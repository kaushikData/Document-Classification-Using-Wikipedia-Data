The '''Alpine-steppe''' is a high altitude natural alpine [[grassland]], which is a part of the [[Montane grasslands and shrublands]] biome.

Alpine-steppes are unique ecosystems found throughout the world, especially in [[Asia]], where they make up 38.9% of the total [[Tibetan plateau]] grassland's area.&lt;ref name="Steph1"&gt;{Lu, X., Yan, Y., Sun, J., Zhang, X., Chen, Y., Wang, X., &amp; Cheng, G. 2015. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage in alpine grassland ecosystems of Tibet: effects of grazing exclusion. Ecology and Evolution, 5(19), 4492–4504.,[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1732/full]}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Alpine grasslands, like the Alpine-steppe, are characterized by their intense [[radiation]], with direct [[solar radiation]] periods averaging 2916 hours annually.&lt;ref name=Steph2&gt;{Wu, J., Yang, P., Zhang, X., Shen Z.,  Yu, C. 2015. Spatial and climatic patterns of the relative abundance of poisonous vs. non-poisonous plants across the Northern Tibetan Plateau. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment 187: 491–510.}&lt;/ref&gt; The average [[temperature]] in this ecosystem is very low. For example, they may experience temperatures around −10&amp;nbsp;°C in winter, and 10&amp;nbsp;°C in summer.&lt;ref name=Steph2/&gt; Winters also tend to be long and cold, and summers are mild and short.&lt;ref name="Steph3"&gt;{Wei, D., Ri, X., Wang, Y., Wang, Y., Liu, Y., &amp; Yao, T. 2012. Responses of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O fluxes to livestock exclosure in an alpine steppe on the Tibetan Plateau, China. Plant Soil, 359(1–2), 45–55. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-011-1105-3]}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[ecosystem]] also experiences year-long frost, with no reported frost-free season.&lt;ref name=Steph2/&gt;

The annual rates of [[precipitation]] in Alpine-steppes are very low, with mean ranges falling anywhere between 280 and 300&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Steph3/&gt; In addition, upwards to 80% of this falls between the months of May and September, causing the climate to be [[arid]] or [[semi-arid]], making the environment much harsher for plant and livestock life.&lt;ref name=Steph2/&gt;

==Vegetation==
[[File:Whitneys locoweed Astragalus whitneyi pods.jpg|left|thumb|Locoweed in Tibet]]
[[Vegetation]] in the alpine steppe is very vulnerable to [[climate change]]. Average air temperature has been increasing by approximately 0.3 degrees Celsius every ten years since the 1960s. This is three times the global average, indicating the sensitivity of this area.&lt;ref name=ANPP&gt;{Zeng, C., Wu, J., Zhang, X. 2015. Effects of Grazing on Above- vs. Below-Ground Biomass Allocation of Alpine Grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. PLoS ONE 10(8): e0135173. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0135173}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been done that show that the spread of vegetation has changed dramatically since the [[Holocene]] period. The Tibetan Plateau is composed of three main regions, based on yearly precipitation levels and types of vegetation, namely the alpine [[meadow]], alpine [[steppe]], and the alpine [[desert-steppe]]. Since the Holocene, studies of fossil pollen records have shown that the alpine meadow has extended into areas that were previously alpine steppe as precipitation increased during that period.&lt;ref name=Holo&gt;{Li, Q., Lu, H., Shen, C., Zhao, Y., Ge. Q. 2016. Vegetation successions in response to Holocene climate changes in the central Tibetan Plateau. Journal of Arid Environments 125: 136–144}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a unimodal pattern across precipitation and vegetation rain use efficiency (RUE), with an increasing trend in Alpine-steppe regions.&lt;ref name=Steph4&gt;{Yang, Y., Fang, J., Fay, P., Bell, J., &amp; Ji, C. 2010. Rain use efficiency across a precipitation gradient on the Tibetan Plateau. Geophys. Res. Lett., 37(15), n/a-n/a.}&lt;/ref&gt; RUE is lower here compared to the alpine meadow because of differences in species richness, soil texture, and [[soil carbon]] content.&lt;ref name=Steph4/&gt;

Changes in vegetation have been used recently as an indicator of grass[[land degradation]] in the Tibetan Plateau, along with land [[desertification]] and decreased overall productivity. Vegetation shifts from non-poisonous to [[poisonous]] plants seem to correlate with increased land degradation. Plants defined as poisonous in the alpine grasslands area include species such as [[locoweed]],&lt;ref name="Steph2" /&gt; which is known to be very invasive.  Not only are poisonous plants an indicator of decline, they result in increased mortality of grazing animals. This invasion of poisonous species is spread across all regions of the Tibetan Plateau, but the alpine steppe is the most affected area.&lt;ref name="Steph2" /&gt;

The Tibetan Plateau is an extremely important area for livestock farming, and historically [[overgrazing]] has been as issue with regard to the [[sustainability]] of the vegetation in the area. Measures have been taken to regulate the use of these grasslands, including the implementation of protected or ‘fenced areas’.&lt;ref name="Steph2" /&gt; While these measures are certainly a step in the right direction as far as sustainability legislation, they have not been shown to have a very strong effect on the above ground net primary productivity (ANPP).&lt;ref name=ANPP/&gt;

==Soil and Biome Composition==
[[File:Topografic map of Tibetan Plateau.png|thumb|Topografic map of Tibetan Plateau|272x272px]]Based on studies done in the alpine steppe region of the Tibetan Plateau, different soil nutrients have differential effects on the nutrient composition and uptake of plants in the area. Soil [[phosphorus]] seems to have a much more significant impact on the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio in plants than soil [[nitrogen]] does. This type of finding can have implications for different nutrient conservation strategies among plant species in the same community, as plants seem to be more sensitive to changes in soil phosphorus than nitrogen, though nitrogen is still extremely important.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;{Hong, J., Wang, X., Wu, J. 2015. Effects of soil fertility on the N:P stoichiometry of herbaceous plants on  nutrient-limited alpine steppe on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Plant and Soil 391: 179–184.}&lt;/ref&gt; What also makes this interesting is the fact that nitrogen is a limiting factor for plant growth, and so is actually critical for the overall health of the plant community. Grazing of herd animals has been shown to have a positive effect on the levels of nitrogen in the soil, though the return of nitrogen in the excrement. The addition of dung to the soils of this region in a laboratory setting resulted in increased availability of [[ammonia]] for plants (their primary nitrogen source). However, in an unaltered system, soil nitrogen tends to be more constant, whereas soil phosphorus is more influenced by climate variation, which may explain why, even though nitrogen is the limiting factor, phosphorus can be a greater influence on the N:P ratio of plant nutrients.&lt;ref name=Sheep&gt;{Cheng, Y., Cai, Y., Wang, S. 2016. Yak and Tibetan sheep dung return enhance soil N supply and retention in two alpine grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Biology and Fertility of Soils DOI 10.1007/s00374-016-1088-6}&lt;/ref&gt;  alpine grassland temperature range from 14 degrees Fahrenheit in winter to 50 degrees Fahrenheit in summer

==Threats to Alpine-Steppes==
[[File:Yak in Tibet-2.jpg|thumb|Yak in Tibet|left|284x284px]]Because of their elevation, alpine regions are thought to experience higher rates of warming, causing them to be more sensitive and vulnerable to global [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=Steph6&gt;{Wu, J., Zhang, X., Shen, Z., Shi, P., Yu, C., &amp; Chen, B. 2014. Effects of livestock exclusion and climate change on aboveground biomass accumulation in alpine pastures across the Northern Tibetan Plateau. Chinese Science Bulletin Chin. Sci. Bull., 59(32), 4332–4340.}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major threats to Alpine-Steppes include [[overgrazing]], as well as land use change associated with increases in population size.&lt;ref name=Steph3/&gt; Because of this, the authorities in areas throughout [[China]] are under pressure to implement programs to protect and preserve this fragile ecosystem.

One such program is the "Retire Livestock and Restore Pastures" initiative,&lt;ref name="Steph3" /&gt; which requires the use of special [[enclosure fencing]]. The purpose of this protective fencing is to prevent the grazing activity of large livestock, like [[sheep]], [[yak]]s, and [[goat]]s, in an attempt to restore the degraded biomass, and maintain ecosystem function.&lt;ref name="Steph1" /&gt;  Often these effects can best be seen by the changes they produce in the [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] properties of the soil.&lt;ref name="Steph1" /&gt; The overall goal is to improve ecosystem [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]] storage, by increasing both vegetation and soil pools of these elements.&lt;ref name="Steph1" /&gt; This effect is crucial because even a small percent change in carbon storage can have a huge positive impact on [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] and global carbon levels, as well as ecosystem sustainability.&lt;ref name="Steph1" /&gt; But carbon is not the only important factor. Low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus have also been found to limit plant growth and net primary productivity.&lt;ref name="Steph1" /&gt; In one study, exclusion fencing was found to increase the carbon stored in the biomass, as well as the nitrogen and phosphorus in the above-ground biomass.&lt;ref name="Steph1" /&gt; However this effect was minor, and not enough to compensate for the considerable loss of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools from the soil surface layer.&lt;ref name="Steph1" /&gt; Another study found exclusion fencing to be a beneficial tool in lowering carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing [[methane]] consumption, which improves both the soil carbon and nitrogen stores.&lt;ref name="Steph3" /&gt; Although findings are controversial, enclosure fencing remains a common practice in China because of the sensitivity of these grassland areas.

== Examples ==
[[File:Artemisia capillaris 1.JPG|thumb|Artemisia capillaris]]
At an elevation of 4,500–6,000 m, [[Northern Tibet]]'s area is covered by approximately 94% grasslands, including the alpine-steppe and alpine meadow.&lt;ref name="Steph5"&gt;{Lu, X., Yan, Y., Fan, J., Cao, Y., &amp; Wang, X. 2011. Dynamics of above- and below-ground biomass and C, N, P accumulation in the alpine steppe of Northern Tibet. Journal of Mountain Science, 8(6), 838–844.}&lt;/ref&gt; The alpine-steppe in this area has less than 20% vegetation coverage, which consists mainly of ''Stipa purpurea'', ''Artemisia capillaris'' Thunb, and ''Rhodiola rotundaia'' assemblages.&lt;ref name="Steph5" /&gt; Compared to the alpine meadow, the alpine-steppe is cooler, arid or semi-arid, with little precipitation and barren soils.&lt;ref name="Steph5" /&gt; The highest vegetation carbon pool can be found in August, and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the area exhibit seasonal variations throughout the growing period.&lt;ref name="Steph5" /&gt;

'''Apple Maps''' (or simply '''Maps''') is a [[web mapping|web mapping service]] developed by [[Apple Inc.]] It is the default map system of [[iOS]], [[macOS]], and [[watchOS]]. It provides directions and estimated times of arrival for automobile, pedestrian, and public transportation navigation. Apple Maps also features ''Flyover'' mode, a feature that enables a user to explore certain densely populated urban centers and other places of interest in a 3D landscape composed of models of buildings and structures.

On September 19, 2012, Apple released its mapping service in [[iOS]], replacing [[Google Maps]] as the default mapping service for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] operating systems. In the initial launch, it received large amounts of criticism from users and newspapers for incorrect directions, a lack of support for [[public transport]]ation users and various other bugs and errors. Since its introduction, further [[software]] development has addressed many of those criticisms.&lt;ref name="Digital Trends"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barbee |first1=Brie |title=Apple Maps vs. Google Maps: Which is better at helping you find your way? |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-maps-vs-google-maps/ |website=Digital Trends |accessdate=2 October 2018 |language=en |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WWDC 2012 Interior.jpg|thumb|Apple Maps was announced along with [[iOS 6]], [[OS X Mountain Lion]], and [[iCloud]] during the 2012 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) on June 11.]]

=== Initial release ===
On June 11, 2012, during the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC), Apple announced the initial release of Apple Maps and revealed that the application would replace [[Google Maps]] as the default web mapping service in [[iOS 6]] and beyond. Apple also announced that the application would include turn-by-turn navigation, 3D maps, [[Apple Maps#Flyovers and 3D maps|Flyovers]], and the virtual assistant [[Siri]]. Furthermore, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] stated that [[iPhone]] users would be able to navigate Apple Maps while in the locked screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/wwdc-apple-kondigt-eigen-kaartendienst-maps-met-volledige-navigatie-aan-wwdc/ |language =Dutch |date =11 June 2012 |access-date =29 November 2015 |publisher =iCulture |title =WWDC 2012: Apple kondigt eigen kaartendienst Maps met volledige navigatie aan |author =Vroegop, B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/wwdc-2012-ios-6-aangekondigd-ipad-1-krijgt-geen-update/ |language =Dutch |date =11 June 2012 |access-date =29 November 2015 |publisher =iCulture |title =WWDC 2012: iOS 6 aangekondigd, iPad 1 krijgt geen update #WWDC |author = Zwaag, G. van der }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapping service was released on September 19, 2012.&lt;ref name="sorry"/&gt; Following the launch, Apple Maps was heavily criticized, which resulted in a public apology by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] in late September and the departure of two key [[employees]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].

Before Apple Maps launched as the default mapping application in iOS, Google Maps held this position since the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first generation iPhone]] release in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2157804/Apple-WWDC-2012-New-app-takes-Google-maps-Facebook-integrated-iPhones-iPads.html |publisher =Daily Mail |access-date =29 November 2015 |title =Apple takes on Google Maps and integrates Facebook into iPhone software - along with a new Macbook |date =11 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2009, tensions between [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] started to grow when the [[Android (operating system)|Android version]] of Google Maps featured turn-by-turn navigation, a feature which the iOS version lacked. At the time, Apple argued that Google collected too much user data.&lt;ref name="lost"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/11/apple-maps-google-iphone-users |author =Arthur, C. |date =11 November 2013 |access-date =30 December 2015 |publisher =The Guardian |title =Apple maps: how Google lost when everyone thought it had won }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Apple made iOS 6 available, Google Maps could only be accessed by [[iOS]] 6 users via the web.&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; Although Google did not immediately launch a mapping application of its own, shortly after the announcement of Apple Maps, [[Google]] did add an equivalent of Apple Maps' Flyover feature to its virtual globe application [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/apps/google-earth-of-apple-kaarten-wie-heeft-de-beste-3d-beelden/ |title =Google Earth of Apple Kaarten: wie heeft de beste 3D-beelden? |language =Dutch |author =Zwaag, G. van der |publisher =iCulture |access-date =29 November 2015 |date =27 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, in December 2012, [[Google Maps]] was released in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. This version of Google Maps, unlike the previous version, featured turn-by-turn navigation. Shortly after it was launched, [[Google Maps]] was the most popular free application in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.cnet.com/news/google-maps-already-no-1-among-free-iphone-apps/ |publisher =CNET |access-date =1 December 2015 |date =13 December 2012 |author =Whitney, L. |title =Google Maps already No. 1 among free iPhone apps }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation around Apple creating a mapping service of its own arose in 2009 after computer magazine ''[[Computerworld]]'' reported that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] had acquired the company Placebase, an online mapping service, in July of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2467794/smartphones/apple-purchased-placebase-in-july-to-replace-google-maps-.html|title=Apple purchased Placebase in July to replace Google Maps?|last=Weintraub|first=Seth|website=Computerworld|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Placebase became a part of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s "Geo Team".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.computerworld.com/article/2467794/smartphones/apple-purchased-placebase-in-july-to-replace-google-maps-.html |publisher =Computerworld |access-date =29 November 2015 |title =Apple purchased Placebase in July to replace Google Maps? |date =1 October 2009 |author =Weintraub, S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/apple-neemt-kaartleverancier-placebase-over-en-richt-geo-team-op/ |language =Dutch |publisher =iCulture |access-date =29 November 2015 |title =Apple neemt kaartleverancier Placebase over en richt Geo Team op |date =1 October 2009 |author =Zwaag, G. van der }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following two years, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] acquired two more mapping related companies who specialized in 3D maps: Poly9 in 2010 and C3 Technologies in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.pcworld.com/article/201118/apple_buys_poly_9.html |author =Bertolucci, J. |publisher =PCWorld |access-date =29 November 2015 |title =Why Apple Bought Poly9: And What Is Poly9? }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://9to5mac.com/2011/10/29/apple-acquired-mind-blowing-3d-mapping-company-c3-technologies-looking-to-take-ios-maps-to-the-next-level/ |title =Apple acquired mind-blowing 3D mapping company C3 Technologies, looking to take iOS Maps to the next level |date =29 October 2011 |publisher =9to5Mac |author =Gurman, M. |access-date =29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; C3 Technologies' imagery was later used for the Flyovers feature in Apple Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://9to5mac.com/2012/07/19/apples-ios-6-3d-maps-are-straight-from-c3-technologies-some-interesting-notes/ |title =Apple's iOS 6 3D Maps are straight from C3 Technologies, some interesting notes |date =19 July 2012 |publisher =9to5Mac |author =Gurman, M. |access-date =29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2011, Apple indicated its plan for a mapping service when it stated on its website that it was collecting location data to create "an improved traffic service in the next couple of years" for iPhone users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27Apple-Q-A-on-Location-Data.html |date =27 April 2011 |publisher =Apple Press Info |title =Apple Q&amp;A on Location Data |access-date =29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, when Apple Maps was released, a source connected to both Google and Apple Maps claimed to technology website ''[[TechCrunch]]'' that Apple was recruiting [[Google]] employees that worked on Google Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/source-apple-aggressively-recruiting-ex-google-maps-staff-to-build-out-ios-maps/ |title =Source: Apple Aggressively Recruiting Ex-Google Maps Staff To Build Out iOS Maps |author =Etherington, D. |date =23 September 2012 |access-date =29 November 2015 |publisher =TechCrunch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012–2015 ===
In the first year after its release, Apple Maps received a number of improvements which solved various errors in the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/apple-verbetert-eigen-maps-meer-3d-gebouwen-minder-fouten/ |language =Dutch |title =Apple verbetert eigen Maps: meer 3D-gebouwen, minder fouten |date =6 October 2012 |author =Zwaag, G. van der |publisher =iCulture |access-date =1 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes included adding more satellite imagery and making the navigation available in more cities. In 2013, Apple also acquired a few companies to improve Apple Maps, namely [[HopStop]], Embark, WifiSlam, and Locationary, as well as the team and the technology of the company BroadMap. [[HopStop]] and Embark both specialized in mapping public transportation, WifiSlam specialized in interior maps, Locationary provided accurate company data for mapping services, and BroadMap managed, sorted, and analyzed map data.&lt;ref name="one year on"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/apple-maps-one-year-on-1182395/1 |publisher =TechRadar |date =21 September 2013 |author =Marshall, G. |title =Apple Maps: one year on |access-date =22 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://9to5mac.com/2013/12/23/apple-likely-acquired-mapping-firm-broadmap-location-infused-evernote-competitor-catch/ |title =Apple acquired mapping firm BroadMap's talent, location-infused Evernote competitor Catch |author =Gurman, M. |date =23 December 2013 |access-date =29 November 2015 |publisher =9to5Mac }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://allthingsd.com/20131223/apple-did-indeed-acquire-broadmap-and-catch-earlier-this-year/ |title =Apple Did Indeed Acquire BroadMap and Catch Earlier This Year |author =Fried, I. |date =23 December 2013 |access-date =29 November 2015 |publisher =All Things Digital }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During WWDC in June 2013, Apple announced the new version of Apple Maps in [[iOS 7]]. This new version had a new look and icon.&lt;ref name="Dossier"/&gt; A number of new functions were also implemented, including full-screen mode, night mode, real-time traffic information, navigation for pedestrians, and the Frequent Locations feature. The latter feature, which can be switched on and off, was introduced to record the most frequently visited destinations by users in order to improve Apple Maps. In addition, new satellite imagery was added once again.&lt;ref name="one year on"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dossier"/&gt; On September 18, 2013, Apple released iOS 7.&lt;ref name="iOS 7"/&gt; At that time, the new [[iPhone 5S]] included a new [[Apple motion coprocessors|motion coprocessor]], the M7, which can identify whether a user is walking or driving in order to adjust the navigation mode.&lt;ref name="one year on"/&gt;

During that same conference, Apple announced that a desktop version of the application would be made available for [[OS X Mavericks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4414348/apple-maps-coming-os-x-mavericks |date =10 June 2013 |publisher =The Verge |access-date =24 October 2015 |title =Apple Maps coming to OS X Mavericks }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 2013, Apple released OS X Mavericks and the desktop version of Apple Maps. The desktop version was similar to that in iOS 7, but it connected with the [[Contacts (Mac OS)|Contacts]] and [[Calendar (Apple)|Calendar]] applications. Additionally, the desktop version enabled users to send locations and directions to other devices with iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.cnet.com/news/walk-with-us-through-os-x-mavericks-new-maps-app/ |title =Walk with us through OS X Mavericks' new Maps app |date =22 October 2013 |author =Goodwin, A. |publisher =CNET |access-date =24 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June of the following year, Apple acquired the company [[Spotsetter]], a social search engine that gave personalized recommendations for places to visit. Since the acquisition, most of its employees now work at Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/06/spotsetter-a-social-search-engine-for-places-acquired-by-apple/ |publisher =TechCrunch |access-date =6 December 2015 |author =Perez, S. |date =6 June 2014 |title =Apple Acquires Spotsetter, A Social Search Engine For Places }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2014, the successor of iOS 7, [[iOS 8]], became available. Later that year, on October, 16, Apple released [[OS X Yosemite]].&lt;ref name="iOS 8"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/09/09Apple-Announces-iOS-8-Available-September-17.html |publisher =Apple Press Info |access-date =30 December 2015 |date =9 September 2014 |title =Apple Announces iOS 8 Available September 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither update brought any major modifications to Apple Maps. However, the feature "City Tours" was introduced to both iOS and OS X. This function made it possible for the user to be guided through locations with Flyovers.&lt;ref name="City Tours"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/07/flyover-city-tours/ |publisher =MacRumors |access-date =6 December 2015 |date =7 September 2014 |author =Slivka, E. |title =Apple Filling Out Flyover City Tours Ahead of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite Launches }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Apple Maps results were shown in the search feature [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]] in OS X Yosemite.&lt;ref name="Yosemite"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/10/16OS-X-Yosemite-Available-Today-as-a-Free-Upgrade.html |date =16 October 2014 |publisher =Apple Press Info |access-date =24 October 2015 |title =OS X Yosemite Available Today as a Free Upgrade }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2014, Apple news website ''[[Apple community#9to5Mac|9to5Mac]]'' reported that in the previous months a number of Apple Maps employees, including a key employee, had left the company to work for [[Uber (company)|Uber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/25/top-apple-maps-app-manager-for-watch-ios-os-x-exits-for-uber/ |date =25 November 2014 |author =Gurman, M. |access-date =7 December 2015 |publisher =9to5Mac |title =Top Apple Maps app manager for Watch, iOS &amp; OS X exits for Uber }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next year, Apple Maps was added to the operating system of the new [[Apple Watch]], which was released on April 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/03/09Apple-Watch-Available-in-Nine-Countries-on-April-24.html |title =Apple Watch Available in Nine Countries on April 24 |access-date =29 November 2015 |publisher =Apple Press Info |date =9 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The smartwatch version of Apple Maps features turn-by-turn navigation. The app indicates navigation instructions by taps on the user's wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.macworld.com/article/2915572/apple-watch-how-to-use-maps.html |title =How to use Maps to navigate from your Apple Watch |author =Allsopp, A. |date =28 April 2015 |access-date =30 December 2015 |publisher =Macworld }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015–2018 ===
During WWDC on June 8, 2015, [[Craig Federighi]], Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering, announced that the new version of Apple Maps in [[iOS 9]] would have information about public transportation in a number of global cities.&lt;ref name="transit"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.techradar.com/news/software/apple-maps-finally-adds-public-transit-info-1295842 |title =Apple Maps finally adds public transit info |publisher =TechRadar |author =Pino, N. |access-date =22 October 2015 |date =8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The function also became available for [[OS X El Capitan]] and [[watchOS|watchOS 2]].&lt;ref name="El Capitan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WatchOS"/&gt; In addition, Apple added the function "Nearby", which shows nearby points of interest in several categories. With the update, the application chooses a detour in case of a traffic delay. The three new versions of the operating systems became available in September 2015. In addition to these new releases, Apple acquired a few companies in 2015 in order to improve the mapping application even further. In the spring, Apple also acquired Coherent Navigation, that provides precise location data through High Integrity GPS, and the startup company Mapsense later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.engadget.com/2015/05/17/apple-reportedly-buys-coherent-navigation/??ncid=rss_full |date =17 May 2015 |author =Fingas, J. |publisher =Engadget |access-date =25 December 2015 |title =Apple bought a company focused on super-accurate GPS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/apple-overname-coherent-navigatiebedrijf/ |title =‘Apple nam navigatiebedrijf Coherent over’ |language =Dutch |date =17 May 2015 |author =Zwaag, G. van der |publisher =iCulture |access-date =29 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter had developed software to organize large amounts of location data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-acquires-mapping-visualisation-startup-mapsense/ |publisher =ZDNet |access-date =25 December 2015 |title =Apple acquires mapping visualisation startup Mapsense |date =17 September 2015 |author =Tung, L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Apple Maps opened a new development center and it was updated for watchOS and iOS. The application was improved when watchOS 2.2 came out in March 2016. Apple Maps was renewed in the new version of the operating system and received a number of new features, including "Nearby" which had previously been exclusive to iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/watchos-2-2-apple-watch-verschenen/|title=Apple brengt watchOS 2.2 voor Apple Watch met verbeterde Kaarten-app uit|last=|first=|date=21 March 2016|website=|publisher=iCulture|language=Dutch|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, Apple CEO Tim Cook inaugurated a new office in partnership with IT company RMSI, Noida, at the WaveRock campus in the Indian city [[Hyderabad]]. The development center focusses on the development of Apple Maps and employs 4,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.rmsi.com/uploads/press/02_apple.pdf |publisher =The Economic Times |format =PDF |title =Apple opens development office in Hyderabad |date =19 May 2016 |access-date =15 October 2016 |author =Kulshrestha, Ashish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/05/19Apple-Opens-Development-Office-in-Hyderabad.html|title=Apple Opens Development Office in Hyderabad|last=|first=|date=19 May 2016|website=|publisher=Apple Press Info|access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[ZDNet]]'', the {{Convert|250,000|sqft|sqm|abbr=off}} office cost US$25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-to-open-first-offshore-technology-development-centre-in-india/|title=Apple to open first offshore technology development centre in India|last=Srinivasan|first=V. L.|date=11 February 2016|website=|publisher=ZDNet|access-date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, [[iOS 10]] was released. The update of the Apple's mobile operating system was accompanied by a new design of Apple Maps. Moreover, the application was opened up to developers and gained a few features: it makes suggestions for places to go based on earlier usage of the app, it can remember the location where the user parked their vehicle, it allows a user to filter search suggestions, and the turn-by-turn navigation was improved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/apple-maps-nieuw-design-vernieuwingen/|title=Apple Maps krijgt nieuw design: alle vernieuwingen op een rij|last=Meijer|first=Eveline|date=13 June 2016|website=|publisher=iCulture|language=Dutch|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/kleine-ios-10-verbeteringen/|title=Twintig kleine iOS 10-verbeteringen die je zeker even moet proberen|last=Zwaag|first=Gonny van der|date=15 September 2016|website=|publisher=iCulture|language=Dutch|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The navigation automatically zooms in and out, shows traffic ahead, and allows users to search for points of interests along the route. These features are available for [[CarPlay]] as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 2018–Present ===
In early 2018, Apple announced Maps can help users find bike-sharing stations in over 175 cities across 36 countries, for example: San Francisco (GoBike), New York (Citi Bike), Montreal (BIXI), London (Santander), Paris (Velib) and Brisbane (CityCycle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dillet |first1=Romain |title=Apple Maps shows you the nearest bike-sharing stations – TechCrunch |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/12/apple-maps-shows-you-the-nearest-bike-sharing-stations/ |website=techcrunch.com |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Estrada |first1=Zac |title=Apple Maps gets upgraded bike-sharing information |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17110362/apple-maps-bike-share-data |website=The Verge |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2018, Maps leader Eddy Cue announced an ambitious roll-out of Apple Maps, rebuilt "from the ground up" using map data Apple has been quietly gathering for the past four years. New maps for the San Francisco Bay Area are promised for early July in the next iOS 12 beta, expanding to Northern California in further beta's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Panzarino |first1=Matthew |title=Apple is rebuilding Maps from the ground up – TechCrunch |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/apple-is-rebuilding-maps-from-the-ground-up/ |website=techcrunch.com |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Panzarino |first1=Matthew |title=Questions about Apple’s new Maps, answered – TechCrunch |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/questions-about-apples-new-maps-answered/ |website=techcrunch.com |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Updates will not, however, require iOS 12, and they will also appear on Apple Watch and Macs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tibken |first1=Shara |title=Apple hopes its Maps do-over gets you where you need to go |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-hopes-its-maps-do-over-gets-you-where-you-need-to-go-vs-google-maps/ |website=CNET |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=en |date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Updated maps with new data are currently available in all of Northern California from iOS 12 beta 2 and up.

In November 2018, Apple revealed on its website that it will be sending its backpack-wearing team to different locations, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Santa Clara County in an attempt to improve Apple Maps’ walking directions along footpaths and walkways. The company will also deploy its mapping cars throughout the US and the UK to gather its own data and add details to the maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.apple.com/vehicles/|title=Apple Maps vehicles|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-confirms-its-using-pedestrians-to-improve-its-maps-app/|title=Apple confirms it’s collecting data on foot to improve its Maps app|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, vehicles equipped with twelve cameras and [[lidar]] sensors were seen in a variety of places throughout the United States. These vehicles were owned by Apple. In June 2015, Apple stated on its website that the vehicles were collecting data to improve Apple Maps. Also, Apple claimed to secure privacy by making faces and license plates unrecognizable. In 2018 Apple confirmed in an article that it was rebuilding Apple Maps, with the first results rolled out in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/apple-is-rebuilding-maps-from-the-ground-up/ |title =Apple is rebuilding Maps from the ground up |publisher =TechCrunch |access-date =November 23, 2018 | date =June 29, 2018 |author =Panzarino, Matthew }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the company, Apple's vehicles have driven through the following countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://maps.apple.com/vehicles/ |access-date =2 November 2015 |title =Apple: Apple Maps vehicles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple Maps uses [[vector graphics]], which allows the application to use less data than competitor Google Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/apple-maps-efficienter-met-data-dan-google-maps/ |language =Dutch |author =Vroegop, B. |publisher =iCulture |access-date =1 December 2015 |date =2 October 2012 |title =Apple Maps efficiënter met data dan Google Maps }}&lt;/ref&gt; The map has four available layers: regular map, satellite view, hybrid view (a combination of regular and satellite view), and public transit view.&lt;ref name="Dossier"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/dossiers/apple-maps/ |language =Dutch |title =Dossier: Apple Maps |access-date =30 December 2015 |publisher =iCulture }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main provider of map data is [[TomTom]], but data is also supplied by [[Automotive Navigation Data]], [[Hexagon AB]], [[Intermap Technologies]], [[OpenStreetMap]], and [[Waze]].&lt;ref name="Acknowledgements" /&gt; Apple renewed their agreement with TomTom in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://corporate.tomtom.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=913777 |publisher =TomTom |access-date =29 December 2015 |date =19 May 2015 |title =TomTom extends Apple agreement }}&lt;/ref&gt; TomTom is the parent company of [[Tele Atlas]], which is also used by Apple Maps' competitor, Google Maps.&lt;ref name="one year on" /&gt; The satellite imagery comes from [[DigitalGlobe]].&lt;ref name="Acknowledgements"/&gt; iPhones located in China use data from [[AutoNavi]] instead.

Apple Maps can be used to plan routes. The navigation service features turn-by-turn navigation with spoken instructions for vehicles, pedestrians, and public transportation.&lt;ref name="Maps"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/ |title =Apple: Maps |access-date =30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], the navigation function is available in 56 countries worldwide.&lt;ref name="availability"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/|title=Apple: iOS Feature Availability|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple Maps can also be used to see real-time traffic information. In addition, Apple's virtual assistant, [[Siri]], is integrated into Apple Maps. The map displays points of interest provided by approximately twenty companies, including [[Booking.com]], [[Foursquare]], [[TripAdvisor]], and [[Yelp]]. The data from Foursquare was added in late 2015.&lt;ref name="Acknowledgements"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://gspe21.ls.apple.com/html/attribution-8.html |title =Apple: Acknowledgements |access-date =29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://9to5mac.com/2015/11/16/apple-maps-foursquare-business-listings/ |publisher =9to5Mac |access-date =25 December 2015 |date =16 November 2015 |author =Kahn, J. |title =Apple adds Foursquare business listings to Apple Maps }}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can drop pins on the map to save places for later retrieval. The satellite view features Flyovers, three-dimensional satellite views, in designated locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/ios-6-uitgelicht-apple-maps-kaartendienst-met-grote-nederlandse-invloed/ |date =12 June 2012 |language =Dutch |access-date =29 November 2015 |author =Zwaag, G. van der |title =iOS 6 uitgelicht: Apple Maps-kaartendienst met grote Nederlandse invloed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flyover and 3D maps ===
With Flyover, certain locations — mainly the big cities and landmarks — can be seen from a bird's-eye perspective.&lt;ref name="Dossier"/&gt; The three-dimensional views are photo-realistic and users can change the perspective.&lt;ref name="Maps"/&gt; Flyover has been available since the first release of Apple Maps. A number of cities with Flyovers also have "City Tours". With this feature, the user is guided in the Flyover view along landmarks in that location. "City Tours" was added to Apple Maps in iOS 8 (released on September 17, 2014) and in OS X Yosemite (released on October 16, 2014).&lt;ref name="iOS 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="City Tours"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yosemite"/&gt; In addition to Flyovers, around fifty cities also feature 3D maps. This feature enables the user to see three-dimensional models of structures in the map view. These models, which are not photo-realistic, can also be seen when using the turn-by-turn navigation.&lt;ref name="Dossier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maps"/&gt;

Flyovers are available at the following locations:&lt;ref name="availability"/&gt;

=== Nearby ===
The feature "Nearby" is exclusive to iOS 9 and watchOS 2.2. It shows icons of different categories like "food" and "transportation" in the search menu.&lt;ref name="2.2"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/16/watchos-2-2-nearby-maps-apple-watch/ |date =16 January 2016 |publisher =9to5Mac |access-date =23 January 2015 |author =Hall, Z. |title =watchOS 2.2 adds Nearby search to Maps for Apple Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt; After clicking each icon, nearby points of interest in that category are shown with their names, distances, and reviews on Yelp. Additionally, pins appear at the locations of these places on the map. The turn-by-turn navigation can be activated with Nearby as well.&lt;ref name="nearby"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/iosapps/how-use-proactive-siri-in-ios-9-virtual-assistant-3616319/ |publisher =Macworld |date =15 September 2015 |access-date =1 November 2015 |author =Painter, L. |title =How to use Proactive in iOS 9: How Siri is becoming more proactive and smart in iOS 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/16/ios-9-apple-maps-transit-nearby/ |author =Rossignol, J. |publisher =MacRumors |access-date =1 November 2015 |date =16 September 2015 |title =Inside iOS 9: Apple Maps Gains Transit Mode and Nearby Search }}&lt;/ref&gt; When iOS 9 was launched on September 16, 2015, the function was only available in the United States and China, but had expanded to include Australia, Canada, Germany, and France by the end of October 2015.&lt;ref name="free update"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/26/apple-activates-nearby-maps-search-results-in-4-countries-adds-flyover-locations |publisher =AppleInsider |title =Apple activates 'Nearby' Maps search results in 4 countries, expands Flyover support |date =26 October 2015 |access-date =1 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Nearby was added to Austria, Denmark, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="availability"/&gt;

=== Transit ===

=== Traffic information ===
Apple Maps shows real-time traffic information on the map. In addition, the turn-by-turn navigation takes delays into account when calculating the estimated time of arrival and will occasionally choose a detour in case of traffic.&lt;ref name="Maps"/&gt; Apple introduced this function in iOS 7 (released on September 18, 2013) and it is available in 49 countries as of June 2017.&lt;ref name="Dossier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iOS 7"&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/ios-7-available-download-now-how-download-ios-7-update-your-iphone-ipad-3440312/ |author =Haslam, K. |date =18 September 2013 |access-date =30 December 2015 |publisher =Macworld |title =iOS 7 available to download now.

=== Apple Maps Connect ===
In October 2014, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced a service dubbed Apple Maps Connect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/apple-launches-maps-connect-self-service-local-listings-portal-206349|title=Apple Launches "Maps Connect" Self-Service Local Listings Portal|date=2014-10-21|website=Search Engine Land|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows small business owners to claim their business listing and edit business information, such as location and open hours. After the user logs in with their [[Apple ID]], they are given a prompt to claim and link an Apple Maps listing to their account. The user can search through Apple's [[database]] to either locate their listing or add a missing listing to Apple's database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mapsconnect.apple.com|title=Maps Connect|website=mapsconnect.apple.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market share ==
[[File:Market share Apple Maps and Google Maps.png|{{largethumb}}|A graph showing the percentage of American smartphone users who used Apple Maps (blue) and Google Maps (orange) between July 2013 and February 2016 (Data: [[comScore]]).]]

[[ComScore]] investigated the market shares of different web mapping services in the United States using polls. Prior to the launch of Apple Maps in September 2012, there were 103.6 million [[Americans]] with [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]], 81 million of which used Google Maps. According to comScore, the latter figure had dropped to 58.7 million in September 2013, a year after the release of Apple Maps. At the same time, there were 35 million American Apple Maps users and a total of 136.7 million people with iOS or Android in the United States. Out of the 60.1 million iPhone users, 8.3 million used [[Google Maps]]. However, some of those [[iPhone]] users were not able to use Apple Maps, since their devices were not updated to iOS 6.&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt; In addition, research by [[comScore]] conducted between July 2013 and February 2016 revealed that between 20% and 30% of all American smartphone users used Apple Maps — this includes users with operating systems for which Apple Maps was not compatible. During the same period, it was concluded that between 40% and 51% of American smartphone owners used the application Google Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/ |title =comScore: Market Rankings |access-date =3 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, comScore studied the market share of Apple Maps on iPhones in the United Kingdom. In September 2013, one year after its launch, more than 6.2 million of the total 10.35 million British iPhone owners used Apple Maps. Google Maps had the second largest market share on British iPhones with over 1.8 million British iPhone users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/26/apple-maps-europe-google |author =Arthur, C. |date =26 November 2013 |title =How Apple Maps won on UK iPhones over Google Maps - despite Waze |publisher =The Guardian |access-date =3 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of 2013, British Internet service provider [[EE Limited]] concluded that Apple Maps had a market share in the UK of 64% of 4G network users and 57% of 3G network users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://ee.co.uk/content/dam/everything-everywhere/documents/EE_Mobile_Living_Index_Q4_2013_0.pdf |title =4GEE MOBILE LIVING INDEX: Second half 2013 report |date =December 2013 |access-date =22 October 2015 |format =PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research involved comparing the data of the internet provider and the results of an investigation by [[Taylor Nelson Sofres]] among 1,000 users of the 4G network. However, EE Limited did not indicate how many of its users had an iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/apple-maps-surging-back-in-fight-against-google-1261188 |title =Apple Maps surging back in fight against Google |author =Rogerson, J. |publisher =TechRadar |date =12 August 2014 |access-date =22 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to subsequent research by EE Limited, in the first half of 2014, the market share of Apple Maps increased among iPhone users: 70% of the 4G network and 76% of the 3G network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://ee.co.uk/content/dam/everything-everywhere/Newsroom/PDFs%20for%20newsroom/EE%20Mobile%20Living%20Index%20H1%202014.pdf |title =4GEE MOBILE LIVING INDEX: First half report 2014 |access-date =22 October 2015 |format =PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the year, the same values amounted to 73% and 82% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://ee.co.uk/content/dam/everything-everywhere/Newsroom/PDFs%20for%20newsroom/EEMLI%20H1%202015%20FINAL.pdf |title =4GEE MOBILE LIVING INDEX: First half report 2015 |access-date =22 October 2015 |format =PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early inaccuracy ==
Apple Maps received considerable criticism after its launch on September 19, 2012, due to wrong and inaccurate information about places and points of interests. Many of these errors are now fixed.&lt;ref name="sorry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="one year on"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.iculture.nl/apps/google-belooft-geweldige-google-maps-ervaring-op-ios/ |language =Dutch |title =Google belooft ‘geweldige Google Maps-ervaring’ op iOS |date =23 June 2011 |author =Zwaag, G. van der |publisher =iCulture |access-date =29 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some places were misspelled, were displayed with the wrong name, or were missing entirely.&lt;ref name="sorry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; Examples of those mistakes included the Ukrainian capital [[Kiev]], which was incorrectly spelled as "Kylv", the Welsh place [[Pontypridd]], whose label was shown {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} northeast of its actual location, and the English town [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], which was missing altogether in Apple Maps. Also, when users looked up "London" they were directed to the Canadian city [[London, Ontario|London]] instead of its namesake, the capital of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="problems"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/20/apple-maps-ios6-station-tower |publisher =The Guardian |access-date =23 October 2015 |date =20 September 2012 |author =Garside, J. |title =Apple Maps service loses train stations, shrinks tower and creates new airport }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many complained about outdated or inaccurate data about companies and interesting places. For example, in the United Kingdom, chains that no longer exist were still on the maps and large stores were accidentally mapped in backyards.&lt;ref name="one year on"/&gt; Furthermore, in the United States, the label of the [[Willis Tower]] was displayed in the wrong location.&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; Apple Maps was sometimes inadequate to find companies or other points of interest at all.&lt;ref name="one year on"/&gt; For instance, the London train and underground station [[London Paddington station|Paddington]] and [[Tokyo Station]] were missing, and the [[Helsinki Central railway station]] was shown as a park.&lt;ref name="lost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; Also, parks were occasionally displayed as airports.&lt;ref name="sorry"/&gt;

On several occasions, government authorities and politicians warned citizens of errors with Apple Maps. In early December 2012, the police department of the Australian city [[Mildura]] alerted people who planned to reach the city using Apple Maps, because Mildura was shown in the middle of [[Murray-Sunset National Park]], {{convert|40|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} from its actual location. The police department stated that the error was potentially life-threatening, as national park temperatures could rise to {{convert|114|F|C|0|abbr=on}} and those traveling would be without water supplies. The police rescued, at least, four people, one of whom was stranded for 24 hours. After that, the police department tried to contact Apple to solve the problem. Apple fixed the error in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/10/tech/apple-maps-australia-flaw/ |author =Thompson, N. |date =11 December 2012 |title =Apple Maps flaw could be deadly, warn Australian police |access-date =23 October 2015 |publisher =CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.cnet.com/news/australia-police-discourage-use-of-apple-maps-app-after-rescues/ |publisher =CNET |date =9 December 2012 |title =Australia police discourage use of Apple maps app after rescues |author =Musil, S. |access-date =23 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/apple-maps-life-threatening-australian-police |date =10 December 2012 |publisher =The Guardian |author =Arthur, C. |title =Apple redraws maps after Australian drivers led astray in the bush |access-date =24 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Shatter]], the [[Minister for Justice and Equality]] and [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Minister of Defense]] of [[Ireland]] at the time, issued a warning because of a mistake in Apple Maps: a non-existent airport was shown near the Irish capital [[Dublin]]. This location was in reality a public farm called "Airfield". Shatter wrote in his statement that the mistake was dangerous, because a pilot could try to make an emergency landing there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.thejournal.ie/alan-shatter-apple-maps-airport-dundrum-602115-Sep2012/ |publisher =The Journal |access-date =23 October 2015 |title =‘Alan Shatter concerned over fake Apple airport’ Statement of the Day |date =20 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apple's response ===
As a result of the criticism, [[Tim Cook]], CEO of Apple Inc., published a letter of apology on Apple's website on September 28, 2012, in which he apologized for the "frustrations" experienced by users. He said that Apple fell short and that the company was making every effort to improve the mapping service. Cook also suggested that dissatisfied users could use rival mapping applications like [[Bing Maps]], [[MapQuest]], [[Waze]], [[Google Maps]], and [[Here (company)|Nokia Maps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/ |date=28 September 2012 |title=Apple: A letter from Tim Cook on Maps |author=Cook, T. |access-date=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928170739/http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps/ |archivedate=September 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Jobs]], former CEO of Apple Inc., had used this way of apologizing in the past.&lt;ref name="sorry"/&gt; A week before the release of the letter of apology, just after the launch of Apple Maps, spokesperson Trudy Miller had stated to technology news website ''[[All Things Digital]]'' that Apple Maps was a major initiative and that they "were just getting started with it." Miller also said the application would improve as more people used it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-statement-maps-2012-9?IR=T |title =Apple Responds To The Maps Backlash: 'We Are Just Getting Started With It' |author =Yarow, J. |date =20 September 2012 |access-date =23 October 2015 |publisher =Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://allthingsd.com/20120920/apple-maps-app-takes-reality-distortion-to-a-whole-new-level/?mod=atdtweet |title =Apple Maps App Takes Reality Distortion to a Whole New Level |author =Paczkowski, J. |date =20 September 2012 |access-date =29 November 2015 |publisher =All Things Digital }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the criticism, two key employees left the company due to the problems associated with Apple Maps. The departure of [[Scott Forstall]], senior vice president of iOS, was announced in October 2012.&lt;ref name="Cue"/&gt; Sources told technology news website ''[[The Verge]]'' that he had been fired for refusing to sign Tim Cook's letter of apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3574022/apple-scott-forstall-ios-6-maps-apology-letter |publisher =The Verge |access-date =24 October 2015 |title =Apple's Scott Forstall's fatal mistake was not signing iOS 6 Maps apology letter: sources |author =Ziegler, C. |date =29 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to business magazine ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]],'' Richard Williamson, the person responsible for the mapping team at Apple, left the following month. He was succeeded by [[Eddy Cue]].&lt;ref name="Cue"&gt;{{Cite web |url =https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-11-27/apple-said-to-fire-maps-manager-after-flaws-hurt-iphone-5-debut |publisher =Bloomberg Businessweek |access-date =24 October 2015 |date =28 November 2012 |author =Satariano, A. |title =Apple's Cue Seeks Overhaul of Maps Amid Duel With Google }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Eddy Cue said in an interview with [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']] that Apple "had completely underestimated the product, the complexity of it." He also said the problems with Apple Maps led to "significant changes to all of our development processes." After the launch of Maps, Apple started offering public betas of new versions of iOS and OS X. Furthermore, Cue commented that before Maps was launched Apple's executive team long discussed if Apple should have its own mapping service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3062090/tim-cooks-apple/playing-the-long-game-inside-tim-cooks-apple|title=Playing The Long Game Inside Tim Cook's Apple|last=Tetzeli|first=Rick|date=8 August 2016|website=|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, Tim Cook looked back to the launch of Apple Maps in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and said "Maps was a mistake." He added that the company admitted its mistake and that Maps is something the company is now proud of because of the improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/classic-apps/stepping-out-of-steve-jobss-shadow-tim-cook-champions-the-promise-of-apple/2016/08/12/fadb6c26-59cd-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html|title=Tim Cook, the interview: Running Apple ‘is sort of a lonely job’|last=McGregor|first=Jena|date=12 August 2016|website=|publisher=The Washington Post|access-date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TomTom's response ===
As the primary provider of map data, TomTom has received criticism as well. Cees van Dok, TomTom's head of [[user experience design]], in April 2013 told technology news website ''[[TechRadar]]'' that Apple was the problem. According to him, Apple was trying to combine too many sources of data to create Apple Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.techradar.com/news/car-tech/satnav/tomtom-still-defensive-over-apple-maps-says-smartphones-not-a-threat-1146027 |publisher =TechRadar |date =22 April 2013 |author =Langley, H. |title =TomTom still defensive over Apple Maps, says smartphones not a threat |access-date =22 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern reception ==
Despite fixing preliminary issues, Apple Maps has received mixed reviews, with some critics complimenting its "Flyover" feature and appearance of the street map,&lt;ref name="ZDNET"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braue|first1=David|title=Apple Maps' worldview is now better than Google Maps'|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-maps-worldview-is-now-better-than-google-maps/|website=ZDNet|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are criticizing its lack of features similar to those in [[Google Maps]]. ''[[ZDNet]]'' said "[Apple Maps] had its share of problems, but Apple Maps is back with a vengeance. Powered by some jaw-dropping 3D graphics and enjoying an aggressive multi-platform strategy, Apple is finally set to redefine our geospatial expectations – and take Google down a few notches."&lt;ref name="ZDNET" /&gt; An editor of ''[[TheStreet.com|The Street]]'' wrote "But, today, and presumably after the iOS 7 update, Apple Maps has come into its own. Despite the lingering absence of transit directions (at last check, Apple still suggests Google Maps and other "routing" apps), I now prefer to Apple over Google."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/12047750/1/google-maps-no-longer-embarrasses-apple-maps.html|title=Google Maps No Longer Embarrass Apple Maps|author=Rocco Pendola|work=TheStreet}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Macworld]]'' wrote "Apple Maps has vastly improved since it was first launched and now we conclude the turn-by-turn navigation is a lot better than Google's offering. While there are areas that both Google and Apple can improve on, we’re certain that using Apple Maps won’t direct you to drive into the Thames and that most of the initial issues have been fixed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/reference-education/apple-maps-vs-google-maps-comparison-review-googles-maps-still-better-apple-maps-3464377/|title=Apple Maps vs Google Maps comparison review: is Google still on top? - Review - Macworld UK|author=Lewis Painter|work=Macworld UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Thrillist]]'' wrote an article about "Things Apple Maps Does Better Than Google Maps," praising its ability to let the user "send directions instantly from your computer to your phone," "see turn-by-turn directions from the lock screen," "get more specific recommendations for nearby attractions," "know which subway car to get on and which exit to use," "see true-to-life details," and "get seamless directions from Siri."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/tech/nation/things-apple-maps-does-better-than-google-maps|title=Things Apple Maps Does Better Than Google Maps|author=Joe McGauley|date=31 January 2016|work=thrillist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taiwan]] (Republic of China) was classified as a province of the [[People's Republic of China]] in the application in 2013; searches for "Taiwan" were changed automatically to "China Taiwan province" in Simplified Chinese, prompting the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to demand a correction from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/taiwan/10413744/Taiwan-demands-Apple-change-map-that-shows-it-as-part-of-China.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bagnold formula''', named after [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]], relates the amount of [[sand]] moved by the wind to [[wind speed]] by [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]]. It states that the mass transport of sand is proportional to the third power of the [[log wind profile|friction velocity]]. Under steady conditions, this implies that mass transport is proportional to the third power of the excess of the wind speed (at any fixed height over the sand surface) over the minimum wind speed that is able to activate and sustain a continuous flow of sand grains. 

The formula was derived by Bagnold &lt;ref&gt;Bagnold, R.A. 1936. The movement of desert sand. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A 157(892):594-620.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1936 and later published in his book ''[[The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes]]'' in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnold, R.A. 1941. The physics of blown sand and desert dunes. London: Methuen, 265 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wind tunnel]] and field experiments suggest that the formula is basically correct.  It has later been modified by several researchers, but is still considered to be the benchmark formula.&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, R. and Iversen, J.D. 1985. Wind as a Geological Process, pp. 99 - 100, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen, M. 2004. On the rate of aeolian sand transport. Geomorphology 59:53-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its simplest form, Bagnold's formula may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;q = C \ \frac{\rho}{g}\ \sqrt{\frac{d}{D}} u_*^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;big&gt;''q''&lt;/big&gt; represents the mass ''transport'' of sand across a lane of unit width; ''C'' is a dimensionless constant of order unity that depends on the sand sorting; ''&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'' is the [[density of air]]; ''g'' is the local gravitational acceleration; ''d'' is the reference grain size for the sand; ''D'' is the nearly uniform grain size originally used in Bagnold's experiments (250 micrometres); and, finally, &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is [[log wind profile|friction velocity]] proportional to the square root of the shear stress between the wind and the sheet of moving sand.

The formula is valid in dry (desert) conditions. The effects of sand moisture at play in most coastal dunes, therefore, are not included.

'''Blasieholmen''' is a peninsula in central [[Stockholm]], Sweden. It is located east of [[Kungsträdgården]]. Originally a small island, named Käpplingen, it became a peninsula, connected to [[Norrmalm]], during the 17th century. Among the buildings at Blasieholmen are the [[Nationalmuseum]], hotels and office buildings.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Blasieholmen |first=Lars |last=Mæhlum |authorlink= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Blasieholmen |language=Norwegian |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Skeppsholmsbron]] bridge connects Blasieholmen to the island of [[Skeppsholmen]].

'''Hazen Camp''' is a shelter maintained and operated by [[Parks Canada]]. It contains many all-weather shelters for the park staff. The visiting researchers set up tents in the camp area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ernst|first1=Crystal|title=Final report for field season 2010|url=https://northernbiodiversity.wordpress.com/tag/lake-hazen/|website=Northern Biodiversity Program|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its coordinates are 81°49'15.22'N 71°21'14.11'W &lt;ref&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hazen Camp was originally established in 1957-1958 for [[Operation Hazen]]. It was one of the most comprehensive science research projects ever in the Canadian High Arctic.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Panchen|first1=Zoe|title=Introducing Lake Hazen|url=http://arcticplantphenology.blogspot.ca/2013/08/introducing-lake-hazen.html|website=Plant Phenology|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Hazen Camp is used as an Warden Station and an access point to [[Quttinirpaaq National Park]].&lt;ref name=Quttinirpaaq&gt;{{cite web|title=Quttinirpaaq National Park of Canada  Cultural Heritage|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nu/quttinirpaaq/natcul/natcul6.aspx|website=Parks Canada|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Hazen Camp is situated half way along the north shore of [[Lake Hazen]]. The closest settlement is [[Tanquary Fiord]]. McGill [[Mountain]] is very close to the station, rising 1000m into the sky.

'''Cataphiles''' are [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]] who illegally tour the [[Mines of Paris]], a term popularly used to describe a series of underground tunnels that were built as a network of stone mines, which are no longer used. The [[Catacombs of Paris]] comprise a subset of this network.

==Unauthorized visits==
[[Image:Catacombs rueDeLaVoieVerte.jpg|thumb|329px|A partially flooded section of rue de la Voie Verte]]
Entrance to the mines is restricted.  The portion open to the public (the [[Catacombs of Paris|catacombs]]) is only a small part of an extensive network of underground tunnels, which spans around {{convert|280|km|mi}} in length. The tunnel system is complex, and though some tunnels have plaques indicating the name of the street above, it is easy to get lost. Some passages are low or narrow, and others are partially flooded. There are aging telephone wires, pipes, and other impediments that can hinder progress, and [[cave-in]]s, although rare, do occasionally occur. A good guide is indispensable, and many guides occasionally refer to a map. Because of these dangers, accessing the catacombs without official escort has been illegal since 2 November 1955. There is a [[euro|€]]60 fine for people caught by the E.R.I.C - the special police who patrol the mines.

Secret entrances exist throughout Paris, and it is sometimes possible to enter the mines via the sewers, metro, and certain manholes.&lt;ref name="rfi"&gt;{{cite web
|last=Oved |first=Marco Chown
|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/112/article_3639.asp
|title=The catacombs of Paris and a journey into the unknown
|work=Radio France Internationale |publisher= |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some unofficial visitors hold keys to certain official entrances. On rare occasions people use these access points and illegally enter the mines — for example, to meet clandestinely, to hold [[unusual parties]], or simply as  [[Urban exploration|urban explorers]].

In September 2004,  the French police discovered an underground movie theater run by [[les UX]] — a French artistic movement that seeks to convey their ideas using underground places.&lt;ref name="Mexicaine"&gt;{{cite web|last=

|title=La Mexicaine De Perforation
|work=Urban-Resources
|publisher=Urban-Resources
|accessdate=2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cataphiles often descend for a day, a night, or perhaps a week to explore, photograph, paint murals, create maps, clean up rooms, and dig ''chatières'' (very narrow tunnels, that one can only crawl through).&lt;ref name="Secrets of the City of Light"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://blogs.bootsnall.com/Moe/mommy-whats-a-cataphile.html |title=Mommy, what's a cataphile? |work=Secrets of the City of Light |publisher= |accessdate=2009-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204114559/http://blogs.bootsnall.com/Moe/mommy-whats-a-cataphile.html |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2988">The '''Coalition for Rainforest Nations''' ('''CfRN''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] established by forested tropical counties to collaboratively reconcile forest stewardship with economic development. The Rainforest Coalition aims to bring together both developing and industrialized nations for the purpose of creating community-driven, [[Sustainable Development|environmentally sustainable economic growth]].

The primary strategy of the Coalition is to bring about the reform of international frameworks, both legal and economic, to correct [[market failure]]s that result in unsustainable outcomes, and to create economic incentives for the preservation of areas of high [[biodiversity]] and [[endemism]] worldwide. The Coalition supports the [[Forests Now Declaration]] calling for changes in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and other international carbon markets to include land use and forestry.

The Coalition has been instrumental in the establishment of the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and the United Nations' UN-REDD program.  Further, based upon these efforts by the Coalition, various industrialized countries (including Norway, the UK, Germany, France, Japan, Australia, Finland, and others) have currently pledged around US$3.0 billion for capacity building and incentives to reduce rates of deforestation in participating developing countries.

At the request of Prime Minister Somare, the participating nations have agreed to base the Secretariat for the Coalition for Rainforest Nations at [[Columbia University]] in the City of New York.  The CfRN was formed after a [http://www.rainforestcoalition.org/documents/SirMichaelSomareGROCCSpeech-FINAL speech]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} given on May 10, 2005, at [[Columbia University]] by [[Sir Michael Somare]], the Prime Minister of [[Papua New Guinea]].

A '''compass rose''', sometimes called a '''windrose''' or '''Rose of the Winds''', is a figure on a [[compass]], [[map]], [[nautical chart]], or monument used to display the orientation of the [[cardinal direction]]s ([[north]], [[east]], [[south]], and [[west]]) and their intermediate points. It is also the term for the graduated markings found on the traditional [[magnetic compass]]. Today, the idea of a compass rose is found on, or featured in, almost all [[navigation]] systems, including [[nautical chart]]s, [[non-directional beacon]]s (NDB), [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) systems, global-positioning systems ([[GPS]]), and similar equipment.

[[File:Windrose.svg|thumb|right|Compass rose with the eight [[principal winds]]]]
The modern compass rose has eight [[principal winds]]. Listed clockwise, these are:

Although modern compasses use the names of the eight principal directions (N, NE, E, SE, etc.), older compasses use the traditional Italianate wind names of Medieval origin (Tramontana, Greco, Levante, etc.)

4-point compass roses use only the four "basic winds" or "[[cardinal directions]]" (North, East, South, West), with angles of difference at 90°.

8-point compass roses use the eight [[principal winds]]—that is, the four cardinal directions (N, E, S, W) plus the four "intercardinal" or "[[ordinal directions]]" (NE, SE, SW, NW), at angles of difference of 45°.

16-point compass roses are constructed by bisecting the angles of the principal winds to come up with intermediate compass points, known as [[half-wind]]s, at angles of difference of 22{{frac|1|2}}°. The names of the half-winds are simply combinations of the principal winds to either side, principal then ordinal.  E.g. North-northeast (NNE), East-northeast (ENE), etc.

32-point compass roses are constructed by bisecting these angles, and coming up with [[quarter-wind]]s at 11{{frac|1|4}}° angles of difference. Quarter-wind names are constructed with the names "X by Y", which can be read as "one quarter wind from X toward Y", where X is one of the eight principal winds and Y is one of the two adjacent cardinal directions. For example, North-by-east (NbE) is one quarter wind from North towards East, Northeast-by-north (NEbN) is one quarter wind from Northeast toward North. Naming all 32 points on the rose is called "[[boxing the compass]]".

The 32-point rose has the uncomfortable number of 11{{frac|1|4}}° between points, but is easily found by halving divisions and may have been easier for those not using a 360° circle. Using [[Grad (angle)|gradians]], of which there are 400 in a circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://webdav-noauth.unit-c.fr/files/perso/pbarbier/cours_unit/Elements_de_base_de_la_cartographie.pdf|page=12|year=2005|publisher=Institut Géographique National|author=Patrick Bouron|accessdate=2011-07-07|title=Cartographie: Lecture de Carte|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415034329/http://webdav-noauth.unit-c.fr/files/perso/pbarbier/cours_unit/Elements_de_base_de_la_cartographie.pdf|archivedate=2010-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sixteen-point rose will have twenty-five gradians per point.

== History ==

Linguistic anthropological studies have shown that most human communities have four points of [[cardinal direction]]. The names given to these directions are usually derived from either locally-specific geographic features (e.g. "towards the hills", "towards the sea") or from celestial bodies (especially the sun) or from atmospheric features (winds, temperature).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C.H. (1983) "Where do Cardinal Direction Terms Come From?", Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 25 (2), p. 121-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Most mobile populations tend to adopt sunrise and sunset for East and West and the direction from where different winds blow to denote North and South.

=== Classical compass rose ===

{{main|Classical compass winds}}

The [[ancient Greek]]s originally maintained distinct and separate systems of points and winds. The four Greek [[cardinal direction|cardinal points]] (arctos, anatole, mesembria and dusis) were based on celestial bodies and used for orientation. The four Greek [[anemoi|winds]] (Boreas, Notos, Eurus, Zephyrus) were confined to [[meteorology]]. Nonetheless, both systems were gradually conflated, and wind names came to eventually denote cardinal directions as well.&lt;ref&gt;D'Avezac, M.A.P. (1874) ''Aperçus historiques sur la rose des vents: lettre à Monsieur Henri Narducci.'' Rome: Civelli&lt;/ref&gt;

In his meteorological studies, [[Aristotle]] identified ten distinct winds: two north-south winds (Aparctias, Notos) and four sets of east-west winds blowing from different latitudes—the [[Arctic circle]] (Meses, Thrascias), the [[summer solstice]] horizon (Caecias, Argestes), the [[equinox]] (Apeliotes, Zephyrus) and the [[winter solstice]] (Eurus, Lips). However, Aristotle's system was asymmetric. To restore balance, [[Timosthenes]] of Rhodes added two more winds to produce the classical 12-wind rose, and began using the winds to denote geographical direction in navigation. [[Eratosthenes]] deducted two winds from Aristotle's system, to produce the classical 8-wind rose.

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] (e.g. [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]) adopted the Greek 12-wind system, and replaced its names with [[Latin language|Latin]] equivalents, e.g. Septentrio, Subsolanus, Auster, Favonius, etc. Uniquely, [[Vitruvius]] came up with a 24-wind rose.

According to the chronicler [[Einhard]] (c. 830), the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] himself came up with his own names for the classical 12 winds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Einhard]], ''Vita Karoli Imp.'', [Lat: (Eng.([https://books.google.com/books?id=R2IJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.22])([https://books.google.com/books?id=2mMNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.68])&lt;/ref&gt; He named the four cardinal winds on the roots ''Nord'' (etymology uncertain, could be "wet", meaning from the rainy lands), ''Ost'' (shining place, sunrise), ''Sund'' (sunny lands) and ''Vuest'' (dwelling place, meaning evening). Intermediate winds were constructed as simple compound names of these four (e.g. "Nordostdroni", the "northeasterly" wind). These Carolingian names are the source of the modern compass point names found in nearly all modern west European languages. (e.g. North, East, South and West in English; Nord, Est, Sud, Ouest in [[French language|French]], etc.)

The following table gives a rough equivalence of the classical 12-wind rose with the modern compass directions (Note: the directions are imprecise since it is not clear at what angles the classical winds are supposed to be with each other; some have argued that they should be equally spaced at 30 degrees each; for more details, see the article on [[Classical compass winds]]).

=== Sidereal compass rose ===

The "sidereal" compass rose demarcates the compass points by the position of [[star]]s in the night sky, rather than winds. [[Arab]] navigators in the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]], who depended on [[celestial navigation]], were using a 32-point sidereal compass rose before the end of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Saussure, L. de (1923) "L'origine de la rose des vents et l'invention de la boussole", ''Archives des sciences physiques et naturelles'', vol. 5, no.2 &amp; 3, pp.149-81 and 259-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E.G.R. (1956) ''The Haven-Finding Art: A history of navigation from Odysseus to Captain Cook'', 1971 ed., London: Hollis and Carter., p.128-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolmacheva, M. (1980) "On the Arab System of Nautical Orientation", ''Arabica'', vol. 27 (2), p.180-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tibbets, G.R. (1971) ''Arab Navigation in the Indian Ocean before the coming of the Portuguese'', London: Royal Asiatic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Lagan (2005) ''The Barefoot Navigator: Navigating with the skills of the ancients''. Dobbs Ferry, New York: Sheridan House.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern hemisphere, the steady Pole Star ([[Polaris]]) was used for the N-S axis; the less-steady [[Southern Cross]] had to do for the southern hemisphere, as the southern pole star, [[Sigma Octantis]], is too dim to be easily seen from Earth with the naked eye. The other thirty points on the sidereal rose were determined by the rising and setting positions of fifteen bright stars. Reading from North to South, in their rising and setting positions, these are:&lt;ref&gt;List comes from Tolmacheva (1980:p.183), based "with some reservations" on Tibbets (1971: p.296, n.133). The sidereal rose given in Lagan (2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIOpOb0mpugC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.66]) has some differences, e.g. placing Orion's belt in East and Altair in EbN.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western half of the rose would be the same stars in their setting position. The true position of these stars is only approximate to their theoretical equidistant rhumbs on the sidereal compass. Stars with the same [[declination]] formed a "linear constellation" or ''kavenga'' to provide direction as the night progressed.&lt;ref&gt;M.D. Halpern (1985) [http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Halpern-MA1985.pdf The Origins of the Carolinian Sidereal Compass], Master's thesis, [[Texas A &amp; M University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar sidereal compass was used by [[Polynesian navigation|Polynesian and Micronesian navigators]] in the Pacific Ocean, although different stars were used in a number of cases, clustering around the East-West axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodenough|first=W. H.|title=Native Astronomy in the Central Carolines|year=1953|publisher=University Museum, University of Philadelphia|location=Philadelphia|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=David|title=[[We, the Navigators]]|accessdate=Apr 1, 2015|year=1972|publisher=Australian National University Press|location=Canberra|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mariner's compass rose ===

In Europe, the Classical 12-wind system continued to be taught in academic settings during the Medieval era, but seafarers in the Mediterranean came up with their own distinct 8-wind system. The mariners used names derived from the [[Mediterranean lingua franca]]—the [[Italian language|Italian]]-tinged patois among Medieval sailors, composed principally of [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]], mixed with [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]] terms from around the Mediterranean basin. [[File:32-point compass (traditional winds).svg|thumb|400px|32-wind compass with traditional names (and traditional color code)]]
* (N) Tramontana
* (NE) Greco (or Bora)
* (E) Levante
* (SE) Scirocco (or Exaloc)
* (S) Ostro (or Mezzogiorno)
* (SW) Libeccio (or Garbino)
* (W) Ponente
* (NW) Maestro (or Mistral)

The exact origin of the mariner's eight-wind rose is obscure. Only two of its point names (''Ostro'', ''Libeccio'') have Classical etymologies, the rest of the names seem to be autonomously derived. Two [[Arabic]] words stand out: ''Scirocco'' (SE) from ''al-Sharq'' (الشرق – east in Arabic) and the variant ''Garbino'' (SW), from ''al-Gharb'' (الغرب – west in Arabic). This suggests the mariner's rose was probably acquired by southern Italian seafarers not from their classical Roman ancestors, but rather from [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman Sicily]] in the 11th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, E.G. R. (1937) "The 'De Ventis' of Matthew Paris", ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 2, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt; The coasts of the [[Maghreb]] and [[Mashriq]] are SW and SE of Sicily respectively; the ''Greco'' (a NE wind), reflects the position of Byzantine-held Calabria-Apulia to the northeast of Arab Sicily, while the ''Maestro'' (a NW wind) is a reference to the [[Mistral wind]] that blows from the southern French coast towards northwest Sicily.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The 32-point compass used for navigation in the Mediterranean by the 14th century, had increments of 11{{frac|1|4}}° between points. Only the eight principal winds (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) were given special names. The eight [[half-wind]]s just combined the names of the two principal winds, e.g. Greco-Tramontana for NNE, Greco-Levante for ENE, and so on. [[Quarter-wind]]s were more cumbersomely phrased, with the closest principal wind named first and the next-closest principal wind second, e.g. "Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco" (literally, "one quarter wind from North towards Northeast", i.e. North by East), and "Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana" ("one quarter wind from NE towards N", i.e. Northeast by North). [[Boxing the compass]] (naming all 32 winds) was expected of all Medieval mariners.

=== Depiction on Nautical Charts ===

In the earliest Medieval [[portolan chart]]s of the 14th century, compass roses were depicted as mere collections of color-coded compass [[rhumb lines]]: black for the eight main winds, green for the eight half-winds and red for the sixteen quarter-winds.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, H.M. and J.H. Robinson, editors (1987) ''Cartographical Innovations: An international handbook of mapping terms to 1900''. London: Map Collector Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The average portolan chart had sixteen such roses (or confluence of lines), spaced out equally around the circumference of a large implicit circle.

The cartographer [[Cresques Abraham]] of [[Majorca]], in his [[Catalan Atlas]] of 1375, was the first to draw an ornate compass rose on a map. By the end of the 15th century, Portuguese cartographers began drawing multiple ornate compass roses throughout the chart, one upon each of the sixteen circumference roses (unless the illustration conflicted with coastal details).&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Nordenskiöld (1896) "Résumé of an Essay on the Early History of Charts and Sailing Directions", ''Report of the Sixth International Geographical Congress: held in London, 1895''. London: J. Murray. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=glw5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA693#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.693])&lt;/ref&gt;

The points on a compass rose were frequently labeled by the initial letters of the mariner's principal winds (T, G, L, S, O, L, P, M). However, from the outset, the custom also began to distinguish the north from the other points by a specific visual marker. Medieval Italian cartographers typically used a simple arrowhead or circumflex-hatted T (an allusion to the compass needle) to designate the north, while the [[Majorcan cartographic school]] typically used a stylized [[Pole Star]] for its north mark.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Heinrich (1947) "On the Real and the Pseudo-Pilestrina Maps and Other Early Portuguese Maps in Munich", ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 4, p. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the [[fleur-de-lis]] as north mark was introduced by [[Pedro Reinel]], and quickly became customary in compass roses (and is still often used today). Old compass roses also often used a [[Christian cross]] at Levante (E), indicating the direction of [[Jerusalem]] from the point of view of the Mediterranean sea.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;Dan Reboussin (2005). [http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/cm/africana/windrose.htm Wind Rose.] [[University of Florida]]. Retrieved on 2009-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twelve Classical winds (or a subset of them) were also sometimes depicted on portolan charts, albeit not on a compass rose, but rather separately on small disks or coins on the edges of the map.

The compass rose was also depicted on [[traverse board]]s used on board ships to record headings sailed at set time intervals.

The contemporary compass rose appears as two rings, one smaller and set inside the other. The outside ring denotes '''true''' [[cardinal direction]]s while the smaller inside ring denotes '''magnetic''' cardinal directions. '''[[True north]]''' refers to the geographical location of the [[north pole]] while '''[[magnetic north]]''' refers to the direction towards which the north pole of a magnetic object (as found in a [[compass]]) will point. The angular difference between '''true''' and '''magnetic''' north is called [[magnetic variation|variation]], which varies depending on location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRqzoX04v5AC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=compass+variation+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RQOP6i4YkC&amp;sig=7wi8b-sx9EAESaeQC55aNInCA6c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_88VTtLIDqHb0QHvsrkv&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=compass%20variation%20book&amp;f=false|title=The Annapolis book of seamanship|author=John Rousmaniere, Mark Smith|page=233|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1999|ISBN=978-0-684-85420-5|accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angular difference between magnetic heading and compass heading is called [[magnetic deviation|deviation]] which varies by vessel and its heading.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23191">A '''cultigen''' (from the Latin ''cultus'' – cultivated, and ''gens'' – kind) is a plant that has been deliberately altered or selected by humans; it is the result of [[artificial selection]]. These ''man-made'' or [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] plants are, for the most part, plants with commercial value used in [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] or [[forestry]]. Because cultigens are defined by their mode of origin and not by where they are growing, plants meeting this definition remain cultigens whether they are [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in the wild, deliberately planted in the wild, or growing in cultivation.
Cultigens arise in the following ways: selections of variants from the wild or cultivation including vegetative [[Sport (botany)|sport]]s (aberrant growth that can be reproduced reliably in cultivation); plants that are the result of [[plant breeding]] and selection programs; [[genetically modified]] plants (plants modified by the deliberate implantation of genetic material); and [[graft-chimaera]]s (plants grafted to produce mixed tissue, the [[Grafting|graft]] material possibly from wild plants, special selections, or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]).

Cultigens may be named in any of a number of ways.{{disputed inline|date=July 2015}} The traditional method of scientific naming is under the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', and many of the most important cultigens, like [[maize]] (''[[Zea mays]]'') and [[banana]] (''[[Musa acuminata]]''), are so named. Although it is perfectly in order to give a cultigen a botanical name, in any rank desired, now or at any other time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Nothing precludes the use, for cultivated plants, of names published in accordance with the requirements of this Code."&lt;/ref&gt; these days it is more common for cultigens to be given names in accordance with the principles, rules and recommendations laid down in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] (ICNCP) which provides for the names of cultigens in three classification categories, the [[cultivar]], the [[Cultivar group|Group]] (formerly cultivar-group), and the [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The category grex was added in the 2009 ''Cultivated Plant Code'' and applies only to orchids (Article 4).&lt;/ref&gt; From that viewpoint it may be said{{original research inline|date=July 2015}} that there is a separate discipline of cultivated plant taxonomy, which forms one of the ways to look at cultigens. The ICNCP does not recognize the use of trade designations and other marketing devices as scientifically acceptable names, but does provide advice on how they should be presented.&lt;ref name=ICNCP&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Brickell CD, Alexander C, David JC, Hetterscheid WA, Leslie AC, Malecot V, Jin X |others=Editorial committee; Cubey, J.J. |year=2009  |title=International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP or Cultivated Plant Code) incorporating the Rules and Recommendations for naming plants in cultivation, Eighth Edition, Adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences International Commission for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy and International Society for Horticultural  Science  |url=http://www.actahort.org/chronica/pdf/sh_10.pdf }} Article 10 and Appendix 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all cultigens have been given names according to the ''Cultivated Plant Code''. Apart from ancient cultigens like those mentioned above there may be occasional anthropogenic plants such as those that are the result of breeding, selection, and tissue grafting that are of no commercial value and have therefore not been given names according to the ICNCP.

== Formal definition ==
A '''cultigen''' is a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity.&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The wild/cultivated distinction ==
Interest in the distinction between wild and cultivated plants dates back to antiquity. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that wild and cultivated plants (cultigens) were of intense interest to the ancient Greek botanists (partly for religious reasons) and that the distinction was discussed in some detail by  [[Theophrastus]] (370–285 BCE) the "Father of Botany". Theophrastus was a pupil of both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] and succeeded the latter as head of the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic School of Philosophy]] at the [[Lyceum]] in Athens. Theophrastus accepted the view that it was human action, not divine intervention, that produced cultivated plants (cultigens) from wild plants and he also  "''had an inkling of the limits of culturally induced ([[phenotype|phenotypic]]) changes and of the importance of genetic constitution''" (''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'' III, 2,2 and ''Causa Plantarum'' I, 9,3). He also noted that cultivated varieties of fruit trees would degenerate if cultivated from seed.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, A.G. 1981. ''History of Botanical Science''. London: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-508382-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of term ==
[[File:Liberty Hyde Bailey 1858-1954.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Liberty Hyde Bailey 1858-1954, who coined the word ''cultigen'' in 1918]]
The word cultigen was coined in 1918&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1918. The indigen and cultigen. ''Science'' ser. 2, 47:306-308&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858–1954) an American horticulturist, botanist and cofounder of the [[American Society for Horticultural Science]]. He was aware of the need for special categories for those cultivated plants that had arisen by intentional human activity and which would not fit neatly into the Linnaean [[hierarchical]] classification of ranks used by the ''International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature'' (which later became the ''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants'').
In his 1918 paper Bailey noted that for anyone preparing a descriptive account of the cultivated plants of a country (he was at that time preparing such an account for North America) it would be clear that there are two ''gentes'' or kinds (Latin singular, ''gens''; plural, ''gentes'') of plants. Firstly, those that are of known origin or nativity "of known habitat". These he referred to as [[indigen]]s. The other kind was: &lt;blockquote&gt;" ... a domesticated group of which the origin may be unknown or indefinite, which has such characters as to separate it from known indigens, and which is probably not represented by any type specimen or exact description, having therefore no clear taxonomic beginning." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
He called this second kind of plant a cultigen, the word derived from the conflation of  the Latin ''cultus'' – cultivated, and ''gens'' – kind.

In 1923&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1923. Various cultigens, and transfers in nomenclature. ''Gentes Herb''. 1:113--136&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey extended his original discussion emphasising that he was dealing with plants at the rank of species and he referred to indigens as: &lt;blockquote&gt;"''those that are discovered in the wild''"&lt;/blockquote&gt; and cultigens as plants that: &lt;blockquote&gt; "''arise in some way under the hand of man''" &lt;/blockquote&gt; He then defined a cultigen as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"''a species, or its equivalent, that has appeared under domestication''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Bailey's definitions ==
Bailey soon altered his 1923 definition of cultigen when, in 1924, he gave a new definition in the Glossary of his ''Manual of Cultivated Plants''&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1924. ''Manual of cultivated plants''. Macmillan, New York&lt;/ref&gt; as: &lt;blockquote&gt; " ''Plant or group known only in cultivation; presumably originating under domestication; contrast with indigen'' "&lt;/blockquote&gt; This, in essence, is the definition given at the head of this piece. This definition of the cultigen permits the recognition of cultivars, unlike the 1923 definition which restricts the idea of the cultigen to plants at the rank of species.
In later publications of the ''Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium'', Cornell, the idea of the cultigen having the rank of species returned (e.g. ''Hortus Second'' in 1941 and ''Hortus Third'' in 1976):&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1941. ''Hortus second : a concise dictionary of gardening, general horticulture and cultivated plants in North America''. The Macmillan Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H. 1976. ''Hortus third : a concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada''. Macmillan Collier Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; both of these publications indicate that the terms cultigen and cultivar are not synonymous and that cultigens exist at the rank of species only.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''A cultigen is a plant or group of apparent specific rank, known only in cultivation, with no determined nativity, presumably having originated, in the form in which we know it, under domestication. Compare indigen. Examples are ''Cucurbita maxima'', ''Phaseolus vulgaris'', ''Zea mays'' ''".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent usage in horticulture has, however, maintained a distinction between cultigen and cultivar while nevertheless ''allowing the inclusion of cultivars'' within the definition (see "Usage in horticulture" below).

== Cultivars ==
Cultigen and cultivar may be confused with one another. Cultigen is a general-purpose term encompassing not only plants with cultivar names but others as well (see introductory text above), while cultivar is a formal classification category (in the ICNCP).

Although in his 1923 paper Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen, it was clear to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species and so he established a new classification category for these, the [[cultivar]], generally assumed to be a contraction of the words "cultivated" and "variety". Bailey was never explicit about the [[etymology]] of the word cultivar and it has been suggested that it is a contraction of the words "cultigen" and "variety".&lt;ref&gt;Trehane, P. 2004. 50 years of the ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants''. ''Acta Horticulturae'' 634: 17-27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined cultivar in his 1923 paper as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
 ... "''a race subordinate to species, that has originated and persisted under cultivation; it is not necessarily, however, referable to a recognised botanical species. It is essentially the equivalent of the botanical variety except in respect to its origin''".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition and understanding of cultivar has changed over time (see current definition in [[cultivar]]).

== Usage ==

=== Usage in botany ===
In botanical literature the word cultigen is generally used to denote a plant which, like the [[common wheat|bread wheat]] (''Triticum aestivum'') is of unknown origin, but presumed to be an ancient human selection. Plants like bread wheat have been given [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]]s according to the ''Botanical Code'' and  therefore have names with the same form as those of plant species that occur naturally in the wild, but it is not necessary for a cultigen to have a species name, or to have the biological characteristics that distinguish a [[Species problem|species]]. Cultigens can have names at any of various other ranks, including cultivar names, names in the classification categories of [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]] and [[Cultivar group|group]], [[variety (botany)|variety names]], [[forma (botany)|forma names]], or they may be plants that have been altered by humans (including [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] plants) but which have not been given formal names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usage in horticulture ===
The year 1953 was an important one for cultivated plant taxonomy because this was the date of publication of the first ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'' in which Bailey's term cultivar was introduced. It was also the year that the eponymous journal commemorating the work of Bailey (who died in 1954), ''Baileya'', was published. In the first volume of ''Baileya'' taxonomist and colleague of Bailey, George Lawrence, wrote a short article clarifying the distinction between the new term ''cultivar'' and the ''variety''. In the same article he also tried to clarify the critical term ''taxon'' which had been introduced by German biologist Meyer in the 1920s but had only just been introduced and accepted in botanical circles. This brief article by Lawrence is useful for its insight into the understanding of the meaning of the word cultigen at this time. He opens the article: &lt;blockquote&gt;''In 1918, L.H. Bailey distinguished those plants originating in cultivation from the native plants by designating the former as cultigens and the latter as indigens (indigenous or native to the region). At the same time he proposed the term cultivar to distinguish varieties originating in cultivation from botanical varieties known first in the wild''.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, George H. M. 1953. "Cultivar, Distinguished from Variety." ''Baileya'' '''1''': 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In horticulture the definition and use of the terms cultigen and cultivar has varied. One example is the definition given in the Botanical Glossary of ''The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening''&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, A., Griffiths, M., and Levy, M. (eds.) 1992. ''The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt; which defines cultigen as: &lt;blockquote&gt; " ''A plant found only in cultivation or in the wild having escaped from cultivation; included here are many hybrids and cultivars,'' "... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of cultigen in this sense is essentially the same as the definition of the cultigen published by Bailey in 1924.

The ''Cultivated Plant Code'', however,  states that cultigens are "maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation",&lt;ref name=ICNCP/&gt; and thus would not include plants that have evolved subsequent to escape from cultivation.

=== Recommended usage ===
Wider use of the term cultigen as defined here has been proposed&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt; for the following reasons:

* supports current usage in horticulture
* assists clarity in non-technical discussions about "wild" and "cultivated" plants (for example, cultivated plants as commonly understood (plants in cultivation) are not the same as the "cultivated plants" of the ''Cultivated Plant Code'', and the distinction between "wild" and "cultivated" habitats is becoming progressively blurred)
* has the potential to simplify the language and definitions used in the Articles and Recommendations of the ''Cultivated Plant Code''
* gives greater precision and clarity to the definition of the respective scope, terminology and concepts of the ''Botanical Code'' and the ''Cultivated Plant Code''
* avoids the potential for confusion within the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' over its scope, that is, whether it is concerned with:
** where plants are growing (in the wild or in cultivation)
** how they originated (whether they are the result of intentional human activity or not)
** whether it simply provides a mechanism for regulating the names of those cultigens requiring special classification categories that are not part of the  Linnaean [[hierarchy]] of the ''Botanical Code'' i.e. cultivar and Group names&lt;ref name="spencer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=spencer2&gt;Spencer, R.D. 1999. Cultivated plants and the codes of nomenclature&amp;nbsp;– towards the resolution of a demarcation dispute. pp.171—181 in: S. Andrews, A.C. Leslie and C. Alexander (eds). ''Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants'': Third Symposium. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. {{ISBN|1-900347-89-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of definition ==
Potential misunderstandings and questions arising from the definition of cultigen given here have been discussed in the literature&lt;ref name=spencer2/&gt; and are summarised below.

* Natural and ''artificial'' selection
:The selection process is termed "artificial" when human preferences or influences have a significant effect on the evolution of a particular population or species (see [[artificial selection]]). Note: artificial selection is a part of the overall selection process&amp;nbsp;– it does not imply that humans are not part of nature, it is simply useful sometimes to distinguish when there has been human influence on selection (as with cultigens).

* What exactly does ''altered'' mean?
:There are cases that do not seem to comply with the definition. For example, we can presume that the entire global flora is changing as a result of human-induced climate change. Does this mean that all plants are cultigens?

:In cases like this the definition refers to "deliberate" selection and this would be of particular plant characteristics that are not exhibited by a plant's wild counterparts (but see ''Selections from the wild'').

* What exactly does ''deliberately selected'' mean?
:From the moment a plant is taken from the wild it is subject to human selection pressure&amp;nbsp;– from the selection of the original propagation material to the purchase of the plant in a nursery. Surely this form of selection is not deliberate? Again, the early human selection of crops 7,000-10,000 years ago is thought to have occurred quite unintentionally. Variants useful to horticulture often arise spontaneously, they are not deliberate products. Are these cases of unintentional, accidental, or unconscious selection?

:There certainly appear to be cases where origin or selection of a plant is not "deliberate". However, the long term propagation of plants that have some utility, usually economic or ornamental, can hardly be regarded as unintentional and these plants will, almost without exception, have characteristic(s) that distinguish them from their wild counterparts.

* What about plants selected from the wild?
:Plants like ''Quercus robur'', Pedunculate or English Oak, ''Liquidambar styraciflua'', Sweetgum and ''Eucalyptus globulus'', Blue Gum grown in parks and gardens are essentially the same as their wild counterparts and are therefore not cultigens. However, occasionally within natural plant variation there occur characters that are of value to horticulture but of little interest to botany. For example a plant might have flowers of several different colours but these may not have been given formal botanical names. It is customary in horticulture to introduce such variants to commerce and to give them cultivar names. Technically these plants have not been deliberately altered in any way from plants growing (or once growing) in the wild but as they are ''deliberately selected'' and ''named'' it seems permissible to refer to them as cultigens. These occurrences are very few. The definition could be (clumsily) extended by mentioning that selection can be for "desirable variation that is not recognised in [[botanical nomenclature]]".

* What about gene flow between populations?
:Occasionally cultigens escape from cultivation into the wild where they breed with indigenous plants. Selections may be made from the progeny in the wild and brought back into cultivation where they are used for breeding and the results of the breeding again escape into the wild to breed with indigenous plants. ''[[Lantana]]'' has behaved much like this. The genetic material of a cultigen may become part of the gene pool of a population where, over time, it may be largely or completely swamped. In cases like this what plants are to be called cultigens?

:Whether a plant is a cultigen or not does not depend on where it is growing. If it complies with the definition then it is a cultigen. Cases like this have always been difficult for botanical nomenclature. Unnamed progeny in the wild might be given a name like ''Lantana'' aff. ''camara'' (aff. = having affinities with) or may remain unnamed. Its cultigenic origin may or may not be recognised by the allocation of a cultivar name.

* Plants of unknown origin
:Occasionally plants will occur whose origin is unknown. Plants growing in cultivation that are unknown in the wild may be determined as cultigenic as a result of scientific investigation, but may remain a mystery.

* Difficult cases
:It may happen that a hybrid cross that has occurred in nature is also performed deliberately in cultivation and that the progeny appear identical. How do we know which plants are cultigens?

:If the cross in cultivation is followed by deliberate selection and naming then this will indicate a cultigen. However in a case like this it may not be possible to tell.

'''CyberGIS''', or '''cyber geographic information science and systems''', is an interdisciplinary field combining [[cyberinfrastructure]], [[e-science]], and [[geographic information science]] and [[Geographic information system|systems]] (GIS). CyberGIS has a particular focus on computational and data-intensive geospatial problem-solving within various research and education domains. The need for GIS has extended beyond traditional forms of geographic analysis and study, which includes adapting to new sources and kinds of data, [[high-performance computing]] resources, and online platforms based on existing and emerging information networks. The name cyberGIS first appeared in [[Geographic Information Science and Technology Body of Knowledge|Geographic Information Science]] literature in 2010.&lt;ref name="Wang2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Shaowen|title=A CyberGIS Framework for the Synthesis of Cyberinfrastructure, GIS, and Spatial Analysis|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=100|issue=3|year=2010|pages=535–557|issn=0004-5608|doi=10.1080/00045601003791243}}&lt;/ref&gt; CyberGIS is characterized as digital geospatial ecosystems. These systems are developed and have evolved through [[heterogeneous computing]] environments (see CyberGIS Supercomputer below), as well as human communication and information environments. CyberGIS can be considered a new generation of geographic information systems (GIS). These systems are based on advanced computing and information infrastructure, which analyze and model geospatial data, providing computationally intensive spatial analysis, modeling, and collaborative geospatial problem-solving at previously unprecedented scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=researchAreas_11&amp;_urlType=action&amp;wlpresearchAreas_11_id=%252FresearchGov%252FAwardHighlight%252FPublicAffairs%252F2014%252F24730_Thenext-generationgeospatialdiscovery.html&amp;wlpresearchAreas_11_action=selectAwardDetail|title=Research.gov Homepage|website=www.research.gov|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further descriptions of CyberGIS include: "a fundamentally new software framework comprising a seamless integration of cyberinfrastructure, GIS, and spatial analysis/modeling capabilities",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1047916|title=NSF Award Search: Award#1047916 - SI2-SSI: CyberGIS Software Integration for Sustained Geospatial Innovation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "GIS detached from the desktop and deployed on the web, with the associated issues of hardware, software, data storage, digital networks, people, training and education."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/10/01/what-is-cybergis/|title=What is CyberGIS? {{!}} ArcGIS Blog|website=blogs.esri.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier scientific research demonstrated problems for integration of spatiotemporal data and analytics due to geographic and spatial complexity. CyberGIS attempts to move beyond traditional scientific and technical constraints within conventional GIS by innovating compute- and data-intensive cyber environments, exploiting spatiotemporal characteristics inherent in various scientific domains, and using big data and [[high-performance computing]] approaches to collaborative problem solving.

== History ==
In 2004, early research on [[middleware]] that integrates GIS with high performance and distributed computing technologies laid the foundation for the subsequent research and development of cyberGIS. This middleware was called geo-middleware&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Shaowen. 2004. Grid-based Geo-Middleware for Geographic Analysis: Theory, Method, Implementation, and Evaluation. Ph.D. Thesis. The University of Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; because it was tailored to solving geographic problems. Geo-middleware was aimed at enabling collaborative problem-solving and decision-making by taking advantage of massive computational resources provided by high-performance computing infrastructure. Data-intensive spatiotemporal analytics and simulation require substantial computing power&lt;ref name="HagerWellein2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers|last2=Wellein|first2=Gerhard|year=2010|volume=20102232|doi=10.1201/EBK1439811924|issn=2154-4492|last1=Hager|first1=Georg}}&lt;/ref&gt; while geographic analysis often needs to address the effects of scale and spatial relationships have on various complex phenomena. This means that cyberGIS is focused on cutting-edge GIS advances that are dependent on advanced cyberinfrastructure and high-performance computing instead of conventional sequential computing and GIS approaches. By exploiting massive cyber resources, it is possible for cyberGIS to resolve broader scientific challenges through data-intensive spatiotemporal knowledge discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anselin|first1=Luc|last2=Rey|first2=Serge|title=Spatial Econometrics in an Age of CyberGIScience|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|date=2012|volume=26|issue=12|pages=2211–2226|doi=10.1080/13658816.2012.664276|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2012.664276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Dust II'''", also known by its filename '''de_dust2''', is a [[Virtual world| video game map]] featured in the [[first-person shooter]] series ''[[Counter-Strike]]''. Dust II is the successor to "Dust", another ''Counter-Strike'' map, and was developed by David Johnston prior to the official release of the original ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'' game. It was designed with the aims of simplicity and balance, based on its symmetrical design and two points, for which the two teams must fight over for control. 

The map was first released in March 2001 for the original ''Counter-Strike'' game and is present in all games in the series. Apart from graphical updates, it underwent minimal changes after its initial release, before  receiving a major revision in ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' in October 2017. The map has been popular with players since its initial release, and both its original and revised design in ''Global Offensive'' have been positively received by players and mapmakers.

== Design ==
[[File:Dust II radar.png|frame|Dust II [[minimap]]]]

Dust II is a [[Virtual world|video game map]] featured in the [[first-person shooter]] series ''[[Counter-Strike]]''. The map is set in a dusty environment based in Morocco, according to [[Jess Cliffe]], co-designer of the original ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/75ck0g/devs_annouce_dust_2_rework/do5p1rr/?context=3|title=Devs annouce dust 2 rework • r/GlobalOffensive|website=Reddit|date=October 10, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419143915/https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/75ck0g/devs_annouce_dust_2_rework/do5p1rr/?context=3|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other maps in the game, players are divided into two teams: Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. The Terrorists have a limited time in which to plant and detonate a bomb; the Counter-Terrorists try to stop them from planting the bomb or to defuse it if it has already been planted. The Terrorist side must gain control of two locations to plant the bomb; these sites are easily accessible to the Counter-Terrorists at the beginning of the round. The map has a few main choke points: "Middle", "Long A", and "B Tunnels". Of its layout, the map's creator David Johnston wrote: "...Dust was little more than a figure-of-eight that had grown a pair of arms and legs, centralizing the battles but providing tactical wiggle room."&lt;ref name="kotaku"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/valve-removes-counter-strikes-dust2-map-from-competitiv-1792023996|title=Valve Removes Counter-Strike's Dust2 Map From Competitive Play|last=Gach|first=Ethan|work=Kotaku|date=February 5, 2017|access-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125204701/https://kotaku.com/valve-removes-counter-strikes-dust2-map-from-competitiv-1792023996|archive-date=January 25, 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main choke points contain tactically important positions and areas. Middle has three main areas: Catwalk, an elevated pathway that leads to Short on A site; Lower Tunnels, a tunnel leading from Middle to Upper Tunnels; and Middle Doors, that has a set of open double doors at Middle, which leads to the Counter-Terrorist's spawn. At Long A, there are another three important areas before approaching the A Site. Long Doors are the two sets of open double doors that lead from the Terrorist's spawn to Long A; Pit is a sloped area where players can hide or use for cover near Long Doors; and Counter-Terrorist spawn, located right of Long A from A Site, is where the Counter-Terrorists spawn. B Tunnels has two main areas; Upper Tunnels and Lower Tunnels. Upper Tunnels leads to the B site or Terrorist spawn; Lower Tunnels leads to Upper Tunnels or Middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/|title=How to attack on CS:GO’s Dust2 map|first=Fredrik|last=Salomonsson|work=PC Gamer|date=March 22, 2016|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072744/http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-terrorist-guide/|archive-date=January 2, 2018|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/|title=How to defend on CS:GO’s Dust2 map|first=Fredrik|last=Salomonsson|work=PC Gamer|date=March 15, 2016|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102013256/http://www.pcgamer.com/csgo-dust2-ct-guide/|archive-date=January 2, 2018|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston stated in a blog post that, in making Dust II, he "had to ensure that this new map had everything in common with Dust, without actually being Dust". He began identifying what made Dust unique and Johnston kept the simple structures, ramps, crates, and "Dust doors"; these were elements he knew had to stay. Though, he wanted to add other elements, an area with close combat and an area with long-range fights, which turned into B Tunnels and Long A. Compared to Dust, he was patient in using the "trim" feature, an element that separated certain objects; he said he, "tried to use the trim very carefully, only exactly when needed, and not just as filler". He set certain rules for himself with trimming so that he did not overuse or under-use it; overusing would make the map too complex and under-using would make it too flat. Another thing different from Dust is that Dust II did not undergo any other major layout changes.&lt;ref name="johnston"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnsto.co.uk/design/making-dust2/|title=The Making Of: Dust 2|last=Johnston|first=Dave|date=April 26, 2014|website=johnsto.co.uk|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309134743/http://www.johnsto.co.uk/design/making-dust2/|archive-date=March 9, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=November 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Dust II was developed by David Johnston for the first game in the series as a conceptual sequel to the existing Dust map. Johnston originally titled it "Dust 3" because he did not think it was a worthy successor to Dust; before the game's launch it was retitled Dust II. The map was designed to be simple and balanced.&lt;ref name="johnston"/&gt; During the initial development of the map, "Long A", a long pathway that leads towards the "A Site", was not present. It existed in the map because of space limitations of the engine; there had been plans to make the area larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dexerto.com/news/dust-2-supposed-look-different/25846|title=Dust 2 Was Supposed to Look Very Different {{!}} Esports News &amp; Videos {{!}} Dexerto|last=Deason|first=Ross|work=Dexerto|date=February 2017|access-date=November 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113165228/https://www.dexerto.com/news/dust-2-supposed-look-different/25846|archive-date=November 13, 2017|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During development, map features such as caverns that would have provided cover, a window in "B Site", and a longer ramp in the Counter-Terrorist's Spawn to A Site were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/13555-dust-2-how-counterstrikes-most-popular-map-was-almost-completely-different|title=Dust 2: How Counter-Strike's Most Popular Map Was Almost Completely Different - GameRevolution|date=February 2, 2017|first=Jonathan|last=Leack|work=GameRevolution|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032317/http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/13555-dust-2-how-counterstrikes-most-popular-map-was-almost-completely-different|archive-date=December 1, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=November 29, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial release on  March 13, 2001, as part of ''Counter-Strike 1.1'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cstrike-planet.com/view.php/csinfo/history/?v=1.1|title=Version 1.1|last=|first=|date=March 13, 2001|website=Counter-Strike Planet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050330231453/http://www.cstrike-planet.com/view.php/csinfo/history/?v=1.1|deadurl=yes|archive-date=March 30, 2005|access-date=April 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the map received minimal changes following updates to the rest of the game, but received small graphical updates and lighting changes. It also received graphical updates in ''[[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero]]'' and Counter-Strike's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] release.&lt;ref name="johnston"/&gt;

=== ''Counter-Strike: Source'' ===
''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'' was allowed to use Valve's new [[Source (game engine)|Source game engine]] and changed some of the physics. Dust II received a graphical update and new objects that would affect game play were added. New doors were added and a crate at "Middle" was made easier to climb. A raised ceiling made firing down from T spawn onto Mid Doors easier.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/14/counter-strike-evolution-of-dust-2|title=Counter-Strike: Evolution of Dust 2|last=Onyett|first=Charles|date=February 13, 2012|website=IGN|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113115716/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/14/counter-strike-evolution-of-dust-2|archive-date=November 13, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Counter-Strike: Global Offensive'' ===

== Reception ==

Dust II has been in every ''Counter-Strike'' game to date and, as of the 2017 updates, continues to receive positive reception from mapmakers and players. Shawn "FMPONE" Snelling, a ''Counter-Strike'' mapmaker said "Valve has given the map a very cohesive and 'tactile' look, making it easier to get a read on your surroundings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://steamed.kotaku.com/what-counter-strike-mapmakers-think-of-the-new-dust2-1819410108|title=What Counter-Strike Mapmakers Think Of The New Dust2|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|work=Kotaku|access-date=November 5, 2017|date=October 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123181533/https://steamed.kotaku.com/what-counter-strike-mapmakers-think-of-the-new-dust2-1819410108|archive-date=January 23, 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitch Bowman of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the 2017 update, stating: "It's a healthy overhaul that makes some modest but interesting changes without reinventing the wheel."&lt;ref name="ReviewAndCar"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/new-dust-2-map/ |title=CS:GO's new Dust 2 map, reviewed |first=Mitch|last=Bowman|website=PC Gamer |language=en |date=October 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210190022/https://www.pcgamer.com/new-dust-2-map/|archive-date=February 10, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Stewart of [[MailOnline]] wrote that the update has made the map "&amp;nbsp;... drop-dead gorgeous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/esports/article-4966142/Iconic-CS-map-Dust-II-receives-update-esport-return.html|title=Iconic CS:GO map Dust II receives facelift on the next beta depot|last=Stewart|first=Jack|date=October 10, 2017|website=MailOnline|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218120342/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/esports/article-4966142/Iconic-CS-map-Dust-II-receives-update-esport-return.html|archive-date=December 18, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=January 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional ''Counter-Strike'' players have mixed opinions; some players enjoyed the update and its changes while some were disapproving.

=== Impact and legacy===
[[File:Dust II Far Cry 5 Imitation.jpg|thumb|An imitation of Dust II in ''[[Far Cry 5]]'''s "Far Cry Arcade"]]

Dust II has existed since 2001 and has been subject to imitation, spin offs, and disapproval from the gaming community. In February 2017, the map was removed from the Active Duty Competitive Pool in ''Global Offensive'', a group of maps played in professional competitions. The map was removed in favor of a revamped version of a map titled Inferno.&lt;ref name="dust2 inferno"/&gt; There was an immediate backlash to this change from professional players and community members; according to Peter "ptr" Gurney, Valve "[took] out a map that's balanced and put a map in that literally has at least 4-5 problems I can think of right away".&lt;ref name="d2 remove quotes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwg.com/esports/2017/02/03/what-are-the-pros-saying-about-dust-ii-being-removed-from-compet/|title=What Are The Pros Saying About Dust II Being Removed from Competitive Play?|last=Hitt|first=Kevin|date=February 3, 2017|website=WWG|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228041352/http://wwg.com/esports/2017/02/03/what-are-the-pros-saying-about-dust-ii-being-removed-from-compet/|archive-date=February 28, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabien "kioShiMa" Fiey, another professional ''Counter-Strike'' player, said, "Why is everyone so surprised.

There have been several imitations and recreations of Dust II.

==Biography==
Emmanuel Brunet-Jailly was born in Paris and raised in the South of France. He holds an LLB from [[Paul Cézanne University]], an MA in Political Science from [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]], and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Western Ontario]], London, Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwo.ca/ |title=The University of Western Ontario |publisher=Uwo.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ring.uvic.ca/01nov15/new_faculty.html |title=November 15, 2001 - New faculty |publisher=The Ring |date=2001-11-15 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Keating (political scientist)]] was chair of his Ph.D. committee. In 1999, he was appointed Assistant Director of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies [http://nanovic.nd.edu/] at the University Of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA. [http://nd.edu/] He was hired by the University of Victoria School of Public Administration in 2001 and granted [[academic tenure]] in 2007. He became co-director of the Local Government Institute in 2001, Executive Secretary and Treasurer of the Association of Borderland Studies in 2005, and Editor of the Journal of Borderland Studies in 2008 (with Martin van der Velde &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ru.nl/fm/link_naar/geografie/velde/ |title=Faculteit der Managementwetenschappen - Dr. B.M.R. van der Velde |publisher=Ru.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Henk van Houtum &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ru.nl/fm/houtum/ |title=Faculteit der Managementwetenschappen - Sociale geografie - Dr. H.J. van Houtum |publisher=Ru.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Since July 2008, he is also director of the University of Victoria European Studies Program, an interdisciplinary teaching and research unit grouping UVic scholars from five of its faculties.

==Research==
Brunet-Jailly’s published work focuses on two main areas of research:[[comparative]] [[Urban area|urban]] [[governance]], and the governance of [[cross-border]] [[region]]s, with a specific focus on comparative decentralization, horizontal and vertical governance, and the theorization of cross-border regions.

His interest in border cities and border urban regions, originates from his work as a civil servant of the French Government ''Agence Pour la Création d'Entreprises.'' [http://www.apce.com/] While working in the Paris office of APCE he developed a strong interest in what makes cities wealthy or poor, their international relations, and the impact of economic integration on urban politics.

As a result, a first strand of research is his notable attempt to make a strong theoretical contribution to the study of ''urban borderlands.'' In the 1990s, this literature was underdeveloped, but has seen a resurgence of interests after the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks on New York and Washington D.C.. One of his goals has been to develop a border model that would allow scholars to compare borders effectively and thus expand the scholarly 'boundaries' of their respective fields of study.

A second concurrent strand of research is about urban governance issues. In this area, he has published a number of research papers and a book ''Local Government in a Global World'' at the University of Toronto Press, with John Martin. Since 2001, he has written with Warren Magnusson (University of Victoria) the "Municipal Affairs" section of the ''Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Policies''.

All in all, as of 2008, his short biography states that his research work has appeared or is forthcoming in eight books or guest edited scholarly journals, and over 38 articles and book chapters in the following refereed journals and presses: Canadian American Public Policy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umaine.edu/canam/Publications/listoftitles.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015205523/http://www.umaine.edu/canam/Publications/listoftitles.htm |date=October 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Political Science Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/cpsr |title=Canadian Political Science Review |publisher=Ojs.unbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs,[http://www.carppa.ca/] Geopolitics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/14650045.asp |title=Taylor &amp; Francis Journals: Welcome |publisher=Tandf.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Journal of Economic Development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaef.com/ijed.php |title=International Journal of Economic Development &amp;#124; Southern Public Administration Education Foundation &amp;#124; Online Journals |publisher=Spaef.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journal of Borderland Studies,&lt;ref name="ABS home"/&gt; Journal of Urban Affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0735-2166 |title=Journal of Urban Affairs - Journal Information |publisher=Wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Toronto Press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utpress.utoronto.ca/ |title=University of Toronto Press is ... |publisher=Utpress.utoronto.ca |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; University Of Ottawa Press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uopress.uottawa.ca/ |title=Les Presses de l’Université d’Ottawa - University of Ottawa Press |publisher=Uopress.uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324060443/http://www.uopress.uottawa.ca/ |archive-date=2011-03-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Institute of Public Administration of Canada [http://www.ipac.ca/], Rowman and Littlefield (Lanham, MD), Commonwealth Local Government Forum (London, UK [[London]]), Hassleholm; [[Sweden]], Queen’s McGill University Press, Septentrion University Press, Lille, France, and Katharla publishers, [[Paris, France]].

* These theoretical contributions suggest a model of analysis of borders that resists a one-dimensional analysis, and argues that, in the cases of borders and borderlands, agency and structure are intermeshed.

The 1921 flag's inscriptions read, "Flag of the executive committee of the People's Revolutionary Party of Tannu Tuva" (tangnu tiva yin arad un qubisyal tu nam un quriyan u tuy). The 1926-1930 flag started being used after the Constitution of 24 November 1926 and the inscription read, "Tuvan People's Republic" (Bügüde Nayiramdaqu Tuva Arad Ulus). The 1941-1943 flag had the initials of the state ('''T'''ıwa '''A'''rat '''R'''espublik) in gold in canton. The 1943-1944 was just the Cyrillic version ('''Т'''ыва '''А'''рат '''Р'''еспублик).

'''Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs''' (April 14, 1831 &amp;ndash; June 2, 1896) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geography|geographer]], explorer, author and adventurer.

==Biography==
He was born at [[Bremen-Vegesack|Vegesack]], now part of [[Bremen]].  He was the son of a physician,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Rohlfs, Friedrich Gerhard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was much pressure on Rohlfs to be in the field of medicine. After the ordinary course at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] of [[Osnabrück]], he entered the [[Bremen]] corps in 1848, and took part as a volunteer in the [[First War of Schleswig|Schleswig-Holstein campaign]], being made an officer after the [[battle of Idstedt]] (July 1850).&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; He then became a medical student, and studied at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]], and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. He wanted to travel, joined the [[French Foreign Legion]] in a medical capacity, and served during the conquest of [[Kabylia]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;  He attained the highest rank open to a foreigner,&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Rohlfs, Gerhard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was decorated for bravery as Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Having learned the [[Arabic language]] and the mode of life of the inhabitants, in 1861 he went to [[Morocco]],&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; and was for some time personal physician to a nobleman there.

He then set off on his own, exploring the oases of Morocco. It was on this trip that he was attacked and left for dead, his leg almost severed from his body. These injuries would keep him from returning to Europe for most of his life, the cold weather somehow aggravating them.  In 1864 he continued his travels in Morocco, and crossed the [[Atlas Mountains]] to the oasis of [[Tuat]]. His description and map of the country were the first ever made from personal observation and with scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

After this trip, and a short visit to [[Germany]],&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; Rohlfs returned to [[Africa]], and, disguised as an Arab, was the first [[Europe]]an to cross Africa from [[Tripoli]] across the [[Sahara desert]] via [[Lake Chad]] and along the [[Niger River]] and to present-day Lagos on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] from 1865-1867. He was the second European explorer to visit the region of the [[Draa River]] in the south of Morocco. For this work, in 1868 he was awarded the Patron's Medal of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] of London.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Rohlfs's detailed account of it is contained in the ''Ergänzungsheft'' (“Supplement”) No. 34 to [[August Heinrich Petermann|Petermann]]'s ''Geographische Mittheilungen'' (Gotha, 1872).&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

At the close of 1867, by order of the [[king of Prussia]], he joined the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia|British punitive expedition to Abyssinia]]. He returned to Tripoli in 1868, and in 1869 traversed the desert from Tripoli to Alexandria, visiting the [[Siwa Oasis|oasis of Siwah]], site of the ancient city of Ammonium.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; Returning to Germany, he married and settled down in [[Weimar]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

[[File:Gerhard Rohlfs von Bremen - (...) btv1b8450600h (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Rohlfs posing with a [[scimitar]]]]
In 1873, with an expedition of 100 camels and 90 men, organized under the patronage of the [[khedive of Egypt]] [[Isma'il Pasha]], he explored the Libyan desert west of the chain of oases which skirt the valley of the [[Nile]], and discovered that the depression called the Bahr Bela-ma (river without water), marked on many maps of the desert at that time, did not exist. In 1874 Rohlfs set out from [[Dakhla Oasis]] intending to reach [[Kufra]]. In February he was about {{convert|100|km}} north of [[Abu Ballas]] (Pottery Hill) in the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]]. Accompanied by [[Karl Alfred von Zittel|Karl Zittel]] and a surveyor called Jordans, Rohlfs and his colleagues experienced a torrential downpour - a rare occurrence in the desert. Rohlf's team restocked and watered their camels and left a [[cairn]] at the place he had named ''Regenfeld'' (“Rain field”).&lt;ref&gt;W.B. Kennedy Shaw, ''Long Range Desert Group'', Greenhill Books, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The progress of the expedition was stopped by hills of loose sliding sand which the camels were unable to traverse, and the party turned back.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

In 1875, he visited the [[United States]], and lectured on his travels.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; In 1878 Rohlfs and Anton Stecker (1855-1888) were commissioned by the German African Society to go to [[Ouaddaï Region|Wadai]]. They succeeded in reaching the oasis of [[Kufra]], one of the chief centres of the [[Senussi]]tes, but being attacked by Arabs, they were obliged to retreat, making their way to the coast at [[Benghazi]], reached in October 1879. In 1880 Rohlfs accompanied Stecker in an exploring expedition to Abyssinia; but after delivering a letter from the German emperor to the [[Negus]], he returned to Europe.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

In 1885, when the rivalry belween the British and Germans in East Africa was very keen, [[Otto von Bismarck]] appointed Rohlfs consul at [[Zanzibar]], which island Bismarck desired to secure for Germany. Rohlfs, untrained in diplomacy, was no match for [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]], the British agent, and he was soon recalled, and did not again visit Africa.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

Rohlfs died at Rüngsdorf, near [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

==Climate==
[[File:Dominican Republic Köppen.svg|300px|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen climate types]] of the Dominican Republic]]
The country is a [[tropical]], [[maritime nation]]. Conditions are ameliorated in many areas by elevation and by the northeast [[trade winds]], which blow steadily from the [[Atlantic]] all year long. The annual mean [[temperature]] is {{convert|25|°C}}; regional mean temperatures range from {{convert|18|°C|1}} in the heart of the Cordillera Central ([[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]]) to as high as {{convert|27|°C|1}} in arid regions. Temperatures rarely rise above {{convert|32|°C|1}}, and freezing temperatures only occur in winter in the highest mountains. The average temperature in [[Santo Domingo]] in January is {{convert|24|°C|1}}, and {{convert|27|°C|1}} in July.

The rain season for the northern coast is from November to January. For the rest of the country, the rain season is from May to November. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1346|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with extremes of {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} or more in the mountainous northeast (the windward side of the island) and {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the southwestern valleys. The western valleys, along the Haitian border, remain relatively dry, with less than {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation, due to the [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the central and northern mountain ranges. The northwestern and southeastern extremes of the country are also arid.

The Dominican Republic is occasionally damaged by tropical storms and hurricanes, which originate in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern Caribbean from June until November (mainly from August to October) each year.

== Islands ==
There are several smaller islands and cays that are part of the Dominican territory. The largest islands are:
#''[[Saona Island|Saona]]'', close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 117&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="santiago" /&gt; Its [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name was ''Iai'' &lt;ref name="Morales"&gt;As shown in a map made by Andrés Morales in 1508 and published in 1516.

#''[[Beata Island|Beata]]'', in the southern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 27&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="santiago" /&gt; Its [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name is unknown. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] named this island as ''Madama Beata''.
#''[[Catalina Island, Dominican Republic|Catalina]]'', very close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It has an area of 9.6&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="santiago" /&gt; Its [[Taíno people|Taíno]] name was ''Iabanea''&lt;ref name="Morales" /&gt; but some writers, including poets, say that it was called ''Toeya'' or ''Toella''. It was discovered by [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] who named it ''Santa Catalina''.

== Relief ==
[[File:Cordillera Central, RD.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cordillera Central]]
The Dominican Republic is a country with many [[mountain]]s, and the highest peaks of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] are found here. The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern peninsula (in Haiti) where they have a direction west-east. The mountains are separated by [[valley]]s with the same general direction.

From north to south, the mountain ranges and valleys are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Cordillera Septentrional'' (in English, "Northern Range"). It runs parallel to the north coast, with extensions to the northwest, the [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] Island, and to the southeast, the Samaná Peninsula (with its ''Sierra de Samaná''). Its highest mountain is [[Diego de Ocampo]], close to Santiago, with 1,249 m. There are several small plains between this range and the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers are short and most of them flow to the north.
* The ''[[Cibao]]'' Valley (Dominican Republic) is the largest and the most important valley of the country. This long valley stretches from North Haiti, where is called ''[[Plain]]e du Nord'', to Samaná Bay. It can be divided in two sections: the northwestern part is the ''Yaque del Norte Valley'' (or ''Línea Noroeste'') and the eastern ''Yuna Valley'' (or ''Vega Real'', English: ''Royal Valley''). The ''Vega Real'' is the most fertile area in the country, with a high population density.
* The ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (also called ''Sierra del Cibao'') is the island's most rugged and imposing feature and is known in Haiti as the ''Massif du Nord'' ("Northern Massif").  The highest mountains of the West Indies are in this range: [[Pico Duarte]], 3,098 m, and others above 3,000 m. Near the center of the island, this range turns southward and is called ''Sierra de Ocoa'', finishing near the city of Azua de Compostela, on the Caribbean coast. Another branch, ''Cordillera Oriental'' or ''Sierra del Seibo'', is separated from the main chain by a [[Karst topography|karst]]ic region (''Los Haitises'') and with a west-east direction; it is located south of Samaná Bay.
* The ''San Juan Valley'' and ''[[Plain]] of Azua'' are big valleys south of the ''Cordillera Central'' with altitude from 0 to 600 m.
* The ''Sierra de Neiba'', with Mount Neiba the highest mountain with 2,279 m. An extension to the southeast of ''Sierra de Neiba'' is the ''Sierra Martín García'' (''Loma Busú'', 1,350 m).
* The ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' or ''Neiba Valley'' is a remarkable valley, with a west-east direction, of low altitude (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with a great salt lake: the ''[[Enriquillo Lake]]''.
* The ''Sierra de Bahoruco'', called ''Massif de la Selle'' in Haiti. This southern group of mountains have a geology very different from the rest of the island.
* ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (in English, "Caribbean Coastal Plain") is in the southeast of the island (and of the Dominican Republic). It is a large [[prairie]] east of [[Santo Domingo]].

[[File:Dashashwamedha ghat on the Ganga, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|The famous ''[[Dashashwamedh Ghat]]'' on the Ganges river, [[Varanasi]]]]
As used in many parts of [[South Asia]], the term '''ghat''' refers to a series of steps leading down to a body of water, particularly a holy river.
The set of stairs can lead down to something as small as a pond or as large as a major river.

==Etymology==
The word ''ghat'' is explained by numerous [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] etymons such as [[Kannada language|Kannada]] ''gatta'' (mountain range) [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''kattu'' (side of a mountain, dam, ridge, causeway) and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ''katta'' and ''gattu'' (dam, embankment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaini|first=Padmanabh S.|title=Jainism and Early Buddhism|year=2003|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|pages=523–538|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_EdL2FtIqQC&amp;dq=etymology+dravidian&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The word ''ghat'' has furthermore the implicit meaning of ''pass'' or ''crossing''.

==Along the rivers in India==
The numerous significant ghats along the [[Ganges]] are the [[Ghats in Varanasi|Varanasi ghats]] (the city of [[Varanasi]] has 88 ghats) and generically the "ghats of the Ganges". Most of these were constructed under the patronage of various [[Maratha empire| Maratha rulers]] such as [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] (Queen of the Malwa Kingdom from 1767 to 1795) in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Madhya Pradesh]] in central [[India]] there are further significant ghats along the [[Narmada River]]. People who live on the steps are also called ghats.

==Shmashana ghats==
[[File:019XZZ000000123U00013000(SVC2).jpg|right|thumb|A late 18th century painting of [[Pune]] with the Shmashana ghat at the confluence of Mula and Mutha rivers in the foreground]]
Ghats such as these are useful for both mundane purposes (such as cleaning) and religious rites (i.e. ritual bathing or ablutions); there are also specific "[[shmashana]]" or "cremation" ghats where bodies are cremated waterside, allowing ashes to be washed away by rivers; notable ones are [[Nigambodh Ghat]] and [[Raj Ghat]] in [[Delhi]] on the [[Yamuna]], the latter of which was the cremation area for [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and numerous political leaders after him, and the [[Manikarnika Ghat]] at Varanasi on the [[Ganges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_6-1-2005_pg7_23 |title=Funeral pyre to be set up in Lahore |publisher=Daily Times Pakistan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213050046/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_6-1-2005_pg7_23 |archivedate=2007-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Kannada]],  ''ghat'' is a term used to identify a difficult passage over a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Navneet Marathi English Dictionary |publisher=Navneet Publications (India) Limited |location=Mumbai 400028 |url=http://www.navneet.com/mainpage/contactus.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124025354/http://navneet.com/mainpage/contactus.asp |archivedate=2009-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such passage is the [[Bhor Ghat]] that connects the towns [[Khopoli]] and [[Khandala]], on [[National Highway 4 (India)|NH 4]] about {{convert|80|km}} north of [[Mumbai]]. [[Charmadi]] Ghat of Karnataka is also notable.

In many cases, the term is used to refer to a mountain range itself, as in the ''[[Western Ghats]]'' and ''[[Eastern Ghats]]''. 'Ghattam' in Malayalam also refers to mountain ranges when used with the name of the ranges being addressed (e.g., paschima ghattam for Western Ghats), while the passage road would be called a 'churam'.

===Outside India===
The word is also used in some places outside the Indian subcontinent where there are Indian communities. For example, in [[George Town, Penang]] in [[Malaysia]], the label "Ghaut" is used to identify the extensions of those streets which formerly ended in ghats before reclamation of the quayside (e.g., Church St Ghaut - in [[Malay language|Malay]] ''Gat Lebuh Gereja'' - is the name of the extension of Church St beyond where the street used to descend to the water via a ghat). In both [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], there are areas named [[Dhoby Ghaut]] ([[dhobi]] meaning "launderer" or "laundry", depending on whether it refers to a person or a business).

==Place name suffix==
"Ghat" and "Ghata" is also a [[suffix]] used in several place names across the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]]. This is an incomplete list:
* [[Balaghat district|Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh]], India
* [[Balurghat|Balurghat, West Bengal]], India
* [[Batiaghata Upazila|Batiaghata, Khulna]], Bangladesh

[[File:Greater Yemen.png|thumb|Yemen in red, unofficial claims in pink]]
'''Greater Yemen''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: اليمن الكبرى - Al-Yaman al-Kubrā) is a [[geographic]] term denoting territories of historic [[South Arabia]] which included the present territory of the [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]] as well as the Saudi regions of [['Asir Region|'Asir]], [[Najran Region|Najran]], [[Jizan Region|Jizan]], adjacent islands in the [[Red Sea]], adjacent parts of [[Tihamah]] and the Omani governorate of [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]].

[['Asir Region|'Asir]], [[Najran Region|Najran]], and [[Jizan Region|Jizan]] were part of Yemen before the [[Saudi–Yemeni War (1934)]] and Dhofar was part of [[Kathiri]] [[Sultanate]].

Greater Yemen is also a [[politics|political]] term denoting the [[irredentism|irredentist]] aspiration that these areas be united under a common [[Sovereign state|state]].  These claims are based on the historical notion of Bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula) as well as the [[Rasulid]] state of the 13th-15th centuries and the [[Zaiddiyah|Zaidi]] state of the late 17th and early 18th centuries which encompassed most of the territory of Greater Yemen.

In the 20th century, Imam [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din]], King of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] (North Yemen) attempted to realize these aspirations but only managed to consolidate his control in [[Upper Yemen]], [[Lower Yemen]], [[Marib]], and Lower [[Tihamah]].  He expressed his claim to [[Aden]] and the [[Aden Protectorate]] in treaties, such as in the [[Italo-Yemeni Treaty]] of 1926. He was forced to acknowledge Saudi control over Asir and was unable to dislodge the [[British Empire|British]] from the Aden hinterland or [[Hadhramaut]]. British control of Aden was also challenged by his successor [[King of Yemen|King]] [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] who did not recognise British suzerainty in South Arabia and also had ambitions of creating a unified Greater Yemen.  In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, Yemen was involved in a series of border skirmishes along the disputed [[Violet Line (1914)|Violet Line]], a [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913|1913 Anglo-Ottoman demarcation]] that served to separate Yemen from the Aden Protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=faWMHiaaLgkC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=violet+Line+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BCwmtya0Hj&amp;sig=KXg3P6JPCffyWSALXFI5cf8cu9M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix-aPUj5zKAhWJlJQKHYmYDB4Q6AEIHjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=violet%20Line%201914&amp;f=false Ungoverned Territories: Understanding and Reducing Terrorism Risks]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Aden achieved independence from Britain in the 1960s, it united with North Yemen in 1990 to form the [[Republic of Yemen]], which saw the majority of Greater Yemen ruled as a single polity for the first time in nearly two centuries, but the [[Southern Movement]] has since 1994 sought the secession of [[south Yemen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1153">'''Gumbo soil''' is a mixture which often has some small amounts of [[sand]] and/or organic material, but is typically defined by the overwhelming presence of very fine particles of [[clay]] &lt;ref&gt;http://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/there-s-science-behind-sticky-gumbo-soil/article_8c6c31ef-2b94-5122-b52c-7113644c656c.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
 [[File:Commercial Soybeans Pushing Thru Missouri Gumbo.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'''Missouri Gumbo Soil w/Soybean Seedlings'''&lt;/center&gt;]]Although gumbo soils are exceptional at water retention, they can be difficult to farm, as precipitation will turn gumbo into a unique muddy fiasco that is challenging to work using large commercial farming equipment. Avoiding [[tillage]] of this type of soil, thru "no-till" farming, appears strongly correlated to higher yields versus more traditional tilling practices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dakotafarmer.com/story-drought-tested-till-9-131661&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bowack''' ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1737) was a British topographer, for many years a writing-master at [[Westminster School]].

In 1705-6, when living in Church Lane, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], he began to publish, in [[folio numbers]], 'The Antiquities of [[Middlesex]], being a collection of the several church monuments in that county; also an historical account of each church and parish, with the seats, villages, and names of the most eminent inhabitants.' Of this work two parts appeared, comprising the parishes of Chelsea, [[Kensington]], [[Fulham]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Chiswick]], and [[Acton, London|Acton]]. A third part was promised, which would have extended through [[Ealing]], [[New Brentford]], [[Isleworth]], and [[Hanwell]]; but from want of encouragement Bowack proceeded no further.

A specimen of his skill in [[ornamental handwriting]] is to be seen in [[Harleian MS]]. 1809, a thin [[vellum]] book, containing two neat drawings in Indian ink, and various kinds of English text and print hands, which was sent to [[Lord Oxford]] in December 1712, with a letter, wherein the author expresses the hope that his little work may find a place in his lordship's library. Bowack was appointed in July 1732 clerk to the commissioners of the turnpike roads, and in 1737 assistant-secretary to the [[Westminster Bridge]] commissioners, with a salary of £100 a year. The date of his death appears to be unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">'''Keenan Land''' was the name given to a mass of land in the [[Beaufort Sea]] about 300 miles north of [[Point Barrow]], Alaska. It was allegedly discovered in the 1870s by American whaler [[John Keenan (whaler)|John Keenan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mills |first=William James |title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=1-57607-422-6 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Keenan reported stranding his ship on an uncharted island, where he raised the American flag. After his return, the island was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Capt. John Keenan |url=http://explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/bl-keenan.htm |newspaper=The Troy Times |date=12 March 1910 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1907 with the [[Anglo-American Polar Expedition]], numerous unsuccessful attempts were made (by [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]] and [[Roald Amundsen]], among others) to relocate Keenan Land. [[Hubert Wilkins]] flew over the area in 1937 on his search for the missing [[Sigizmund Levanevsky]] and came to the conclusion that the land never existed.

This is a '''list of [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries by GDP''' in nominal values. Gross domestic product is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. The GDP dollar estimates presented here are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Values are given in millions of [[United States dollar|US dollars]]. Dependent territories are shown in italics and are not ranked, and their flags are shown alongside the country of which they are a territory.

The following lists show the latest figures for GDP and GDP per capita. Most figures are 2017 data from the [[International Monetary Fund]]; figures for dependent territories (both GDP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/dnltransfer.asp?fID=2|| title=GDP and its breakdown at current prices in US Dollars | publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] | date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/dnlList.asp|title=United Nations Statistics Division - National Accounts|website=unstats.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and GDP per capita&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/selbasicFast.asp National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, 2016], (Select all countries, "GDP, Per Capita GDP - US Dollars", and 2016 to generate table), [[United Nations Statistics Division]].

The '''Maragoli''', or '''Logoli''' (''Ava-Logooli''), are now the second-largest [[ethnic group]] of the 6 million-strong [[Luhya people|Luhya nation]] in Kenya, numbering around 2.1 million, or 15% of the Luhya people according to the last Kenyan [[census]]. [[Logoli language|Their language]] is called "Logoli", "Lulogooli", "Ululogooli", or "Maragoli". The name "Maragoli" probably emerged later on after interaction of the people with missionaries of the Quaker Church.

Maragoli also refers to the area that the descendants of a man called Mulogooli (also known as Maragoli) settled and occupied in the thirteenth century AD. Maragoli [[clan]]s include the Va-Gonda, Va-Mavi, Va-Sachi, Va-Saniaga, Va-Vulughi, Va-Ndega, Va-sari, Va-ng'ang'a, Va-Yonga. (The prefix ''Va-'' refers to people, and is sometimes written ''Ba-, Ava-,'' or ''Aba-''.)

==Origins==

=== Oral history ===

Maragoli history records a migration from [[North-East Africa]]. The story of the Maragoli people begins with a man called Mulogoli. He was descended from Kintu, who led the progenitors of the Luhya to their current area from an area they called [[Misri legend|Misri]], now known commonly as Northern [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]].

When the Luhya progenitors first arrived in what is now northern [[Kenya]], Southern [[Ethiopia]] and Southern [[Sudan]], the ruler of the Luhyas at the time was Kitanga. The [[Turkana people|Turkana]] people later came to occupy the area where the Luhya ancestors had settled, and called it Lok-Kitang meaning 'the place of Kitang.' (Lokitaung is a modern town in North-Western [[Kenya]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldmapnow.com/images/2009/11/LARGE-KENYA-MAP.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulogoli was born from the union of Andimi and Mwanzu. Andimi had three wives: Mwanzu the mother of Mulogoli; Amugovolie who had no children and Ndiegu the mother of Mwenje or Anyole (these are the Wanyore, who inhabit Vihiga district together with the Maragoli). Naturally the Nyores and Maragoli are one, they are from the same stock, the stock of Andimi. Mulogoli had a wife called Khaliyesa. She had four male children. These four make the four major clans. The children were: Musaali; Kizungu; Kilima and M'mavi.

In Maragoli, the word 'Abaluhya' or 'Avaluhya' is pronounced as A(b/v)a-roo-shia, ('b' and 'v' are interchangeable) which means, "the people of the North," "the people of the higher place," "the people from the North," or simply "Northerners."

Luhya ancestors moved further south, probably along the [[Turkwel]] river. The Turkwel's principal source is the Suam river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=B67C9EC59F3803D2783A5075ED21ED94.inst1_3b?docId=5000296814|title=Recently Added Articles - Questia Online Research Library|work=questia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhyas, a people who needed a constant source of water for their crops, animals and various industries like metalworking, and building, kept moving along the Suam River depending on various environmental or human triggers, into what is now Western [[Kenya]] and Eastern [[Uganda]], and settled near the source of that river, [[Mt. Elgon]].

They displaced a people akin to the [[Khoisan]] of Southern Africa{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and settled in their current homeland of what is now Western [[Kenya]]. Before the Maragoli split into the present-day [[Kisii people|Kisii]] or Gusii and Maragoli people, they lived in, and built what is now the stone-ruins of [[Thimlich Ohinga]] before the [[Luo peoples|Luo]] moved into the area, and settled.

==Culture==

Luhya culture is comparable to most Bantu cultural practices. Polygamy was a common practice in the past but today, it is only practised by a few people. However, the Avalogooli people were traditionally monogamous just like the patriarch Mulogooli. Marriage was especially significant for young men as they were not alloed to own property before marriage.

About 10 to 15 families traditionally made up a village, presided by a village headman - "Ligutu." Ligutu/Rigutu means 'The Hearer/Ear'  - as such a ''Ligutu'' can judge. Within a family, the man of the home was the ultimate authority, followed by his first-born son. In a polygamous family, the first wife held the most prestigious position among women.

The first-born son of the first wife was usually the main heir to his father, even if he happened to be younger than his half-brothers from his father's other wives. Daughters had no permanent position in Luhya families as they would eventually become other men's wives. They did not inherit property, and were excluded from decision-making meetings within the family. Today, women can inherit property and often make decisions on behalf of their families as per the judgement of Kenyan law and individual families.

Children are named after the clan's ancestors, or after their grandparents, or after events or the weather. The paternal grandparents take precedence, so that the first-born son will usually be named after his paternal grandfather (Guka/Guga), while the first-born daughter will be named after her paternal grandmother (Guku).

Subsequent children may be named after maternal grandparents or after significant events. Some Maragoli names usually have names whereas others do not. For instance, names like Injugu (born during groundnut harvesting), Kabwoni (born during sweet potato harvesting) and Anzala (born during extreme drought) have meanings. Other names like Afandi, Inziria, Mwachi, Aliviza and Asava have no known meaning. Names of events are also common. For example, Imbarambara (born during road construction), Msuruve (born when a white missionary called Miss Reeves first came to Maragoli land) and Sirinji (born when money was first introduced in the land).

Traditionally, Luhyas practised arranged marriage. The parents of a boy would approach the parents of a girl to ask for her hand in marriage. If the girl agreed, negotiations for [[dowry]] would begin. Typically, this would be 12 cattle and similar numbers of sheep or goats, to be paid by the groom's parents to the bride's family. Once the dowry was delivered, the girl was fetched by the groom's sisters to begin her new life as a wife.

Instances of eloping were and are still common. Young men would elope with willing girls, with negotiations for dowry to be conducted later. In such cases, the young man would also pay a fine to the parents of the girl. In rare cases abductions were normal but the young man had to pay a fine. As polygamy was allowed, a middle-aged man would typically have 2 to 3 wives.

When a man got very old and handed over the running of his homestead to his sons, the sons would sometimes find a young girl for the old man to marry. Such girls were normally those who could not find men to marry them, usually because they had children out of wedlock. Wife inheritance was and is also practised. A widow would normally be inherited by her husband's brother or cousin. Today, wife inheritance is uncommon to non-existent.

In some cases, the eldest son would also inherit his father's widows (though not his own mother). Modern day Luhyas do not practice some traditional customs as most have adopted the Christian way of life. Many Luhyas also live in urban towns and cities for most of their lives and only return to settle in the rural areas after retirement or the death of parents in the rural areas.

The Luhya had extensive customs surrounding death. There would be a great celebration at the home of the deceased, with mourning lasting up to forty days. If the deceased was a wealthy or influential man, a big tree would be uprooted and the deceased would be buried there, after the burial another tree, Mukumu would be planted (This was a sacred tree and is found along most Luhya migration paths it could only be planted by a righteous Lady mostly Virgin or a Very Old Lady).

Nowadays, mourning takes shorter periods of time (about one week) and the celebrations are held at the time of burial. ''Ovogogo'' and ''rovego'' are post burial ceremonies held to complete mourning rites.

Animal sacrifices were also traditionally practised. There was great fear of the "avaroji" ([[witch]]es) and "Babini" ([[Magician (paranormal)|wizards]]). These were "night-runners" who prowled in the nude running from one house to another casting spells.

Most modern day Luhyas are Christians and for some, (if not all), the word for God is [[Nyasaye]] or Nyasae.

The word Nyasae when translated into English roughly corresponds with ''Nya'' (of) and ''Asae/ Asaye/ Sae/ Saye/'' (God). The Luhya traditionally worshipped a god of the same name. When Christianity was first introduced among the Luhya in the early 1900s by various Christian missionaries from Europe and America, the Luhya took the name of their traditional god, Nyasae, forgot about their God, and gave that name to the God of Christianity, who, according to the Bible,is the father of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and whose son is Jesus Christ.

The first Luhyas who were converted into Christianity applied words that defined some aspects of the religious traditions that they were born into and gave them to Christ and the Christian god.

The Friends Church (Quakers), opened a mission at Kaimosi and the Church of God based in Anderson, Indiana took over the mission in [[Bunyore]]. During the same period the Catholic order Mill Hill Brothers came to the area of Mumias. The Church of God of Anderson, Indiana, USA, arrived in 1905 and began work at Kima in [[Bunyore]]. Other Christian groups such as the Anglicans (CMS) came in 1906. In 1924 the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada began their work in Nyan'gori. The Salvation Army came to Malakisi in 1936. The Baptists came to western Kenya in the early 1960s.

The first Bible translation in the Luhya language was produced by Nicholas Stamp in the Wanga dialect. Osundwa says he did this translation in Mumias, the former capital of the Wanga kingdom of Mumia. There has been a strong Christian witness among the Luhya in the twentieth century. A religious sect known as Dini ya Msambwa was founded by Elijah Masinde in 1948. They worship "Were," the god of Mt. Elgon, while at the same time using portions of the Bible to teach their converts. They also practice traditional arts termes witchcraft. This movement originally arose as part of an anti-colonial resistance.

Various sources estimate that Luhya are 75–90% professing Christians.&lt;ref name=Abeingo&gt;[http://www.abeingo.org Abeingo Community Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Luhya Initiation===

The Luhya, except for the Marama and Saamia, practised [[male circumcision]]. The Maragoli did not practice clitoridectomy.

Traditionally, circumcision was a period of training for adult responsibilities for the youth. Among the [[Kakamega]] Luhya, circumcision was carried out every four or five years, depending on the clan. This resulted in various age sets notably, Kolongolo, Kananachi, Kikwameti, Kinyikeu, Nyange, Maina, and Sawa in that order.

Like the Abanyala living in Navakholo do the initiation of their young boys every other year and notably an even year. The initiates were about 8 to 13 years old, and the ceremony was followed by a period of seclusion for the initiates. On their coming out of seclusion, there would be a feast in the village, followed by a period of counselling by a group of elders.

The newly initiated youths would then build bachelor-huts for each other,the huts were called "simba" or "esimba" where they would stay until they were old enough to become warriors. This kind of initiation is no longer practised among the Kakamega Luhya, except for the Tiriki. Nowadays, the initiates are usually circumcised in hospital due to health benefits, and there is no seclusion period. On healing, a party is held for the initiate – who then usually goes back to school to continue with his studies. Among the [[Bukusu people|Bukusu]], the [[Tachoni]] and (to a much lesser extent) the Nyala and the Kabras, the traditional methods of initiation persist. Circumcision is held every even year in August and December (the latter only among the Tachoni and the Kabras), and the initiates are typically 11 to 15 years Traditions have however changed with the dynamics of life, and currently, like most communuties in Kenya, boys are initiated at the time the parent feels appropriate for their children and is now usually done during infancy with symbolic rites of passage during their preteen years.

==Economic activities==
The Luhya are, traditionally, agriculturalists, and they grow different crops depending on the region where they live. Close to [[Lake Victoria]], the Saamia are mainly fishermen and traders, with their main agricultural activity being the raising of [[cassava]]. The [[Bukhusu]] and the Wanga are mainly cash crop farmers, raising [[sugar cane]] in [[Bungoma]] and [[Mumias]] areas respectively. The [[Bukhusu]] also farm wheat in the region around [[Kitale]]. The Isukha of [[Kakamega]] area and the Maragoli of Vihiga raise tea, while the rocky land of the Nyore is used to harvest stones and gravel for construction. In Bukura area, the Khisa are small scale and only subsistence maize farmers. They also rear cattle, sheep, goats and chicken on a small scale. The Kabras of Malava area raise mainly maize at subsistence levels, with a few also farming [[sugar cane]].

With the rapid modernisation of [[Kenya]], many young Luhya people have emigrated to [[Nairobi]] and other towns in search of work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6783">The name of the [[city]] of '''[[Buenos Aires]]''' ({{IPA-es|bwenoˈsaiɾes}}), the capital of [[Argentina]], means "Good Airs" or "Fair Winds" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. There are [[Buenos Aires (disambiguation)|other places]], mostly in the [[Americas]], that go by the same name.

==Sardinian origin==
When the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] conquered [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]] from the [[Pisa]]ns in 1324, they established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city. The hill was known to them as ''Buen Ayre'' (or "Bonaria" in [[Sardinian language]]), as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the Castle area), which is adjacent to [[swampland]]. "Foul smell" is another word for malaria ("mal aria" = bad air), since at that time people believed the air to cause the illness. Swamps are the breeding ground of Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors of malaria which had been plaguing Sardinia since the Phoencian first arrived, until the swamps were drained and treated with DDT in the 20th century. 

During the siege of Cagliari, the Aragonese built a sanctuary to the [[Virgin Mary]] on top of the hill. In 1335, King [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso the Gentle]] donated the church to the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarians]], who built an [[abbey]] that stands to this day. 

In the years after that, a story circulated, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The statue was placed in the abbey. Spanish sailors, especially [[Andalusia]]ns, venerated this image and frequently invoked the "Fair Winds" to aid them in their [[navigation]] and prevent [[shipwreck]]s. A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would be later erected in [[Seville]] [http://www.rotaryba.org.ar/reunion060202.htm].

In 1536, Spanish seaman [[Pedro de Mendoza]] established a fort and port in current-day [[San Telmo]] (about one kilometre south of the current Buenos Aires city centre) and called it ''Santa María del Buen Aire'' ("Our Lady of the Good Air"). The city name was chosen by the chaplain of Mendoza's expedition, a devotee of the Virgin of Buen Ayre. (Another version [http://www.genealogiadelujan.com.ar/CRONICAS/gribeo.html] says that one Leonardo Gribeo, who had witnessed the original miracle, was on Mendoza's crew.) The naming of Buenos Aires after the Sardinian virgin also suggested itself because Buenos Aires lies immediately beyond the southern limit of the South-American range of Anopheles species and was thus one of the first malaria-free ports for ships coming from the north.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C Mann (2011). 1493. Random House, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendoza’s settlement soon came under attack by indigenous peoples, and was abandoned in 1541. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who sailed down the [[Paraná River]] from [[Asunción]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). Garay preserved the name chosen by Mendoza, calling the city ''Ciudad de la Santísima Trinidad y Puerto de Nuestra Señora la Virgen María de los Buenos Aires'' ("City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Good Airs"). The short form "Buenos Aires" became the common usage during the 17th century.

==Demonyms==
The inhabitants of the city are called "porteños" ("people of the [[port]]") to acknowledge the centrality of the port of Buenos Aires in the development of the city and the nation.

Since [[federalization of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires's federalisation]] in 1880, the city proper includes the former towns of [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]] and [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]]; the resulting city was separated from [[Buenos Aires province]].

Residents of Buenos Aires province are called "bonaerenses".

Most of the population of [[Greater Buenos Aires]] lives in the [[suburb]]s, which are part of the province. Depending on context, they may be called ''bonaerenses'' or (more commonly) by the demonym of their town (e.g. ''quilmeño'' to refer to a person from [[Quilmes]]). Suburbanites may be sometimes referred to as "porteños" by those unfamiliar with the details.

==Formal and informal names==
In the [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|1994 constitution]], the city was given autonomy, hence its current formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires), sometimes abbreviated as CABA.

To differentiate the city from the province of the same name, it is common to refer to the city as Capital Federal ("Federal Capital"). This name was used extensively in road signs, for postal addresses, and in everyday speech (shortened to ''Capital'' or even ''la Capi''), but usage of that name has been in decline since 1994.

* The abbreviations ''Bs. As.'' and ''Baires'' are sometimes used, the first one mostly in writing and the second one in everyday speech. The abbreviation ''BUE'' gained currency since the 1990s (even though the [[IATA]] code for the [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|international airport]] is EZE).
* The city is sometimes called ''la Reina del Plata'' ("Queen of the Plata") in a nod to its being the largest city in the [[Río de la Plata]] [[estuary]].
* Some songs have given alternative names to Buenos Aires, such as [[Soda Stéreo]]'s ''la ciudad de la furia'' ("city of fury"). The oft-used expression ''mi Buenos Aires querido'' ("my beloved Buenos Aires") is the name of both [[Mi Buenos Aires querido (song)|a song]] popularized by [[tango music|tango]] singer [[Carlos Gardel]] and [[Mi Buenos Aires querido (1936 film)|an eponymous movie]].
* Because of its European influence, the city is sometimes referred to as "The Paris of the South".
* Sometimes, the importance of Buenos Aires is perceived as casting a heavy shadow over the rest of the country and slowing back its development. This caused writer [[Ezequiel Martínez Estrada]] to refer to the city as ''la cabeza de Goliat'' ("[[Goliath]]'s head").
* A popular expression says that "Dios es argentino, pero atiende en Buenos Aires" ("[[God]] is Argentine but he serves in Buenos Aires"), referring to the political centralism that the city represents.

The '''Ouled Naïl Range''' ({{lang-ar|سلسلة جبال أولاد نايل}}, {{lang-fr|Monts des Ouled Naïl}}) is a [[mountain range]] in [[Algeria]], part of the [[Saharan Atlas]] of the greater [[Atlas Mountain System]]. The range is named after a confederation of [[nomadic]] and semi-nomadic tribes, all of which claim to hail from [[Arab]] ancestors that arrived in the mountains in the eleventh century.

==Geography==
The Ouled Naïl mountain range is formed by parallel ridges rising between the level 850 m high terrain of the [[Hodna]] region of the ''[[Hautes Plaines]]'' in the north and the 600 m of the southern plain of the ''Dayas''.  
It is located in the eastern zone of the Saharan Atlas, with the [[Amour Range]] in the western and the [[Zab Range]] at the eastern end.

The range is formed by mountains created by [[Fold (geology)|folds]] of the early [[Tertiary]] which remained relatively undisturbed after formation but have been heavily eroded. Their altitude is relatively moderate, the highest point of the range, Djebel Lazrag (جبل الأزرق), not even reaching 1,500 m. However, towards the south the look of the highest ridges is quite spectacular, with jagged [[sandstone]] or [[limestone]] outcrops and almost vertical walls. The part facing the Sahara has a less encumbered terrain with smooth mountaintops separated by [[water gap]]s.&lt;ref name="Sah"&gt;[http://alger-roi.fr/Alger/titteri/textes/6_titteri_atlas_saharien.htm Géographie de l'Afrique du Nord - L'Atlas Saharien]&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is dry in all the surrounding areas, but the rainfall is slightly better on the mountains. Therefore, cereal cultivation is possible in the heights, although with rather irregular results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/geo_0003-4010_1960_num_69_373_14605 Étude de la situation météorologique au Sahara en janvier 1958]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Date palm]]s are mostly absent throughout the range owing to the prevailing cold temperatures. They only grow in the few places at the feet of the Ouled Naïl mountains that are at an altitude below 600 m, such as near Bou Saada and the Oued Djedi.&lt;ref name="Sah"/&gt;

==Human presence==
{{see also|Ouled Naïl|Rock art of the Djelfa region}}

Two important towns are located in the immediate area of the range, [[Bou-Saada]] to the north at the feet of the mountains and [[Djelfa]] in the middle of the range at an elevation of 1,208 m. North of Djelfa town there is an imposing physical feature known as ''[[Rocher de Sel]]'' (English: Salt Rock) that was formed from the erosion of [[rock salt]]s and [[marl]]s by rain.&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=321|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the west of the town [[Megalithic]] funerary structures are found. [[Neolithic art]] is widespread in different caves and walls throughout the range.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lhote, F. de Villaret, ''Les gravures rupestres de l'Atlas saharien: monts des Ouled-Nail et région de Djelfa''. 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The range is well known for the [[Ouled Naïl]] people living in its cold highlands. Djelfa is an important market centre for the Ouled Naïl who live in black-and-red striped tents and claim ancient Arab descent. These semi-nomadic or nomadic people have traditionally reared cattle in the mountain grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algeria.com/blog/a-different-perspective-of-algeria A Different Perspective of Algeria]&lt;/ref&gt; The years of drought and years with prolonged, cold winters are hard times for the Ouled Nail; in 1944 and 1947 about 50% of their livestock died.&lt;ref name="Sah"/&gt;

== History ==
Jim Leniart is the owner and creator of Red Maps.  He began his career in commercial real estate drawing maps for clients.  Jim's decision to become a full-time [[cartographer]] led to the creation of Red Maps, which he founded in 1998.  Beginning with a shopping guide to [[SoHo]], by June 2000, two additional New York guides for [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and all of [[Manhattan]], as well as maps to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington DC and Las Vegas were completed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Tien|first=Ellen|title=PULSE; If It's Red, It Means 'Go'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/style/pulse-if-it-s-red-it-means-go.html|work=The New York Times|date=11 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2001, Red Maps was named one of the Best Map Guides for San Francisco by [[Travel + Leisure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glusac|first=Elaine|title=The Best Map Guides|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/unfolding-the-latest-map-guides|work=Travel + Leisure|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2012, more than 20 Red Maps have been created.

== Cities ==
Among the 20 cities that Red Maps publishes its guides for are: Chicago, Miami, London, Paris, Barcelona, Rome and Milan. The New Yorker set lays out detailed block by block shopping guides and restaurants of SoHo, [[Nolita]], [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], [[Meatpacking District]], [[Greenwich Village]], Midtown, [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Eric|title=Downtown Comes Uptown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/fashion/on-madison-avenue-a-new-vibe.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;smid=fb-share&amp;adxnnlx=1347053878-VrUCqE7Qeqij94EmnUQwlQ|work=The New York Times|date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ron Horvath, geographer, 2013.jpg|thumbnail|150px| right|Ron Horvath, 2013]]
Ron (Ronald J.) Horvath (born 1937) has made contributions to the study of colonialism, African development, and urban geography of Sydney, Los Angeles, Detroit and Addis Ababa.

==Background==
Horvath was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and educated at California State University, Long Beach (B.A., 1960) and UCLA (MA 1961, PhD 1966). While working on his PhD on "Around Addis Ababa, a geographical study of the impact of a city on its surroundings"  he taught at [[Addis Ababa University|Haile Selassie I University]] in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (1963-5). He was an Assistant Professor at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]] 1965-1967, [[Michigan State University]],1967-1972 during which time he participated in the foundation with [[William Bunge]] of the Detroit Geographical Expedition and Institute.  He was visiting COMGA professor at North Carolina Central University in 1969 and visiting professor at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver BC, 1974-1976 before migrating to Australia in 1976. He taught geography at the School of Geosciences at the [[University of Sydney]] from 1976–1996 before retiring as Senior Lecturer.

Since 2011, he has worked with the [http://www.sydneyalliance.org.au/ Sydney Alliance], which is dedicated building community and promoting social justice in the Sydney metropolitan region.

He married Barbara (Horvath), formerly an Associate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Sydney.

==Contributions==
Horvath acquired a range of skills in urban studies and agricultural geography during graduate study and fieldwork in Africa. On returning to the US and publishing in these areas he was soon involved in support for political change and Civil Rights, and until the early 1970s applied himself to questions of colonialism, race, and poverty in American society. A number of key publications resulted. His participation in [[William Bunge]]'s&lt;ref&gt;http://indiemaps.com/blog/2010/03/wild-bill-bunge/&lt;/ref&gt; and Gwendolen Warren's Detroit Geographical Expedition&lt;ref&gt;http://civic.mit.edu/blog/kanarinka/the-detroit-geographic-expedition-and-institute-a-case-study-in-civic-mapping&lt;/ref&gt; placed him at the centre of radical, and controversial application of geographical teaching and knowledge in the inner city, activities that were disruptive to academic norms.

An early statement of his interest in transport geography and automobiles came in 1974,  "If geographers are to participate more fully in planning and monitoring future technological growth, explicit recognition of the spatial dimensions of technological change will be necessary. Machine space, or territory devoted primarily to the use of machines, shall be so designated when machines have priority over people in the use of territory. Automobile territory in modern American cities exemplifies the concept of machine space." (Horvath 1974: 167-168).

'''{{nihongo|''Sōya''|宗谷|}}''' is a [[Japan]]ese icebreaker that serves as a [[museum ship]] in Tokyo after a long and storied service spanning some of the 20th century's historic events. It is named for [[Sōya Subprefecture]] in Hokkaido.

==Construction==
The vessel was built as ''Volochaevets'', commissioned by the Soviets in 1936 from the Matsuo shipyard, on Nagaskai's Koyagi Island, as part-payment for Japan's construction of the [[South Manchuria Railway]] (also known as the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]). Two other ice-strengthened cargo ships were ordered at the same time, ''Bolshevik'' and ''Komsomolets''. All three were built but, owing to the worsening state of Japan-Soviet relations by that time, the ships were never delivered. ''Volochaevets'' was launched from the now renamed Kawaminami Shipyard in February 1938. She was completed as an ice-breaking cargo freighter for the Tatsunan Kisen Co. and was renamed ''Chiryō Maru''. ''Bolshevik'' and ''Komsomolets'' were renamed ''Minryo Maru'' and ''Tenryo Maru''.&lt;ref name=mus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funenokagakukan.or.jp/index_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126180845/http://www.funenokagakukan.or.jp/index_e.html |archivedate=26 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comb" /&gt;

==War role==
In November 1939 the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] requisitioned ''Chiryo Maru'' for national service. In February 1940 she was renamed ''Sōya'', a name previously held by the former [[Russian cruiser Varyag (1899)|''Varyag'']], an armoured cruiser seized from Imperial Russia but which Japan returned in 1916. The icebreaker ''Sōya'' was assigned duties as an auxiliary ammunition supply and survey vessel. She survived the Second World War, albeit with multiple close calls. In January 1943 ''Sōya'' was attacked by {{USS|Greenling|SS-213|6}}. The torpedoes either missed or proved to be duds: ''Sōya''{{'}}s crew hoisted one undetonated torpedo onto the deck in celebration. In February 1944 aircraft from [[Fast Carrier Task Force|TF58]] attacked the Japanese anchorage at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], sinking 41 Japanese vessels. ''Sōya'' escaped but ran aground as she did so. Ten crewmembers were killed.&lt;ref name="comb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/Soya_t.htm |title=IJN ''Soya'': Tabular Record of Movement |accessdate=2009-02-13 |last=Hackett |first=Bob |author2=Kingsepp, Sander |author3=Cundall, Peter |year=2007 |publisher=combinedfleet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 1945 the submarine {{USS|Parche|SS-384|6}} attacked a convoy escorting ''Sōya'' and other transport ships from Yokohama to Hakodate, sinking an escort vessel and disabling one transport ship. On 9 August 1945 ''Sōya'' was at anchor in [[Onagawa, Miyagi|Onagawa Bay]] as part of a flotilla with other vessels when British bombers attacked from the air, sinking at least two of them.&lt;ref name="comb" /&gt;

==Post-war==
After the war, with Japan in defeat and needing to repatriate millions of individuals from its former colonies, ''Sōya'' was removed from the navy list and was assigned duties with the nation's repatriation fleet. Modifications at this time included removal of her guns and the installation of facilities for passengers such as toilets in what had been her large forward and aft cargo holds. Spacious wooden accommodation was also built on deck. She undertook numerous missions embarking troops and passengers, including calls at Shanghai, Tinian and Guam. In light of her ice-breaking ability, she was also assigned northerly missions and by 1948 had made 14 voyages to and from [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin (the former Karafuto)]], evacuating citizens by agreement with the new authorities from what had become part of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Soya, Historic Ships Study Guide #3, published by Museum of Maritime Science, Tokyo, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

(''Sōya'' should not be confused during this period with ''Soya Maru'', one of three ice-strengthened passenger ferries that operated on the Japan National Railways maritime Chihaku Line between Odomari, the present-day [[Korsakov (town)|Korsakov]] in Sakhalin, and [[Wakkanai]] in [[Hokkaido]] from 1923 to August 1945.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://kam-r.sub.jp/ainu/chihaku.html 稚泊連絡船史] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, her repatriation duties ceased and ''Sōya'' was transferred to the Maritime Safety Agency, the precursor to the [[Japan Coast Guard]]. In a new role supplying remote lighthouses she is reputed to have become known in some circles as the 'Santa Claus of the Sea'.&lt;ref name=comb/&gt;

==Antarctic research vessel==
[[File:Soya course to Antarctica.svg|thumb|right|''Sōya''{{'}}s voyage to Antarctica]]

In 1950 the ship received a comprehensive refit in preparation for service as Japan's first dedicated Antarctic research ship. In 1956 further modifications included the replacement of her steam engine with twin diesel engines and the installation of a helicopter deck with the ability to store light helicopters for voyage. In 1957 her forward gunwale was built up and 1958 a further refit added a second, larger helicopter deck above the earlier one, which became a vast new storage space. Between 1956 and 1962 ''Sōya'' undertook missions to the Antarctic.  Her second voyage, in 1958, made headlines worldwide when she rescued personnel stranded at the [[Showa Station (Antarctica)|Showa]] research station in the face of approaching winter. The evacuation did not extend to the mission's dogs, and 15 [[Sakhalin Husky|Karafuto-Ken]] huskies were abandoned to fend for themselves on the ice. The following spring the ship returned to find two dogs still alive. The mutts, named Taro and Jiro, became bywords in Japan for fortitude. The story travelled worldwide thanks in part to two movies: ''[[Nankyoku Monogatari]]'' (lit. "South Pole Story"; released in the U.S. as ''Antarctica'') and a treatment by Disney in the Hollywood film ''[[Eight Below]]''.&lt;ref name=comb/&gt; ''Sōya'' herself experienced hardship during her time in the Antarctic, including becoming stuck in the ice and needing assistance from the nearby Russian icebreaker ''Ob''.&lt;ref&gt;Information from a video display at the Funenokagakukan museum in Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Icebreaking rescue vessel==
When retired from Antarctic duties, ''Sōya'' became an ice-breaking rescue ship for Japan's [[Maritime Safety Agency]]. ''Sōya'' was based during this period in [[Hokkaido]].&lt;ref name="comb" /&gt;

==Museum ship==
''Sōya'' was fully decommissioned in 1978. Her last mission was a farewell tour to communities she had served, including the port of Hakodate, and photographs exist from this period of well-wishers swarming the ship before her departure. In 1979 ''Sōya'' was moored alongside at the [[Museum of Maritime Science]], [[Tokyo]], and remains open to the public as a [[museum ship]], open daily and generally closed only when typhoons threaten Tokyo. She remains in largely original condition. Her propellers have been removed and placed on deck but her interior is largely intact from Antarctic exploration days. However, as a result of modifications made in the 1950s her superstructure has changed considerably from her appearance during World War II. Gone are the tall funnel and aft crane assembly, while the addition of a helicopter landing deck and higher forward gunwales give her a beefier appearance than the cargo ship she started out as.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;&lt;ref name=comb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funenokagakukan.or.jp/sc_01_en/soya_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130045300/http://www.funenokagakukan.or.jp/sc_01_en/soya_en.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3986">A '''TOID''' ([[topography|'''TO'''pographic]] [[identifier|'''ID'''entifier]], pronounced ''toyed'') is a unique reference identifier assigned by the [[Ordnance Survey]] to identify every feature in [[Great Britain]].  The identifier consists of two parts, a prefix ‘osgb’ and a unique identifier that is 13-16 digits long.  In [[Geography Markup Language|GML]] 2, a TOID is encoded as a gml:fid (Feature Identifier); in GML 3 as a gml:id.

Around 440 million man-made and natural features have been thus identified: [[building]]s, [[road]]s, fields, [[phone box]]es, [[pillar box]]es, [[landmark]]s and many other types. The identification system is designed to be used in [[Geographic information system|GIS]], digital [[cartography]] and in any customized computer application, including non-cartographic ones, where information about fixed, real-world features needs to be managed. Using consistent identifiers (IDs) makes it much easier to share data between various kinds of applications and systems. A TOID remains constant throughout the lifetime of the real-world feature it identifies, and is guaranteed not to be reassigned to anything else when the feature no longer exists.

Example: the TOID for the [[Tower of London]] is osgb1000006032892.

==TOIDs in OS MasterMap==
[[OS MasterMap]], Ordnance Survey's master database, depends on TOIDs. Every feature is identified by a TOID in MasterMap. Other attributes of the feature are defined by relating them, via [[geography Markup Language|GML]], to the TOID. Users of OS MasterMap relate their own data to TOIDs of items of interest to them.  Unlike with a custom designed GIS, one organization can share data with another organization easily since TOIDs are maintained centrally by Ordnance Survey, and are free to reuse.

==TOID revision history==
If the data for a feature is edited, for example to reflect a real-life change or to correct an error, then the changes are referenced by TOID. Unless the feature has undergone drastic change, the feature keeps its original TOID, enabling one to track changes to a feature over time if one has access to the historic data.

==Granularity of TOIDs==
Every object in OS MasterMap has its own TOID, including features representing buildings, roads, addresses, and cartographic text.  Complex entities such as [[Southampton Central railway station]], are defined in terms of multiple TOIDs: one for the main building, several others for the platforms, and another for the pedestrian bridge over the tracks. The OS MasterMap Sites Layer has a single TOID for these 'sites'. Similarly, users can create their own "supertoid" that unites features into one entity. This also acknowledges that defining the boundaries of vaguely defined folk objects is subjective: should the station car-park be defined as part of the station, for example? The TOID scheme leaves such decisions to its users, that is, those building information systems for end-users.

==Intellectual Property==
In keeping with recent [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/ Open Data] initiatives, Ordnance Survey has stated its [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/about/governance/policies/index.html policy on royalty free use of the TOID] with the aim of allowing easier integration of data using its [[spatial database]]: a core part of its vision of a [https://web.archive.org/web/20051229122438/http://www.dnf.org/ Digital National Framework].

"TOID" is a [[registered trademark]] of Ordnance Survey.

'''The Mountain Institute''' (TMI) is an international non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the world's mountains by conserving mountain ecosystems and empowering the people in mountain communities. The Mountain Institute is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] and operates regional field offices in the [[Andes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountain.pe/ Instituto de Montaña |title=Instituto de Montana |year=2013 |publisher=Instituto de Montana |accessdate =29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Appalachians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mountain.org/appalachian |title=Appalachian Program |year=2010 |publisher=The Mountain Institute |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mountain.org/appalachian |title=Himalayan Program |year=2010 |publisher=The Mountain Institute |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respectively, these are the longest, the oldest, and the tallest mountain ranges in the world.

== History ==
The Mountain Institute was founded in 1972 as the Woodlands &amp; Whitewater Institute in [[Cherry Grove, West Virginia]] by [[Daniel C. Taylor]] and King Seegar. The organization's goal was to facilitate children sharing activities with their parents, experiencing adventure together, and developing relationships that would support and guide them through adolescence.  Woodlands was designed as a "family equivalent to [[Outward Bound]] and [[National Outdoor Leadership School]]" with courses that brought together fathers and sons and fathers and daughters for rock climbing, caving, backpacking, fly fishing, photography, falconry, and survival skills. These outings were based out of the Spruce Knob Mountain Center, a 400-acre tract of land abutting the [[Monongahela National Forest]] on the west side of [[Spruce Mountain (West Virginia)|Spruce Mountain]] in [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="ewv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1442 |last=Arnold |first=Amy Donaldson |title=Mountain Institute |encyclopedia=The West Virginia Encyclopedia |year=2013 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, TMI's work expanded to experiential and leadership education for youth. The [[Baltimore Friends School]], of which TMI's founders are alumni, was the first school course. [[St. Paul's School for Girls]] came next, and the founders were soon working with a number of schools in the [[Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[New York City]] areas. These school courses quickly became TMI's niche in the experiential education world and remain so today.

TMI became an international organization in 1987, when it assisted in the establishment of [[Makalu Barun National Park]] in Nepal and the adjacent [[Qomolangma National Nature Preserve]] in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China.&lt;ref name="makalu"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00150641 |last=Taylor-Ide |first=Daniel |author2=Alton C. Byers III |author3=J. Gabriel Campbell |year=1992 |journal=GeoJournal |title=Mountains, Nations, Parks, and Conservation |pages=105–112 |volume=27 |issue=1 |accessdate=21 October 2014 |doi=10.1007/bf00150641}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the organization changed its name to "Woodlands Mountain Institute" to reflect its broad work in the world's mountain ranges. "Woodlands" was later dropped.

== Andes ==
The Andes program began in 1996, as large scale mining and hydroelectric projects and a sharp increase in tourism coincided with a rapid decline in traditional means of livelihood within local communities. The resulting conflict between development and traditional cultures not only  exacerbated the economic challenges faced by local populations, it also accelerated deterioration of local mountain ecosystems.
 
To address these issues, TMI developed comprehensive community-based projects to demonstrate the potential for diversifying local methods of subsistence through community-based tourism and protection of biodiversity hotspots. The program has grown in the past 15 years and Instituto de Montaña is now recognized as one of the leading NGOs in Peru.

== Appalachians ==
The Appalachian Program focuses on developing an understanding and appreciation for the complex interaction between community, culture, and conservation through education and sustainable community initiatives.

The Mountain Institute has been involved in a variety of conservation and community programs in the Himalayas since 1987.

Among these programs is the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) program, in which TMI works with farmers in the [[Sacred Himalayan Landscape]] by teaching them to cultivate medical plants, having trained over 12,500 since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Conserving the Sacred Himalayan Landscape: One Seed at a Time |institution=The Mountain Institute |year=2011 |url=http://www.mountain.org/sites/default/files/attachments/tmi_reportfinal_05dec11.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922153052/http://mountain.org/sites/default/files/attachments/tmi_reportfinal_05dec11.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 September 2012 |accessdate=21 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''weather hole''' is a location that receives calmer [[weather]] than the surrounding area. It is an area [[thunderstorm]]s often miss, or near which approaching [[storm]]s often dissipate.

==Details==
A 2005 study entitled "Do Meteorologists Suppress Thunderstorms?: [[Radar]]-Derived Statistics and the Behavior of Moist [[Convection]]" examined 28 target cities and random [[Scientific control|control]] points in the U.S. They were compared to their surroundings in order to determine whether these target points were [[weather]] holes or the opposite, hot spots. A determination was made by measuring and comparing the convective [[echo]]es of the target points with the surrounding area. Only one target was classified as a weather hole, and one was classified as a hot spot. Most selected targets experienced convective echoes as often as their surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-86-3-341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the a study's authors, the "results suggest that [[Meteorology|meteorologists]] are unnecessarily cranky about the frequency of storms in their hometowns."&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-86-3-341&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks, ND]] is a weather hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collin|first=Ben|title=Radar Proof of the Grand Forks Weather Hole.|url=http://www.bencollin.com/radar-proof-of-the-grand-forks-weather-hole/|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Map at Lake Klejtrup''' ({{lang-da|Verdenskortet ved Klejtrup Sø}}) is a miniature [[world map]] built of stones and grass in [[Klejtrup Sø]] near the village of [[Klejtrup]], [[Viborg Municipality]], [[Denmark]].

In 1943, Søren Poulsen, a local farmer, was working on the drainage of the surrounding meadows when he found a stone shaped like the [[Jutland]] peninsula.  This inspired him to create a small world of his own.&lt;ref name=amazing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2015/11/the-world-map-at-lake-klejtrup.html |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup  |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=November 21, 2015 |format= |work=Amusing Planet }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter months, with the use of primitive tools, he placed big stones carefully on the ice.  When spring arrived, the stones could easily be tilted into place, and in this way the World Map took shape. Some of the stones used weighted more than 2 tonnes.&lt;ref name=ripley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripleys.com/blog/world-map/ |title=Man Builds Entire World Map in His Back Yard |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=December 2, 2015 |format= |work=Ripley's Believe it or Not |publisher=Ripley Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poulsen created the World Map between 1944 and 1969.  It measures 45 by 90 metres (49 by 98 yards), covering an area of over 4000 square meters (1 acre).&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/a-very-danish-map-of-the-world |title=A Very Danish Map of the World |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |last=Jacobs |first=Frank |work=Big Think |publisher=The Big Think Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One 111-kilometre (69 mi) [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] corresponds to 27 centimetres (11 [[inch|inches]]) on the map.&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; On Poulsen's map, [[Antarctica]] is not present and the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is marked in two places, ensuring a better impression of the correct distances between the countries to avoid the difficulties of spreading out our planet's globular shape.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; Red poles mark the [[equator]], and each country is represented by miniature flags, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/02/priority-world-map-lake-klejtrup-danish-farmer-spent-last-25-years-life-built-version-world/ |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup: A Danish farmer spent the last 25 years of his life building his own miniature version of the world |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |publisher=The Vintage News }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=ripley /&gt; which are updated yearly.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; State borders in the [[United States of America]] are marked with yellow bricks; Poulsen lived 20 years in America.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt;

The map is the epicenter of a park, which has, among other attractions, a [[picnic]] area, a coffee shop and a playground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitviborg.com/ln-int/verdenskortet-ved-klejtrup-so-gdk601190 |title=Verdenskortet ved Klejtrup Sø  |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |work=Visit Viborg }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The World Map is an important attraction in the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/verdenskortet |title=Verdenskortet |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |publisher=Atlas Obscura }}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracts about 40,000 visitors per year, most of them Danish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/74993761/Markedsf_ringsstrategi_for_Verdenskortet_v_Klejtrup_S_.pdf |title=Markedsføringsstrategi for Verdenskortet v/Klejtrup sø |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |last=Olsen |first=Sara Janner |date=May 2014 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Aarhus University]] |location=[[Aarhus]] |language=Danish }}&lt;/ref&gt;
