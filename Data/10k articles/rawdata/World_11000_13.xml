      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">The '''Afghan Women's Council (AWC)''' (also known as the ''Women's Council'') was an [[organization]] under the ''Democratic Republic of Afghanistan'' (1978-87) and the [[Republic of Afghanistan]] between (1987-1992). Until 1989 the leader of the organization was [[Masuma Esmati-Wardak]], Wardak was not a member of the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) and in 1991 she became Minister of Education.&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Ann Tétreault |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X95R043HBJwC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=Afghan+Women%27s+Council&amp;lr=&amp;hl=no |title=Women and revolution in Africa, Asia, and the New World |publisher=''Google Books'' | accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization was run by Wardak and a staff of eight women. Some of these staff members were also members of the PDPA. When the [[communist regime]] in 1978 under [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] the government gave equal rights to women. Women now had the ability to choose their [[husband]]s, [[education]]-- they had the ability to make decisions about their own lives.&lt;ref name="womencouncil"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lawrence Kaplan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBVCgetqZAAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=DRA+Afghan+Minister+of&amp;lr=&amp;hl=no#PPA144,M1 |title=Fundamentalism in comparative perspective |publisher=''Google Books'' | accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership of the AWC was around 150,000 around the country and had branches and bases in all Afghan [[province]]s with the exception of [[Wardak Province|Wardak]] and [[Katawaz]]. Most of the women in [[Kabul]] resisted the [[Mujahideen]] because of their retrogressive laws concerning women.&lt;ref name="education"/&gt;

The AWC provided [[social service]]s to women in [[Afghanistan]], in the fight against [[illiteracy]] and [[vocational training]] for those in the [[Secretary]], [[hairdressing]] and [[workshop]] fields. Many feared the sacrificing of the AWC in the [[national reconciliation]] talks which started in 1987.&lt;ref name="womencouncil"/&gt;

One of the post important AWC programmes was their fight for the [[literacy]] and [[education]] of girls. According to AWC survey in 1991 estimated around 7 thousand women were in the institution of [[higher education]] and around 230,000 girls studying in [[school]]s around Afghanistan. According to the survey there existed around 190 female [[professors]] and 22,000 female [[teacher]]s in the country.&lt;ref name="womencouncil"/&gt;

The '''Assizes of Jerusalem''' are a collection of numerous medieval legal treatises written in [[Old French]] containing the law of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]. They were compiled in the thirteenth century, and are the largest collection of surviving medieval laws.

==History==

As [[Peter Edbury]] says: "one group of sources from the Latin East that have long excited the attention of scholars are the [[legal treatise]]s often known collectively, if somewhat misleadingly, as the '''Assises of Jerusalem'''." (Peter W. Edbury, ''John of Ibelin and the Kingdom of Jerusalem'', pref.)

The [[assize]]s, or ''assises'' in [[French language|French]], survive in written form only from the 13th century, at least a generation after the collapse of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The earliest laws of the Kingdom were promulgated at the [[Council of Nablus]] in 1120, but these laws seem to have fallen out of use and were replaced by the assizes by the 13th century and presumably even earlier.

Although no laws or court cases survive from the height of the kingdom in the 12th century, the kingdom obviously had laws and a well-developed legal structure. By the 13th century, the development of this structure was lost to memory, but jurists such as Philip and John recounted the legends that had grown up about the early kingdom. According to them, both the Haute Cour and the burgess court were established in 1099 by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who set himself up as judge of the high court. The laws of both were said to have been written down from the very beginning in 1099, and were simply lost when Jerusalem was captured by [[Saladin]] in 1187. These laws were kept in a chest in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and were thus known in [[Old French language|Old French]] as the "''Letres dou Sepulcre''." The chest supposedly could have only been opened by the king, the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], and the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|viscount of Jerusalem]]. Each law, according to Philip, was written on one page, beginning with a large initial [[manuscript illumination|illuminated in gold]], and with a [[rubric]] written in red ink. Philip claimed to have obtained his information from an old knight and jurist named [[Ralph of Tiberias]], and John in turn probably got his information from Philip. Whether or not these legends were true (Edbury, for one, believes they were not), the 13th century jurists envisioned the legal structure of the kingdom to have existed continuously from the original conquest.

Some of the treatises are said to represent Western feudal law, as interpreted by baronial jurists to weaken royal power, but later scholarship argues that the works present an idealized legal model rather than proof of an existing feudal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Kazkhdan |editor-first=Alexander P. |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium | title=Jerusalem, Assizes of |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=9780195046526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Bkork |editor-first=Robert E. |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages | title=Jerusalem, Assizes of (Livres des assises de Jérusalem) |year=2010|publisher=Oxford |isbn=9780198662624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==

The surviving collections of laws are:

*The ''Livre au Roi''.  This is the earliest surviving text, dating from approximately 1200.  It was written for [[Amalric II of Jerusalem]] (the "Roi" of the title) and has a decidedly royalist slant. It is the only text preserving the ''établissement'' of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|King Baldwin II]], which allowed the king to disinherit his [[vassal]]s, bypassing the normal judgement of the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]. Otherwise its contents are very similar to the other authors.
*Le Livre de Forme de Plait. Philip of Novara's legal treatise, written from a more [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] viewpoint, was written in the 1250s. He also wrote a history of the conflict between the [[House of Ibelin|Ibelins]] (his patrons) and the [[Hohenstaufen]]s on [[Cyprus]] and in [[Akko|Acre]]. 
*[[John of Ibelin (jurist)|John of Ibelin]]. John, [[count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] and regent of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in Acre, was a participant in the struggle that Philip recorded elsewhere. From 1264 to 1266 he wrote the longest legal treatise from the Latin East, and indeed from anywhere in medieval Europe. 
*Geoffrey La Tor or Geoffrey le Tort, and James of Ibelin, John's son, independently wrote very small treatises, much less important than the larger works of Philip and John.
*The ''Livre des Assises de la Cour des Bourgeois''. This is a lengthy work detailing the assizes the lower court of the kingdom, the burgess court, established for the non-noble class. Their author is anonymous, but they were also written in the mid-13th century. According to [[Joshua Prawer]] they derive from ''Lo Codi'', a [[Provence|Provençal]] law code itself based on [[Roman law]].

Also important on its own, although found in the ''Livre au Roi'', Philip, and John, is the ''[[Assise sur la ligece]]'', a law promulgated by [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] in the 1170s, which effectively made every lord in the kingdom a direct vassal of the king and gave equal voting rights to [[vavasour|rear-vassals]] as much as the greater barons.

==Modern editions==

All of these works were edited in the mid- to late-19th century by [[Auguste Arthur, comte de Beugnot]], and published in the ''[[Recueil des Historiens des Croisades]]'' by the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]], in two volumes designated "''Lois''." Also included in the RHC are the 13th- and 14th-century ordinances of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]]; a document concerning succession and regency, written by (or attributed to) [[John of Brienne]], [[king of Jerusalem]]; and a document concerning military service, written by (or attributed to) [[Hugh III of Cyprus]]. There are also a number of [[charter]]s, although a far more complete collection of charters was collected in the late 19th and early 20th century by [[Reinhold Röhricht]].

In the judgement of all later editors, from Maurice Grandclaude in the early 20th century to Edbury today, Beugnot was a very poor editor; fortunately, some, but not all, of these works have been edited separately. A French critical edition of the ''Livre au Roi'' was published by Myriam Greilshammer in 1995, and in 2003 Edbury published a critical edition of John of Ibelin's text. No new edition of the Old French assizes of the burgess court has been published since Beugnot's publication in 1843, but in the 15th century they were translated into [[Greek language|Greek]], and from the Greek manuscripts an English translation has recently been made by Nicholas Coureas.

Modern historians generally recognize the dangers in attributing 13th-century laws to the 12th-century kingdom, although earlier it was believed that these assizes represented the purest form of [[medieval]] European [[feudalism]]. In reality the laws probably reflect the practise of neither the 12th or the 13th century, as they were written from scratch in the 13th and were consciously designed to harken back to the less-troubled days of the 12th century, despite the important legal changes that had occurred in the meantime ([[trial by ordeal]], for example, was outlawed in the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] of 1215).

As mentioned above, it is somewhat misleading to call all of these texts the "Assizes of Jerusalem" as if they were written together at the same time; they often contradict one another or omit information that another text has. Together, however, they are the largest collection of laws written in a medieval European state for this period.

==Background==
The [[Soviet Union]] had established [[diplomatic relations]] with Bolivia on April 18, 1945.

==Current==

With Bolivia the focus on relations with Russia is mainly economic, as opposed to political and strategic, as an agreement to invest in Bolivia's [[natural gas]] fields shows. It is seen to "help Latin America...[as it] expands Latin America's economic opportunities, diversifies its relationships...that's healthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-11-14-voa17.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-15 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209050529/http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-11-14-voa17.cfm |archive-date=2012-12-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 [[Gazprom]], the Russian energy company of which the state holds a controlling stake, signed an agreement worth US$4.5 billion to explore for gas in Bolivia. In December 2008, Russia invested US$4 million in a study on the Bolivian gas industry, with hopes of opening a joint Russian-Bolivian center on gas exploration sometime in 2009.&lt;ref name="efe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Bolivia/proyecta/comprar/armamento/ruso/varios/millones/dolares/elpepuint/20090522elpepuint_10/Tes|title=Bolivia proyecta comprar armamento ruso por varios millones de dólares|author=EFE|date=22 May 2009|work=EL PAÍS|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Russia and Bolivia signed a protocol agreement aimed at strengthening democracy in each nation. In February 2009 President [[Evo Morales]] visited Moscow. His trip was the first ever by a Bolivian head of state to the Russian capital. During the visit, both leaders signed an agreement strengthening energy and military ties between the two nations in addition to strengthening counter narcotics co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7894176.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Americas - Russia to aid Bolivia drugs fight|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Bolivia’s Viceminister of Foreign Affairs said that Bolivia would be making a multimilliondollar arms and transportation purchase from Russia in efforts to combat drug smuggling and production in Bolivia.
&lt;ref name="efe"/&gt;

In October 2009, President Evo Morales announce the plans to construct a technical support and repair facility for Russian aircraft in Bolivia that would be built at a former U.S. base near the town of Chimore in the center of the country. the initial investment in the construction is estimated at $5 million and the length of the existing runway will be extended by three times "to receive the most modern aircraft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20091025/156582301.html|title=Bolivia to host servicing center for Russian aircraft|author=Sputnik|date=25 October 2009|website=En.rian.ru|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cannabis is believed to have been introduced to Algeria by the Arab invasions of the 9th through 12th centuries.&lt;ref name="Nahas1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriel G. Nahas|title=Cannabis Physiopathology Epidemiology Detection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6doGy7klT88C&amp;pg=PA208|date=31 December 1992|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-8310-6|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis use in Algeria also played a role in spreading the habit to France, following France's 1830 occupation of Algeria.&lt;ref name="Rainford2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rainford|title=Consuming Pleasures: Australia and the International Drug Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3FQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT134|date=14 May 2010|publisher=Fremantle Press|isbn=978-1-921696-73-2|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Jacques-Joseph Moreau]] observed the effects of cannabis in Algeria in the form of an edible called ''[[dawamesc]]'', and it was this drug that he introduced to Paris' [[Club des Hashischins]].&lt;ref name="Regan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ciaran Regan|title=Intoxicating Minds: How Drugs Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz9bGD0GToUC&amp;pg=PT134|date=19 June 2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-53311-9|pages=134–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, John Morell wrote of his travels in Algeria:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''In Algeria they apply the names of kif, of hachich, and sometimes of tekrouri, to the extremity of the stem of the hemp, including the leaves, the flowers, and the seed, sometimes smoked by the natives in very diminutive pipes. These smokers are mostly inhabitants of the towns and villages, and are rarely met with among the Bedouins.''&lt;ref name="Morell1854"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Reynell Morell|title=Algeria: The Topography and History, Political, Social, and Natural, of French Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REVCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108|year=1854|publisher=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4344">[[File:Concilium-Bibliographicum-1908.jpg|thumb|Building for the Concilium in Zurich, 1908]]
The '''Concilium Bibliographicum''' was established in [[Zurich]]. Switzerland in 1895 by the U.S. zoologist [[Herbert Haviland Field]] in response to the lack of timely and complete bibliographies to serve the new sciences that had begun to emerge in the late nineteenth century.  Initially using his own funds, Field assumed the task of surveying all science journals and to use the then new index-cards and the highly sophisticated but complex [[Universal Decimal Classification]] system to send packets, bi-weekly, to his subscribers who were each to build a cumulative card file that would allow access to complete bibliographic citations and subject identifiers for all the literature on zoology and related fields from 1895 to the present.  
	Field cooperated with the grand information efforts of Belgians [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]] who had founded the Institut International de Bibliographie (IIB) in [[Brussels]] in 1895, later renamed as (in English) the [[International Federation for Information and Documentation]] (FID). In its early years the Concilium operated as an affiliate of the IIB. Field is credited with persuading Otlet and La Fontaine to adopt the 75 x 125&amp;nbsp;mm card size. He was also responsible for developing at the Concilium the Zoology sections of the Universal Decimal Classification.

== Success and Struggle ==
The Concilium and the IIB faced hostilities arising from nationalistic competition among England, France and Germany, but by 1903 the Concilium had sent some 13,000,000 cards to over 600 subscribers in Europe and North and South America.

It was, however, difficult to make the Concilium financially viable and just as it was on the verge of becoming self-sustaining the outbreak of war in 1914 forced it to suspend operations.  After the war, as Herbert Field was overcoming objections to his system by applied scientists, such as those represented by the [[National Research Council (United States)]] who favored a simpler and less expensive system based on volunteers composing abstracts of articles (as in [[Biological Abstracts]]) and saw no need for 'old knowledge', and just as he was about to receive funding from America's Rockefeller Foundation, he died. The Concilium was left in the hands of Johannes Strohl, a rather stubborn European scientist who found himself in conflict with the foundation, with those who favored a new world science information system based on abstracts, and with his subscribers who objected to the increased prices he had to charge as well as to the unwieldy size of the Concilium files as the number of science publications increased.

== End ==
Already on its last-legs, the outbreak of war in 1939 led to the closing of the Concilium in 1940. There were no attempts to revive it when peace returned.

In 2009 the number of students reached the threshold of 2000 and in 2010 the maximum capacity was exceeded with 600 students waiting for a place to enter.

The Portuguese government has showed willingness to support the implementation of a second phase that would allow the increase of the capacity of the Portuguese School of Luanda to 3,000 students. However, to date this has not yet occurred.

The '''flag of [[Shan State]]''' was adopted as one of the provisions of the [[Panglong Agreement]] signed on 12 February 1947, which served as the most important stepping stone towards the independence of [[Myanmar]].

The flag is a horizontal triband of yellow, green and red, with a white circle in the centre. Yellow represents [[Buddhism]], which is practiced by a majority of the [[Shan people]], green represents the rich agricultural land in Shan State, red represents the bravery of the Shan people and the white circle represents the moon, which symbolizes the Shan people's hopes for peace and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sca-uk.org.uk/?about-shan#shan_culture|title=About Shan|publisher=Shan Culture Association - UK|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other interpretations suggest that the yellow represents the colour of a [[Bhikkhu|monk's]] robe or a rice field during harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shan State (Myanmar) |url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mm-shan.html |website=www.crwflags.com |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Union Jack features in many territorial and sub-national flags. These are often [[Red Ensign]]s (e.g., {{flagof|Bermuda}}) or [[Blue Ensign]]s (e.g., {{flagof|New South Wales}} and {{flagof|Anguilla}}). A small number have backgrounds of other colours (e.g. {{flagof|British Antarctic Territory}} and {{flagof|Niue}}) or a unique pattern in the field (e.g. {{flagof|British Indian Ocean Territory}} and {{flagof|Hawaii}}). A small number put the Union Jack somewhere other than the canton (e.g. {{flagof|British Columbia}}). Unofficial flags, such as {{flagof|Ross Dependency|unofficial}} also use it.

'''Mlaḥsô''' or '''Mlahsö''' ({{lang-syc|ܡܠܚܬܝܐ}}), sometimes referred to as '''Suryoyo''' or '''Surayt''', is an extinct or dormant [[Central Neo-Aramaic|Central Neo-Aramaic language]]. It was traditionally spoken in eastern [[Turkey]] and later also in northeastern [[Syria]] by [[West Syrian Rite|Jacobite]] [[Assyrian people|Syriac-Assyrians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jastrow|first=Otto|title=Mlaḥsô: An Unknown Neo-Aramaic Language of Turkey|journal=Journal of Semitic Studies|date=1985|volume=30|pages=265–270|doi=10.1093/jss/xxx.2.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mlaḥsô language (Surayt of Mlaḥsô) is closely related to the [[Turoyo language|Surayt of Turabdin]] but sufficiently different
to be considered a separate language, with the syntax of the language having retained more features of [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]] than Turoyo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/lhs|title=Mlahsö|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was spoken in the villages of Mlaḥsô ({{lang-tr|Yünlüce}}, {{lang-ku|Mela}}), a village established by two monks from the [[Tur Abdin]] mountain range, and in the village of ˁAnşa near [[Lice, Turkey|Lice]], [[Diyarbakır]], [[Turkey]]. Aside from their native language, many Mlaḥsô speakers were fluent in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Levantine Arabic|Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Kurmanji language|Kurdish]] and [[Zazaki language|Zaza]].

==Etymology==
The name of the village and the language is derived from the earlier Aramaic word ''mālaḥtā'', 'salt marsh'. The literary Syriac name for the language is ''Mlaḥthoyo''. The native speakers of Mlaḥsô referred to their language simply as ''Suryô'', or Syriac.&lt;ref&gt;Jastrow, Otto. 1997. "Der Neuaramaische Dialek von Mlahso." In British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, reviewed by Geoffrey Khan. 299-300. British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Distribution==
The language was still spoken by a handful of people in the 1970s. The [[Last speaker of language|last fluent native speaker]] of Mlaḥsô, Ibrahim Ḥanna, died in 1998 in [[Qamishli]]. His daughters, Munira in Qamishlo, Shamiram in Lebanon, and son Dr. Isḥaq Ibrahim in Germany are the only speakers left with some limited native proficiency of the language. Recordings of Ibrahim Ḥanna speaking the language are available on [http://www.semarch.uni-hd.de/tondokumente.php43?LD_ID=4&amp;RG_ID=9&amp;ORT_ID=12&amp;lang=en Heidelberg University's Semitic Sound Archive] which were done by Otto Jastrow, a prominent German semiticist who is credited as the modern "discoverer" of the language and published the first modern research papers on the existence of Mlaḥsô and its linguistic features.

On 3 May 2009, a historical event in the history of the Mlaḥsô Surayt language took place. The [[Suroyo TV]] television station aired the program series ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uswfjcVLHBg Dore w yawmotho]'', which was about the village Mlaḥsô (and the Tur Abdin village Tamarze). Dr. Isḥaq Ibrahim, the son of Ibrahim Ḥanna, was a guest and spoke in the Mlaḥsô language with his sisters Shamiram in Lebanon and Munira in [[Qamishli]] live on the phone. Otto Jastrow was also interviewed regarding his expertise on Mlaḥsô. Turabdin [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]/Syriacs viewers and those present at the show could for the first time ever in modern times hear the language live.

The extinction of Mlaḥsô can be attributed to the small amount of original speakers of the language, and them being limited to two isolated villages, resulting in a disproportionate loss of speakers during the [[Assyrian genocide]] compared to Turoyo and other variants of Neo-Aramaic.

==Phonology==
Mlahsô is phonologically less conservative than Turoyo. This is particularly noticeable in the use of ''s'' and ''z'' for classical ''θ'' and ''ð''. The classical ''v'' has been retained though, while it has collapsed into ''w'' in Turoyo. Also sometimes ''y'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /j/) replaces ''ġ''. Mlaḥsô also renders the combination of vowel plus ''y'' as a single, fronted vowel rather than a [[diphthong]] or a glide.

The '''National Road 6''' ({{lang-sq|Rruga shtetërore SH6}}) leads from [[Milot, Laç|Milot]] to [[Peshkopi]].

The SH6 breaks off from [[National Road 1 (Albania)|National Road 1]] at Milot and travels through [[Burrel, Albania|Burrel]] and [[Bulqizë]] to Peshkopi. 

The first section, between Milot and [[Klos, Dibër|Klos]], follows the [[Mat (river)|Mat]] river valley, initially in a narrow cutting through the [[Skanderbeg range]], north of Burrell in the hilly terrain in the Matsenke it often travels far from the river. From Klos, the SH6 rises around 550 metres to the {{ill|Qafa e Buallit|de}} pass at 842 metres above sea level. East of this, it follows the Bulqizë valley to the [[Drin (river)|Drin]] river, which it crosses at a narrow point. At [[Maqellarë]], there is a junction with the road to [[Debar]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. There is a new by-pass at Maqellarë. From here the SH6 travels north to Peshkopi, travelling through hilly terrain far from the river once more. The first few kilometres of this road have been renovated recently.

Between Bulqizë and the Drin, the SH6 has been expanded into a broader, two-lane road. West of Bulqizë, construction was still in progress, as of 2011, as part of the national highway construction project. The new road would provide a direct link from [[Tirana]] to the Macedonian border, without the detour through Milot and Burrel. As part of this, the Qafa e Buallit pass will be replaced by a short tunnel. For the section travelling through the mountains between Tirana and Klos, many tunnels and complicated bridge systems are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yllpress.com/14733/rruga-e-arbrit-gati-ne-vitin-2013.html |title=Rruga e Arbrit gati në vitin 2013 |work=YllPress |date=2010-08-16 |language=sq |access-date=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}
The '''Order of Dobrzyń''' ({{lang-pl|Zakon Dobrzyński}}) or '''Order of Dobrin''' ({{lang-de|Orden von Dobrin}}), also known as the '''Brothers of Dobrzyń''' ({{lang-pl|Bracia Dobrzyńscy}}), was a [[Military order (society)|military order]] created in the borderland of [[Masovia]] and [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] (today's [[Dobrzyń Land]], [[Poland]]) during the 13th century [[Prussian Crusade]] to 'defend against [[Old Prussians|Baltic Prussian]] raids'.

In [[Latin]] the [[knight]]s were known as being a smaller part of the much bigger and older '''Fratres Milites Christi''' (de Prussia,&lt;ref name=opoka&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opoka.org.pl/biblioteka/D/DZ/marecki/bracia_dobrzynscy.html |title=Bracia Dobrzyńscy |publisher=Opoka|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Dobrin, de Dobrzyń,&lt;ref name=opoka/&gt; de Mazovia), and they were nicknamed the ''Prussian Cavaliers of Jesus Christ''.

The Order was created by [[Christian of Oliva]], the first [[Bishop]] of Prussia (1216&amp;ndash;1228), to protect Masovia and [[Kuyavia]] against raids from the [[paganism|pagan]] Prussians who defied Duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]]'s attempts to subjugate them.

The creation of the Order was confirmed by [[Pope Gregory IX]] (1227&amp;ndash;1241) in 1228. Duke Konrad granted the Knights the town of [[Dobrzyń nad Wisłą|Dobrzyń (Dobrin)]] and the surrounding [[Dobrzyń Land]] ({{lang-de|Dobriner Land}}), territory located south of and adjacent to Prussia. The Order of Dobrzyń was the only military order created in the territory of Poland.

At first the Order was composed of 15 [[Germans|German]] [[knight]]s from [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Mecklenburg]] led by [[Brunon (master)|Master Brunon]].

The Order of Dobrzyń provided assistance to the [[Cistercian]] [[missionary|missionaries]] in Prussia and protection from the raids of the pagan Prussian tribes. Their ideology was represented by their clothing - over their [[armor]] they had white cloaks, with symbols of a red sword raised up and a red star representing the revelations of [[Jesus]] to non Christians. The rules of their orders were based on those of the [[Livonian Order]] and the [[Knights Templar]].

In the face of the Order's lack of success in battle against the Prussians, as well as their small number (at its highest, 35 knights), in around 1235 the majority of the Knights joined the [[Teutonic Order]], as allowed by a papal document, the [[Golden Bull of Rieti]].

In 1237 the rest of the Brothers were moved by Konrad to [[Drohiczyn]] to increase the military strength of that outpost. The Brothers of Dobrin were last mentioned when Drohiczyn was captured by [[Danylo King of Rus|Prince Daniel]] of [[Kiev]] in 1240.

On 28 August 1952 the then [[NATO member states]] signed the '''Paris Protocol ''' in [[Paris]].
Its official title is "On the Status of International Military Headquarters Set up Pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty" and it establishes
the status of allied and national headquarters and respective procedures. The Protocol is part of the so-called NATO legal acquis.

All NATO member states have ratified the protocol, except Canada, which signed but did not ratify it. France ratified the protocol in 1955 but denounced its ratification in 1966.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="709">'''Postajankt-iki''' ("the fast old man") is the youngest son of the god [[Num-Torum]] in [[Ugric peoples|Ob-Ugrian]] mythology. He has several other names: '''Sorni-iki''' ("the golden old man"), and '''Õi-shlapt-lah-hliotõ-iki''' (which is used if one wishes to prevent him from being frightened during an offering). He rides upon a white horse. Postajankt-iki is easily started when someone calls his name (even jumping into the air), but it is not wise to call him for no reason because then woe befalls that person, according to the myths.

The application tracks performance over time, allowing users to view a detailed history of activities, get notifications for new personal "bests" and milestones, measure progress against current goals, follow detailed plans, and turn any activity into a route to do again later using built-in GPS.&lt;ref name="applestore"/&gt; Runkeeper allows users to share their personal content with friends through posting to Facebook and Twitter, and allows supporters watch live maps of workouts and races as users run.&lt;ref name="applestore"/&gt; The application has released an open API for outside developers to plug into Runkeeper users’ feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/06/runkeeper-facebook-of-fitness/|title=How RunKeeper Could Become the Facebook of Fitness|publisher=wired.com|author=Erik Malinowski |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Runkeeper periodically comes up with 'challenges' which rewards the user for completing certain criteria in a certain time-frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runkeeper.com/challenge|title=Runkeeper Challenges - Runkeeper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first challenge was in May 2014 with the goal of completing and GPS tracking a 5 kilometers between May 19 and June 19 to be entered in winning an [[LG]] Lifeband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runkeeper.com/challenge/lg|title=LG Lifeband 5K Challenge - Runkeeper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversy ==
In May 2016, the Runkeeper software came to the attention of the Norwegian Consumer Council for breaching European data protection laws.  It is alleged to continue tracking user's locations after the application is terminated and to share this information with advertisers in ways that exceed the bounds of the application's terms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/runkeeper-user-location-tracking-data-advertisers-692346/|title=Runkeeper is secretly tracking you around the clock and sending your data to advertisers|date=13 May 2016|website=Android Authority|publisher=Android Authority|quote="The NCC's investigation into Runkeeper discovered that user location data is tracked around the clock and gets transmitted to a third party advertiser in the U.S. called Kiip.me."|last1=Carlon|first1=Kris|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rwanda''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Rwanda pronunciation.ogg|r|u|ˈ|ɑː|n|d|ə|,_|-|ˈ|æ|n|-}}; {{lang-rw|U Rwanda}} {{IPA-rw|u.ɾɡwaː.nda||Rwanda (rw) pronunciation.ogg}}), officially the '''Republic of Rwanda''' ({{lang-rw|Repubulika y'u Rwanda}}; [[Kiswahili|Swahili]]: ''Jamhuri ya Rwanda''; {{lang-fr|République du Rwanda}}), is a country  in [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[East Africa]] and one of the smallest countries on the African mainland. Located a few degrees south of the [[Equator]], Rwanda is bordered by [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Rwanda is in the [[African Great Lakes]] region and is highly elevated; its geography is dominated by mountains in the west and [[savanna]] to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year.

The population is [[Youth in Rwanda|young]] and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]], although within this group there are three subgroups: the [[Hutu]], [[Tutsi]] and [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]]. The Twa are a forest-dwelling [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy people]] descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social [[caste]]s within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is [[Kinyarwanda]], spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as additional official languages.  The  [[sovereign state]] of Rwanda has a [[presidential system]] of government. The president is [[Paul Kagame]] of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.

[[Hunter gatherer]]s settled the territory in the [[stone age|stone]] and [[iron age]]s, followed later by [[Bantu peoples]]. The population coalesced first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] and then into kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. [[German colonial empire|Germany]] colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of [[German East Africa]], followed by [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], which invaded in 1916 during [[World War I]]. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population [[Rwandan Revolution|revolted]] in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. A [[1973 Rwandan coup d'état|1973 military coup]] saw a change of leadership, but pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] launched a [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] in 1990. Social tensions erupted in the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide]], in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.

[[Economy of Rwanda|Rwanda's economy]] suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on [[subsistence agriculture]]. Coffee and tea are the major [[cash crops]] for export. [[Tourism in Rwanda|Tourism]] is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which [[mountain gorilla]]s can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed ''intore'' dance. Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, including ''[[imigongo]]'', a unique cow dung art.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Rwanda}}
Modern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the [[last glacial period]], either in the [[Neolithic]] period around 8000 BC, or in the [[Neolithic Subpluvial|long humid period]] which followed, up to around 3000 BC.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=44}} Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by [[hunter gatherer]]s in the late [[stone age]], followed by a larger population of early [[Iron Age]] settlers, who produced dimpled [[pottery]] and iron tools.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=45}} These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=58}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], while the [[Tutsi]] migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}} Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|pp=10–11}}

The earliest form of social organisation in the area was the [[Clans of Rwanda|clan]] (''ubwoko'').{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=88}} The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|pp=88–89}} From the 15th century, the clans began to coalesce into kingdoms;{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=141}} by 1700 around eight kingdoms existed in present-day Rwanda.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=482}} One of these, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi [[Nyiginya]] clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-eighteenth century.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=160}} The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the nineteenth century under the reign of King [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]]. Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} and initiated administrative reforms; these included ''[[ubuhake]]'', in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=13–14}} and ''[[uburetwa]]'', a [[corvée]] system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court,{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} but their numbers continued to decline.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=6}}

The [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference of 1884]] assigned the territory to [[German Empire|Germany]] as part of [[German East Africa]], marking the beginning of the colonial era. The explorer [[Gustav Adolf von Götzen]] was the first European to significantly explore the country in 1894; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=217}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=9}} The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy and delegating power to local chiefs.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=25}} &lt;ref&gt;See also Helmut Strizek, "Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft", Berlin: Ch. Links Verlag, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] forces took control of Rwanda and [[Burundi]] in 1916, during [[World War I]], beginning a period of more direct colonial rule.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=260}} Belgium ruled both Rwanda and Burundi as a [[League of Nations mandate]] called [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgians also simplified and centralised the power structure,{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=270}} and introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works, and agricultural supervision, including new crops and improved agricultural techniques to try to reduce the incidence of famine.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|pp=276–277}} Both the Germans and the Belgians promoted Tutsi supremacy, considering the Hutu and Tutsi different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]].{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=450}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the classes.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56–57}}

[[Belgium]] continued to rule [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territory]] after the [[Second World War]], with a mandate to oversee eventual [[Decolonisation of Africa|independence]].{{sfn|United Nations (II)}}{{sfn|United Nations (III)}} Tensions escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 [[Rwandan Revolution]]: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses,{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=267}} forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=51}} In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a [[Rwandan monarchy referendum, 1961|referendum]] in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy. Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence on 1 July 1962,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=53}} which is commemorated as Independence Day, a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/independence-day-did-rwanda-really-gain-independence-july-1-1962 |title=Independence Day: Did Rwanda really gain independence on July 1, 1962? |last=Karuhanga |first=James |date=30 June 2018 |work=[[The New Times (Rwanda)|The New Times]] |access-date=1 July 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630010535/http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/independence-day-did-rwanda-really-gain-independence-july-1-1962# |archive-date=30 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycles of violence followed, with exiled Tutsi attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu retaliating with large-scale slaughter and repression of the Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=56}} In 1973, [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] took power in [[1973 Rwandan coup d'état|a military coup]]. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued, but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount of violence against Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=74–76}} The Twa remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely forced out of the forests by the government; many became beggars.{{sfn|UNPO|2008|loc=History}} Rwanda's population had increased from 1.6&amp;nbsp;million people in 1934 to 7.1&amp;nbsp;million in 1989, leading to competition for land.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=4}}

[[File:Nyamata Memorial Site 13.jpg|thumb|left|Human skulls at the [[Nyamata]] Genocide Memorial]]
In 1990, the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), a rebel group composed of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the [[Rwandan Civil War]].{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=93}} The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government for failing to democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=135–136}} but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=190–191}} The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|Habyarimana's plane was shot down]] near Kigali Airport, killing him.{{sfn|BBC News (III)|2010}} The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the [[Rwandan genocide]], which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, around 800,000{{sfn|Henley|2007}} Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=386}} Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.{{sfn|UNPO|2008|loc=History}}

The Tutsi RPF restarted their offensive, and took control of the country methodically, gaining control of the whole country by mid-July.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=299}} The international response to the genocide was limited, with major powers reluctant to strengthen the already overstretched [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|UN peacekeeping force]].{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=364}} When the RPF took over, approximately two million Hutu [[Great Lakes refugee crisis|fled to neighbouring countries]], in particular [[Zaïre]], fearing reprisals;{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=312}} additionally, the RPF-led army was a key belligerent in the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s.{{sfn|BBC News (V)|2010}} Within Rwanda, a period of reconciliation and justice began, with the establishment of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and the reintroduction of ''[[Gacaca]]'', a traditional village court system.{{sfn|Bowcott|2014}} Since 2000 Rwanda's economy,{{sfn|World Bank (X)}} tourist numbers,{{sfn|World Bank (XI)}} and [[Human Development Index]] have grown rapidly;{{sfn|UNDP (I)|2010}} between 2006 and 2011 the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45%,{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2012}} while [[life expectancy]] rose from 46.6 years in 2000{{sfn|UNDP (V)|2013|p=2}} to 59.7 years in 2015.{{sfn|CIA (I)}}

[[File:Paul Kagame 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Rwandan President [[Paul Kagame]]|alt=Photograph of Paul Kagame, taken in Busan, South Korea, in 2014]]
The [[President of Rwanda]] is the [[head of state]],{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 98}} and has broad powers including creating policy in conjunction with the Cabinet,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 117}} exercising the [[Prerogative of mercy (Rwanda)|prerogative of mercy]],{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 111}} commanding the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|armed forces]],{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 110}} negotiating and ratifying treaties,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 189}} signing presidential orders,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 112}} and declaring war or a state of emergency.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 110}} The President is elected by popular vote every seven years,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=articles 100–101}} and appoints the [[Prime Minister of Rwanda|Prime Minister]] and all other members of [[Council of Ministers of Rwanda|Cabinet]].{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 116}} The incumbent President is [[Paul Kagame]], who took office upon the resignation of his predecessor, [[Pasteur Bizimungu]], in 2000. Kagame subsequently won elections in [[Rwandan presidential election, 2003|2003]] and [[Rwandan presidential election, 2010|2010]],{{sfn|Lacey|2003}}{{sfn|BBC News (IV)|2010}} although human rights organisations have criticised these elections as being "marked by increasing political repression and a crackdown on free speech".{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|2010}} Article 101 of the [[Constitution of Rwanda|constitution]] had previously limited presidents to two terms in office,{{sfn|Mufulukye|2015}} but this was changed in a [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 2015|2015 referendum]], which had been brought following receipt of a petition signed by 3.8 million Rwandans.{{sfn|Uwiringiyamana (I)|2015}} Through this change in the constitution, Kagame could stay on as president until 2034.{{sfn|Uwiringiyamana (II)|2015}} Kagame was elected for a third term in [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 2015|2017]] with 98.79% of the vote.{{sfn|Burke|2017}}{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|2017}}

The constitution was adopted following a national referendum in 2003, replacing the transitional constitution which had been in place since 1994.{{sfn|Panapress|2003}} The constitution mandates a multi-party system of government, with politics based on democracy and elections.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 52}} However, the constitution places conditions on how political parties may operate. Article 54 states that "political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, region, sex, religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination".{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 54}} The government has also enacted laws criminalising genocide ideology, which can include intimidation, defamatory speeches, [[genocide denial]] and mocking of victims.{{sfn|National Commission for the Fight against Genocide|2008|p=1}} According to [[Human Rights Watch]], these laws effectively make Rwanda a one-party state, as "under the guise of preventing another genocide, the government displays a marked intolerance of the most basic forms of dissent".{{sfn|Roth|2009}} [[Amnesty International]] is also critical; in its 2014/15 report Amnesty said that laws against inciting insurrection or trouble among the population had been used to imprison people "for the legitimate exercise of their rights to freedom of association or of expression".{{sfn|Amnesty International|2015|p=311}}

The [[Parliament of Rwanda|Parliament]] consists of two chambers. It makes legislation and is empowered by the constitution to oversee the activities of the President and the Cabinet.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 62}} The lower chamber is the [[Chamber of Deputies of Rwanda|Chamber of Deputies]], which has 80 members serving five-year terms. Twenty-four of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a joint assembly of local government officials; another three seats are reserved for youth and disabled members; the remaining 53 are elected by [[universal suffrage]] under a [[proportional representation]] system.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 76}} Following the [[Rwandan parliamentary election, 2013|2013 election]], there are 51 female deputies,{{sfn|Munyaneza|2013}} up from 45 in 2008;{{sfn|McGreal|2008}} {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.{{sfn|Inter-Parliamentary Union|2015}} The upper chamber is the 26-seat [[Senate of Rwanda|Senate]], whose members are selected by a variety of bodies. A mandatory minimum of 30% of the senators are women. Senators serve eight-year terms.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 82}} (See also [[Gender equality in Rwanda]]).

[[File:RwandaParliament.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chamber of Deputies of Rwanda|Chamber of Deputies building]]|alt=Photograph of the Chamber of Deputies with highway in the foreground]]
Rwanda's legal system is largely based on [[Law of Germany|German]] and [[Law of Belgium|Belgian]] [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems and [[customary law]].{{sfn|CIA (I)}} The judiciary is independent of the executive branch,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 140}} although the President and the Senate are involved in the appointment of Supreme Court judges.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 148}} Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty,{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|Wells|2008|loc=I. Summary}} but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|Wells|2008|loc=VIII. Independence of the Judiciary}} The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 143}} Ordinary courts are the [[Supreme Court of Rwanda|Supreme Court]], the [[High Court of Rwanda|High Court]], and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 143}} and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations.{{sfn|Kamere|2011}} Between 2004 and 2012, a system of [[Gacaca courts|''Gacaca'' courts]] was in operation.{{sfn|BBC News (VIII)|2015}} ''Gacaca'', a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects.{{sfn|Walker|March 2004}} The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.{{sfn|BBC News (IX)|2012}}

Rwanda has low corruption levels relative to most other African countries; in 2014, [[Transparency International]] ranked Rwanda as the fifth cleanest out of 47 countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and 55th cleanest out of 175 in the world.{{sfn|Transparency International|2014}}{{sfn|Agutamba|2014}} The constitution provides for an [[Ombudsman]], whose duties include prevention and fighting of corruption.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 182}}{{sfn|Office of the Ombudsman}} Public officials (including the President) are required by the constitution to declare their wealth to the Ombudsman and to the public; those who do not comply are suspended from office.{{sfn|Asiimwe|2011}}

The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has been the dominant [[political party]] in the country since 1994. The RPF has maintained control of the presidency and the Parliament in national elections, with the party's vote share consistently exceeding 70%. The RPF is seen as a Tutsi-dominated party but receives support from across the country, and is credited with ensuring continued peace, stability, and economic growth.{{sfn|Clark|2010}} Human rights organisation [[Freedom House]] claims that the government suppresses the freedoms of opposition groups; in its 2015 report, Freedom House alleged that the RPF had "prevented new political parties from registering and arrested the leaders of several existing parties, effectively preventing them from fielding candidates" in elections.{{sfn|Freedom House|2015}} Amnesty International also claims that the RPF rules Rwanda "without
any meaningful opposition".{{sfn|Amnesty International|2015|p=310}}

Rwanda is a member of the [[United Nations]],{{sfn|United Nations (I)}} [[African Union]], [[Francophonie]],{{sfn|Francophonie}} [[East African Community]],{{sfn|Grainger|2007}} and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].{{sfn|Fletcher|2009}} For many years during the Habyarimana regime, the country maintained close ties with France, as well as Belgium, the former colonial power.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=89}} Under the RPF government, however, Rwanda has sought closer ties with neighbouring countries in the East African Community and with the English-speaking world. Diplomatic relations with France were suspended in 2006 following the indictment of Rwandan officials by a French judge,{{sfn|Porter|2008}} and despite their restoration in 2010, {{As of|2015|lc=y}} relations between the countries remain strained.{{sfn|Xinhua News Agency|2015}} Relations with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) were tense following Rwanda's involvement in the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s;{{sfn|BBC News (V)|2010}} the Congolese army alleged Rwandan attacks on their troops, while Rwanda blamed the Congolese government for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in [[North Kivu|North]] and [[South Kivu]] provinces.{{sfn|USA Today|2008}}{{sfn|Al Jazeera|2007}} Relations soured further in 2012, as Kinshasa accused Rwanda of supporting the [[M23 rebellion]], an insurgency in the eastern Congo.{{sfn|BBC News (X)|2012}} {{As of|2015}}, peace has been restored and relations are improving.{{sfn|Agence Africaine de Presse|2015}} Rwanda's relationship with [[Uganda]] was also tense for much of the 2000s following a 1999 clash between the two countries' armies as they backed opposing rebel groups in the Second Congo War,{{sfn|Heuler|2011}} but improved significantly in the early 2010s;{{sfn|BBC News (VI)|2011}} {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, the two countries enjoy a good relationship.{{sfn|Maboja|2015}}

The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) is the national army of Rwanda. Largely composed of former [[Rwandan Patriotic Army]] (RPA) soldiers, it includes the Rwanda Land Force, Rwanda Air Force and specialised units.{{sfn|Ministry of Defence}} After the successful conquest of the country in 1994 in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan Genocide]], the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a military division which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of the national budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Burundi]] and lingering concerns about [[Uganda]]'s intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s, charges denied by the Rwandan government.{{sfn|McGreal|2010}}

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main|Provinces of Rwanda|Districts of Rwanda}}
[[File:RwandaGeoProvinces.png|thumb|Provinces of Rwanda|alt=Map of Rwanda showing the five provinces in various colours, as well as major cities, lakes, rivers, and areas of neighbouring countries]]
Rwanda has been governed by a strict hierarchy since precolonial times.{{sfn|OAU|2000|p=14}} Before colonisation, the [[List of kings of Rwanda|King]] (''Mwami'') exercised control through a system of provinces, districts, hills, and neighbourhoods.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=5}} The current constitution divides Rwanda into [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] ({{lang|rw|intara}}), [[Districts of Rwanda|districts]] ({{lang|rw|uturere}}), cities, municipalities, towns, [[Sectors of Rwanda|sectors]] ({{lang|rw|imirenge}}), cells ({{lang|rw|utugari}}), and villages ({{lang|rw|imidugudu}}); the larger divisions, and their borders, are established by Parliament.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 3}}

The five provinces act as intermediaries between the national government and their constituent districts to ensure that national policies are implemented at the district level. The "Rwanda Decentralisation Strategic Framework" developed by the Ministry of Local Government assigns to provinces the responsibility for "coordinating governance issues in the Province, as well as monitoring and evaluation".{{sfn|MINALOC|2007|p=8}} Each province is headed by a governor, appointed by the President and approved by the Senate.{{sfn|Southern Province}} The districts are responsible for coordinating public service delivery and economic development. They are divided into sectors, which are responsible for the delivery of public services as mandated by the districts.{{sfn|MINALOC|2007|p=9}} Districts and sectors have directly elected councils, and are run by an executive committee selected by that council.{{sfn|MINALOC|2004}} The cells and villages are the smallest political units, providing a link between the people and the sectors.{{sfn|MINALOC|2007|p=9}} All adult resident citizens are members of their local cell council, from which an executive committee is elected.{{sfn|MINALOC|2004}} The city of [[Kigali]] is a provincial-level authority, which coordinates urban planning within the city.{{sfn|MINALOC|2007|p=8}}

The present borders were drawn in 2006 with the aim of decentralising power and removing associations with the old system and the genocide. The previous structure of twelve provinces associated with the largest cities was replaced with five provinces based primarily on geography.{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2006}} These are [[Northern Province, Rwanda|Northern Province]], [[Southern Province, Rwanda|Southern Province]], [[Eastern Province, Rwanda|Eastern Province]], [[Western Province, Rwanda|Western Province]], and the [[Kigali Province|Municipality of Kigali]] in the centre.

At {{convert|26338|km2|sqmi}}, Rwanda is the world's 149th-largest country,{{sfn|CIA (II)}} and the fourth smallest on the African mainland after [[Gambia]], [[Swaziland]], and [[Djibouti]].{{sfn|CIA (II)}} It is comparable in size to [[Burundi]], [[Haiti]] and [[Albania]].{{sfn|CIA (I)}}{{sfn|Richards|1994}} The entire country is at a high altitude: the [[List of countries by lowest point|lowest point]] is the [[Rusizi River]] at {{convert|950|m|ft|0}} above sea level.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} Rwanda is located in Central/Eastern Africa, and is bordered by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the west, [[Uganda]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the east, and [[Burundi]] to the south.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} It lies a few degrees south of the [[equator]] and is [[landlocked]].{{sfn|U.S. Department of State|2004}} The capital, Kigali, is located near the centre of Rwanda.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010}}

The [[Congo-Nile Divide|watershed]] between the major [[Congo Basin|Congo]] and [[Nile Basin|Nile]] [[drainage basin]]s runs from north to south through Rwanda, with around 80% of the country's area draining into the Nile and 20% into the Congo via the [[Rusizi River]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]].{{sfn|Nile Basin Initiative|2010}} The country's longest river is the [[Nyabarongo River Wetlands|Nyabarongo]], which rises in the south-west, flows north, east, and southeast before merging with the [[Ruvubu River|Ruvubu]] to form the [[Kagera River|Kagera]]; the Kagera then flows due north along the eastern border with Tanzania. The Nyabarongo-Kagera eventually drains into [[Lake Victoria]], and its source in Nyungwe Forest is a contender for the as-yet undetermined overall [[Source (river or stream)|source]] of the [[Nile]].{{sfn|BBC News (II)|2006}} Rwanda has many lakes, the largest being [[Lake Kivu]]. This lake occupies the floor of the [[Albertine Rift]] along most of the length of Rwanda's western border, and with a maximum depth of {{convert|480|m|ft|0}},{{sfn|Jørgensen|2005|p=93}} it is one of the twenty [[List of lakes by depth|deepest lakes in the world]].{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=153}} Other sizeable lakes include [[Lake Burera|Burera]], [[Lake Ruhondo|Ruhondo]], [[Lake Muhazi|Muhazi]], [[Lake Rweru|Rweru]], and [[Lake Ihema|Ihema]], the last being the largest of a string of lakes in the eastern plains of [[Akagera National Park]].{{sfn|Hodd|1994|p=522}}

[[File:RwandaVolcanoAndLake cropped2.jpg|thumb|Lake and volcano in the [[Virunga Mountains]]|alt=Photograph of a lake with one of the Virunga mountains behind, partially in cloud]]
Mountains dominate central and western Rwanda. They are part of the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the Albertine branch of the [[East African Rift]], which runs from north to south along Rwanda's western border.{{sfn|WWF|2001|loc=Location and General Description}} The highest peaks are found in the [[Virunga Mountains|Virunga]] volcano chain in the northwest; this includes [[Mount Karisimbi]], Rwanda's highest point, at {{convert|4507|m|ft|0}}.{{sfn|Mehta|Katee|2005|p=37}} This western section of the country lies within the [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] ecoregion.{{sfn|WWF|2001|loc=Location and General Description}} It has an elevation of {{convert|1500|to|2500|m|ft|0}}.{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=7}} The centre of the country is predominantly rolling hills, while the eastern border region consists of [[savanna]], plains and swamps.{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}}

Rwanda has a [[temperate]] [[Tropical climate|tropical highland]] climate, with lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries because of its high elevation.{{sfn|U.S. Department of State|2004}} Kigali, in the centre of the country, has a typical daily temperature range between {{convert|12|and|27|°C|°F}}, with little variation through the year.{{sfn|World Meteorological Organization}} There are some temperature variations across the country; the mountainous west and north are generally cooler than the lower-lying east.{{sfn|Best Country Reports|2007}} There are two rainy seasons in the year; the first runs from February to June and the second from September to December. These are separated by two [[dry season]]s: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February.{{sfn|King|2007|p=10}} Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=1}} [[Global warming]] has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group, change in climate has reduced the number of rainy days experienced during a year, but has also caused an increase in frequency of torrential rains.{{sfn|Strategic Foresight Group|2013|p=29}} Both changes have caused difficulty for farmers, decreasing their productivity.{{sfn|Bucyensenge|2014}} Strategic Foresight also characterise Rwanda as a fast warming country, with an increase in average temperature of between 0.7&amp;nbsp;°C to 0.9&amp;nbsp;°C over fifty years.{{sfn|Strategic Foresight Group|2013|p=29}}

In prehistoric times [[montane forest]] occupied one-third of the territory of present-day Rwanda. Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly restricted to the three [[National parks of Rwanda|National Parks]], with [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced agriculture]] dominating the rest of the country.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|pp=3–4}} [[Nyungwe Forest|Nyungwe]], the largest remaining tract of forest, contains 200 species of tree as well as [[orchid]]s and [[begonia]]s.{{sfn|King|2007|p=11}} Vegetation in the [[Volcanoes National Park]] is mostly [[bamboo]] and moorland, with small areas of forest.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|pp=3–4}} By contrast, Akagera has a [[savanna]] ecosystem in which [[acacia]] dominates the flora. There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including ''[[Markhamia lutea]]'' and ''[[Eulophia guineensis]]''.{{sfn|REMA (Chapter 5)|2009|p=3}}

The greatest diversity of large mammals is found in the three National Parks, which are designated conservation areas.{{sfn|Government of Rwanda (II)}} Akagera contains typical savanna animals such as giraffes and elephants,{{sfn|RDB (III)}} while Volcanoes is home to an estimated one-third of the worldwide [[mountain gorilla]] population.{{sfn|RDB (I)|2010}} Nyungwe Forest boasts thirteen primate species including [[chimpanzee]]s and [[Black-and-white colobus|Ruwenzori colobus]] arboreal monkeys; the Ruwenzori colobus move in groups of up to 400 individuals, the largest troop size of any primate in Africa.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=140}} Rwanda's population of [[lion]]s was destroyed in the aftermath of the genocide of 1994, as national parks were turned into camps for displaced people and remaining animals were poisoned by cattle herders. In June 2015, two South African parks donated seven lions to [[Akagera National Park]], reestablishing a lion population in Rwanda.{{sfn|Smith|2015}} The lions were held initially in a fenced off area of the park, and then collared and released into the wild a month later.{{sfn|The New Times|2015}}

There are 670 [[List of birds of Rwanda|bird species in Rwanda]], with variation between the east and the west.{{sfn|King|2007|p=15}} Nyungwe Forest, in the west, has 280 recorded species, of which 26 are endemic to the Albertine Rift;{{sfn|King|2007|p=15}} endemic species include the [[Rwenzori turaco]] and [[handsome francolin]].{{sfn|WCS}} Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, features savanna birds such as the [[black-headed gonolek]] and those associated with swamps and lakes, including [[stork]]s and [[crane (bird)|cranes]].{{sfn|King|2007|p=15}}

Recent entomological work in the country has revealed a rich diversity of [[praying mantises]],{{sfn|Tedrow|2015}} including a new species ''Dystacta tigrifrutex'', dubbed the "bush tiger mantis".{{sfn|Maynard|2014}}

{{Main|Economy of Rwanda}}
[[File:MarabaCoffeeDryingRacks.jpg|thumb|left|Coffee beans drying in [[Maraba coffee|Maraba]]. Coffee is one of Rwanda's major cash crops.|alt=Photograph of four drying racks containing white coloured unroasted coffee beans]]
Rwanda's economy suffered heavily during the 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, failure to maintain infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) estimated at [[Geary–Khamis dollar|$]]2,090 in 2017,{{sfn|IMF (II)|2017}} compared with $416 in 1994.{{sfn|IMF (I)}} Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} The economy is managed by the central [[National Bank of Rwanda]] and the currency is the [[Rwandan franc]]; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar.{{sfn|Agutamba|2015}} Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for [[monetary union]] amongst the five member nations,{{sfn|Asiimwe|2014}} which could eventually lead to a common [[East African shilling#Second East African shilling|East African shilling]].{{sfn|Lavelle|2008}}

Rwanda is a country of few natural resources,{{sfn|U.S. Department of State|2004}} and the economy is based mostly on [[subsistence agriculture]] by local farmers using simple tools.{{sfn|FAO / WFP|1997}} An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land and steep slopes.{{sfn|Our Africa}} Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have been decreasing, due in part to the resettlement of displaced people.{{sfn|WRI|2006}}{{sfn|U.S. Department of State|2004}} Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with population growth, and food imports are required.{{sfn|CIA (I)}}

Subsistence crops grown in the country include [[matoke]] (green bananas), which occupy more than a third of the country's farmland,{{sfn|Our Africa}} [[potato]]es, [[bean]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, [[cassava]], [[wheat]] and [[maize]].{{sfn|Our Africa}} Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and volcanic soils providing favourable conditions.{{sfn|Our Africa}} Reports have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans make their living from coffee plantation.{{sfn|Tumwebaze|2016}} Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices.{{sfn|WTO|2004}} Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each.{{sfn|MINAGRI|2006}} Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali.{{sfn|MINAGRI|2006}} Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.{{sfn|Namata|2008}}

The industrial sector is small, contributing 14.8% of GDP in 2014.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} Products manufactured include cement, agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, plastic goods, textiles and cigarettes.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} Rwanda's mining industry is an important contributor, generating US$93&amp;nbsp;million in 2008.{{sfn|Mukaaya|2009}} Minerals mined include [[cassiterite]], [[wolframite]], gold, and [[coltan]], which is used in the manufacture of electronic and communication devices such as mobile phones.{{sfn|Mukaaya|2009}}{{sfn|Delawala|2001}}

The largest radio and television stations are state-run, and the majority of newspapers are owned by the government.{{sfn|BBC News (VII)|2015}} Most Rwandans have access to radio; during the 1994 genocide, the radio station [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] broadcast across the country, and helped to fuel the killings through anti-Tutsi propaganda.{{sfn|BBC News (VII)|2015}} {{As of|2015}}, the state-run [[Radio Rwanda]] is the largest station and the main source of news throughout the country.{{sfn|BBC News (VII)|2015}} Television access is limited, with most homes not having their own set.{{sfn|Gasore|2014}} The government rolled out [[digital television]] in 2014, and a year later there were seven national stations operating, up from just one in the pre-2014 analogue era.{{sfn|Opobo|2015}} The press is tightly restricted, and newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals.{{sfn|BBC News (VII)|2015}} Nonetheless, publications in Kinyarwanda, English, and French critical of the government are widely available in Kigali. Restrictions were increased in the run-up to the Rwandan presidential election of 2010, with two independent newspapers, ''Umuseso'' and ''Umuvugizi'', being suspended for six months by the [[High Media Council (Rwanda)|High Media Council]].{{sfn|Reporters Without Borders|2010}}

The country's oldest telecommunications group, [[Rwandatel]], went into liquidation in 2011, having been 80% owned by Libyan company [[LAP Green]].{{sfn|Mugisha|2013}} The company was acquired in 2013 by [[Liquid Telecom]],{{sfn|Southwood|2013}} a company providing telecommunications and [[fibre optic]] networks across eastern and southern Africa.{{sfn|Mugwe|2013}} {{As of|2015}}, Liquid Telecom provides [[landline]] service to 30,968 subscribers, with mobile operator [[MTN Rwanda]] serving an additional 15,497 fixed line subscribers.{{sfn|RURA|2015|p=6}} Landlines are mostly used by government institutions, banks, [[Non Government Organisation|NGO]]s and embassies, with private subscription levels low.{{sfn|Majyambere|2010}} {{As of|2015}}, [[mobile phone]] penetration in the country is 72.6%,{{sfn|RURA|2015|p=5}} up from 41.6% in 2011.{{sfn|RURA|2011|p=3}} MTN Rwanda is the leading provider, with 3,957,986 subscribers, followed by [[Tigo]] with 2,887,328, and [[Bharti Airtel]] with 1,336,679.{{sfn|RURA|2015|p=6}} Rwandatel has also previously operated a mobile phone network, but the industry regulator revoked its licence in April 2011, following the company's failure to meet agreed investment commitments.{{sfn|Butera|2011}} Internet penetration is low but rising rapidly; in 2015 there were 12.8 internet users per 100 people,{{sfn|RURA|2015|p=5}} up from 2.1 in 2007.{{sfn|World Bank (II)}} In 2011, a {{convert|2300|km|mi}} fibre-optic telecommunications network was completed, intended to provide broadband services and facilitate electronic commerce.{{sfn|Reuters|2011}} This network is connected to [[SEACOM (African cable system)|SEACOM]], a [[Submarine communications cable|submarine]] fibre-optic cable connecting communication carriers in southern and eastern Africa. Within Rwanda the cables run along major roads, linking towns around the country.{{sfn|Reuters|2011}} Mobile provider MTN also runs a [[wireless internet]] service accessible in most areas of Kigali via pre-paid subscription.{{sfn|Butera|2010}}

[[File:WaterPumpRwanda.jpg|thumb|left|Rural water pump|alt=Photograph depicting one adult and five children filling jerrycans at a rural metal water pump with concrete base, at the bottom of a steep rocky hillside]]
The Rwandan government prioritised funding of water supply development during the 2000s, significantly increasing its share of the national budget.{{sfn|IDA|2009}} This funding, along with donor support, caused a rapid increase in access to safe water; in 2015, 74% of the population had access to safe water,{{sfn|Umutesi|2015}} up from about 55% in 2005;{{sfn|IDA|2009}} the government has committed to increasing this to 100% by 2017.{{sfn|Umutesi|2015}} The country's water infrastructure consists of urban and rural systems that deliver water to the public, mainly through standpipes in rural areas and private connections in urban areas. In areas not served by these systems, hand pumps and managed springs are used.{{sfn|MINECOFIN|2002|pp=25–26}} Despite rainfall exceeding {{convert|750|mm|in}} annually in most of the country,{{sfn|Berry|Lewis|Williams|1990|p=533}} little use is made of [[rainwater harvesting]], and residents are forced to use water very sparingly, relative to usage in other African countries.{{sfn|Umutesi|2015}} Access to [[Water supply and sanitation in Rwanda|sanitation]] remains low; the United Nations estimates that in 2006, 34% of urban and 20% of rural dwellers had access to [[improved sanitation]].{{sfn|USAID (I)|2008|p=3}} Government policy measures to improve sanitation are limited, focusing only on urban areas.{{sfn|USAID (I)|2008|p=3}} The majority of the population, both urban and rural, use public shared [[pit latrine]]s.{{sfn|USAID (I)|2008|p=3}}

Rwanda's electricity supply was, until the early 2000s, generated almost entirely from [[hydroelectric]] sources; power stations on Lakes [[Lake Burera|Burera]] and [[Lake Ruhondo|Ruhondo]] provided 90% of the country's electricity.{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|p=3}} A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the [[Rugezi wetlands]] for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50%, leading to a sharp drop in output from the power stations.{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|p=5}} This, coupled with increased demand as the economy grew, precipitated a shortfall in 2004 and widespread [[loadshedding]].{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|p=5}} As an emergency measure, the government installed [[diesel generator]]s north of Kigali; by 2006 these were providing 56% of the country's electricity, but were very costly.{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|p=5}} The government enacted a number of measures to alleviate this problem, including rehabilitating the Rugezi wetlands, which supply water to Burera and Ruhondo and investing in a scheme to extract methane gas from Lake Kivu, expected in its first phase to increase the country's power generation by 40%.{{sfn|AfDB|2011}} Only 18% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, though this had risen from 10.8% in 2009.{{sfn|World Bank (XIII)}} The government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 aims to increase access to electricity to 70% of households by 2017.{{sfn|Baringanire|Malik|Banerjee|2014|p=1}}

The government has increased investment in the [[Transport in Rwanda|transport infrastructure of Rwanda]] since the 1994 genocide, with aid from the United States, [[European Union]], Japan, and others. The transport system consists primarily of the road network, with paved roads between Kigali and most other major cities and towns in the country.{{sfn|AfDB|OECD Development Centre|2006|p=439}} Rwanda is linked by road to other countries in the East African Community, namely Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and [[Kenya]], as well as to the eastern Congolese cities of [[Goma]] and [[Bukavu]]; the country's most important trade route is the road to the port of [[Mombasa]] via [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]], which is known as the [[Northern Corridor]].{{sfn|Tancott|2014}} The principal form of public transport in the country is the [[minibus]], accounting for more than half of all passenger carrying capacity.{{sfn|MININFRA|2013|p=34}} Some minibuses, particularly in Kigali,{{sfn|MININFRA|2013|p=67}} operate an unscheduled service, under a [[share taxi|shared taxi]] system,{{sfn|MININFRA|2013|p=32}} while others run to a schedule, offering express routes between the major cities. There are a smaller number of large buses,{{sfn|MININFRA|2013|p=34}} which operate a scheduled service around the country. The principal private hire vehicle is the [[motorcycle taxi]]; in 2013 there were 9,609 registered motorcycle taxis in Rwanda, compared with just 579 [[taxicab]]s.{{sfn|MININFRA|2013|p=34}} [[Coach (vehicle)|Coach]] services are available to various destinations in neighbouring countries. The country has an [[Kigali International Airport|international airport]] at Kigali that serves several international destinations, the busiest routes being those to [[JKIA|Nairobi]] and [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe]];{{sfn|Centre For Aviation|2014}} there is one domestic route, between Kigali and [[Kamembe Airport]] near [[Cyangugu]].{{sfn|Tumwebaze|2015}} In 2017, construction began on the [[Bugesera International Airport]], to the south of Kigali, which will become the country's largest when it opens, complementing the existing Kigali airport.{{sfn|MININFRA|2017}} The national carrier is [[RwandAir]], and the country is served by seven foreign airlines.{{sfn|Centre For Aviation|2014}} {{As of|2015}} the country has no railways, but there is a project underway, in conjunction with Burundi and Tanzania, to extend the Tanzanian [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Line]] into Rwanda; the three countries have invited expressions of interest from private firms to form a [[public private partnership]] for the scheme.{{sfn|Senelwa|2015}} There is no public water transport between the port cities on Lake Kivu, although a limited private service exists and the government has initiated a programme to develop a full service.{{sfn|MININFRA|2013|p=43}} The [[Ministry of Infrastructure (Rwanda)|Ministry of Infrastructure]] is also investigating the feasibility of linking Rwanda to [[Lake Victoria]] via shipping on the [[Akagera River]].{{sfn|MININFRA|2013|p=43}}

{{As of|2015}}, the [[National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda]] estimates Rwanda's population to be 11,262,564.{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2015}} The 2012 census recorded a population of 10,515,973.{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2014|p=3}} The population is young: in the 2012 census, 43.3% of the population were aged 15 and under, and 53.4% were between 16 and 64.{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2014|p=8}} According to the CIA ''[[World Factbook]]'', the annual birth rate is estimated at 40.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants in 2015, and the death rate at 14.9.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} The life expectancy is 59.67&amp;nbsp;years (61.27&amp;nbsp;years for females and 58.11&amp;nbsp;years for males), which is the 26th lowest out of 224 countries and territories.{{sfn|CIA (I)}}{{sfn|CIA (III)|2011}} The sex ratio of the country is relatively even.{{sfn|CIA (I)}}

At {{convert|445|PD/km2}},{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2015}} Rwanda's population density is amongst the highest in Africa.{{sfn|Banda|2015}} Historians such as [[Gérard Prunier]] believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to the population density.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=4}} The population is predominantly rural, with a few large towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country.{{sfn|Straus|2013|p=215}} The only sparsely populated area of the country is the savanna land in the former province of [[Umutara Province|Umutara]] and Akagera National Park in the east.{{sfn|Streissguth|2007|p=11}} Kigali is the largest city, with a population of around one million.{{sfn|Kigali City}} Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development.{{sfn|CIA (I)}}{{sfn|Percival|Homer-Dixon|1995}}{{sfn|REMA (Chapter 2)|2009}} According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is [[Gisenyi]], which lies adjacent to [[Lake Kivu]] and the Congolese city of [[Goma]], and has a population of 126,000.{{sfn|City Population|2012}} Other major towns include [[Ruhengeri]], [[Butare]], and [[Gitarama (town)|Gitarama]], all with populations below 100,000.{{sfn|City Population|2012}} The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990,{{sfn|Percival|Homer-Dixon|1995}} to 16.6% in 2006;{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2012|p=29}} by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2012|p=29}}

Rwanda has been a unified state since pre-colonial times,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=450}} and the population is drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]];{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=52}} this contrasts with most modern African states, whose borders were drawn by [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial powers]] and did not correspond to ethnic boundaries or pre-colonial kingdoms.{{sfn|Boyd|1979|p=1}} Within the Banyarwanda people, there are three separate groups, the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=5}} The CIA ''World Factbook'' gives estimates that the Hutu made up 84% of the population in 2009, the Tutsi 15% and Twa 1%.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} The Twa are a pygmy people who descend from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants, but scholars do not agree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|pp=46–47}} Anthropologist Jean Hiernaux contends that the Tutsi are a separate race, with a tendency towards "long and narrow heads, faces and noses";{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=47}} others, such as Villia Jefremovas, believe there is no discernible physical difference and the categories were not historically rigid.{{sfn|Jefremovas|1995}} In precolonial Rwanda the Tutsi were the ruling class, from whom the kings and the majority of chiefs were derived, while the Hutu were agriculturalists.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=11–12}} The current [[Government of Rwanda|government]] discourages the Hutu/Tutsi/Twa distinction, and has removed such classification from identity cards.{{sfn|Coleman|2010}} The 2002 census was the first since 1933{{sfn|Kiwuwa|2012|p=71}} which did not categorise Rwandan population into the three groups.{{sfn|Agence France-Presse|2002}}

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Rwanda}}
[[File:RwamaganaChurch.jpg|thumb|Roman Catholic church in [[Rwamagana]]|alt=Photograph depicting the Roman Catholic parish church in Rwamagana, Eastern Province, including the main entrance, façade, the separate bell tower, and dirt forecourt]]
The largest faith in Rwanda is [[Catholic Church in Rwanda|Roman Catholicism]], but there have been significant changes in the nation's religious demographics since the genocide, with many conversions to [[evangelical]] Christianity, and, to a lesser degree, [[Islam in Rwanda|Islam]].{{sfn|Walker|April 2004}} According to the 2012 census, Roman Catholics represented 43.7% of the population, Protestants (excluding [[Seventh-day Adventists]]) 37.7%, Seventh-day Adventists 11.8%, and Muslims 2.0%; 0.2% claimed no religious beliefs and 1.3% did not state a religion.{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2014|p=17}} Traditional religion, despite officially being followed by only 0.1% of the population, retains an influence. Many Rwandans view the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] as synonymous with the traditional Rwandan God ''[[Imana]]''.{{sfn|Wiredu|Abraham|Irele|Menkiti|2006|pp=236–237}}

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Rwanda}}
The country's principal language is [[Kinyarwanda]], which is spoken by nearly all Rwandans. The major European languages during the colonial era were [[German language|German]], though it was never taught or widely used, and then [[French language|French]], which was introduced by Belgium from 1916 and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence in 1962.{{sfn|Université Laval|2010}} [[Dutch language|Dutch]] was spoken too. The return of English-speaking Rwandan refugees in the 1990s {{sfn|Université Laval|2010}} added a new dimension to the country's linguistic diversity.{{sfn|Samuelson|Freedman|2010}} Kinyarwanda, English, French, and Swahili are all official languages. Kinyarwanda is the national language while English is the primary medium of instruction in secondary and tertiary education. [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the [[lingua franca]] of the [[East African Community]],{{sfn|Tabaro|2015}} is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Kenya, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and those who live along the border with the DRC.{{sfn|Stanford University Swahili Department}} In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools.{{sfn|Tabaro|2015}} Inhabitants of Rwanda's [[Nkombo Island]] speak [[Mashi language|Mashi]], a language closely related to Kinyarwanda.{{sfn|Nakayima|2010}}

===Sexuality===
{{See also|LGBT rights in Rwanda}}

Homosexuality is generally considered a [[taboo]] topic, and there is no significant public discussion of this issue in any region of the country.{{sfn|Gmünder|2007|page=1216}}

Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Rwanda, and some cabinet-level government officials have expressed support for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender people.{{sfn|U.S. Department of State|2016}} However, Rwanda does not recognise same-sex marriages, civil unions or similar unions.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 26}}

[[File:Rwanda IntoreDancers.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Rwandan ''[[intore]]'' dancers|alt=Photograph depicting two male dancers with straw wigs, neck garments, spears and sticks]]
[[Music of Rwanda|Music]] and dance are an integral part of Rwandan ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings and storytelling. The most famous traditional dance is a highly choreographed routine consisting of three components: the ''[[umushagiriro]]'', or cow dance, performed by women;{{sfn|Rwanda Development Gateway}} the ''[[intore]]'', or dance of heroes, performed by men;{{sfn|Rwanda Development Gateway}} and the drumming, also traditionally performed by men, on drums known as ''ingoma''.{{sfn|RMCA}} The best known dance group is the [[National Ballet of Rwanda|National Ballet]]. It was established by President Habyarimana in 1974, and performs nationally and internationally.{{sfn|Briggs|2004}} Traditionally, music is transmitted orally, with styles varying between the social groups. Drums are of great importance; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the King (''Mwami'').{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|pp=135–136}} Drummers play together in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=139}} The country has a growing popular music industry, influenced by African Great Lakes, Congolese, and American music. The most popular genre is [[hip hop]], with a blend of [[dancehall]], [[rap]], [[ragga]], [[R&amp;B]] and [[dance-pop]].{{sfn|Mbabazi|2008}}

[[File:Igiseke.jpg|thumb|upright|Rwandan woven basket|alt=Photograph depicting a bowl shaped off-white woven basket with tall conical lid and black zigzag pattern]]
Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration. Woven baskets and bowls are especially common.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|pp=68–70}} ''[[Imigongo]]'', a unique cow dung art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating back to when the region was part of the independent [[Gisaka]] kingdom. The dung is mixed with natural soils of various colours and painted into patterned ridges to form geometric shapes.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=243–244}} Other crafts include pottery and wood carving.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=31}} Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials; circular or rectangular mud homes with grass-thatched roofs (known as ''nyakatsi'') are the most common. The government has initiated a programme to replace these with more modern materials such as corrugated iron.{{sfn|Ntambara|2009}}{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=75}}

Rwanda does not have a long history of written literature, but there is a strong oral tradition ranging from poetry to [[folk stories]]. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations.{{sfn|King|2007|p=105}} The most famous Rwandan literary figure was [[Alexis Kagame]] (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=29}} The Rwandan Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as [[Benjamin Sehene]]. A number of films have been produced about the Rwandan Genocide, including the [[Golden Globe]]-nominated ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (2007 film)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]'', ''[[Sometimes in April]]'', and ''[[Shooting Dogs]]'', the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.{{sfn|Milmo|2006}}

Fourteen regular [[public holidays in Rwanda|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year,{{sfn|Government of Rwanda (I)}} with others occasionally inserted by the government. The week following Genocide Memorial Day on 7 April is designated an official week of mourning.{{sfn|Watson|Renzi|Viggiani|2010|p=25}} The victory for the RPF over the Hutu extremists is celebrated as [[Liberation Day]] on 4 July. The last Saturday of each month is ''[[umuganda]]'', a national morning of mandatory [[community service]] lasting from 8{{nbsp}}am to 11{{nbsp}}am, during which all able bodied people between 18 and 65 are expected to carry out community tasks such as cleaning streets or building homes for vulnerable people.{{sfn|Rwanda Governance Board}} Most normal services close down during ''umuganda'', and public transportation is limited.{{sfn|Rwanda Governance Board}}

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of Rwanda}}
The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local [[staple food]]s produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ''[[ibitoke]]''), [[pulse (legume)|pulse]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, beans, and [[cassava]] (manioc).{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, [[tilapia]] is popular.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=81}} The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian [[Second European colonization wave (19th century–20th century)|colonialists]], is very popular.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} ''[[Ugali|Ubugari]]'' (or ''umutsima'') is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a [[porridge]]-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes.{{sfn|Auzias|2007|p=74}} ''[[Isombe]]'' is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} Lunch is usually a buffet known as ''mélange'', consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=66}} [[Brochette]]s are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes [[tripe]], beef, or fish.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=66}} In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and [[barbecue|barbecuing]] the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas.{{sfn|Anyango|2010}} Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ''[[ikivuguto]]'', is a common drink throughout the country.{{sfn|Nzabuheraheza|2005}} Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and ''[[urwagwa]]'',  made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies.{{sfn|Adekunle|2007|p=13}} The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is [[Bralirwa]], which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the [[Rwandan Stock Exchange]].{{sfn|Bralirwa (I)}} Bralirwa manufactures [[soft drink]] products from [[The Coca-Cola Company]], under license, including [[Coca-Cola]], [[Fanta]], and [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]],{{sfn|Bralirwa (II)}} and a range of beers including [[Primus beer|Primus]], [[Mützig beer|Mützig]], [[Amstel Brewery|Amstel]], and [[Turbo King]].{{sfn|Bralirwa (III)}} In 2009 a new brewery, [[Brasseries des Mille Collines]] (BMC) opened, manufacturing [[Skol]] beer and a local version known as [[Skol Gatanu]];{{sfn|Ngarambe|2012}} BMC is now owned by Belgian company [[Unibra]].{{sfn|Craig|2012}} [[East African Breweries]] also operate in the country, importing [[Guinness]], [[Tusker (beer)|Tusker]], and [[Bell (beer)|Bell]], as well as [[whisky]] and [[Distilled beverage|spirit]]s.{{sfn|Kezio-Musoke|2014}}

Rwandans have been competing at the [[Olympic Games]] since 1984,{{sfn|BBC Sport (I)|2012}} and the [[Paralympic Games]] since 2004.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2015}} The country sent seven competitors to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, representing it in athletics, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[mountain biking]] and [[judo]],{{sfn|BBC Sport (I)|2012}} and 15 competitors to the [[2012 Summer Paralympics|London Summer Paralympics]] to compete in athletics, [[Paralympic powerlifting|powerlifting]] and [[sitting volleyball]].{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2015}} The country has also participated in the [[Commonwealth Games]] since joining the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 2009.{{sfn|BBC Sport (II)|2010}}{{sfn|Office of the Prime Minister|2014}} The country's [[Rwanda national basketball team|national basketball team]] has been growing in prominence since the mid-2000s, with the men's team qualifying for the final stages of the [[African Basketball Championship]] four times in a row since 2007.{{sfn|Bishumba|2015}} The country bid unsuccessfully to host the [[2013 African Basketball Championship|2013 tournament]].{{sfn|Mackay|2009}}{{sfn|International Basketball Federation|2011}} Rwanda's [[Rwanda national football team|national football team]] has appeared in the [[African Cup of Nations]] once, in the [[2004 African Cup of Nations|2004 edition]] of the tournament,{{sfn|Carlin|2003}} but narrowly failed to advance beyond the group stages.{{sfn|Copnall|2004}} The team have failed to qualify for the competition since, and have never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].{{sfn|Montague|2014|p=67}} Rwanda's highest domestic football competition is the [[Rwanda National Football League]];{{sfn|Mugabe|Kamasa|2014}} {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, the dominant team is [[APR FC]] of Kigali, having won 13 of the last 17 championships.{{sfn|Schöggl|2015}} Rwandan clubs participate in the [[Kagame Interclub Cup]] for Central and East African teams, sponsored since 2002 by President Kagame.{{sfn|CECAFA}}

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Rwanda}}
[[File:OLPC classroom teaching.JPG|thumb|left|Children in a Rwandan primary school, using laptops supplied by the [[One Laptop Per Child]] scheme]]
Prior to 2012, the Rwandan government provided free education in state-run schools for nine years: six years in primary and three years following a common secondary programme.{{sfn|MINEDUC|2010|p=2}} In 2012, this started to be expanded to 12 years.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=935}} A 2015 study suggests that while enrollment rates in primary schools are "near ubiquity", rates of completion are low and repetition rates high.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=931}} While schooling is fee-free, there is an expectation that parents should contribute to the cost of their children's education by providing them with materials, supporting teacher development and making a contribution to school construction. According to the government, these costs should not be a basis for the exclusion of children from education, however.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=935}} There are many private schools across the country, some church-run, which follow the same syllabus but charge fees.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=27}} From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; because of the country's increasing ties with the [[East African Community]] and the [[Commonwealth]], only the English syllabi are now offered.{{sfn|McGreal|2009}} The country has a number of institutions of tertiary education. In 2013, the public [[University of Rwanda]] (UR) was created out of a merger of the former [[National University of Rwanda]] and the country's other public higher education institutions.{{sfn|Koenig|2014}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2014}}{{sfn|Rutayisire|2013}} In 2013, the [[gross enrolment ratio]] for tertiary education in Rwanda was 7.9%, from 3.6% in 2006.{{sfn|World Bank (III)}} The country's [[literacy]] rate, defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write, was 71% in 2009, up from 38% in 1978 and 58% in 1991.{{sfn|World Bank (I)}}

== Health ==
{{main|Healthcare in Rwanda|Health in Rwanda}}
[[File:Butaro Hospital.jpg|thumb|[[Butaro Hospital]] at [[Burera]], Northern Province |alt=Photograph depicting a hospital building, with Rwandan flag, viewed from the entrance pathway]]
The quality of healthcare in Rwanda has historically been very low, both before and immediately after the 1994 genocide.{{sfn|Drobac|Naughton|2014}} In 1998, more than one in five children died before their fifth birthday,{{sfn|World Bank (IV)}} often from [[malaria]].{{sfn|Bowdler|2010}}

President Kagame has made healthcare one of the priorities for the [[Vision 2020 (Rwanda)|Vision 2020]] development programme,{{sfn|Evans|2014}} boosting spending on health care to 6.5% of the country's [[gross domestic product]] in 2013,{{sfn|World Bank (V)}} compared with 1.9% in 1996.{{sfn|World Bank (VI)}} The government has devolved the financing and management of healthcare to local communities, through a system of health insurance providers called ''mutuelles de santé''.{{sfn|WHO|2008}} The ''mutuelles'' were piloted in 1999, and were made available nationwide by the mid-2000s, with the assistance of international development partners.{{sfn|WHO|2008}}  Premiums under the scheme were initially [[United States dollar|US$]]2 per annum; since 2011 the rate has varied on a sliding scale, with the poorest paying nothing, and maximum premiums rising to US$8 per adult.{{sfn|Rosenberg|2012}} {{As of|2014}}, more than 90% of the population was covered by the scheme.{{sfn|USAID (II)|2014}} The government has also set up training institutes including the Kigali Health Institute (KHI), which was established in 1997{{sfn|IMF|2000|p=34}} and is now part of the [[University of Rwanda]]. In 2005, President Kagame also launched a program known as ''The Presidents' Malaria Initiative''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rw.one.un.org/mdg/mdg6|title=HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases|publisher=United Nations in Rwanda|accessdate=20 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515111753/http://www.rw.one.un.org/mdg/mdg6#|archive-date=15 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative aimed to help get the most necessary materials for prevention of malaria to the most rural areas of Rwanda, such as mosquito nets and medication.

In recent years Rwanda has seen improvement on a number of key health indicators. Between 2005 and 2013, life expectancy increased from 55.2 to 64.0,{{sfn|World Bank (VII)}} under-5 mortality decreased from 106.4 to 52.0 per 1,000 live births,{{sfn|World Bank (VIII)}} and incidence of [[tuberculosis]] has dropped from 101 to 69 per 100,000 people.{{sfn|World Bank (IX)}} The country's progress in healthcare has been cited by the international media and charities. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' devoted an article to "Rwanda's Historic Health Recovery".{{sfn|Emery|2013}} [[Partners In Health]] described the health gains "among the most dramatic the world has seen in the last 50 years".{{sfn|Rosenberg|2012}}

Despite these improvements, however, the country's health profile remains dominated by communicable diseases,{{sfn|WHO|2015}} and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] has described "significant health challenges",{{sfn|USAID (III)|2015}} including the rate of maternal mortality, which it describes as "unacceptably high",{{sfn|USAID (III)|2015}} as well as the ongoing [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic.{{sfn|USAID (III)|2015}} According to the American [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], travelers to Rwanda are highly recommended to take preventive malaria medication as well as make sure they are up to date with vaccines such as yellow fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/rwanda|title=Health Information for Travelers to Rwanda|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=8 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609011245/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/rwanda#|archive-date=9 June 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rwanda also has a shortage of medical professionals, with only 0.84 physicians, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 residents.{{sfn|Partners In Health|2013}} The [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) is monitoring the country's health progress towards [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4–6, which relate to healthcare. A mid-2015 UNDP report noted that the country was not on target to meet goal 4 on infant mortality, despite it having "fallen dramatically";{{sfn|UNDP (II)|2015}} the country is "making good progress" towards goal 5, which is to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio,{{sfn|UNDP (III)|2015}} while goal 6 is not yet met as [[HIV/AIDS in Rwanda|HIV prevalence]] has not started falling.{{sfn|UNDP (IV)|2015}}

}}
The '''Squarial''' (a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[square (geometry)|square]]'' and ''[[antenna (radio)|aerial]]'') is a satellite antenna used for reception of the now defunct [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] television service. The Squarial was a flat plate satellite antenna, built to be unobtrusive and unique. BSB were counting on the form factor of the antenna to clearly differentiate themselves from their competitors at the time. At the time of development, satellite installations usually required an 80&amp;nbsp;cm dish in order to receive a clear signal from the transmitting satellite. The smaller antenna was BSB's unique selling point and was heavily advertised in order to attract customers to their service.

== History ==

The Squarial was launched at a high-profile event in MarcoPolo house, BSB's headquarters. The media were invited to a demonstration to see how much better [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|MAC]] pictures could be than [[Phase Alternating Line|PAL]]. But MAC took a back seat when BSB unveiled the mock up Squarial, to replace the dish aerials usually needed for satellite reception. The Squarial was a surprise to everyone, including the four companies which had signed to manufacture the receivers which would have to work with the new aerial. The Squarial deal, with British company Fortel, had been struck only hours before the London event.
BSB was itself surprised at the press reaction.

Press and TV crews were in such palaver to report the news that they forgot to ask if it worked; and it did not. All that existed was a wood-and-plastic dummy. Believing that someone would be able to make the Squarial work as well as a much larger dish, BSB built a whole advertising campaign on the Squarial. STC in Paignton was the first company to make a British Squarial. These were a little bigger, 38&amp;nbsp;cm across, to provide adequate reception throughout the UK, and more expensive than a dish.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Due to production delays and limited availability of the STC squarial and to save face at launch, BSB sourced already available Squarials from Matsushita in Japan who were producing them in quantity for the Japanese market, industry rumours at the time of launch suggested that BSB were buying in the squarials from Matsushita for several hundred pounds each and heavily subsidising the cost to the 4 manufacturers of DMAC receiver. The Matsushita squarial was of a slightly better build quality compared to the STC design and was used by Ferguson, Philips and Tatung while ITT-Nokia supplied the STC squarial. However all offered the 30&amp;nbsp;cm traditional mini dish for a slightly lower price (several dish manufacturers were used including Lenson Heath and Channel Master)

The Squarial became obsolete in 1993, when the [[Thor (satellite)|Marcopolo]] satellites, which the Squarial received, stopped broadcasting signals from [[BSkyB]], which had carried the Sky channels over the D-Mac system for a period.

== Technology ==
[[File:BSBDishes.jpg|alt=A photo of all three BSB dishes available, the squarial, a Sky dish for comparison, the round BSB dish, and the square BSB dish.|thumb|A photo of all three BSB dishes available, the squarial, a Sky dish for comparison, the round BSB dish, and the square BSB dish.]]

Technology-wise, the Squarial pioneered a system of layered circuitry, effectively thin sheets of plastic embedded with the conductive reception nodes. Three of these sheets were stacked upon each other, padded with polystyrene layers to add rigidity to the unit. This is now commonly known as a '[[phased array]]' setup. All this was engineered into a 38&amp;nbsp;cm wide plastic body, presented in white and adorned with the BSB logo at the bottom. The [[low-noise block converter]] (LNB) was based in the center, behind the layers, and contained a simple reception unit in line with other satellite antennae of the time. It was manufactured by Matsushita and rated as a 10&amp;nbsp;GHz standard unit.

The Squarial's small size was possible thanks to the high power of the two Marcopolo DBS satellites, which simulcast the same channels on the same frequencies. The broadcast power was 59dBW, with a 0.05 degree accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSB - the satellites|url=http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/bsb.html|date=May 2003|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers of the DMAC receivers used with the Squarial included, Ferguson, Phillips, Nokia and Tatung.

== Modification ==

The Squarial was a highly specified unit, designed specifically for operation on the Marco Polo satellites' frequency range. As such the LNB can only tune a limited range of frequencies, and when utilised in modern circumstances the frequency is subsequently out of phase by around 100&amp;nbsp;MHz.

Some owners modified the squarial to operate with the Thor satellite system (formerly BSB's own satellites, Marcopolo) after the decline of BSB. This was due in large part to the highly discounted price of the unit during the final months of BSB's existence. D2MAC programmes could be picked up from the Scandinavian satellites during the early 1990s and viewed using modified receivers. Once transmissions ceased from these satellites, Squarials could be used to receive broadcasts from the French terrestrial relay satellites at 5.0°W.

BSB's alternative dishes have also been used successfully to tune into modern broadcast transmissions, whilst testing has been limited, analogue transmissions from the Astra and Hotbird satellites are reported to have been tuned.

== Design and brand ==

BSB placed the Squarial at the heart of its advertising campaign, using the diamond shape throughout all of its channel logos and on screen presentation. This square/diamond image extended down to BSB's corporate logo and even printed and televisual advertising mediums. This led to the company's slogan (used throughout the company's existence) "It's smart to be square".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TellyAds: BSB Television Advert|url=http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie_vintage.php?filename=VA0604|date=2007-01-19|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique appearance was a design first for satellite antennae, its flat plate measured only a few millimetres thick and the LNB unit protruded another 3&amp;nbsp;cm from the rear. It was built to a very high standard, featuring good quality plastics, weather resistant coatings and stainless steel mounting arm. Compared with the Amstrad-manufactured setups offered by Sky&amp;nbsp;— made from cheap metal&amp;nbsp;— the Squarial offered a much more attractive setup.

== Alternatives ==

BSB offered two alternatives to the squarial, the cheaper more conventional looking mini-dish format and the rounded-rectangle format dish.

The first revision was in the shape of a vertical ellipse of roughly 30&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The design employed a short LNB arm with a 'spike' design LNB operating at a frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;GHz. Essentially this design could be considered the forerunner to BSkyB's minidish. The second revision took on the appearance of a perfectly circular dish (around 25&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter), using a standard LNB at 10&amp;nbsp;GHz. In essence both function like a normal satellite dish, only scaled down.

'''Stanley St. Claire Sayres''' (1896 - 17 September 1956) was a [[hydroplane racing|hydroplane racer]] who broke the world water speed record with his "Slo-mo-shun IV" boat. 

Stanley Sayres was born in [[Dayton, Washington]] in 1896, and studied in [[Walla Walla, Washington]] at the [[Whitman College]]. He entered the army in 1917. After World War I, he ran his own car dealerships in Walla Walla and a second one in [[Pendleton, Oregon]]. By 1931, when he moved to Seattle, he owned 5 dealerships.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maurer|first1=Terry K.|title=Toy boat of extra interest to hydro race fans|url=http://www.tri-cityherald.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/antique-appraisals/article49523395.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=tri-City Herald|date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Chrysler]]-[[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] dealership was located on the corner of [[Broadway (Seattle)|Broadway]] and [[Madison Street (Seattle)|Madison Street]] in Seattle.&lt;ref name="Dorpat"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dorpat|first1=Paul|title=Accident at Stan Sayres’ auto dealership, ca. 1955|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/accident-at-stan-sayres-auto-dealership-ca-1955/|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=Seattle Times|date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Harry Jensen he founded the successful company Jen-Cel-Lite, which made sleeping bags using cellulose for insulation. Harry's brother Tony owned Jensen Motor Boat Company, and this sparked the interest in motor boat racing Sayres would have for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

From 1937 on, he owned a series of successful hydroplane racing boats called ''Slo-mo-shun'' I to V. The first ones were bought in 1937 and 1942 from Jack Cooper; the ''Slo-mo-shun II'' had with its previous owner and under its previous name ''Topps III'' set a world record for its class (225-class boats) at 87.48 mph. The 1947 ''Slo-mo-shun III'' was the first boat specially ordered by Sayres, again in the 225 class. It marked the start of the collaboration between Sayres, designer Ted Jones, and builder Anchor Jensen (son of Tony). The ''Slo-mo-shun IV'' was built between 1948 and October 1949, the ''Slo-mo-shun V'' in 1951. It was the last boat he built.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=David D.|title=Hydroplane Racing in Seattle|url=https://books.google.be/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=yb12AJMVLl8C&amp;q=sayres#v=snippet&amp;q=sayres&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 January 2018|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2006|ISBN=9781439614563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, he let others drive the boats, but in 1950 he piloted the ''Slo-mo-shun IV'' to the World Unlimited [[water speed record]]. [[Malcolm Campbell]] had set the record in 1939 to 141.740 mph (228.108 km/h) with his ''[[Blue Bird K4]]''. On 26 June 1950, Sayres broke that record when he reached 160.323 mph (258.015 km/h). He again improved this record on 7 July 1952 to 178.49 mph (287.25 km/h). This record stood until July 1955 when [[Donald Campbell]], son of the former record holder, reached 202.32 mph (325.60 km/h) in the ''[[Bluebird K7]]''.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In the early 1950s, his two boats ''Slo-mo-shun IV'' and ''Slo-mo-shun V'' (with various captains including [[Ted Jones (hydroplanes)|Ted Jones]]) were the 6-times winners of the [[APBA Gold Cup]], the most important hydroplane race in the United States.&lt;ref name="Maurer"/&gt; The IV also won the [[Harmsworth Cup]] in 1950, making it the only boat to win the two most important trophies and set the world speed record in one year.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

Sayres died of a heart attack in 1956. The Stanley Sayres Memorial Park in Seattle is named after him.

==Income tax==

In 2013, [[Andorra]] announced plans to impose an [[income tax]] in response to pressure from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/andorra/10094209/Andorra-bows-to-EU-pressure-to-introduce-income-tax.html Andorra bows to EU pressure to introduce income tax], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], June 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The tax was introduced in 2015, at a [[flat tax|flat]] rate of 10%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impostos.ad/impost-sobre-la-renda-de-les-persones-fisiques Individual income tax], Government of Andorra. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andorra introduced a new personal income tax regime on the first of January 2015. Those who earn less than 24,000€ are still tax exempt. If income is not more than 40,000€ the tax income is 5% and if you earn more than 40,000€ tax is 10%. However, the 10% income tax was one of the lowest tax rates in Europe.

The tax on savings follow the same regime as the income tax, but the difference in this case is that the first 3,000€ of investment income is tax exempt.

==Corporate tax==

The range of this kind tax goes from zero to ten percentage (as maximum). Foreign companies won´t have to pay this tax though the dividends are paid directly to the Andorran company.

==Value added tax==

Andorra introduced the first of January 2013 the Value Added Tax system (replaces the old Sales Tax regime). It has Europe’s lowest VAT of just 4.5%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.expansion.com/pymes/2016/03/17/56e2f4fbca4741a8028b4650.html (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; in compare of the surrounding countries (Spain and France) that have considerably high VAT rates. It is reduced to a nominal rate of 1% for goods and services such as health, culture, education and food.

Employees pay social security taxes at rates of 5-9% on their salaries; employers pay social security taxes of 13% on their employees' salaries. In October 1991, a form of [[value-added tax]] was introduced at a general rate of 4% on most goods and at higher rates of 8% and 12%, respectively, for special goods and for deemed luxury goods. There are also taxes on the import of certain goods. The 1992 budget law introduced a registration tax on certain activities, to provide 8.6% of government revenues, as well as a tax on [[electricity]] consumption and [[telephone]] services at a rate of 10%, to contribute 1.6% of government revenues.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

==Real estate tax==

When someone want to sell Andorran property to obtain some profit, a capital gains tax will be applied on the real asset. The nominal rate is 15% if you sell the property before one year, 13% if you sell it in the second year of possession, 10% in the third year of possession and decreases by 1% each year after the third year (so the rate can be 0% in the 12th year). However, you can avoid the capital gains tax buying another property before six months of the sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nomoretax.eu/living/relocation-to-andorra/ (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;
==Other taxes==

No wealth tax, no inheritance tax, no gift tax. There are no more taxes on capital gains, except real estate tax. 
People who want to set up a business have to pay social insurance are 8,5% of gross earnings for old age and 6% for maternity, disability and sickness.

''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' is a video game franchise created by Japanese [[video game developer]] [[Shigeru Miyamoto]].

The '''universe depicted in the ''Legend of Zelda'' series''' consists of a variety of lands, the most predominant being {{nihongo|'''Hyrule'''|ハイラル|Hairaru}}.
{{TOClimit|limit=3}}

==Hyrule==
{{Distinguish|Camp Hyrule}}
The kingdom of {{nihongo|Hyrule|ハイラル|Hairaru}}, a [[medieval]]-inspired [[fantasy land]], is the main setting of the series. Making its first appearance in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', many of Hyrule’s areas have recurring appearances throughout the series, like the Lost Woods, Kakariko Village, Death Mountain and Lake Hylia. Several games in the series are set in lands other than Hyrule, including ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]'', set on [[Koholint|Koholint Island]]; ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]'', set in [[Termina]]; [[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages|''Oracle of Seasons'' and ''Oracle of Ages'']], set in Holodrum and Labrynna, respectively; ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass|Phantom Hourglass]]'', both set on the Great Sea, a flooded Hyrule (although a large portion of ''Phantom Hourglass'' takes place in the World of the Ocean King in another dimension); ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]'', set in New Hyrule, and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword|Skyward Sword]]'', set on Skyloft, a group of islands above the clouds.

Hyrule was formed by {{nihongo|[[Deity|three goddesses]]|三柱の女神|Mihashira no Megami}} {{nihongo|Din|ディン}}, {{nihongo|Farore|フロル|Faroru}}, and {{nihongo|Nayru|ネール|Nēru}}. According to Hylian legend depicted in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'', Din created the physical [[geography]] of the realm, Nayru created the [[physical law]]s to govern the land, and Farore created the races to uphold the law and the [[Flora (plants)|flora]] and [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]] that inhabit the world. Once the goddesses had completed their tasks, they departed for the heavens, and left behind three golden triangles. In these, they put their power to govern all things; this relic became known as the [[#Triforce|Triforce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''|developer=[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]]|publisher=[[Nintendo of America]]|date=1998-11-23|platform=[[Nintendo 64]]|version= |level=Deku Tree |isolang= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realm itself was eventually named Hyrule after its dominant race, the [[#Hylian|Hylians]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Link to the Past'', Japanese Manual: {{nihongo|In books left behind for their Hyrulian descendants by the race once closest to the gods, the Hylians&lt;!--The Japanese version calls them Hylia-jin. This is not evidence of the race being named the Hylians--&gt; (the root word for Hyrule), it is written that the three gods, the "god of power", the "god of wisdom," and the "god of courage," created the state of heaven and earth.|かつて神に最も近い民 族とされたハイリア人(ハイラルの語源でもあります)が、ハイラルの子孫に残した書物の中に三人の神々「力の神」「知恵の神」「勇気の神」による天地創造の様子が書かれています。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hylian is a [[constructed language]] that first appears in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'', where it is identified as "the ancient language of the Hylians" and is composed of symbols that [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] must translate to progress. In ''The Wind Waker'', the [[angler fish]]-like Jabun, the dragon Valoo, the Great Deku Tree, and the King of Red Lions can speak it. In Japan, an explanation on the Hylian alphabet was written on the back of the instruction manual with a phonographic writing system, or [[syllabary]], like the Japanese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/12/hyrule-glyphics-translated |title=Hyrule Glyphics translated. Article on Hylian|date=December 12, 2002|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, three more Hylian scripts have been developed and/or deciphered for the public: the Old Hylian Syllabary used in ''Ocarina of Time'', the Modern Hylian Syllabary used in ''The Wind Waker'', and the Hylian Alphabet used in ''Twilight Princess''. The first two are used for transcribing Japanese, while the last is used to transcribe English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hylian3.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224230727/http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hylian3.htm |archivedate=2012-02-24 |title=Hylian alphabet |publisher=omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor| Rupee (The Legend of Zelda)}}
The [[currency]] of Hyrule and other areas is called the {{nihongo|Rupee|ルピー|Rupī}}, named after [[Rupee|the real-world currency]]. They resemble [[hexagon]]al [[crystal]]s or [[Gemstone|gem]]s and come in various colors that determine their value. In ''Oracle of Seasons'', the Subrosian race accepts only [[Ore]] Chunks as currency, and in ''Four Swords Adventures'', Force Gems are used rather than Rupees. Rupees are also absent in ''The Adventure of Link'', which has no apparent in-game currency system. The original ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' only has flashing Rupees, worth one, and blue Rupees, worth five. In the original, they were called "Rupies," the singular being "Rupy"; this was later changed. Subsequent games introduced more colors and sizes for Rupees, each denoting a specific value. Generally, green Rupees have the least value, while huge gold or silver Rupees have the most. In ''Skyward Sword'' and ''Phantom Hourglass,'' black Rupees called "Rupoor" steal a certain quantity of Rupees depending on their size.

===Hyrulean geography===
[[File:MapOfHyrulePuzzle.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A map of Hyrule depicted in The Legend of Zelda Collector's Puzzle.]]
*{{Nihongo|'''Death Mountain'''|デスマウンテン|Desu Maunten}} is a large volcanic mountain located in the northern part of Hyrule. A race of rock eating [[Giant|giants]] known as Gorons inhabit the mountain. The entire mountain is littered with caves as a result of the Goron's [[mining]] activities.
*'''Spectacle Rock''' (メガネイワ Megane Iwa) is two large rock formations next to each other that resemble a pair of eyeglasses. It was the location of the final dungeon in the [[The Legend of Zelda|original game]]. It is usually associated with Death Mountain but in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]],'' it is located in the Gerudo Highlands instead.
*{{Nihongo|'''Ganon's Castle'''|ガノン城|Ganon-jō}} has acted as the final dungeon and battleground between Link and [[Ganon]] in several games.
* The {{Nihongo|'''Great Sea'''|大海原|Ōunabara}} is formed in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass|Phantom Hourglass]]'' after Hyrule was flooded by a [[flood myth|deluge]]. Only a few mountaintops are still visible above the water, and these form the 65 islands and [[archipelago]]s of the Great Sea. Due to the relatively small size of the many islands, the large expanses of ocean between each island require charts to navigate. On the islands of the Great Sea, local [[commerce]] is quite advanced. Most food is gathered from fishing and small farms, though there are also active merchant, salvage, and shipbuilding businesses. Tetra reestablished Hyrule on a new continent, which is where ''Spirit Tracks'' takes place; this is sometimes referred to as "New Hyrule" (although such terminology is never used in-game) to distinguish it from the original Hyrule destroyed at the end of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'', King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule: "Gods of the Triforce! Hear that which I desire! Hope! I desire hope for these children! Give them a future! Wash away this ancient land of Hyrule! Let a ray of hope shine on the future of the world!!! And let our destinies finally be fulfilled...Ganondorf! May you drown with Hyrule!!!"&lt;/ref&gt;''.''
*{{Nihongo|'''Hyrule Castle'''|ハイラル城|Hairaru-jō}} is the home of Hyrule’s royal family. The [[castle]]'s first appearance was in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]'', the third game in the series. It is often a central area that Link must enter during his quest.
*{{Nihongo|'''Kakariko Village'''|カカリコ村|Kakariko-mura}} is a village that first appears in ''A Link to the Past'' and has since reappeared in ''Ocarina of Time'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds|A Link Between Worlds]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]''. Kakariko is often portrayed as a small, prosperous town, but in ''Twilight Princess'', Shadow Beasts have kidnapped most of the villagers, making the town resemble a ghost town. The Hidden Village, another location in ''Twilight Princess'', has signs that say "Welcome to Old Kakariko" in the Anglian language.
*{{Nihongo|'''Lake Hylia'''|ハイリア湖|Hairia-ko}} is a large [[lake]] located in Hyrule. It is fed by a river coming from "Zora's Domain", the Zora race’s home.
*The {{Nihongo|'''Lost Woods'''|迷いの森|Mayoi no Mori}} is a large, forest that appears in various titles. Its maze-like structure leads travels in circles unless they take the correct path through the forest. Those who become lost in the forest are said to eventually turn into monsters. It's rumored that fairies live in the deepest parts of the forest under the watch of their guardian the Great Deku Tree. In several games, the Master Sword can be found in a shrine here. 
* {{nihongo|'''Temple of Time'''|時の神殿|Toki no Shinden}} is the temple that houses the Master Sword in ''Ocarina of Time''. The Master Sword is used to gain access to some areas, like the temple itself. Another temple, also known as the Temple of Time, is visited in Lanayru Desert during ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword|Skyward Sword]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'', Gorko: "Anyway, bud, there is something I am dying to tell you. It is the discovery of the century! This is a sacred place known as the Temple of Time."&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Skyloft''' (スカイロフト ''Sukai Rofuto'') is a collection of large islands floating above the clouds in Skyward Sword. The Goddess Hylia used the last of her power to raise what was left of the surviving Hylians along with a plot of land that was still free during the Great War with Demise. Below the clouds lies "the Surface". Found on the Surface are several locations visited in games that take place after the events of Skyward Sword: "Faron Woods" (Twilight Princess and Breath of the Wild), "Lake Floria" (Breath of the Wild), "Eldin" (Twilight Princess and Breath of the Wild), "Eldin Volcano" (Implied to be the series staple "Death Mountain"), and the arid "Lanayru Desert", which is seen as a fecund region in Twilight Princess and Breath of the Wild. The "Lanayru Mining Facility" has blue Time-Shift Stones that the Hyrule Historia ties to the titular blue ocarina from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''.

===Master Sword===
[[File:Master Sword.png|thumb|210px|Artwork of the Master Sword in its pedestal from ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'']]
The {{nihongo|Master Sword|マスターソード|Masutā Sōdo}}, also known as "The Blade of Evil's Bane", the "Sword of Resurrection",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aonuma ventures out into the wild to find the Master Sword of Resurrection|url= https://nintendowire.com/news/2017/02/03/aonuma-ventures-wild-find-master-sword-resurrection/ |publisher=NintendoWire |accessdate=12 July 2017|date= 2017-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "sword that seals the darkness" is a [[magic sword]] that often acts as the ultimate weapon for [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] as the chosen hero to defeat [[Ganon]] and a key to the Sacred Realm. First introduced in ''[[A Link To The Past]]'', it has the power to "repel evil", which enables it to overcome powerful dark magic and evil beings and keep them from using the sword. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]'', the blade originally began as the Goddess Sword, which has a sentient female avatar named Fi integrated into it. Eventually, the Goddess Sword transforms into its current state after being infused with the Three Sacred Flames with Fi's spirit form ceasing to be once the Master Sword absorbed Demise's remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/16/e3-2010-nintendo-developer-roundtable-live-blog E3 2010: Nintendo Developer Roundtable Live Blog]. [[IGN]], June 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sword traditionally rests in [[wiktionary:sacrosanct|sacrosanct]] locations indigenous to [[#Hyrule|Hyrule]], such as the Temple of Time or the Lost Woods. Similar to [[Arthurian legend]], the Master Sword is often first obtained by [[Sword in the stone (King Arthur)|pulling it from a stone pedestal]]. The sword is often not at full power, leading it to need to be "recharged" in some way, or have its power increased beyond its standard level to fight Ganon. There are some situations when the blade, already at full power, can be further improved; in ''[[A Link to the Past]]'', it was tempered to the Tempered Sword. It can later be upgraded to the Golden Sword. Similarly, in ''[[Twilight Princess]]'', the sword's power is increased by the two Sols in the Palace of Twilight. ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'' establishes that the sword needs the power of two sages praying to the gods to keep its powers, or else it will no longer be able to prevent an evil person from gaining the Triforce.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]], King of Red Lions: The fact that the Master Sword lost the power to repel evil suggests to me that something has happened to the sages who infused the blade with the gods’ power. The sages should be in Hyrule...  in the Wind Temple to the north and the Earth Temple to the south, praying to the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'' the Master Sword is the only unbreakable weapon in the game, though if it is used too often the sword's power needs to be recharged becoming temporarily unusable until it fully recharges. The sword is located in the Korok Forest, which Link can only access by going through the Lost Woods, and the game is notable as the first time in the series to explain why it came to be located there. Zelda moved it there to be guarded by the Great Deku Tree and to protect knowledge of its location from Calamity Ganon, while Link sleeps within the Shrine of Resurrection for 100 years. Link can travel to the Korok Forest at any point after receiving the Paraglider, though he can only remove the sword after obtaining 13 or more Heart Containers (temporary Yellow Hearts do not count) as removing it drains Link's hearts as a way to test his strength. In addition to its unbreakability, Link can also fire Sword Beams. It has a base damage of 30 but its true power glows when in the presence of pools of Calamity Ganon's Malice, Cursed Enemies, and all of Calamity Ganon's various forms and almost never runs out of energy.

Once removed, Link sees a vision of Zelda entrusting the Master Sword to the protection of the Great Deku Tree 100 years ago. During her conversation with him, Princess Zelda reveals that the sword spoke to her (which is implied to be the sword's spirit, Fi, whose consciousness apparently still exists within the sword though unable to manifest her spirit form) and told her that her destiny was not finished and that she still had something she must do, leading to Princess Zelda's sealing Calamity Ganon in Hyrule Castle for 100 years while Link slept. The weapon's in-game description reveals that the sword is delighted to be in Link's possession, echoing Fi's words at the end of ''Skyward Sword''. 100 years after Calamity Ganon was sealed in Hyrule Castle the sword became known across Hyrule as the Sword that Seals the Darkness and is sought by several travelers Link encounters despite the fact that only the chosen hero can wield its power. After obtaining the sword he can show it to these people. There is also a side-quest where Link must show it to a Hylian woman to prove he is the legendary Hero.

The Master Sword is a [[Arming sword|double-edged one-handed sword]]. The blade cross-section is hexagonal with no [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]]. On the flats of the blade near the [[hilt]] is a [[Triforce]] symbol, etched into the steel or emblazoned in gold. It has a blue or purple curved [[Guard (weapon)|crossguard]] in the shape of a pair of wings with a small yellow jewel where it meets the hilt. The hilt is often padded red with a non-ornate blue [[Pommel (sword)|pommel]]. Since ''The Wind Waker'', the Master Sword's blade glows white when it is revived by the [[Wise old man|sages]] in the mid-game. In ''Breath of the Wild'', this glow represents the True Master Sword's power. ''Breath of the Wild'' is the first game to depict the blade showing signs of wear and rust, when Zelda places it in its pedestal in Korok Forest, though 100 years later the Master Sword is shown to have been restored to its undamaged state, indicating that it can repair itself over time or that its physical condition is somehow tied to Link's as he had been heavily injured at that time and was placed in the Shrine of Resurrection to heal for 100 years. It may have also used Link's life force to repair itself explaining why it drains his heart containers while he is trying to remove it.

[[Nintendo Power]] listed the Master Sword as one of the best weapons in gaming: citing that it is more than just a powerful sword, but also integral to Link's adventures and development as a character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nintendo Power 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |page=44 |title-link=Nintendo Power }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triforce===
{{main|Triforce}}
[[File:Triforce.svg|thumb|210px|The Triforce is represented throughout the series as three conjoined golden triangles, with one triangle placed above the other two]]
The {{nihongo|Triforce|トライフォース|Toraifōsu}}, also called {{nihongo|"Power of the Gods"|神の力|Kami no Chikara}} and the {{nihongo|"Golden Triangle"|黄金の大三角|Ōgon no Dai-Sankaku}} in ''Twilight Princess'', is a triangular sacred [[relic]] that represents the essences of [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Golden Goddesses|the Golden Goddesses]]. It is made up of three smaller triangles known as the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Power]]|力のトライフォース|Chikara no Toraifōsu}}, the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Wisdom]]|知恵のトライフォース|Chie no Toraifōsu}}, and the {{nihongo|[[Triforce of Courage]]|勇気のトライフォース|Yūki no Toraifōsu}}. These embody the essences of [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|their respective goddesses]], and bestow certain boons on their bearers. In most of its appearances, the Triforce or its pieces manifest as a marking on the hands of their bearers. These markings resonate when near each other, and the Triforce pieces can emerge from their bearers.

When united, the Triforce allows one who touches it to make a wish that usually lasts until he dies or the wish is fulfilled. If the one who finds it does not possess a balance of the three virtues it represents, however, the pieces split into its three components and the finder is left with the one that represents the characteristic he values most; the other two pieces do likewise with two other characters "chosen by destiny". Ganon makes it his goal to obtain the Triforce in various games, often having a single piece himself (the Triforce of Power) that he uses to further his goals.

The Triforce of Power, which is positioned as the topmost of the three, holds the presence of Din, the goddess of Power, and radiates the physical and magical power of its bearer. It is associated with [[Ganon]], who is power-hungry. The Triforce of Wisdom, positioned on the lower left, embodies the essence of Nayru, the goddess of Wisdom, and amplifies the wisdom and mystical powers of its bearer. It is associated with [[Princess Zelda]], whose great wisdom brings peace and prosperity to Hyrule. The Triforce of Courage, positioned on the lower right, embodies the essence of Farore, the goddess of Courage, and seems to amplify the courage and adventuring skills of its bearer. It is associated with [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], the main protagonist of the series, who bravely defends Hyrule from Ganon and other malevolent forces.

==Other worlds==
===Termina===
{{nihongo|Termina|タルミナ|Tarumina}} is the name of a parallel world, or alternate reality, to Hyrule in ''Majora's Mask''.  The land has very similar geography to that of Hyrule and many of the characters are identical to the characters in ''Ocarina of Time''.  Notably, the Lost Woods appears in both games. The differences are the names of the locations and in Termina, there are four distinct regions, one in every compass direction, and the main town, Clock Town, in the center. Death Mountain and Woodfall are a pair, Ikana Canyon and the Gerudo Desert are a pair, the Great Bay and Lake Hylia, and Snowhead Mountain corresponds to Zora's Domain.

===Lorule===
{{nihongo|Lorule|ロウラル|Rouraru}} is a parallel world, or alternate reality, to Hyrule in ''A Link Between Worlds''. It is similar to Hyrule in both geography, features Lorulean counterparts of many people found in Hyrule, and is ruled by Princess Zelda’s Lorulean counterpart, Princess Hilda. Like Hyrule, Lorule originally had its own Triforce (which appears as an upside down Triforce) and was the source of various conflicts. However unlike Hyrule, the Royal Family of Lorule decided to destroy the Triforce in an attempt to put an end to conflict, only to bring calamity to their world as a result. Desperate to save the kingdom and her people, Princess Hilda conspired with her servant Yuga to steal Hyrule's Triforce, unaware that her actions were exactly the reason that her ancestors had destroyed Lorule's Triforce and that Yuga wanted the Triforce for himself. Eventually Yuga is defeated by Link and Hilda's former servant, Ravio, manages to show her the error of her ways. Ultimately Link and Zelda decide to forgive Hilda for her misguided actions and use the Triforce to restore the Lorulean Triforce, which in turn restores the land of Lorule.

===Others===
Several other parallel worlds to Hyrule exist, such as the Twilight Realm, the World of the Ocean King, and the Dark World from ''Twilight Princess'', ''The Phantom Hourglass'', and ''A Link to the Past'', respectively. Several other lands also exist beyond the kingdom. In ''Oracle of Ages'' and ''Oracle of Seasons'', Link travels to Labrynna and Holodrum. ''Triforce Heroes'' is set in Hytopia, a kingdom connected to Hyrule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |quote= Hyrule and Hytopia are connected. |author=Tri Force Heroes developers |date=October 22, 2015 |access-date=October 22, 2015 |url=https://www.facebook.com/NintendoHandheldGaming/photos/a.150955828309750.40686.149152295156770/953796588025666/?type=3 |title=Most games in The Legend of Zelda series have a connection to Hyrule. Does the land of Hytopia connect to Hyrule in any way? |website=Facebook}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Races==
===Anouki===
{{nihongo|Anouki|ユキワロシ|Yukiwaroshi}} are an Inuit-like race that appear to be a cross between a reindeer and penguins. There are different variations of them with purple, red, blue, and yellow shirts and facial hair or small or big antlers. They are found on the Isle of Frost in the World of Ocean King and in Anouki Village in New Hyrule. In ''Spirit Tracks'', the Anouki are the only race in the snow realm.

===Bokoblin===
Bokoblins are a race of human-sized [[Goblin]]-like creatures, that first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Bokoblins come in a variety of colors such as red, blue, and green. They often appear as standard enemies and wield Boko Sticks, machetes, and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In ''Twilight Princess'', they are less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by the more prevalent Bulblins. In ''Skyward Sword'', Bokoblins are revealed to have been around since ancient times and are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and his master, the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces different varieties of Bokoblin such as Technoblins, which lived in Lanayru Desert in the distant past and wield ancient technology and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that can curse Link. The game introduces the bow wielding Bokoblin Archers and Bokoblin Leaders that can summon other Bokoblins using the Monster Horns they carry. Red Bokoblins are most commonly encountered on the game's overworld, while green Bokoblins are encountered in dungeons. Blue Bokoblins appear in later stages of the game and effectively replace red Bokoblins. In ''Breath of the Wild'', Bokoblin are revealed to have an omnivorous diet that consists of fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat. They also can occasionally be seen eating food and hunting wild animals for their meat, which they will consume after a successful kill. Bokoblins can wield a variety of weapons, bows, and shields though tend to favor their own crafted clubs, bats, spears, and bows, the strongest of which are made from Dragonbone. Like in ''The Wind Waker'', Link can keep their weapons. The game also introduces another undead variant of Bokoblin called Stalkoblin, which raise from the ground at night and will continuously regenerate unless all Stalkoblin skulls in the area are destroyed, because a single skull can reanimate its headless comrades. Link can pick up and wield Bokoblin Arms left behind by defeated Stalkoblins. The game also introduces stronger Black Bokoblins and Silver Bokoblins. Cursed Bokoblins return but are depicted in ''Breath of the Wild'' as floating Stalkoblin skulls corrupted by Calamity Ganon's malice and are spawned from mouths located in pools of Malice.

Red Bokoblins and Stalkoblins drop Bokoblin Horns and Bokoblin Fangs, while Blue, Black, and Silver Bokoblins drop those parts along with Bokoblin Guts. These monster parts can be sold to shops and merchants for Rupees or to Kilton for ''Mon'' at the Fang and Bone shop, though Link can also cook them with bugs to make Elixirs or use them as materials by one of the four Great Fairies to upgrade Link's armor. Link can also buy a Bokoblin Mask from Kilton at Fang and Bone, which allows him to disguise himself as a Bokoblin and blend in with them.

===Bulblin===
{{nihongo|Bulblins|ブルブリン|Buruburin}} are a green, horned race that resemble the [[orc]]s of classic fantasy. They are led by {{nihongo|King Bulblin|キングブルブリン|Kingu Buruburin}},&lt;ref name="BulblinTrophy"&gt;&lt;!--"Creatures that serve under King Bulblin. They follow their superiors and pillage the land like hyenas. They typically attack with spears and fiery arrows but sometimes attack while mounted on boarlike beasts. They're not the strongest creatures but can prove dangerous in packs. "--&gt; [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]] (2008). In-game trophy description "Bulblin" trophy.&lt;/ref&gt; who unlike the rest has the ability to talk.&lt;ref&gt;"King Bulblin... When he loses in his final battle, he pays subtle respect to Link when he says, 'I follow the strongest side!'". [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008). Trophy description of the "King Bulblin" trophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Bulblins usually fight with heavy clubs or flaming arrows and commonly ride on boars. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]].'' King Bulblin appears as an obstacle in the Bridge of Eldin stage in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.

===Cobble===
The Cobble are a race that appear in ''Phantom Hourglass''. The Cobble once inhabited a prosperous land called the Cobble Kingdom. By the time the game takes place, the only Cobble that remain are the ghosts of the soldiers and King Mutoh, who dress in ancient Egyptian-like clothes and live in pyramid-like temples. The Isle of Ruins in the Northeastern Sea is all that remains of the once-mighty kingdom, and Link must visit there to retrieve the Aquanine, a pure metal entrusted to the Cobble by the Ocean King. There, he delves beneath Mutoh's Temple and destroys a corrupt Cobble war machine that is disrupting the king's eternal rest. Astrid, the fortune-teller living on the Isle of Ember, tells Link that she and her deceased assistant, Kayo, are part of the Cobble race.

===Deku===
The {{nihongo|Deku|デクナッツ|Dekunattsu}} are a race of plant-like creatures introduced in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' that appear mostly in the [[overworld]] and dungeons. Deku are small creatures with leaves sprouting out from their heads. They often have red glowing eyes and tube-like mouths that can shoot Deku Nuts. Their bodies consist of wood and leaves and perish quickly if set on fire. They can fly by using large leaves to glide, and some can use the leaves on their head to fly indefinitely after taking off from a "Deku Flower." There are four types of Deku depicted in the series: Deku Scrubs, Mad Scrubs, Business Scrubs, and Royal Scrubs. Deku Scrubs are the most common type, which have green leaves and often give information when caught. Mad Scrubs are violent, have red and yellow leaves, and do not talk. Business Scrubs are traders who offer to sell their wares and services. Royal Scrubs have larger heads, bigger eyes, smaller mouths, and extra leaves covering their body. In ''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of an unknown deceased Deku Scrub who is heavily implied to be the son of the Deku King's butler. In this form, Link can temporarily fly using a Deku Flower, shoot bubbles, and hop on deep water five times before sinking.

===Dragon===
[[Dragon]]s are a recurring race that appears in several titles. Dragons usually appear as benevolent guardians or powerful enemies. In ''Ocarina of Time'', after becoming the King of Evil, Ganondorf resurrects the evil Goron-eating dragon Volvagia, who had terrorized the Goron people in the distant past before being defeated by Darunia’s ancestor, who wielded the Megaton Hammer. When Ganondorf orders his minions to capture and feed the Gorons to Volvagia as a warning to his enemies, Darunia journeys to the Fire Temple to rescue his people and defeat Volvagia, but he is defeated because he was unable to locate the Megaton Hammer. However, Link manages to free the Gorons, find the Megaton Hammer, slay Volvagia, and awaken Darunia as the Sage of Fire. In ''The Wind Waker'', the Sky Spirit Valoo acts as the protector and patron deity of the Rito tribe, providing them with his scales that allow them to grow wings. When Link arrives on Dragon Roost Island, he discovers that Gohma was tormenting Valoo. He defeats Gohma to obtain Din's Pearl, which had been entrusted to Valoo; he later entrusted it to the Rito. Valoo and the Rito later repay their debt to Link by rescuing him and Tetra from Ganondorf during their encounter with him in Forsaken Fortress. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link encounters a species of malevolent draconic warriors called Aeralfos and the massive Twilit dragon Argorok, who is the boss of the City in the Sky. In ''Skyward Sword'', Link is aided by the Three Dragons that guard the three regions of the Surface. Faron the Water Dragon rules over the Parella and protector of Faron Woods, Lake Floria, and the Ancient Cistern that holds Farore's Flame. Eldin the Fire Dragon guards Eldin Volcano. Lanayru the Thunder Dragon created the Ancient Robots and protects Lanayru Desert. Each dragon was entrusted with part of the Song of the Hero, which provides clues on the location of the Triforce. During his quest for Farore's Flame, Link aids Faron, who had been injured while fighting Ghirahim; she leads him to the Ancient Cistern. During his quest for the Song of the Hero, Link encounters Eldin after he is captured and imprisoned by Bokoblins during an eruption. Link learns that the Fire Dragon had caused the eruption, and the dragon apologizes to Link for all the trouble it caused him. Unlike the other two dragons who are alive in the present, Lanayru is shown to have died from an illness in the past, forcing Link to go back in time, cure him of his illness, and prevent his death. After curing him and learning his part of the song, Lanayru will allow Link to take part in the Lightning Round, which allows him to face a boss battle challenge and a Silent Realm challenge for various prizes. If Link completes eight boss battles, Lanayru will reward him with the unbreakable Hylian Shield, the strongest shield in the game.

In [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]], the three incarnations of Din, Farore, and Nayru are large dragons named Dinraal, Farosh, and Naydra respectively.

===Fairy===
[[File:The Legend of Zelda - Fairy.svg|thumb|Representation of a fairy]]
{{nihongo|[[Fairy|Fairies]]|妖精|[[Yōsei]]}} are a magical race associated with nature and the Goddess Farore that aid Link during his quest in several games in the series. Fairies appear as small, winged [[humanoid]]s who are often obscured by light. They can be found in many places, but usually reside in a Fairy Fountain or Fairy Spring, sometimes under the protection of a {{nihongo|Great Fairy|大妖精|Dai-yōsei}}, which are the size of humans or even larger. These Fairies from the fountains will heal Link when he approaches, and if he catches one in a bottle, Link can release the fairy to have it heal him, or it will automatically resurrect him if he dies. In ''Ocarina of Time'', Guardian Fairies travel with the Kokiri and give them advice. One of these is [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]], who serves as Link's guardian fairy, or Tatl in ''Majora's Mask''. In ''Phantom Hourglass'', Link's guardian fairy is Ciela, who is eventually joined by two more fairies, Leaf and Neri. In some of the games, such as ''The Minish Cap'', players will be tested of their honesty and if they are, fairies give them gifts and upgrades.

In [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]], fairies can be found around the springs of the four great fairies. There is a fifth fairy named Malayna, but she is not a Great Fairy. She is the Horse God who will revive dead horses. Fairies can be used to cook potions and other food. If they are used in making a dish, they will help you cook and increase the amount of hearts the food heals before disappearing from your inventory.

===Gerudo===
The {{nihongo|Gerudo|ゲルド}} are a tribe of humanoid [[Theft|thieves]] who mainly live in the desert. Physical Gerudo traits typically include bronzed skin, scarlet hair, aquiline noses, gold eyes and round ears. Evil Gerudo like Ganondorf and the Twinrova Sisters possess an olive skin color. Apart from a single Gerudo male who is born every century, the race consists entirely of women. By Gerudo law, this man must become king of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Nabooru: "A kid like you may not know this, but the Gerudo race consists only of women. Only one man is born every hundred years… Even though our laws say that lone male Gerudo must become King of the Gerudo, I'll never bow to such an evil man!"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ganon]]dorf, the main antagonist of the series, is king of the Gerudo in ''Ocarina of Time'' and the surrogate son of the Gerudo witches Kotake and Koume. Gerudo appear as pirates in ''Majora's Mask'', where they live in the ocean at Great Bay, and are ruled by a woman instead of a man, presumably because there are not any male Gerudo alive at the present moment, one that is alive is still a child, or the law itself does not exist among Termina's Gerudo population.  These Gerudo are enemies of the Zoras. They search for treasures in the sea and assault Zora and fishermen but do not approach Clock Town. In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', only "vai" or women are permitted in the town. "Voe" or men are forbidden entry to Gerudo Town. [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] has to dress up as a female in order to enter the town. After gaining entrance to Gerudo Town, Link has to speak with the Gerudo chief Riju. Link must retrieve a thunder-resistant helmet known as the Thunder Helm from a clan of thieves called the Yiga, a traitorous formation who broke away from the Sheikah tribe. The helm is used to board the Divine Beast of thunder, Vah Naboris, named after the Sage of Spirit, Nabooru, as stated by the spirit of former Gerudo Champion Urbosa, who was killed by one of Ganon's creations aboard the Divine Beast.

===Goron===
[[File:Goron.JPG|thumb|A Goron, as seen in ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'']]
The {{nihongo|Goron|ゴロン}} are a race of strong and peaceful mountain-dwelling [[Giant|giants]] who first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''. Goron culture revolves around brotherhood and strength, usually referring to each other and those they deem strong as "Brother" or "Big Brother". Gorons show high regard for individuals who display great strength and bravery and enjoy matching their strength with others in competition such as [[sumo wrestling]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--"They like sumo wrestling"--&gt;In-game trophy description of a "Goron" from [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[racing]]. While not all ''Zelda'' games featuring Gorons include full tribes, the games that do depict tribes depict them as headed by a single [[patriarch]] who is aided by one or more elders who assume leadership of the tribe in the event that the patriarch cannot. {{nihongo|Darunia|ダルニア}} is the patriarch in ''Ocarina of Time''. The Goron elders in ''Twilight Princess'' are: {{nihongo|Gor Coron|ドン・コローネ|Don Korōne}}, {{nihongo|Gor Amoto|ドン・シーゲル|Don Sīgeru}} {{nihongo|Gor Ebizo|ドン・エビーゾ|Don Ebīzo}}, and {{nihongo|Gor Liggs|ドン・レゲーヌ|Don Regēnu}}.

One of the oldest races in Hyrule, Gorons' bodies are resistant to intense heat and lava and they consume rocks and minerals,&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap'', Goron figurine: "These rock- and iron-eaters once lived on Mount Crenel in Western Hyrule."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: "You shouldn't be so picky about what you eat! Do you eat all of your green rocks? If you don't, you won't grow up big and strong!"&lt;/ref&gt; which they mine from the earth. By adulthood, most Gorons gain rock-like protrusions on their backs and sometimes on their arms and head as well. These stony growths (which may be a side affect of the Goron's diet) act as a natural armor and continue to grow as the Goron ages. Gorons enter the [[fetal position]], similar to an [[armadillo]], when resting, and can also assume this position for self defense or to travel at high speed by [[Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend|rolling]]. Gorons endowed with magic power can sprout metal spikes from their body while rolling.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani's memorial: "If Gorons who possess magic power roll swiftly enough, spikes will emerge from their bodies so that they may mow down enemies."&lt;/ref&gt;

For leisure, Gorons enjoy music and dance, rolling and racing,&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Goron: “This wild rolling is the only way to relieve my stress!” […] “Let me express my joy with more wild rolling!”&lt;/ref&gt; games,&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages'', Goron: "We Gorons love games!"&lt;/ref&gt; sumo wrestling, and bathing in hot springs. Gorons have taken on occupations such as crafting, blacksmithing, sculpting, demolition, and merchantry (usually explosives, which they are experts in producing). Rock sirloin, [[amber]], and metal shields are some Goron delicacies. 

Three Gorons appear in ''Skyward Sword:'' Gorko, Golo, and Gortram. Gorko and his assistant Golo, are shown working as archaeologists; Gorko travels the land researching ancient artifacts and ruins, while Golo excavates the Lanayru Caves. Unlike the other two, Gortram works as the proprietor of the Rickety Coaster mine cart ride at the abandoned Lanayru Shipyards. All three Gorons are encountered in the Lanayru Desert region at some point and the Lanayru Caves seems to serve as the base of operations for Gorko and Golo as there are signs on the wall that pertain to their research into various regions of the desert.

Gorons are large humanoids with long muscular arms, stout legs, hulking shoulders and necks, and rotund bellies. Their skin is generally beige in color and their hair is typically white. Gorons lack external hearing organs; Goron ears are instead holes on the sides of their heads. Most are as tall as a large human though, though some individuals such as {{nihongo|Biggoron|ダイゴロン|Daigoron}} can grow as large as a mountain. To date, no female Gorons have been seen in the series, however child and baby Gorons do appear and Darunia even has a son during the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. Due to their great density, Gorons sink to the bottom of bodies of water and are thus helpless in such an environment. However, they do not need to breath to survive, as a Goron child proves by resting underwater and mentioning that he never feels the need to take a breath. Also, in ''Twilight Princess'', a Goron becomes permanently submerged in the main pool in Zora's Domain, but enjoys the cold water rather than drowning.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Darmani III's memorial: "Water is disastrous for Goron heroes, for they sink like stones and are rendered motionless in the deep. Beware."&lt;/ref&gt; Gorons are exceptionally resistant to heat and can walk through shallow [[lava]].

In ''The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask'', Link can inhabit the body of the deceased Goron hero Darmani and roll and punch as hard as the Megaton Hammer from ''Ocarina of Time.''

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', the Gorons are encountered all over Hyrule, but mostly appear in the Eldin region. They live around Death Mountain, which Link must use heat-resistant armor or elixirs to enter. The Gorons help the player conquer the Divine Beast Vah Rudania on top of Death Mountain. The Goron Champion Daruk appears as a spirit after regaining control of Vah Rudania, since one of Ganon’s creations killed him one hundred years prior to the events of the game.

===Hylian===&lt;!-- In the official game they call them "Hylians". They also call them this on Zelda Universe. (Nintendo's official website) --&gt;
{{nihongo|Hylians|ハイリア族|Hairia-zoku}} are an [[elf]]-like race that make up the main population of Hyrule, which they established organized civilization on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |title=Zelda Universe |publisher=Zelda.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207075201/http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/h.jsp |archive-date=2013-02-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are born with magic-infused blood said to be a gift from [[List of recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#The Golden Goddesses|the goddesses]] that grants them psychic powers and magical skill. Their long pointed ears are said to allow them to hear messages sent by the gods. Link and Princess Zelda belong to this race in all games of the series. In some games, such as ''Twilight Princess'', Hylians are referred to as "humans". In ''Skyward Sword'', Hylians live on a floating island known as Skyloft and are accompanied by bird-like creatures called Loftwings.

===Keaton===
{{nihongo|Keaton|キータン|Kītan}} are a three-tailed fox-like race mostly found in Termina. They normally stay hidden from sight, but reveal themselves to Link and challenge him with a quiz if he wears a Keaton Mask. No known Keaton exist in Hyrule in ''Ocarina of Time'', although at least one of them is a well-known fictional character in Hyrule Castle Town.&lt;ref name="Keaton-1"&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'': "Oh, I know that character! It's Keaton! He's very hot in Hyrule Castle Town right now!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keaton-2"&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', Death Mountain Guard: "Oh? Is that a "Kee...something..." character mask? I heard he's very popular recently? He's my boy's favorite."&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Minish Cap'', however, some thuggish Keaton roam the Hyrule countryside, walking on their hindpaws and having only one tail instead of three; if they injure Link, he loses some Rupees.

===Kikwi===
The {{nihongo|Kikwi|キュイ族|Kyui-zoku}} are a race in ''Skyward Sword'' who inhabit the Faron Woods region. They have the appearance of black-and-white masked wingless birds. Their name is a reference to the kiwi bird and fruit, which they resemble. They can partially bury themselves underground and cause a plant to blossom from their backs for camouflage.

===Kokiri and Koroks===
The {{nihongo|Kokiri|コキリ族|Kokiri-zoku}} are a [[pixie]]-like race who inhabit the Kokiri Forest. They were created by the Great Deku Tree who considers them to be his children, and each receives a small fairy that is their lifelong friend, guardian, and teacher. Cautious and secretive, the Kokiri believe that they will die if they leave the forest.&lt;ref&gt;'': Ocarina of Time'', Kokiri boy: "The Great Deku Tree said that if a Kokiri leaves the woods, he or she will die!"&lt;/ref&gt; This belief seems to be false, as Saria leaves the forest when she becomes the Forest Sage. It is possible that the Deku Tree actually meant that he wouldn't be able to protect the Kokiri if they leave the forest or that the forest actually keeps the Kokiri young and if they will grow old and die if they leave the forest. It is also suggested that if they wander too deep into the forest, they will turn into a Skull Kid, although this has not been proven definitively.

A Kokiri named Saria is the Sage of the Forest. Another Kokiri, Fado, is the first Sage of Wind in ''The Wind Waker'', but he is killed prior to the events of the game, leaving the player to interact with his spirit and locate his successor, the Korok Makar. Link was raised as a Kokiri in ''Ocarina of Time'', but he is actually a Hylian whose mother entrusted the Great Deku Tree with his care when he was an infant.

The {{nihongo|Koroks|コログ|Korogu}} of ''The Wind Waker'' are said to have been transformed from the Kokiri after the Great Flood.&lt;ref name="Kokiri forms"&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'', Great Deku Tree: "Once upon a time, long ago, the Koroks took on human forms, but when they came to live on the sea, they took these shapes."&lt;/ref&gt; They are small creatures with wood-like bodies and masks made from leaves. They are very light, which allows them to travel by using sprouts as propellers. They leave their home, the "Forest Haven", to plant seeds from the Great Deku Tree all over the world, and return once a year to hold a ceremony and obtain more seeds.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', Koroks can be found all over Hyrule. Once the player retrieves Korok Seeds from Koroks, one can trade it with Hestu, a large Korok, for more inventory slots for swords, shields, and bows. However, the player must first retrieve Hestu's maracas from a group of Bokoblins. He will then retreat to the Korok Forest, location of the Great Deku Tree and the Master Sword.

===Lokomo===
{{nihongo|Lokomos|ロコモ|Rokomo}} are a humanoid race who first appear in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks]]''. All but one of the encountered Lokomo are sages who reside in the five realms of New Hyrule and the Tower of Spirits. They are distinguishable by their pointed ears and short legs, the latter of which forces them to use motorized carts for transportation.  However, an exceptionally strong Lokomo named Byrne is capable of walking on his legs.

===Oocca===
The {{nihongo|Oocca|天空人|Tenkū-jin|lit. "sky people"}}  are a race of birds with long necks and human-like faces that appear in ''Twilight Princess''. They live in the {{nihongo|"City in the Sky"|天空都市|Tenkū Toshi}},&lt;ref&gt;"One of the Oocca, Ooccoo travels around with her son in search of a means to return to her home, the City in the Sky." [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. (2008). Ooccoo &amp; Son in-game trophy description.&lt;/ref&gt; an airborne city that acts as the seventh [[dungeon]] in ''Twilight Princess''. A female Oocca named {{nihongo|Ooccoo|おばちゃん|Oba-chan}} can warp the player back to the entrance of the game’s dungeons. Ooccoo's son, {{nihongo|Ooccoo Jr|ぼくちゃん|Boku-chan}}, warps the player to Ooccoo’s location. They bear a striking resemblance to the statue in [[M.C. Escher]] painting, [[Another World (M. C. Escher)|Another World]]. In ''Twilight Princess'', these creatures are mentioned to be closer to the gods than the Hylians. It is supposed that they created Hylians and created a city in the sky for them to live in. In ''Twilight Princess'', Link reaches this city by launching himself out of an enormous ancient cannon.

===Minish===
Minish, also referred to as {{nihongo|Picori|ピッコル|Pikkoru|inspired by the [[Koropokkuru]]}}, are small humanoid creatures that tend to be helpful, although {{nihongo|Vaati|グフー|Gufū}} was an evil Picori. They are only visible to children and tend to live in forests, but also appear inside of buildings and holes in and around various spots of Hyrule. There are three variations of the Minish, which can be distinguished by their attire: Forest Minish, Town Minish and Mountain Minish. They first appear in ''The Minish Cap''.

===Mogma===
The {{nihongo|Mogma|モグマ族|Moguma-zoku}} are a mole-like race from ''Skyward Sword'' who live in the Eldin Volcano region. They appear to be anthropmorphic rodents with long arms and distinctive hairstyles. The Mogma hide underground by burrowing with their claws. They are demolition experts who like digging for treasure and are known to never go anywhere without their bomb bag.  Mogmas are found in Eldin Volcano and play major parts in the plot of the Volcano Summit, Eldin Volcano, the Fire Sanctuary, and the Earth Temple.

===Parella===
The {{nihongo|Parella|パラゲ族|Parage-zoku}} are an aquatic race from ''Skyward Sword'' who live in the underwater spiraling caverns of Lake Floria. They are a squid-like race who resemble the aquatic Octoroks from ''Ocarina of Time''. Conical spirals appear as their central body and the shape of their dwellings.

===Rito===
The {{nihongo|Rito|リト}} are a race of bird-like humanoids who debuted in ''The Wind Waker''. In that game, they lived on Dragon Roost Island, an island on the Great Sea. They have a tribal elder and elaborately dressed guards. No Rito is born with wings, and instead, must visit their guardian, the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in a coming-of-age ceremony to receive one of his scales, which enables them to grow wings.  Wingless Rito children are called Fledglings.

Rito are viewed upon by outsiders somewhat dubiously. Some have an inexplicable bigotry directed towards them, perhaps out of jealousy. Still, Rito are widely accepted as mail carriers because they can quickly traverse the seas. Rito are capable of flying quickly, and full-grown members can carry humans for a short time.

Rito appear to be covered by dark shaded skin or feathers. Most Rito have red eyes, but the Rito Chieftain has yellow eyes. They have pointed ears,  bird-like feet, and a beak whose shape and size varies from Rito to Rito. Unlike real-life birds, his beak appears to only be used for smelling, and cannot be used as a mouth. However, the Rito have a mouth below this beak.

Throughout a young Rito's childhood, he or she is called a Fledgling and is flightless without any wings. After a child reaches a certain age they can receive their wings after they retrieve a scale from the dragon Valoo. Their wings are unique in that they protrude from their forearms, similar to where a Zora's fins would be. These appear similar to the sleeves of a cloak when the Rito is not in flight. While not in use,  Rito wings are mostly white with black colored plumage along the ends. When in flight the top of a Rito's wings are colored brown with black along the edges while the bottoms of the wings contain white colored plumage along the wings interior. However Medli has pure white colored wings, possibly suggesting that female Rito have white wings or that her wings are not fully grown yet. Most Rito can fly over a great distance and hover in place, but some have trouble flying for long periods of time, likely due to inexperience.

In [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]], the Rito reside in the Tabantha region in Northwest Hyrule. The Rito can't fly at a preferred height because the Divine Beast Vah Medoh, named after Medli, the Sage of Earth, shoots down Rito who fly at its height. The Rito warrior Teba helps you board Vah Medoh, but is severely injured by Medoh's cannons. The Rito Champion Revali appears as a spirit because he was killed by one of Ganon's creations. He regains control of Vah Medoh and prepares to blast Ganon when Link fights Ganon. Notably, Revali resents Link, stating that he has many skills as an archer, and that he was only called to assist Link because Link has the Master Sword.

===Ancient Robots===
The {{nihongo|Ancient Robots|RS-301}} are a mechanical race from ''Skyward Sword''. They were created by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru, but their land eventually became a barren desert while they rusted away. By using a Timeshift Stone they can be revived and serve three purposes. Some of them mine for Timeshift Stones, one group protected one of the Sacred Flames, and a small number act as Lanayru’s servants. In addition there is a band of Ancient Robot Pirates, though only two of them are seen throughout the entire game: LD-002S Scervo on the Sandship, and LD-003D Dreadfuse in the Sky Keep. During Link's quest for Nayru's Flame, Link is aided by a robot named Skipper, who is captain of the Sandship and its crew that lost his ship to the Pirate Scervo. Like most Ancient Robots, Link can only interact with Skipper in the Timeshifted past. Skipper aids Link in traversing the Lanayru Sand Sea using his Timeshift Stone powered motorboat, which can transform the impassible sea of sand into the ancient sea of water that once existed in the past. Also, Gondo, one of the citizens of Skyloft, owns an Ancient Robot that he inherited from his grandfather; at one point in the game this robot, named Scrapper, is restored to full functionality, and assists Link by carrying cumbersome items up to Skyloft from the surface. Gondo reveals that the Ancient Robots require the oil produced by Ancient Flowers to function. As these flowers can no longer be found in the present day Lanayru Desert, it is implied that the flowers disappearance resulted in the decline of the LD-301 Series Ancient Robots, though Link is able to obtain an Ancient Flower from the timeshifted past and Gondo is able to use its oil to repair Scrapper. Most ancient robots are part of the mass-produced LD-301 Series, including LD-301S Scrapper and LD-301N Skipper, while Servo and Dreadfuse are part of the LD-002 and LD-003 series, which unlike the LD-301 Series remain functional in the present.

In ''Breath of the Wild'', similar robots exist called Guardians and Divine Beasts. Divine Beast Vah Ruta represented Ruto and the Zora. Divine Beast Vah Rudania represents Darunia and the Gorons. Divine Beast Vah Naboris represents Nabooru and the Gerudo. Divine Beast Vah Medoh represents Medli and the Rito. The Guardians are ancient mechanisms with powerful sniper blasts. The robots were intended to be used to defeat Ganon, but Ganon used his power to turn the robots against Hyrule. Mipha, the Zora Princess and Champion, Urbosa, the Gerudo Champion, Daruk, the Goron Champion, and Revali, the Rito Champion, were killed by the Blight Ganons in the Divine Beasts. The Blight Ganons were Ganon's creations, representing the element of the Divine Beast i.e. Thunderblight Ganon for Vah Naboris of the Gerudo.

===Sheikah===
The {{nihongo|Sheikah|シーカー|Shīkā}} are an ancient clan of mysterious [[ninja]]-like warriors who are often referred to as the "shadows" of the Hylians and protect the Hylian Royal Family.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', old man: "Have you heard the legend of the "Shadow Folk"? They are the Sheikah...the shadows of the Hylians. They say they swore allegiance to the King of Hyrule and guarded the Royal Family."&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in ''Skyward Sword'', the Sheikah are servants of the goddess Hylia, whose reincarnation is Zelda. The Sheikah have long life spans compared to Hylians. The Sheikah crying eye symbol is commonly seen in the series, even in games where the Sheikah are not present. It is alluded that the tear was added after the Hyrule Civil War, which took place some time before the events of ''Ocarina of Time''. By the events of ''Ocarina of Time'', the Sheikah are referred to as an extinct race with Impa among the last few members. The Sheikah also built the Shadow Temple for unknown reasons. It is said that the Sheikah people were fascinated by a search for truth as they created the Mask of Truth (sold by the Happy Mask Salesmen of Hyrule Castle Town in ''Ocarina of Time''). In ''Skyward Sword'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''Majora's Mask'', Sheikah Stones or Gossip Stones created by the Sheikah give Link information on where to go and what to do.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', the ancient Sheikah invented the Divine Beasts, Guardian Stalkers, Guardian Turrets, Guardian Skywatchers and Guardian Sentries 10,000 years before the Great Calamity to fight Ganon. The Sheikah reside primarily in Kakariko Village. Link also possesses a Sheikah Slate, a piece of ancient technology that can be upgraded with various runes. The four primary Runes are Magnesis, which can move metallic objects; Remote Bombs, circular or cube-shaped bombs that can remotely detonate once thrown or dropped; Stasis, which can freeze objects and temporarily freeze monsters when upgraded; and Cryonis, which can create icy blocks on watery surfaces.

Additionally in ''Breath of the Wild'', a group of Sheikah led by Master Kohga swore allegiance to Ganon and formed the Yiga Clan after the Great Calamity, vowing to destroy Ganon’s enemies. Their hideout is located in Karusa Valley in the Gerudo Highlands. They spawn throughout the world and sometimes appear as lost travelers or merchants who will attack Link if he talks to them. There are three types of Yiga: Yiga Footsoldiers, who commonly carry a bow or sword; Yiga Blademasters, who carry around a Windcleaver, and Master Kogha, who is referenced by almost every disguised Yiga.

===Light Spirits===
There are four {{nihongo|Light Spirits|光の精霊|Hikari no Seirei}} throughout Hyrule in ''Twilight Princess''.

The first light spirit is {{Nihongo|Ordona|ラトアーヌ|Ratoānu}}, who resembles an Ordon Goat. Ordona has an orb between her antlers and first appears at Ordon Spring when Link has defeated the first Shadow Beast.

The second light spirit, {{nihongo|Faron|フィローネ|Firōne}}, resembles a monkey or ape. He holds his golden orb with his tail over his head. He appears in Faron Spring when Link has completed the first collection of twilight bugs.

The third light spirit, {{nihongo|Eldin|オルディン|Orudin}}, resembles an eagle with his orb between his feet. He appears in the lake near the shaman's house in Kakariko Village once Link has completed the second collection of twilight bugs.

The fourth and last light spirit, {{nihongo|Lanayru|ラネール|Ranēru}}, resembles a serpent with his orb inside his mouth. He appears in the cave at Lake Hylia when Link has completed the third and final collection of twilight bugs. But after Lanayru tells Link the story of the three goddesses and the three Fused Shadows, Zant appears and embeds the Shadow Crystal in Link's skull that later allows him to transform between his human and wolf form. He also exposes Midna to Lanayru’s light causing her to become very ill and sends Link on the quest for the Master Sword.

===Subrosian===
{{nihongo|Subrosians|ウーラ|Ūra}} are a mysterious race that live in the subterranean world of Subrosia in ''Oracle of Seasons''. They have large glowing eyes and are always seen wearing either green, blue or red hooded cloaks. There are two exceptions: Rosa, who wears a yellow cloak with a ribbon, and another unnamed yellow-clothed Subrosian who gives Link a Secret to use in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are shy when around people of other races and prefer to be rarely seen. They can survive in lava and use a currency made of metal rocks found in the ground called Ore Chunks.

===Tokay===
{{nihongo|Tokay|トカゲ人|Tokage-jin|lit. "lizard people"}} are a race of green-scaled lizards who reside on Crescent Island in Labrynna in ''Oracle of Ages''. They are known to search for valuable items and be deceitful. They are also expert gardeners which are able to grow scent seeds from seedlings over a course of four hundred years. They have never seen anyone from other races so when they see Link, they think he is a Tokay without a tail and call him "Strange Tokay".

===Twili===
{{nihongo|Twili|トワイライトの民|Towairaito no Tami}} are a race that come from the Twilight Realm. They are the descendants of the Dark Interlopers, who were sent to the Twilight Realm by the {{nihongo|Golden Goddesses|三柱の女神|Mihashira no Megami &lt;small&gt;Three Goddesses&lt;/small&gt;}} after trying to seize control of the Sacred Realm. Eventually, they abandoned their plans to rule the Sacred Realm and Hyrule and became peacefully adapted to the Twilight Realm. One member of their race is {{nihongo|[[Midna]]|ミドナ|Midona}}. They first appeared in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]''. {{nihongo|Zant|ザント|Zanto}} was also part of this race. He overthrew Midna with Ganon’s help and helped Ganon take over Hyrule.

The skin tone of the Twili is mostly black while their faces, necks, and chest tend to be gray. The Twili have long limbs, necks, and heads, and great variances in appearance.

===Wizzrobes===
{{nihongo|Wizzrobes|ウィズローブ|Wizurōbu}} are [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] creatures that wear [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] robes (hence their name) and often use fire and ice magic. In ''The Wind Waker'' they can also summon other enemies and wear [[toucan]]-like or bird-like masks and headdresses. They first appeared in the first ''The Legend of Zelda'' game.

''Breath of the Wild'' introduced Electric Wizzrobes, who use Lighting or Thunderstorm Rods. They can teleport and shoot electricity. The other Wizzrobes can also teleport and shoot fire and ice respectively.

===Yeti===
{{nihongo|Yeta|マトーニャ|Matōnya}} and {{nihongo|Yeto|ドサンコフ|Dosankofu}} in Snowpeak Ruins in the game ''Twilight Princess'' were {{nihongo|[[Yeti]]s|雪男|yukiotoko}}.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--"The wife of Yeto. She is a yeti who lives in the Snowpeak Ruins... she became possessed by the mirror and was transformed into the great, icy Blizzeta"--&gt;[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]] (2008) In-game trophy description of the "Yeta" trophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeto helps Link by giving him soup that heals up to eight hearts of his health. Male yetis look like the 'real-life' [[Yeti]] only they have large, beaver tails, have saddles for hats and speak with poor grammar. The females, however, are smaller than the males and wear an armless sweater, showing no arms or tail.

===Zora===
The {{nihongo|Zora|ゾーラ|Zōra}{ZOR-ah}} are a race of aquatic [[piscine humanoid]]s that appear in nearly every game of the series. In the original game and ''Link to the Past'', Zoras were an enemy race that attacked Link from the water with projectiles, though the giant Zora King sells Link a pair of flippers in ''A Link to the Past'', allowing him to swim and to use the network of whirlpools that link far corners of Hyrule. By ''Ocarina of Time'', their role in most stories had changed to a neutral or friendly race. Zoras rely heavily on water, in fact they can only live on land "for limited time periods,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Super Smash Brothers Brawl]] (2008). In game trophy description of the "Zora" trophy.&lt;/ref&gt; and reflect this dependency in their culture. Zoras are mostly seen gracefully swimming about and frolicking in water. Besides routine swimming and sports, Zoras also enjoy music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040347/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/z.jsp "Led by their King, the Zoras are peaceful creatures who enjoy music and sports"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Zoras do not wear [[clothing]], and they are generally covered in silver [[Scale (zoology)|scale]]s, which give them a pale blue sheen from a distance. Where humans sometimes have long hair, average Zoras have rear-hanging [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] extensions that resemble tails. These tails undulate periodically, which gives a Zora's head the unique semblance of a fish. They are sometimes depicted as having webbed feet (except for Queen Rutela from ''Twilight Princess'' who appears to have two flat mermaid-like fins that fall down like a skirt) and hands. They lack ears in the traditional sense, but do have pronounced noses and gills on their abdomen. Their fins can be used to fight by extending out to serve as sharp-edged weapons. Zoras lay [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s to reproduce. Zora eggs need to be kept in cold, clean water to develop healthily, and every egg from the same [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] must be kept together for them to hatch. Newborn Zoras are [[tadpole]]-like with a circular body and a long, skinny tail ending in a [[wikt:fluke|fluke]].

Zora government is apparently [[Monarchy|monarchical]], either ruled by a king, {{nihongo|King Zora|キングゾーラ|Kinguzōra}}, or queen, such as Queen {{nihongo|Rutela|ルテラ|Rutera}} from ''Twilight Princess''. Two different tribes exist, "river Zora" are more violent and are able to shoot fire, while "sea Zora" make up the friendly Zoras. The Zora Royal Family is responsible for maintaining order among their people, overseeing care for {{nihongo|Jabu Jabu|ジャブジャブ}}, whom they worship as a guardian god,&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'', [[King Zora]]: “Our guardian god, Lord Jabu-Jabu, would never eat my dear [[Princess Ruto]]!”&lt;/ref&gt; and assuring that the waters upon which he and all creatures rely are clean and pure.

The Zora appear to be an extinct race in ''The Wind Waker''; a sage named {{nihongo|Laruto|ラルト|Raruto}} is encountered in spirit. They may be linked to the {{nihongo|Rito|リト}} race of bird people, along with the Princess {{nihongo|Ruto|ルト}}.
The Zora of Hyrule typically inhabit fresh water such as Zora River and Lake Hylia, while sea-dwelling Zora are known to appear in Termina (''Majora's Mask'') and Labrynna (''Oracle of Ages'')

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'', Link is able to inhabit the body of the Zora Mikau, who was killed by Gerudo pirates, and can use his fins in the same manner as the boomerang.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Breath of the Wild]]'', Zoras are a major part of the game. Link must head to Zora's Domain in the Lanayru region to meet with King Dorephan and Prince Sidon. The King called for a Hylian because Zora's Domain was in danger of being washed away by Divine Beast Vah Ruta, who was at the East Reservoir Lake. Prince Sidon brings Link without knowing that Link was the Hylian Champion himself. Muzu, a Zora elder and the King's assistant, resents Link, because him and most Zora elders blame Link for the death of the beloved Zora Champion and Princess, Mipha. After realizing that Link has had a special connection with the princess,  he tasks Link with finding 20 shock arrows from Ploymus Mountain. At the top, a strong Lynel waits, guarding Shatterback Point. Link must either defeat the Lynel, and get all the shock arrows, which are jabbed in trees or rocks along the trail to Shatterback Point, on most of the trees in the place, or on the small cliff on the east side of Shatterback Point. After retrieving the arrows, Link heads for the East Reservoir Lake to board Vah Ruta. Once he regains control of the beast, Mipha appears as a spirit and grants you her healing ability. She then moves Vah Ruta to a location that isn't blocked so she can have a direct lock on Hyrule Castle.

===Creatures===
Note: Some creatures' outlook may vary in different titles of the series. An advanced list of recurring enemies in the series can be found [[Recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series|here]].

*{{nihongo|'''Armos'''|アモス|Amosu}} are animated statues that guard ancient ruins and come to life to attack when disturbed. ''The Minish Cap'' features them as guards created by the Wind Tribe. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Beamos'''|ビーモス|Bīmosu}} are laser turret-like devices that continually rotate on a pillar attempting to spot intruders with it's single eye. They first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''.
*{{nihongo|'''Biri and Bari'''|ゴーリア|Gōria}} are electrified jellyfish that can hover in the air. Striking them with a metal weapon causes Link to be electrocuted. They often split into smaller duplicates after being attacked.
*'''Blade Traps''': Indestructible metallic devices armed with spikes. Some sense intruders and fly towards them, while others move in a set pattern. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Bokoblin'''|ボコブリン|Bokoburin}} are demonic goblin-like enemies that wield bladed weapons or clubs. They have red skin, small horns protruding out of their heads, and are very aggressive to intruders. They first appeared in ''The Wind Waker''. Later, they reappear in ''Skyward Sword'' as a common enemy. Like Bulblins, they are prone to follow particular evil forces, mainly the Demon Lord Girahim from ''Skyward Sword''.
*{{nihongo|'''Bubbles'''|バブル|Baburu}}, also known as Anti-Fairies or Whisps, are dark fairies that take the form of giant flaming skulls. They are capable of placing curses on their victims, the color of their flame denoting the abilities the Bubble possesses. For example, if a Blue Bubble bites Link he will be temporarily unable to draw his sword. In some games Link can use Magic Powder to turn Bubbles into healing fairies. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Buzz Blobs'''|バズブロブ|Bazuburobu}} are electrical tapering creatures made of goo. They are passive, but generate large amounts of static electricity when hit. Buzz Blobs deal damage when struck with metal weapons such as swords, with the exception of the Golden Sword, requiring the use of ranged weapons, which can either defeat them instantly or stun them, leaving them vulnerable to sword strikes. They are skinny down near the ground and widen at the top.
*{{nihongo|'''ChuChus'''|チュチュ|Chuchu}} are jelly-like creatures with squat, translucent bodies, stalk-eyes, and a permanently smiling mouth that have a variety of colors. In ''The Wind Waker'' their appearance was changed to upright, opaque bodies and vibrantly colored faces. They first appeared by that name in ''Majora's Mask'', but two similar blob-type enemies were in the original ''The Legend of Zelda'' named "Bit" and "Bot", and a Bot became two Bits when Link slashed it, similar to the behavior of ChuChus in newer titles. Modern ChuChus come in Green, Red (the two most common colors), Yellow, Blue and dark Purple. They aggressively attack anything that invades their territory by tackling it, but will hide in puddles on the ground if no one is close. They mostly move by bouncing around, though the Green, Yellow and Blue ChuChus will occasionally melt and turn into small invincible puddles, and proceed to move around in their puddle forms until they can get close to Link, or until Link uses an item such as his Boomerang to stun and coax them out of their puddles. In ''Twilight Princess'', after one is killed, Link can use their puddles as potions or lantern fuel, depending on the type of ChuChu. In ''Skyward Sword'', ChuChus come in a variety of colors: Green, red (fire), blue (underwater), and yellow (electricity). ChuChus' sizes also vary a lot, depending on their color. The smallest can be defeated with one sword strike, the medium-sized need to be hit multiple times, and the largest ones can be split into two smaller ones with a vertical slash. In ''Breath of the Wild'', ChuChus came in four different forms, normal, fire, ice, and electric. They come in a big or small size. They will jump around and sometimes pounce at Link. If they charge at Link, they will lose their element and become dark and faded, but stay their color. They are vulnerable at this point to attack. They will try to regain their elemental power if left for too long without being killed. Once they are defeated, they will drop ChuChu jelly, which will stay in the element they are, unless an elemental arrow or weapon is used on it to change the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda14-skyward-sword-enemies.php#ChuchuBlue |title=Zelda Dungeon Wiki: Enemies: ChuChus |publisher=Zeldadungeon.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{nihongo|'''Cuccos'''|コッコ|Kokko}} are a type of Hylian [[chicken]] commonly domesticated for their eggs and meat. Although Cuccos strongly resemble real life chickens they differ in several key ways. Most Cuccos can fly short distances and are even strong enough to glide while carrying the weight of an adult man allowing Link to use them to glide to otherwise unreachable areas. Some breeds of Cucco, like blue and gold Cuccos can even outright fly while being held. While normally docile, Cuccos will become angry if attacked repeatedly and crow to summon a flock of Cuccos to attack the aggressor until he or she dies or leaves the area (a behavior commonly known among fans as the "Cucco's Revenge Squad"). Cuccos first appeared in ''A Link to the Past''. They mostly come in white, although ''The Minish Cap'' had gold Cuccos and ''Twilight Princess'' had black, brown, golden and grey variants as well. In ''Ocarina of Time'', there was a single blue cucco that was used in a trading sequence. On a few occasions, someone will tell Link to "not be such a cucco", a play on the phrase "don't be such a chicken", confirming the fact that Cuccos are the Zelda universe's version of chickens and not separate creatures.
*{{nihongo|'''Darknuts'''|タートナック|Tātonakku}} are large armored knights armed with swords and shields. In ''The Wind Waker'', when their helmets are removed, they are revealed to have jackal-like heads. Some Darknuts also have capes, which must be destroyed before they can be hurt. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''. They reappear in groups at Hyrule Castle.  They also appeared in ''Twilight Princess'' for the first time in The Temple of Time, and in several other dungeons thereafter.
*{{nihongo|'''Deku Babas'''|デクババ|Deku Baba}} are [[Venus fly trap]]-like [[carnivorous plant]]s, that live in forests. They spend much of their time shrunk down springing from the ground whenever their [[root]]s detect the footsteps of potential prey. They first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''.
*{{nihongo|'''Dodongos'''|ドドンゴ|Dodongo}} are fire breathing reptiles that resemble gigantic iguanas. They move slowly, protected by their thick scales but are incredibly aggressive eating anything that comes within reach of their mouths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zelda.com/universe/pedia/d.jsp#Dodongos |title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia: Dodongos |publisher=Zelda.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508025421/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/d.jsp#Dodongos |archivedate=2014-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baby Dodongos are born limbless and spend much of their time buried underground &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp#BabyDodongo |title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia: Baby Dodongo |publisher=Zelda.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831212904/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp#BabyDodongo |archivedate=2005-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when attacked they explode. Big Dodongos, which are larger versions of normal Dodongos. A King Dodongo appears as a boss in ''Ocarina of Time.''&lt;ref&gt;They [http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp#BigDodongo ''The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia'': Big Dodongo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831212904/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/b.jsp |date=2005-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Floormasters'''|フロアマスター|Furoamasutā}} and Wallmasters are ghostly or zombified manifestations of giant hands that drag adventurers back to the entrance of a dungeon. Floormasters roam around the room and are visible at all times, while Wallmasters hide on the ceiling out of sight. Also, Floormasters split up into smaller versions when the original is attacked, whereas Wallmasters do not. Wallmasters first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda'' while Floormasters first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''. Floormasters appeared in ''The Wind Waker'' as a spectral arm and hand that will transport Link to a jail-like holding area if he is caught. They do not split up when attacked.
*{{nihongo|'''Gargoyles'''}} are statues that appear in ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link''.  They shoot fireballs at Link in the underground dungeons.
*{{nihongo|'''Gibdos'''|ギブド|Gibudo}} are undead creatures wrapped like [[mummy|mummies]]. They resemble ReDeads in regards to their slow and zombie-like movement; in some games, setting a Gibdo's bandages alight will reveal a Stalfos or a ReDead underneath. In ''Majora's Mask'', Link can use the Gibdo Mask to communicate with them. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Iron Knuckles'''|アイアンナック|Aian-nakku}} are heavily armored knights with axes. While they are even slower than the Darknuts, they are the most powerful enemies in their games as they can take four hearts from Link with just one hit and because of that they are often used to guard treasures. They first appeared in ''The Adventure of Link''.
*{{nihongo|'''Keese'''|キース|Kīsu}} are [[bat]]-like creatures that often lurk in dark places such as caves and dungeons, where they dive bomb unwary travelers attempting to bite off chunks of flesh. Keese have the ability to pick up elements they fly through and there are fire, ice, cursed, and electric variants. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Leevers'''|リーバー|Rībā}} are conical-shaped [[cactus]] monsters that primarily live in sandy areas, such as deserts and beaches. They hide beneath the sand, burrowing to the top to attack in ambush when they sense the footsteps of an intruder. Leevers attack by spinning rapidly and slamming their thorny bodies into their target. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Like Likes'''|ライクライク|Raikuraiku}} are yellowish cylindrical monsters that can suck in creatures as large as humans and consume items they carry. They are known for swallowing the shields and tunics that Link uses. Like Likes dissolve into a puddle when killed, leaving the stolen items. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda'', where they swallow the magical shield, but do not return it upon being killed.
*{{nihongo|'''Lizalfos'''|リザルフォス|Rizarufosu}} are [[humanoid]] [[lizard]]s that stand upright and wield a shield and either a spear or hammer. Lizalfos in later games are rapid-moving monsters that often attack in pairs or small groups. They first appeared in ''The Adventure of Link''.
*{{nihongo|'''Lynels'''|ライネル|Raineru}} are large, strong creatures with the body of a man and a horse, a head of a lion, and horns. This creature has multiple different variations, consisting of red, blue, white, and silver. The white and silver Lynel only appear in ''Breath of the Wild''. In that game, red and blue Lynel can be found in many places. The white one appears in a lot of places too, but mostly in colder climates. They can be found naturally in Gerudo Highlands and N. Tabantha Snowfield. Every Lynel, except for the one in Shatterback Point northeast of Zora's Domain, will become Silver after being beaten enough. After every Blood Moon, the Lynel's type will change to a stronger variant (i.e. a defeated red Lynel will become a blue Lynel after being defeated). The only initially spawned Silver Lynel is in the Colosseum Ruins in Central Hyrule. Two Lynels also appear in Hyrule Castle in both Gatehouses. A blue one will initially spawn in the first Gatehouse and a white one in the second one. They won't spawn until the player has entered the gatehouse from jumping through a window or entering through the gate, which will be blocked off after the player has entered. The only exit is by climbing up or using Revali's Gale through a window. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Moblins'''|モリブリン|Moriburin}} are humanoid monsters that usually reside in forests. In the original ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link'', Moblins resembled [[bulldogs]], but are pig-like in more recent games. They are sometimes accompanied by Pig Warriors, monsters with the same basic form but more porcine characteristics. Both types commonly wield spears, swords, bows, or occasionally massive clubs. They are one of the most common enemies within the games they appear, and are considered "mighty", but also "dumb".&lt;ref&gt;''The Wind Waker'', Moblin Figurine: "These mighty enemies swing their long spears with the greatest of ease."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Minish Cap, Swiftblade: "Those pig-faced Moblins...You see them around the Minish Woods, right? They're big and dumb? Well, they're also rich!"''&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as greedy, self-possessed creatures, and the major antagonist will commonly use them as mercenaries or summoned monsters.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/m.jsp#Moblin| author=Nintendo| title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Moblin| publisher=Zelda Universe| date=January 1, 2006| accessdate=2007-06-11| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610001145/http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/m.jsp#Moblin| archivedate=June 10, 2007| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oracle of Ages'' and ''Oracle of Seasons'' feature a larger, senior Moblin known as the Great Moblin, who terrorizes Holodrum and Labrynna. Moblins are common in ''The Wind Waker'', which introduces two additional smaller creatures, impish Bokoblins and Miniblins, rodent-like beasts who carry pitchforks. In ''Spirit Tracks'', Miniblins were pirates usually led by a "Big Blin", a larger, muscled variation that wields a spiked club. In ''Skyward Sword'', they are depicted as fatter and will use their weight in a final attempt to crush Link before dying. In ''Breath of the Wild'', it is revealed that Moblins are carnivorous and require a diet of meat and fish to maintain their bulky frames. 
**'''Stalmoblin''' are the animated skeletons of Moblins that appear in ''Breath of the Wild''. Like Stalkoblin, their skeletons continue to reanimate as long as a Stalmoblin skull is present. While just as powerful as their living counterparts, they are much easier to defeat by focusing on destroying their skulls. 
*{{nihongo|'''Octoroks'''|オクタロック|Okutarokku}} are rock-spitting [[octopus]] monsters that have appeared in almost every ''Legend of Zelda'' game (except for ''Twilight Princess''). Some species of Octorok are primarily land-dwelling while others are mostly aquatic. '''Big Octos''' are a very large ocean dwelling breed sometimes known to attack ships. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Peahats'''|ピーハット|Pīhatto}{PEE-hats}} are flying plants that soar through the skies on sharp helicopter-like leaves. Some Peahats are small while others can grow to massive size. In ''Twilight Princess'', smaller Peahats were passive creatures rather than enemies and could be used as a transportation method via the Clawshot. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Poes'''|ポウ|Pou}} are lantern-carrying [[ghosts]] formed from concentrated hatred toward the living that freely roam graveyards and other haunted locales. They always carry their signature lanterns. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Pols Voice'''|ポルスボイス|Porusuboisu}} are strange ghost-like creatures with large rabbit ears and whiskers that hop about in an erratic pattern. A lamprey like mouth is hidden under their bodies. Pols Voice hate loud noises so explosive weapons are most effective but in some games they can also be damaged by musical instruments. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''ReDeads'''|リーデッド|Rīdeddo}} are undead creatures resembling zombies with dark brown skin and flat mask-like faces that can paralyze enemies with a scream, and cling to them to drain health away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-scariest-villains-ever/|title=The scariest villains EVER|publisher=GamesRadar|first=Mikel|last=Reparaz|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''.
*{{nihongo|'''Skulltulas'''|スタルウォール|Sutaruwōru}} are giant [[spiders]], named for the protective, white, bony plate in the shape of a human [[Human skull symbolism|skull]] that forms their [[carapace]]. They are most commonly found in dark places, such as forests, caves, and dungeons but can also sometimes be found in towns at night. Skulltulas and Giant Skulltulas hang from ceiling surfaces, suspended by a strand of silk waiting to drop on unwary prey. Smaller Skulltulas called Skullwalltulas (or Walltulas) are commonly encountered on climbable surfaces and will attempt to bite Link if he doesn't first shoot them down. Rare Golden Skulltulas are associated with the "Curse of Skulltula" and must killed to break the curse.
*{{nihongo|'''Stalchild'''|スタルベビー|Sutarubebī}} are smaller forms of the Stalfos. Like Salfos they are the vengeful spirits of dead soldiers. They only appear on the overworld at night and spawn endlessly, but retreat as soon as the sun rises. Unlike Stalfos, they do not carry any weapons, and instead swipe at their target with long, bloody claws. In ''Ocarina of Time'' there is an easter egg where after a certain number are defeated, a larger one appears. They make their debut in ''Ocarina of Time''.
*{{nihongo|'''Stalfos'''|スタルフォス|Sutarufosu}} are animated skeletons mostly from the remains of dead warriors who still have a strong will to fight, and serve evil powers such as [[Ganon]] or [[Vaati]]. In ''Ocarina of Time'', by using the Mask of Truth, the player learns from a Gossip Stone that humans that die while in the Lost Woods will become monsters (although it's only revealed that said monster is a Stalfos during the Biggoron Sword quest, when Link trades in the Odd Potion for the Poacher's Saw). They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Tektites'''|テクタイト|Tekutaito}} are cycloptic four-legged [[insect]]oid creatures who use their powerful legs to leap upon and attack prey. The Blue ones are able to walk on water. And both Blue and Red can jump up cliffs. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Vire'''|バイア|Baia}} are [[gargoyle]]-like creatures that split into two Keese when hit with weak attacks. They first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.
*{{nihongo|'''Wolfos'''|ウルフォス|Urufosu}} are wolf-like creatures equipped with powerful claws. They are usually found in grassy or snowy terrains, where their fur changes according to each. Wolfos are capable of blocking and even dodging oncoming attacks, but if one swipes at Link and misses it will be turned completely around exposing it's vulnerable back. White Wolfos, usually found in snowy terrains, hit harder than the normal Wolfos and are a little larger. They first appeared in ''Ocarina of Time''.
*{{nihongo|'''Zols'''|ゾル|Zoru}} are simple blob-like enemies with two eyes. They often hide between the tiles of dungeon floors, waiting to pop out and attack. In many games, weaker attacks will cause a Zol to split into two smaller versions of itself known as Gels. Both Zols and Gels first appeared in ''The Legend of Zelda''.

==Reception==
In their January 2010 issue, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' listed Hyrule as one of the greatest Nintendo locations, citing the vast number of areas to explore, as well as referencing players' first experiences with the Lost Woods and Death Mountain as highlights of the players' adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nintendopower.com/images/NP250_250Feature.pdf |title=Top 250 Games |format=Magazine |accessdate=2010-07-17 |volume=250 |date=January 2010 |page=42 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229051334/http://nintendopower.com/images/NP250_250Feature.pdf |archivedate=December 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Đurđevića Tara Bridge''' ({{IPA-sh|dʑǔːrdʑɛv̞iːtɕaː târa|pron}}) is a [[concrete]] [[arch bridge]] over the [[Tara River (Montenegro)|Tara River]] in northern [[Montenegro]]. It is located at the crossroads between [[Mojkovac]], [[Žabljak]] and [[Pljevlja]], between the villages of Budečevica and Trešnjica.

==Construction==
Đurđevića Tara Bridge, which was designed by Mijat Trojanović, was built between 1937 and 1940 in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The project's Chief Engineer was Isaac Russo.

The {{convert|365|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} bridge has five arches; the largest span is {{convert|116|m}}. The roadway stands {{convert|172|m}} above the Tara River. At the time of its completion, it was the biggest vehicular concrete arch bridge in [[Europe]].

==World War II==
Much of Montenegro, including the Tara Canyon, came under Italian occupation following the German-led invasion of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. As the mountainous terrain made it suitable for guerrilla warfare, a [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan]] uprising occurred in the area. Italian forces took control of the Tara Bridge during an Italian offensive in 1942.

A Yugoslav Partisan raiding party blew up the central arch with the aid of one of the bridge engineers, Lazar Jauković. The attack cut the only feasible crossing over the Tara Canyon halting the Italian advance. When Jauković was eventually captured, however, the Italians executed the engineer.

These events were depicted in the 1969 Yugoslav film [[The Bridge (1969 film)|Most]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074921/ "Most"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
The bridge was rebuilt in 1946. It was used in the 1978 British action film ''[[Force 10 from Navarone]]'' set during World War II. Bungee jumping is organised on the longest arch directly above Tara river.

The bridge also plays a large part in the Dutch novel 'Het land achter Gods rug' by A. den Doolaard, which was published in 1956. This novel is partly based on the true story of the bridge including its destruction by partisans during the World War II.
