'''5-MeO-DMT''' ('''5-methoxy-''N'',''N''-dimethyltryptamine''') is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] of the [[Substituted tryptamine|tryptamine]] class. It is found in a wide variety of plant species, and at least one toad species, the [[Colorado River toad|Sonora Desert toad]]. Like its close relatives [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[bufotenin]] (5-HO-DMT), it has been used as an [[entheogen]] in [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=AnaMargarida|last1=Araújo|first2=Félix|last2=Carvalho|first3=Maria deLourdes|last3=Bastos|first4=Paula|last4=Guedes de Pinho|title=The hallucinogenic world of tryptamines: an updated review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-015-1513-x|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=August 2015|issn=0340-5761|pages=1151–1173|volume=89|issue=8|doi=10.1007/s00204-015-1513-x|pmid=25877327|first5=Márcia|last5=Carvalho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
5-MeO-DMT was first [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] in 1936, and in 1959 it was isolated as one of the [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] ingredients of ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'' [[seed]]s used in preparing [[Anadenanthera peregrina|Yopo]] snuff. It was once believed to be a major component of the [[neuropsychopharmacology|psychoactive effects]] of the snuff, although this has recently been shown to be unlikely, due to the limited or sometimes even non-existent quantity contained within the seeds, which instead achieve their psychoactivity from the ''O''-[[Demethylation|demethylated]] [[metabolite]] of 5-MeO-DMT, [[bufotenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jonathan|last1=Ott|title=Pharmañopo—Psychonautics: Human Intranasal, Sublingual, Intrarectal, Pulmonary and Oral Pharmacology of Bufotenine|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02791072.2001.10400574|journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs|date=July–September 2001|issn=0279-1072|pages=273–281|volume=33|issue=3|pmid=11718320|doi=10.1080/02791072.2001.10400574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shen/&gt; It is [[metabolism|metabolized]] mainly by [[CYP2D6]].&lt;ref name=Shen&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Hong-Wu|last1=Shen|first2=Xi-Ling|last2=Jiang|first3=Jerrold C.|last3=Winter|first4=Ai-Ming|last4=Yu|title=Psychedelic 5-Methoxy-''N'',''N''-dimethyltryptamine: Metabolism, Pharmacokinetics, Drug Interactions, and Pharmacological Actions|journal=Current Drug Metabolism|date=October 2010|issn=1389-2002|pages=659–666|volume=11|issue=8|pmid=20942780|pmc=3028383|doi=10.2174/138920010794233495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious use==

5-MeO-DMT is a [[sacrament]] of the Church of the Tree of Life. From approximately 1971 to the late 1980s, 5-MeO-DMT was discreetly available to its members.&lt;ref name="Erowid"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dmt/5meo_dmt_timeline.php |title=5-MeO-DMT Timeline |work=Erowid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1990 smoking of 5-MeO-DMT on [[parsley]] was probably one of the two most common forms of [[route of administration|ingestion]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Erowid"/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
5-MeO-DMT is a [[Methoxylation|methoxylated]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]. Based on studies in rats, its [[pharmacological activity]] is believed to be mainly through [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]]. Specifically, it shows high [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;]] subtypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kirsten|last1=Krebs-Thomson|first2=ErbertM.|last2=Ruiz|first3=Virginia|last3=Masten|first4=Mahalah|last4=Buell|title=The roles of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the effects of 5-MeO-DMT on locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition in rats|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-006-0566-1|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=December 2006|issn=0033-3158|pages=319–329|volume=189|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s00213-006-0566-1|pmid=17013638|first5=MarkA.|last5=Geyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional [[mechanism of action|mechanisms of action]] such as [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibition]] of [[monoamine]] [[reuptake]] may be involved also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Fumiko|last1=Nagai|first2=Ryouichi|last2=Nonaka|first3=Kanako|last3=Satoh Hisashi Kamimura|title=The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299906013811|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=22 March 2007|pages=132–137|volume=559|issue=2–3|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075|pmid=17223101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrés Amaya''' ({{circa|1645}} - 29 October 1704) was a Spanish Baroque painter in oils of religious subjects. He was active in the region of [[Castile and León]], primarily in the city of [[Valladolid]].

==Biography==

Nothing is known about Amaya's origins and background, and little about his life and career. One modern Spanish source describes his life and activity as ''cubierta por una enorme bruma'' ("covered by an enormous mist").&lt;ref name=AV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artevalladolid.blogspot.co.uk/2017/05/la-pintura-barroca-en-valladolid-entre.html |title=La pintura barroca en Valladolid entre 1665-1750 |website=artevalladolid.blogspot.co.uk |language=Spanish |date=5 May 2017 |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best that can be said is, that the surname "[[Amaya (Spanish-language name)|Amaya]]" is associated with the small village of [[Amaya (Burgos)|Amaya]] in [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]], Castile and León. Few of his paintings are dated, which makes it difficult to establish a chronology.&lt;ref name=AV /&gt;&lt;ref name=MNE /&gt; Most of his works are on religious subjects, but he is said to have also painted portraits.&lt;ref name=AV /&gt; His surviving works are scattered in and around Valladolid.&lt;ref name=AV /&gt;&lt;ref name=MNE /&gt;

According to Spanish art historian [[Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez]] (1749-1829), Amaya was a disciple of [[Vicente Carducho]] (1576/78–1638).&lt;ref name=CB /&gt;  Amaya cannot have been Carducho's pupil, because their dates do not overlap. It is possible that Amaya knew or was influenced by later Spanish painters of the Madrid high Baroque school, such as {{ill|José Moreno (artist)|lt=José Moreno|es|José Moreno (pintor)}} (after 1630 - 1677) and {{ill|Francisco de Solís|es|Francisco de Solís (pintor)}} ({{circa|1620/1625}} - 1684), and the [[court painter]]s of the time.&lt;ref name=AV /&gt; He has also been said to have been influenced by [[Alonzo Cano]] (1601-1667).&lt;ref name=MNE /&gt;

In 1687, Valladolid painter Amaro Alonso de Llanos (Amaro Alonso Méndez, 1640-1699) married Damiana Jalón y Gallo, widow of the painter Juan Sanz. Amaya was one of the witnesses.&lt;ref name=AV /&gt; That is one of the very few contemporary records of Amaya's existence.

His wife was Isabel ({{nee|Lozano}}). They lived "outside the Puerta del Campo"; that is, roughly in the area of the modern {{ill|Plaza de Zorrilla|es}} in Valladolid. Amaya died on 29 October 1704. The Valladolid painter Ignacio de Prado was his pupil; Amaya's widow called Ignacio "''una persona de mi cariño y de que tengo entera satisfacción''" ("a person in my affection and in whom I have complete satisfaction").&lt;ref name=AV /&gt;

==Critical reception==
Ceán Bermúdez said of Amaya, "''tienen mejor gusto de color que correccion en el dibuxo''" ("he had better taste in colour than in correctness of drawing").&lt;ref name=CB /&gt; The one authority cited by Ceán Bermúdez was [[Antonio Ponz]] (1725–1792), who may only have known Amaya's altarpiece at {{ill|Iglesia de San Martín, Segovia|es|Iglesia de San Martín (Segovia)}}. Spanish art historian {{ill|Alfonso Pérez Sánchez|es}} (1935-2010) had a more generous opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alfonso |last=Pérez Sánchez |title=Pintura Barroca en España 1600-1750 |publisher={{ill|Ediciones Cátedra|es}} |location=Madrid| year=1992 |page=347 |language=Spanish |isbn=84-376-0994-1}} By {{ill|Alfonso Pérez Sánchez|es}}&lt;/ref&gt; So had the anonymous author who wrote for the [[Museo Nacional de Escultura, Valladolid]] in 2001, "''Fue artista bien preparada para la composición, mostrando gran habilidad en la angrupación y relación de las figuras''" ("He was a masterful artist in composition, showing great skill in the grouping and relationship of people").&lt;ref name=MNE /&gt;

==Early years==
Quiboloy was born on April 25, 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apolloquiboloy.com/life-calling-apollo-quiboloy/#his_birth_and_early_years|title=Pastor Apollo's birth and early years|author=Official Website|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Davao City]], and is the youngest of nine children of [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]] José Quiboloy y Turla and María Carreón y Quinto (born December 28, 1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fil-gen-pro.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-pastor-and-president.html|title=The Pastor and the President|author=Todd Cabrera Lucero|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pdi2&gt;[https://archive.is/20130221180913/http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20100216-253439 Who is Pastor Apollo Quiboloy?, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents were natives of [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]], [[Pampanga]], and had migrated to Davao following the end of the [[Second World War]] to find better jobs.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Quiboloy was a member of the [[United Pentecostal Church]]&lt;ref name="asiatimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hodgart|first1=Kenny|title=The Messiah friend of President Duterte|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/messiah-friend-president-duterte-2/|accessdate=9 December 2016|work=Asia Times|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he established the Kingdom of Jesus Christ church.

==Church==
Quiboloy is the founding leader and Executive Pastor of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name founded on September 1, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apolloquiboloy.com/life-calling-apollo-quiboloy/#the_exodus_from_religious_bondage|title=The Exodus from Religious Bondage - Pastor Apollo exited his previous denomination, taking with him all those who had accepted his message.|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began preaching in the slums of Villamor, Agdao, Davao City with only 15 members.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  He has received critical responses to his claims of being the "Appointed Son of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Estremera|first=Stella A|title=Of appointed sons and the second coming|newspaper=Cebu Sun Star|location=Philippines|date=January 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bagnol|first=Raquel C|title=Couple charged with libel for branding Quiboloy's sect a 'cult'|newspaper=Cebu Sun Star|location=Philippines|date=July 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sect's main Cathedral is located along Buhangin National Highway in [[Davao City]].

His followers refer to their community as a "Kingdom Nation." They claim about 2 million "Kingdom citizens" abroad and 4 million in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=pdi2/&gt; On weekdays, members hold bible sessions and prayer services. On Sundays, a "Global Worship" is held at the Cathedral in Buhangin District. In 2000, Quiboloy founded José María College, named after his parents.&lt;ref name="pdi2"/&gt;

===Media holdings===
His ministry has a global television channel, the [[Sonshine Media Network International]] (President and CEO), and 17 radio stations in the Philippines. It also has two newspapers, ''Pinas'' and ''Sikat''.;&lt;ref name=pdi2/&gt; the ''Pinas'' is circulated weekly for followers in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Asia.

===Involvement in sports===
In June 2014, Quiboloy founded [[Sonshine Sports Management]], the newly created sports management group based in [[Davao City]]. SSMI organized different boxing and basketball events within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davaobreakingnews.com/spiritual-leader-apollo-quiboloy-launches-revolution-excelence/|title=Spiritual Leader Apollo Quiboloy Launches 'Revolution Excelence’|publisher=Davao Breaking News|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==
Quiboloy anointed [[Gilbert Teodoro]] as the next president in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2010|2010 Philippine presidential election]]. "Tonight let it be known to all Filipinos that the Almighty Father has appointed the president of this nation. He is no other than Gilbert 'Gibo' Teodoro", Quiboloy told thousands of cheering followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100503-267767/Pastor-Quiboloy-anoints-Teodoro Pastor Quiboloy anoints Teodoro, Philippine Daily Inquirer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506200709/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100503-267767/Pastor-Quiboloy-anoints-Teodoro |date=May 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teodoro finished fourth in the election with 4,095,839 votes (or 11.33%) to which Qui-boloy responded, "I myself am a little bit disturbed with the reports of fraud and cheating in the last elections. Even I am asking where did the votes of the Kingdom go? What happened to our votes when we were supposed to be solid for Gibo?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=577340&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 Quiboloy: Where did our votes for Gibo go?, Philippine Star]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippine general election, 2016|2016 national elections]], Quiboloy and the members of Kingdom of Jesus Christ endorsed the presidential candidacy of the pastor's close friend, [[Davao City]] mayor [[Rodrigo Duterte]] and his running mate Senator [[Alan Peter Cayetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/02/08/1550941/evangelist-quiboloy-backs-duterte|title=Evangelist Quiboloy backs Duterte|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|last=Regalado|first=Edith|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/nation/03/28/16/quiboloy-endorses-duterte-cayetano-duo|title=Quiboloy endorses Duterte-Cayetano duo|publisher=''[[ABS-CBN News]]''|date=March 28, 2016|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quiboloy also lent his private jet and helicopter to be used in [[Rodrigo Duterte presidential campaign, 2016|Duterte's presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte using Quiboloy private jet; Davao bizmen funding rallies|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/video/focus/04/28/16/duterte-using-quiboloy-private-jet-davao-bizmen-funding-rallies|accessdate=20 February 2018|agency=''ABS-CBN News''|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Quiboloy has been sued by a former member for allegedly [[brainwashing]] and holding her young daughter against her will.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O1Y1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ciUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=757,33541770 Lawyers sue cult to get custody of Baguio girl, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Plg1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1722,8240927 Cult probed for disappearance of teenrs, Philippine Daily Inquirer]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispute with the New People's Army===

The communist [[New People's Army]] (NPA) has accused Quiboloy of being behind the massacre of K'lata-Bagobos leader Datu Domingo Diarog and his family on April 29, 2008 for allegedly refusing to sell two hectares of their property for ₱50,000 to Quiboloy and his sect. The property is within the 700-hectare ancestral domain claimed by the [[Lumad#Manobo|Bagobo people]] in Tugbok and is adjacent to Quiboloy's walled "prayer mountain" in Tamayong. Diarog's widow said followers of Quiboloy had threatened to evict them from the land and her relatives were even offered a ₱20,000 bounty for Diarog's head.&lt;ref name=pdi&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080517-137214/Why-did-they-kill-the-Bagobo-datu Why did they kill the Bagobo datu?, Philippine Daily Inquirer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012131648/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080517-137214/Why-did-they-kill-the-Bagobo-datu |date=October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quiboloy, however, said the charges were "totally false and baseless, if not ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/97657/Killings-land-dispute-turn-tribal-village-into-virtual-ghost-town Killings, land dispute turn tribal village into virtual ghost town GMA News]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Quiboloy has branded the rebels "''mga anak ni Satanas''" ("[[Satan|Satan's]] offspring"), the NPA has declared him a "warlord in the service of the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Gloria Arroyo]] administration's policies against the peasants and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20080519-137528/Slay-of-tribal-leader-stirs-Pastor-Quiboloy-NPA-word-war Slay of tribal leader stirs Pastor Quiboloy-NPA word war, Philippine Daily Inquirer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012131707/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20080519-137528/Slay-of-tribal-leader-stirs-Pastor-Quiboloy-NPA-word-war |date=October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080521-137818/Preacher-rebels-exchange-harsh-words-over-killing Preacher, rebels exchange harsh words over killing Philippine Daily Inquirer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012131716/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080521-137818/Preacher-rebels-exchange-harsh-words-over-killing |date=October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police investigator Ireneo Dalogdog, head of the Tugbok police, said he had been receiving reports that Diarog was being harassed by armed men associated with Quiboloy, and that Diarog's farmhouse had earlier been razed three times.&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt;

An '''argument from nonbelief''' is a [[philosophical argument]] that asserts an inconsistency between the [[existence of God]] and a world in which people fail to recognize him.  It is similar to the classic [[problem of evil|argument from evil]] in affirming an inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that would exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through.

There are two key varieties of the argument.  The '''argument from reasonable nonbelief''' (or the '''argument from divine hiddenness''') was first elaborated in [[J. L. Schellenberg]]'s 1993 book ''Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason''.  This argument says that if God existed (and was perfectly good and loving) every reasonable person would have been brought to believe in God; however, there are reasonable nonbelievers; therefore, this God does not exist.

[[Theodore Drange]] subsequently developed '''the argument from nonbelief''', based on the mere existence of nonbelief in God.  Drange considers the distinction between reasonable (by which Schellenberg means inculpable) and unreasonable (culpable) nonbelief to be irrelevant and confusing. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of academic discussion is concerned with Schellenberg's formulation.

==Historical references to the problem of divine hiddenness==
The theme of divine hiddenness, silence or darkness has a long history in Judeo-Christian theology.&lt;ref name="hs-ne"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Howard-Snyder | first=Daniel | author2=Paul K. Moser | year=2001 | chapter=Introduction: Divine Hiddenness | chapterurl=http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~howardd/hiddennessintro.html | title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays | isbn=0-521-00610-4 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York}} The introductory section draws heavily on this source for its exposition of material.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of the Judeo-Christian description of God as hidden are in the Bible, for example in the [[Psalms]], "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?....I cry by day, but you do not answer....",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|22:1–2|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Isaiah: "Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Isaiah|45:15|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first philosophers to write on the theme of divine hiddenness was [[Anselm of Canterbury]], who in his [[Proslogion]] links it to an existential or spiritual concern:
{{quote|I have never seen thee, O Lord my God; I do not know thy form. What, O most high Lord, shall this man do, an exile far from thee? What shall thy servant do, anxious in his love of thee, and cast out afar from thy face? He pants to see thee, and thy face is too far from him. He longs to come to thee, and thy dwelling place is inaccessible. He is eager to find thee, and knows not thy place. He desires to seek thee, and does not know thy face. Lord, thou art my God, and thou art my Lord, yet never have I seen thee. It is thou that hast made me, and hast made me anew, and hast bestowed upon me all the blessings I enjoy; and not yet do I know thee. Finally, I was created to see thee and not yet have I done that for which I was made.&lt;ref name="hs-ne" /&gt;}}

Daniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser, in the introduction to a volume of papers on the idea of divine hiddenness as evidence against theism, cite [[Nietzsche]]'s question as anticipating this contemporary theme: "a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful and who does not even make sure his creatures understand his intentions — could that be a god of goodness?"&lt;ref name="hs-ne" /&gt;

==Schellenberg's hiddenness argument==

Discussion of Schellenberg's argument has made explicit a non-theological use of the term 'hiddenness', which is now commonly used simply as a way of talking about the subjective condition of nonbelief in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schellenberg |first=J. L. |editor1-first=Charles |editor1-last=Taliaferro |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Draper |editor3-first=Philip |editor3-last=Quinn |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion 2d ed. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |pages=509–510 |chapter=Chapter 60: Divine Hiddenness |isbn=978-1-4051-6357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first presentation of the argument Schellenberg emphasized inculpable or reasonable nonbelief, but he has since shifted to speaking more specifically about nonresistant nonbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schellenberg | first=J. L. | year=2007 | title=The Wisdom to Doubt: A Justification of Religious Skepticism | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=978-0-8014-7851-2 | pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first presentation is often given by commentators as follows, based on Schellenberg's own summing up:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schellenberg | first=J. L. | year=1993 | title=Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-8014-2792-4 | pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
# If there is a God, he is perfectly loving.
# If a perfectly loving God exists, reasonable nonbelief does not occur.
# Reasonable nonbelief occurs.
# No perfectly loving God exists (from 2 and 3).
# Hence, there is no God (from 1 and 4).
}}

Schellenberg has stated that this formulation is misleading, when taken on its own, because it does not make explicit the reason why a perfectly loving God would want to prevent nonbelief. His deepest claim, he says, is "about the connection between love and openness to relationship -- a personal and positively meaningful and explicit sort of relationship of the sort that logically presupposes each party's belief in the other's existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schellenberg | first=J. L. | year=2006 | title=Preface to the Paperback Edition of Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-8014-7346-2 | pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later presentation of the argument by Schellenberg, which aims at accessibility for students, includes this element:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schellenberg |first=J. L. |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Solomon |editor2-first=Douglas |editor2-last=McDermid |title=Introducing Philosophy for Canadians |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |pages=165–166 |chapter=Would a Loving God Hide from Anyone? |isbn=978-0-19-543096-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
# If no perfectly loving God exists, then God does not exist.
# If a perfectly loving God exists, then there is a God who is always open to personal relationship with each human person.
# If there is a God who is always open to personal relationship with each human person, then no human person is ever non-resistantly unaware that God exists.
# If a perfectly loving God exists, then no human person is ever non-resistantly unaware that God exists (from 2 and 3).
# Some human persons are non-resistantly unaware that God exists.
# No perfectly loving God exists (from 4 and 5).
# God does not exist (from 1 and 6).
}}

In an article revisiting the argument ten years after it was originally proposed,&lt;ref name="jl2005a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Schellenberg | first=J. L. | year=2005 | title=The hiddenness argument revisited (I) | journal=[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]] | volume=41 | pages=201–215 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | doi=10.1017/S0034412505007614 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schellenberg observes that criticism has mainly centered around the idea that God would prevent inculpable nonbelief. He asserts that there are relatively few criticisms questioning the existence of inculpable nonbelief, and almost no theistic philosopher objects to the idea that God is perfectly loving.

=== God is perfectly loving ===

Schellenberg says he hasn't seen any serious objections to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other [[conceptions of God]]. Daniel Howard-Snyder writes about the possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great [[personal god]] that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] concept of [[Eudaimonia]], he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.&lt;ref name="hs2006"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Howard-Snyder |first=Daniel |year=2006 |title=Hiddenness of God |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=2nd |editor=Donald M.

Theodore Drange, in his attempt to improve the argument ([[#Drange's argument from nonbelief|see below]]), states that there are many theists who do not view God as perfectly loving, and "some Christians think of him as an angry deity bent on punishing people for their sins."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | last=Drange | first=Theodore |authorlink=Theodore Drange | year=1998 | title=Nonbelief as Support for Atheism | booktitle=Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy | url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Reli/ReliDran.htm | accessdate=2007-01-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204050102/http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Reli/ReliDran.htm| archivedate= 4 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drange concludes that the argument should be put forward only in relation to theists who already accept the first premise and believe in a god who is perfectly loving.

Most theists, in fact, do admit that [[love (religious views)|love]] is a central concept in almost all of the world's religions. God is often directly associated with love, especially with [[agape]]. Theologians such as [[Tom Wright (theologian)|N.T. Wright]] suggest that our experience of love is itself a [[argument from love|proof of God's existence]].  However, there are a few others (e.g. Brian Davies in the Thomist tradition) who suggest that the modern interpretation of what it means to say God loves human beings is incorrect, and so that God is able to be loving in a sense while actually willing disbelief.

=== Nonresistant nonbelief, lack of evidence, and sin ===

When asked what he would say when facing God on judgment day, [[Bertrand Russell]] famously replied that he would say "Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence!" Some nonbelievers may have hidden from themselves what seems to them to be possible evidence of the divine, but the view of the hiddenness argument is that others have tried hard to believe in God. Schellenberg addresses this difference with his distinction between culpable and ''inculpable'' nonbelief, with the latter defined as "non-belief that exists through no fault of the non-believer."&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;

Historically, the [[Calvinist]] tradition has placed the blame on nonbelievers. Calvin's religious [[epistemology]] is based on the [[sensus divinitatis]] (Sense of Divinity), the view that the presence of God is universally perceived by all humans. [[Paul Helm]] explains, "Calvin’s use of the term 'sense' signals that the knowledge of God is a common human endowment; mankind is created not only as capable of knowing God, but as actually knowing him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Helm | first=Paul | author-link=Paul Helm|year=1998 | title=John Calvin, the Sensus Divinitatis, and the noetic effects of sin | journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=87–107 | doi=10.1023/A:1003174629151}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this tradition, there is no inculpable or nonresistant nonbelief. [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], the 18th century American theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of "true benevolence," a willingness to be open to the truth about God. Thus, the failure of non-believers to see "divine things" is in his view due to "a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish insensibility of their truth and importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Edwards | first=Jonathan | year=1970 | title=Original Sin | authorlink=Jonathan Edwards (theologian) | editor=Clyde A. Holbrook | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-300-01198-9}} As quoted and represented in Howard-Snyder (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics of theism and the problem of natural nonbelief ===

In modern times, there are fewer proponents of these views. One reason is that, as Stephen Maitzen argues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Maitzen | year=2006 | title=Divine Hiddenness and the Demographics of Theism | journal=[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious Studies]] | volume=42 | pages=177–191 | url=http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_Hiddenness.pdf | doi=10.1017/S0034412506008274 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anthropology]] has long established that while religious belief in general is essentially universal, belief in what Calvin would recognize as God is very unevenly distributed among cultures (consider for example [[God in Buddhism]], [[Jain cosmology]], or non-theistic [[animism]]). If God exists, then why, Maitzen asks, does the prevalence of belief in God vary so dramatically with cultural and national boundaries? Jason Marsh has extended this kind of demographic challenge by focusing on human evolution and cognitive science of religion. Why is theistic belief apparently non-existent among early humans but common at later times, at least in some regions?  According to Marsh, the hiddenness problem is harder to answer once we appreciate that much nonbelief is 'natural', owing to the kinds of minds people naturally possess and to their place in evolutionary and cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Jason | last=Marsh| year=2013 | title=Darwin and the Problem of Natural Nonbelief | journal=[[The Monist]]| volume=42 | pages=177–191 | url=http://philpapers.org/archive/MARDAT-7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason why many philosophers no longer attribute nonbelief to human sinfulness has to do with respect. In fact, modern critics, such as Howard-Snyder, who praised Schellenberg's book for being "religiously sensitive,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Howard-Snyder |first=Daniel |year=1995 |title=Book review: John Schellenberg, ''Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason'' (Cornell 1993) |journal=Mind |volume=104 |issue=414 |pages=430–435 |url=http://www.wwu.edu/~howardd/bookreviews/schellenberg.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928070142/http://www.wwu.edu/~howardd/bookreviews/schellenberg.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are similarly sensitive towards the nonbeliever. Howard-Snyder wrote:
{{quote|Even though some nonbelievers lack true benevolence, the empirical evidence strongly suggests that others possess it since they really do earnestly seek the truth about God, love the Good, assess evidence judiciously, and, if anything, display a prejudice for God, not against Him.&lt;ref name="hs2006" /&gt;}}

=== Would a perfectly loving God prevent nonresistant nonbelief? ===

The most serious criticisms of the hiddenness argument have been leveled against the idea that a perfectly loving God would prevent nonresistant nonbelief. Schellenberg argues in two steps, by first claiming that a loving God would enable humans to partake in a relationship with it, and then, assuming that belief in that god is a necessary condition for such relationships to occur, inferring that a loving God would not permit nonbelief. He states:
{{quote|There is, first of all, the claim that if there is a personal God who is perfectly loving, creatures capable of explicit and positively meaningful relationship with God, who have not freely shut themselves off from God, are always in a position to participate in such relationship – able to do so just by trying to.&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;}}
He justifies this claim by arguing that a conception of divine love can best be formed by extrapolating the best aspects of love in human relations, and draws an analogy with perfect parental love:
{{quote|The perfectly loving parent, for example, from the time the child can first respond to her at all until death separates them, will, insofar as she can help it, see to it that nothing ''she'' does ever puts relationship with herself out of reach for her child.&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;}}
But, says Schellenberg, belief in God's existence is necessary for engaging in such a meaningful relationship with God. He therefore concludes that if there is a perfectly loving God, such creatures will always believe in it. He further argues that since belief is involuntary, these creatures should always have evidence "causally sufficient" for such belief:
{{quote|The presence of God will be for them like a light that – however much the degree of its brightness may fluctuate – remains on unless they close their eyes.&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt;}}

==Objections and counterarguments==

=== Skeptical theism ===
[[Skeptical theism]] is the view that we should remain skeptical of claims that our perceptions about God's purposes can reasonably be considered good evidence of what they are .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Sceptical theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=The Rutledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016|quote=Sceptical theists are ... sceptical of our abilities to discern whether the evils in our world constitute good evidence against the existence of God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Sceptical theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=Rutledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016|quote=The sceptical element of sceptical theism can be used to undermine various arguments for atheism including both the argument from evil and the argument from divine hiddenness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central thesis of skeptical theism is that it would not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being's reasons for permitting a perception of evil or alleged hiddenness to be beyond human comprehension.&lt;sup&gt;[[Skeptical theism#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; That is, what is perceived as hiddeness may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils.

==== Noseeum defense ====
The philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the philosopher William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil, which is equally applicable to a perception of hiddenness:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some evidential arguments ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism, American|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly .|volume=16|pages=335–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2005|title=Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|journal=The Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|pages=241–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1988|title=Evil and Theodicy|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=16|pages=119–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|title=Ruminations about Evil|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=5|pages=69–88.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically unsound. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~bergmann/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/OHPT-bergmann-preprint.pdf|title=Oxford Handbook to Philosophical Theology (Skeptical Theism and the Problem of Evil)|last=Bergmann|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Flint|editor-first=Thomas|editor-link=|location=Oxford|pages=374–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeptical theist and noseum defense place the burden of proof on the atheist to prove that their intuitions about God are trustworthy.

=== Unreasonable demands on God ===
This argument is sometimes seen as demanding God to prove his existence, for example by performing miracles. Critics have argued that even in Schellenberg's more refined version, the nonbeliever is imposing her own [[epistemological]] expectations on the will of God. A detailed discussion of these kinds of demands, and their moral and spiritual implications, is provided by [[Paul Moser]],&lt;ref name="pm_ne"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Moser | first=Paul | year=2001 | chapter=Cognitive Idolatry and Divine Hiding | chapterurl=http://www.luc.edu/faculty/pmoser/idolanon/CognitiveIdolatry.html | title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays | isbn=0-521-00610-4 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; who says that such demands amount to cognitive idolatry. He defines [[idolatry]] as "our not letting the true God be Lord in our lives" and instead committing to something other than God by pursuing a quest for self-realization in our own terms. If this is idolatry in our actions, then idolatry in our knowing, he says, is as follows:
{{quote|Cognitive idolatry relies on a standard for knowledge that excludes the primacy of the morally self-transforming knowledge of God central to knowing God as Lord. It rests on an epistemological standard, whether empiricist, rationalist, or some hybrid, that does not let God be Lord. Such idolatry aims to protect one's lifestyle from serious challenge by the God who calls, convicts, and reconciles. It disallows knowledge of God as personal subject and Lord to whom we are morally and cognitively responsible. It allows at most for knowledge of God as an undemanding object of human knowledge.&lt;ref name="pm_ne" /&gt;}}

Schellenberg considers this criticism irrelevant to the argument, which in his opinion, does not impose any demands for demonstrations of God's power, but rather looks for evidence that "need only be such as will be causally sufficient for belief in the absence of resistance... This result might be effected through the much more spiritually appropriate means of religious experience, interpreted in the sensitive manner of a [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] or a [[Kierkegaard]]."&lt;ref name="jl2005a" /&gt; Schellenberg then expresses a certain frustration that theistic writers who otherwise extol the value of religious experiences deny non-theists the right to do so.

=== Soul-making theodicy ===

[[John Hick]] used the term "soul-making" in his theodicy ''Evil and the God of Love'' to describe the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray,&lt;ref name="mm-ne"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Murray | first=Michael J. | year=2001 | chapter=Deus Absconditus | chapterurl=http://server1.fandm.edu/Departments/Philosophy/staticpages/Murray/Hiddenness_Murray.pdf | title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays | isbn=0-521-00610-4 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem that it is not hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then "any desire that we might have to believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed."

Critics note here that, for example, in Christianity (and even more in Judaism, where God is represented as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people wouldn't believe anyway but if God knows this before creating, there is a problem about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.godonthe.net/evidence/satan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unknown purpose defense ===

[[Alvin Plantinga]] writes that the statement "We can see no good reason for God to do X" only implies "There is no good reason for God to do X" on the assumption that "If there were a good reason for God to do X, we would be able to see it," which he suggests is absurd.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga]] ''Warranted Christian Belief'' {{ISBN|0-19-513192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point might be applied to versions of the argument from nonbelief that suggest without support that there is no good reason for God to permit nonbelief.

=== There really are no atheists defense ===

This is the argument that all true atheists are at heart lying so that they may live in a way that is contrary to God's commands (as seen in particular interpretations of Romans 1:18-25). Critics note that there are atheists who are not lying and are not using their atheism as an escape to sin. Proponents note, however, that they could just as easily still be lying, perhaps not to others anymore but themselves (i.e. loving the wrong woman argument{{clarify|date=October 2015}}). Some have claimed this argument, however, fails to account for Stephen Maitzen's point on the demographics of theism. If all atheists are liars, why are people in some societies so much more likely to lie than in others? &lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_Hiddenness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, some have also claimed this argument fails to account for Jason Marsh's point on natural nonbelief in early humans. Since there was quite plausibly such a thing as natural nonbelief in early humans, then it doesn't make much sense to say that said nonbelief is self-deceptive. That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.
&lt;ref&gt;https://philpapers.org/rec/MARDAT-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drange's argument from nonbelief==

Theodore Drange proposed a version of the nonbelief argument in 1996. He considers the distinction between culpable and inculpable nonbelief to be unhelpful in the argument, arguing instead that the mere existence of nonbelief is evidence against the existence of God. A semi-formal presentation of the argument is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Drange | first=Theodore | authorlink=Theodore Drange | year=1996 | title=The Arguments From Evil and Nonbelief | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html | accessdate=2007-01-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070110135633/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html| archivedate= 10 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#If God exists, God:
## wants all humans to believe God exists before they die;
## can bring about a situation in which all humans believe God exists before they die;
## does not want anything that would conflict with and be at least as important as its desire for all humans to believe God exists before they die; and
## always acts in accordance with what it most wants.
# If God exists, all humans would believe so before they die (from 1).
# But not all humans believe God exists before they die.
# Therefore, God does not exist (from 2 and 3).

Drange's argument is directed primarily to Christians, and the philosopher Laura Garcia has replied from that perspective. She says that Drange's argument hinges on the idea that belief in God's existence is, according to Christians, necessary for salvation. According to Garcia this idea is mistaken: "many Christians deny this claim and the Catholic Church explicitly rejects it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garcia |first=Laura |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Howard-Snyder |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Moser |title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=84 |chapter=St. John of the Cross and the Necessity of Divine Hiddenness |isbn=0-521-00610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as Garcia notes, Drange has answered that for many Christians—in particular, evangelical Christians—his point should remain convincing, and that there are in any case other good things that belief in God can bring for humans, which a good God would desire, such as peace of mind and a sense of meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garcia |first=Laura |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Howard-Snyder |editor2-first=Paul |editor2-last=Moser |title=Divine Hiddenness: New Essays |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=85 |chapter=St. John of the Cross and the Necessity of Divine Hiddenness |isbn=0-521-00610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''asclepeion''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀσκληπιεῖον}} ''Asklepieion''; Ἀσκλαπιεῖον in [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]]; [[Latin]] ''aesculapīum'') was a '''healing temple''' in ancient [[Greece]] (and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]), sacred to the god [[Asclepius]], the Greek god of medicine. These healing temples were a place where patients would visit to receive either treatment or some sort of healing, whether it was spiritual or physical.

[[File:Kos Asklepeion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tourists enjoying the panoramic view of the city from the ''Askleipion'' on [[Kos]]]]

Asclepius may first have been worshipped as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]] in [[Trikala#Antiquity|Trikka (modern Trikala)]], [[Thessaly]], [[Greece]]. Ancient mythographers generally regarded Trikka as the place of Asclepius' birth, but to date archaeological excavations have yet to uncover his sanctuary there.&lt;ref&gt;Edelstein, E. J. and L. L. Edelstein. ''Asclepius: a collection and interpretation of the testimonies''. 2 vols. The Publications of the Institute of the History of Medicine. (Baltimore, 1945): 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Melfi | first= M. |title= I santuari di Asclepio in Grecia| language= Italian| publisher= 2 vols. |work= [[Studia Archaeologica]] |volume= 157 |location= Rome| year= 2007| page= 511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epidaurus, on the other hand, was the first place to worship Asclepius as a god, beginning sometime in the 5th century BC. The asclepieion at [[Epidauros|Epidaurus]] is both extensive and well preserved. There is also an asclepieion located on the south slopes of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] which dates to around 420 BC.

Starting around 350 BC, the cult of [[Asclepius]] became increasingly popular. Pilgrims flocked to asclepieia to be healed. They slept overnight ("incubation") and reported their dreams to a priest the following day. He prescribed a cure, often a visit to the baths or a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. Since snakes were sacred to Asclepius, they were often used in healing rituals. Non-venomous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept.

Asclepeia included carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Risse| first= G. B. |title= Mending bodies, saving souls: a history of hospitals| publisher= Oxford University Press| year= 1990| page= 56| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=htLTvdz5HDEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=History+of+Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20Hospital%2BAsclepieion&amp;f=false| via= Google Books| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Asclepieion of [[Epidaurus]], three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there.  Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, with the patient in a dream-like state of induced sleep known as "enkoimesis" ({{lang-el|ἐγκοίμησις}}), not unlike anesthesia, induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Askitopoulou| first1= H| last2=  Konsolaki| first2= E| last3=  Ramoutsaki| first3= I| last4= Anastassaki| first4= E| title= Surgical cures by sleep induction as the Asclepieion of Epidaurus| work= The history of anesthesia: proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium| publisher= Elsevier Science B.V, International Congress Series | volume= 1242| date= December 2002| pages= 11–17| url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531513102007173 | doi= 10.1016/S0531-5131(02)00717-3 | via= sciencedirect.com | accessdate= July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] remarked that, at the asclepieion of [[Titani|Titane]] in [[Sicyon]] (founded by [[Alexanor]], Asclepius' grandson), statues of [[Hygieia]] were covered by women's hair and pieces of [[Babylon]]ian clothes.  According to inscriptions, the same sacrifices were offered at [[Paros]].

[[Hippocrates]] is said to have received his medical training at an asclepieion on the isle of [[Kos]]. Prior to becoming the personal physician to the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Galen]] treated and studied at the famed asclepieion at [[Pergamon]].

== Asclepius ==
[[File:Asclepius - Project Gutenberg eText 21325.png|thumb|Asclepius holding the staff with a snake wrapped around it that serves as the inspiration for the [[Rod_of_Asclepius|symbol of medicine]]. ]]
In Greek mythology and religion, [[Asclepius]] was the Grecian God of Medicine, descended from [[Apollo]] and the [[Coronis (mythology)|Coronis]]. He received his name as a result of his birth in which his mother had to have her womb cut open in order for him to be birthed (now known as a [[cesarean section]]). Asclepius means "to cut open".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Asklepios.html|title = ASCLEPIUS: Greek God of Medicine &amp; Doctors {{!}} Mythology|date = |accessdate = |website = theoi.com|publisher = |last = Atsma|first = Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2015}} According to Greek mythology, in his upbringing, he was taught the art of medicine by the centaur [[Chiron]]. Through his studies, he had become so deft at the art of medicine that he was able to return the living from the dead.

The symbol of [[Rod of Asclepius|a snake wrapped around a staff]], which is seen throughout all medical infrastructures as well as the [[American Medical Association]] in modern times, is reminiscent of the staff that Asclepius carried.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greek Medicine - Asclepius |url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_asclepius.html|website = nlm.nih.gov| publisher= US National Library of Medicine| accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temple of Asclepius in Epidaurus ==
Located on the [[Argolid Peninsula|Argolid plain]] of the east Peloponnese in Greece, Epidaurus was the main asclepion. The healing temple was named after Asclepius, the son of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Epidaurus|url = http://www.ancient.eu/epidaurus|website = Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate = 2015-10-26| via= ancient.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Epidaurus, there were various people such as physicians and priests who would assist those who sought a session of healing from these professionals. Patients would come pay homage to the gods by making pilgrimages to the site, performing a prayer or a sacrifice, giving monetary gifts or even sleep at the temple. The Epidaurus also served as a sanctuary for those who were extremely ill. It was eventually expanded to a one hundred eighty-room institution to house the dying and women in labour during the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Procedures Performed at the Asclepeion ==
There were two steps in order for a patient to be considered to be treated in the Asclepeion. The first of which is the [[Catharsis|Katharsis]] or purification stage. This is when a patient undergoes a series of baths and other methods of purging, such as a clean diet over a series of several days or purging their emotions through art. The patient would then make an offering such as money or a prayer to the temple, therefore to Asclepius. The priest of the temple then gives the patient a prayer in which it would ease the patient's mind and create a more positive outlook for them.

Afterwards, comes [[Incubation (ritual)|incubation]] or dream therapy. This is the process in which patients would spend the night at the temple of Asclepius and during the night, they would be visited by a god. If the patient was lucky, Asclepius himself would visit him. The patient would then receive the proper treatment whilst in the dream or receive directions from Asclepius on what the necessary steps were to treat their ailment. If Asclepius did not visit the patient, when the patient wakes up, they will then tell their dream to a priest or a dream-interpreter and depending on the type of dream is the type of treatment that the patient will receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The First Hospital - Asclepius and the Temples of Healing|url = http://historywiz.com/didyouknow/asclepius.html|website = historywiz.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pautaliya, Asklepion|url = http://pautaliya-asklepion.free.bg/|website = pautaliya-asklepion.free.bg|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chittagong was formerly known as "Chaityagrama" "town with Buddhist shrines".&lt;ref&gt;The Buddhists of Chittagong, Appendix to Chapter 3, Bengal district gazetteers, 1908, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; It was a center of Mahayana Buddhism in the 10th century. [[Magh people|Magh]] was the general term used for Buddhists; Barua's are also termed ''Rajbansi'' "of royal descent".

They insist that they came from the [[Aryavarta]] or the country of the Aryans which is practically identical to the country later known as Majjhimadesa or Madhyadesa in the Pali texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/bangladesh-txt.htm Buddhism in Bangladesh]&lt;/ref&gt; Bengali speaking Barua people of Chittagong are all Buddhist by religion, unlike [[Assamese people|Assamese]] [[Barua]] of Assam. Barua came from "Baru" "great" and "arya", meaning "noble ones". 

A Magh king, Jaychand, ruled the Chittagong region in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Magh raiders in Bengal, Jamini Mohan Ghosh

==Mahayana Buddhism==
[[File:Dipa Ma IMS.png|thumb|right|[[Dipa Ma]], a prominent Buddhist master in Asia of Barua descent.]]
[[Bauddha Dharmankur Sabha]]  Buddhist religious organisation founded by Kripasharan Mahasthavir in Calcutta on 5 October 1892.  Kripasharan Mahasthavir was its first president and Surendralal Mutsuddi its secretary.   The journal of the Dharmankur Sabha, Jagajjyoti, edited by Gunalangkar Sthavir and Shraman Punnananda Swami, was first published in 1908. It was subsequently also edited by Benimadhab Barua.

Noted scholar Dr. [[Benimadhab Barua]](1888-1948),  was born in 1888 in the village of Mahamuni under Raozan Thana, Chittagong. He was the son of Kaviraj Rajchandra Talukder. Benimadhab assumed the title of ‘Barua’. In 1913 he obtained MA degree in [[Pali]] from University of Calcutta. He also studied law at Calcutta City College and Calcutta Law College. He became one of the pioneers of revitalization of Buddhism in the Barua Community. Benimadhab joined Mahāmuni Anglo-Pāli Institution as headmaster in 1912. From 1913-14 he worked as a lecturer in the Pāli department of the University of Calcutta. He went to England on a government scholarship in 1914. He earned an MA in Greek and Modern European Philosophy from the University of London. In 1917 he was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of London. He was the first Asian to do so.[citation needed] After returning to India in 1918, Benimadhab rejoined Calcutta University and was promoted to professorship. He improvised the syllabus of the MA course in Pali, apart from his work in the departments of Ancient Indian History and Culture (1919–48) and Sanskrit (1927–48) in the same university.[1] &lt;ref&gt;Dr. B.M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">The '''Bot''' are a [[Hindu]] [[caste]] found in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India. They are distinct from the [[Bhotiya]] [[ethnic group]] of the Indian [[Terai]], although like the Bhotiya claim a [[Nepal]]i origin.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 344 to 350 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The community is said to have gotten its name from the fact that they are descended from the king of Botwal, a state that once existed in Nepal. They are said to have immigrated to what is now the [[Bahraich District]] of Uttar Pradesh in 1775. The community claim to Raghuvanshi [[Rajput]]s, a claim not accepted by neighbouring [[Rajput]] groups. They are a small community, found mainly in twenty villages of Jarwal, Fakharpur, Kaiserganj, Huzurpur and Hariharpur blocks of Bahraich District. The community now speak [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], and have customs similar to neighbouring [[Hindu]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 344 to 350 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bot are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]], but do not marry within the village. They occupy their own villages, very rarely sharing them with any other caste. Land is their main economic source, and they are community of cultivators. Of their main crops, they grow paddy and maize in the winter, and wheat and pulses in the summer. Each of their settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a ''biradari panchayat''. These ''biradari panchayats'' are headed by chaudhary, the village headman. The [[panchayat]] acts as instrument of social control, dealing with issues such as divorce and adultery.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6331">{{Buddhism}}
[[Costa Rica]] has more [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] than the other countries in [[Buddhism in Central America|Central America]] with almost 100,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buddhism in Costa Rica|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/buddhism-in-costa-rica/|accessdate=17 December 2017|agency=The Costa Rican News|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2.34% of total population), followed closely by [[Panama]], with almost 70,000 (2.1% of total population). 

Buddhism was introduced in the country for the first time by [[Chinese-Costa Rican|Chinese immigrants]] during the early 19th and 20th century, but an important part of these migrants later became --at least nominally-- [[Roman Catholics]] due to the then very [[Religious Conservative|Conservative]] [[Catholic country|Catholic-lead society]]. But there is registry that some of them kept their Buddhist believes practicing discreetly, for example, the testimony of writer [[Jorge Cardona]] of Buddhist altars among Chinese merchants in the early 20 century [[Puntarenas Province|Puntarenas]].&lt;ref name=despertar&gt;{{cite news|title=El despertar de Buda|url=http://www.nacion.com/archivo/el-despertar-de-buda/LBL6KIFQZVGATNHZ33YOGREZNM/story/|access-date=17 December 2017|agency=La Nación|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of Buddhism in the country was the [[Theosophical Society]], popular among important members of the economic and intellectual elite. Among the poets and theosophists that wrote Buddhist-influenced poetry are [[Roberto Brenes Mesén]] and José Basileo Acuña Zeledón. However one of the first Buddhist temples made in the country was the Casa Zen (Zen House) of Costa Rica created in 1974 with support of the [[Japanese government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El nacimiento de la Casa Zen y los inicios del budismo en Costa Rica|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtDX9NxO8WY|work=[[Amelia Rueda]]|access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casa Zen de Costa Rica|url=http://www.casazen.org/|access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the first Dharma Center of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the Gelug tradition founded in 1989 after the [[Dalai Lama]]'s first visit to the country. 

Nowadays, it is also driven by the very minor presence of Buddhist missionary groups, such as [[Soka Gakkai International]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}, which has establish a community center at San Jose. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia|url=http://sgi.cr/budismo/concpt/vida_shakyamuni.html|website=SGI Costa Rica|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been a tendency  for growing dissatisfaction with [[Catholicism]], the dominant religion. Some convert to other branches of [[Christianity]], most notably [[Protestantism]] (with a growing number of Protestant churches throughout Costa Rica). But others stay as [[agnostic]]s, [[atheist]]s or "[[Freethought|free thinker]]s". It is these latter groups, especially if already interested or practicing some form of [[meditation]], that can become influenced or inspired by "exotic religions" (in Costa Rica) such as Buddhism and therefore convert to it, or adopt it as a [[philosophy]].

==Tibetan Buddhism==
The four [[Schools of Tibetan Buddhism|traditional schools]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] are present in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=despertar /&gt;

The best known and first group is the "Asociación Cultural Tibetano-Costarricense"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetencostarica.com/ tibet in costa rica] (official website, in spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; (Tibetan-Costarrican Cultural Association), which was established in 1989 CE after the first visit of the XIV [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]] in [[Latin America]]. Years later, in 2004 CE, the XIV [[Dalai Lama]] revisited Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetencostarica.com/VisitaSS.html Visit of H.H. the XIV Dalai Lama - 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921191949/http://www.tibetencostarica.com/VisitaSS.html |date=September 21, 2008 }} (in spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; He gave some discourses, including one in the [[University of Costa Rica]] and took part in ecumenical activities that included Costa Rica's archbishop. The Dalai Lama's third visit planned for 2008 was cancelled after the Costa Rican government under [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] renewed relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] over [[Taiwan]], resulting in soured relationships with the Buddhist community and criticism from the opposition. Opposition leader [[Ottón Solís]] publicly supported the Dalai Lama and promise to name the National Stadium in his honor in case he won the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ottón Solís Is "Putting Wood On The Fire" Of The Sino-Tibet Conflict|url=http://www.thetibetpost.com/en/news/international/612-otton-solis-is-qputting-wood-on-the-fireq|access-date=17 December 2017|agency=The Tibet Post|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACTC runs the ''Thousand Eyes Compassive Buddha'' Dharma Center located in Barrio Amón, [[San José, Costa Rica|San José City]]. This center is of the [[Gelug |Gelug tradition]]. There is also a Diamond Way Buddhist Center in [[Curridabat]], San José ([[Karma Kagyu]] lineage)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.facebook.com/BudismoCaminodelDiamanteCostaRica&lt;/ref&gt; and a  Lingmincha Center of the [[Nyingma]]-[[Bon religion|Bon]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find a Center or Sangha|url=http://www.ligmincha.org/index.php/es/centros/encuentra-un-centro-o-sangha.html|website=Lingminch International|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zen Buddhism==
The Casa Zen of Costa Rica center is located in [[Santo Domingo (canton), Costa Rica|Santo Domingo]], [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://casazen.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Others==

There are also temples of [[Theravada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asociación de Budismo Theravada de Costa Rica|url=https://asotheracr.org/|access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia del Templo Shaolin|url=http://www.shaolincr.com/historia-del-templo-shaolin/|work=Shaolin.cr|access-date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Chinese Buddhism]] [[Pagoda]].&lt;ref name=despertar /&gt;

==Christianization of saints==
Historian [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], in his ''The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity'', argued that one cannot equate the ancient cults of pagan gods with the later cults of the saints.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter. ''The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity'',(1981), {{ISBN|0-226-07622-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Caesarius of Arles]] and other churchmen deplored certain customs that from time to time seem to develop around the saints, such as the prolonged drinking of toasts, ostensibly in honor of the saint.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=Christianisation+of+saints+and+feasts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5F8cXvnjX5&amp;sig=h6Tyi9dGTySqBHd8jgWtXtMsOzE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Wxq7VNG2IIHUgwTZ34GYAQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianisation%20of%20saints%20and%20feasts&amp;f=false Filotas, Bernadette. ''Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature'', PIMS, 2005] {{ISBN|9780888441515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[historicity]] of some Christian saints has been treated skeptically by a number of academics, either because there is a paucity of historical evidence for their origins, or due to resemblances to pre-Christian deities and festivals.

The legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] was derived, via [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] versions, from the life story of [[Siddartha Gautama]], known as the [[Buddha]]. The king-turned-monk Joasaphat (Arabic ''Yūdhasaf'' or ''Būdhasaf''; Georgian ''Iodasaph'') also gets his name from the [[Sanskrit]] [[Bodhisattva]], the term traditionally used to refer to Gautama before his [[Bodhi|awakening]].&lt;ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Barlaam and Josaphat}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barlaam and Ioasaph were placed in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] calendar of [[saint]]s on 26 August, and in the Roman [[martyrology]] they were canonized (as "Barlaam and Josaphat") and assigned 27 November. The story was translated into Hebrew in the Middle Ages as ''Ben-HaMelekh ve HaNazir'' ("The King's Son and the [[Nazirite]]"). Thus the Buddhist story was turned into a Christian and Jewish legend.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs (ed. and inducer), Barlaam and Josaphat. English Lives of Buddha (David Nutt, London, 1896) xvi-xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of the Christianization of feasts==

===St. Valentine's Day===
[[Saint Valentine's Day]] on 14 February, commemorates three separate martyrs named Valentinus. One is described as a priest at Rome, another as bishop of Interamna (modern Terni). Both apparently died sometime in the second half of the third century and were buried at different locations on the [[Flaminian Way]]. The connection of the saints' feast day with popular romantic customs arose in the Middle Ages, when it was commonly believed that half way through the second month of the year, the birds began to pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15254a.htm  Thurston, Herbert. "St. Valentine." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 18 Jan. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Kellogg and Robert Cox, have claimed that the modern customs of [[Saint Valentine's Day]] originate from the Roman [[Lupercalia]] customs.&lt;ref name="Ansgar1986"&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly, in "Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine" (Leiden: Brill) 1986, pp. 58-63&lt;/ref&gt; But [[J. Hillis Miller]] and others find the hypothesis unconvincing: they say there is no proof that the modern customs of [[Saint Valentine's Day]] can be traced to the Lupercalia, and the claim seems to originate from misconceptions about the festivities.&lt;ref name="Ansgar1986"/&gt; Jack Oruch says there is no written record of Gelasius ever intending a replacement of Lupercalia.&lt;ref name="Oruch1981"&gt;Jack B. Oruch, "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February" ''Speculum'', 56.3 (July 1981:534–565)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Easter===
Christians generally regard Easter as the most important festival of the ecclesiastical calendar. It is also the oldest feast of the Christian Church, and connected to the Jewish [[Passover]]. Many terms relating to Easter, such as ''paschal'' are derived from the Hebrew term for ''passover''. In many non-English speaking countries the feast is called by some derivation of "pasch". The English term, according to the Venerable [[Bede]], is an Anglo-Saxon form relating to [[Ēostre]], a Teutonic goddess of the rising light of day and spring.&lt;ref name=Holweck&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05224d.htm Holweck, Frederick. "Easter." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 18 Jan. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Mark's Day===
According to [[Hippolyte Delehaye]], the Greater Litanies of the Feast of [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] (April 25) are a continuation and adaptation of the Roman agricultural festival, [[Robigalia]].&lt;ref name=Delehaye&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nQFBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=Christianisation+of+saints+and+feasts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YVrYntVGWU&amp;sig=Jc5WxD9c2MBuu-yyr2FoZgMe9is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Wxq7VNG2IIHUgwTZ34GYAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Christianisation%20of%20saints%20and%20feasts&amp;f=false Delehaye, Hippolyte. ''The Legends of the Saints'', Longmans, Green, and Company, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

===All Hallows===
"Hallowtide",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/little-moreton-hall/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item994753/ |title=Tudor Hallowtide |year=2012 |publisher=National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071731/https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/little-moreton-hall/things-to-see-and-do/view-page/item994753/ |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the three days of [[Halloween]], [[All Saints' Day]], and [[All Souls' Day]] that are traditionally observed in [[Western Christian Church|Western Christianity]] from October 31 through November 2 as a commemoration of the dead.

In many early cultures, the day was considered to start at dusk. Similarly, in Celtic countries the year was considered to begin in winter at Samhain, and it was thought that the start of the year was a time when the world of the dead met that of the living; rather than a sinister event, this was considered a time when a feast should be laid on for the supposed temporary visit from the souls of the dead. The Orthodox tradition, deals rather with the zealous prayer for the dead, whom they believe are allowed to visit the living during 40 days after the moment of death, and always are greatly comforted and even saved from hell, through these prayers. In some Catholic traditions, the night is one when the graves of dead relatives are visited, with candles being lit, under a familiarly atmosphere, often including [[picnic]]; many historians argue that this is clearly derived from the pre-Christian events. The Christian festival was originally held annually on the week after [[Pentecost]], and is still held at about this date by the Orthodox churches, but in western Europe, churches began to hold it at the same time as the pre-Christian festivals commemorating the dead, and it was eventually moved officially, by [[Pope Gregory III]].

===Christmas===
[[Christmas]] on 25 December is, according to Christian tradition, a celebration of the birth of [[Jesus]]. Although there have been various folk suggestions regarding the origin of Christmas, the earliest historical source stating December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (170&amp;ndash;236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox]] which he placed on March 25, and then added nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mercer Dictionary of the Bible |last=Mills |first=Watson E. |authorlink= |author2=Edgar V. McKnight |author3=Roger Aubrey Bullard  |year=1990 |publisher=Mercer University Press |location= |isbn=0-86554-373-9 |page=142 |pages= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 10, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is historical evidence that by the middle of the 4th century the Christian churches of the East celebrated the birth and [[Baptism of Jesus]] on the same day, on January 6 while those in the West celebrated a Nativity feast on December 25 (perhaps influenced by the [[Winter solstice]]); and that by the last quarter of the 4th century, the calendars of both churches included both feasts.&lt;ref name=JBurnett &gt;''Aspects of the liturgical year in Cappadocia (325-430)'' by Jill Burnett Comings 2005 {{ISBN|0-8204-7464-9}} pp. 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freedom of religion in France''' is guaranteed by the constitutional rights set forth in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].

Since 1905 the French government has followed the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'', in which the State does not recognize any official ''religion'' (except for legacy statutes like that of military [[chaplain]]s and the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]] in [[Alsace-Moselle]]). Instead, it merely recognizes certain religious organizations, according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. In return, religious organizations are to refrain from involvement in the State's policy-making.

According to [[Pew Research Center]] in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Among the world's 25 [[List of countries and dependencies by population|most populous nations]], France is among the 12 countries with a high level of religious restrictions, according to 2015 data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious restrictions vary significantly in the world’s most populous countries|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/13/religious-restrictions-vary-significantly-in-the-worlds-most-populous-countries/|website=[[Pew Research Center]]|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, France has the second highest level of religious restrictions, behind only [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Restrictions on Religion Rise Modestly in 2015, Reversing Downward Trend|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/11/global-restrictions-on-religion-rise-modestly-in-2015-reversing-downward-trend/|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Terminology ===
French language terminology related to religion and freedom of religion differs somewhat from English. In particular, there are several misleading [[faux amis]] between French and English regarding religion:
* The French ''culte'' means "(religious) worship", or, in a legal context, an organized "religion", taken in a broad sense. An ''organisation cultuelle'' is thus an organization that supports religious worship, not a "cult". As explained below, there are financial and other operational constraints for being recognized as an ''association cultuelle'' for tax purposes.
* The French ''secte'' can have the meaning of the English [[sect]], especially when applied to [[Buddhism]]. However, in general parlance, it has the derogatory meaning of the English "[[cult]]".

===Government and religious organizations===
[[Image:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.]]
The relationship between government and religious organizations in France is defined by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 "Law concerning the separation of the churches and the state"]] (''"Loi concernant la séparation des Églises et de l'Etat"''). Its first sentence is, though:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Republic assures freedom of conscience. It guarantees the free exercise of religious worship under the sole restrictions hereafter in the interest of public order. The Republic does not grant recognition nor pay nor subsidises any church. (''La République assure la liberté de conscience. Elle garantit le libre exercice des cultes sous les seules restrictions édictées ci-après dans l'intérêt de l'ordre public. La République ne reconnaît, ne salarie ni ne subventionne aucun culte.'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which is considered by legal authorities to have equal legal standing with the [[Constitution of France]], states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one may be questioned about his opinions, [and the] same [for] religious [opinions], provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The law has the right to ward [i.e., forbid] only actions [which are] harmful to the society. Any thing which is not warded [i.e., forbidden] by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it [i.e., the law] does not order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus follows that the French government cannot arbitrarily regulate and prohibit religious activity; it is strictly constrained to regulate it only to the extent that there is a need to safeguard public order and prohibit actions harmful to society (such as, for instance, [[human sacrifice]]s).

The French concept of religious freedom did not grow out of an existing pluralism of religions but has its roots in a history with Roman Catholicism as the single official religion and including centuries of persecution of people not endorsing it, or straying from the most official line, from the [[Cathar]]s to the [[Hugenot]]s and the [[Jansenism|Jansenists]] – this lasted until the [[French Revolution]].

French insistence on the lack of religion in all things public (''[[laïcité]]'' or secularism) is a notable feature in the French ideal of citizenship. This concept of secularism, also plays a role in ongoing discussions about the wearing of scarves by Muslim women in public schools. In 2004, the French Parliament passed a law prohibiting the wearing of ostentatious religious garb in public primary and secondary schools; motivations included the tradition of keeping religious and political debates and proselytism out of such schools, as well as the preservation of the freedom of Muslim female students forced to wear certain costumes out of peer pressure. ''See [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]].''

The French Republic has always recognised individuals rather than groups and holds that its citizens' first allegiance is to society in general and not to a particular group, religious or otherwise; the opposing attitude, known as ''communautarisme'', is generally considered undesirable in political discourse in France. On the other hand, the state sees that it is also responsible to protect individuals from groups rather than to protect groups, religious or others.

Apart from special cases due to historical circumstances (the [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]] in [[Alsace-Moselle]] and the military chaplaincy regimes), the French government is prohibited by law from granting official recognition to religion, and is also prohibited from subsidizing them or paying their personnel. However the government grants recognition to legal entities (associations) supporting religious activities.   The difference is important, since the French government refuses to legally define what is a religion and what is not, and refuses to legally delimit the boundaries of religions. The state has a role in the appointment of bishops, directly in the case of Strasbourg and Metz, and indirectly (but with a rarely used power of veto) in that of other diocesan bishops. In consequence only suitable nationals are appointed and the episcopate does not reflect the ethnic diversity of practising Catholics in France.

Individuals organizing as groups with the exclusive purpose of worship (''associations cultuelles'') may register as such and get significant tax exemptions set by law. Religious groups with non-worship (e.g. humanitarian) activities are free to get organized as associations with the usual tax exemptions granted to secular associations. These definitions are covered by an extensive body of [[jurisprudence]] (roughly, [[case law]]) which focuses on the activities of the groups from a financial point of view, and does, according to law, not take religious doctrine into account.

The population of France is roughly 50% [[Roman Catholic]], 4–5% [[Islam|Muslim]], around 3% [[Protestantism|Protestant]], 1% [[Judaism|Jewish]], 1% [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], 1% other denominations, and 40% not religious (with 30% of [[Atheism|atheists]]).&lt;ref name=lemonde11&gt;{{cite news|last=Tincq|first=Henri|title=Les Français sont de moins en moins catholiques|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=972321&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-NC_01|accessdate=14 March 2012 |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=8749&amp;art=22782&amp;cHash=597202ac5o Franţa nu mai e o ţară catolică] (''France is no longer a Catholic country''), ''[[Cotidianul]]'', 2007-01-11; [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/01/10/wfra10.xml "France 'no longer a Catholic country'", [[Daily Telegraph]],  10 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stategov&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/ |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church attendance is low among Catholics, and polls indicate that a significant proportion of the population is [[atheist]] or [[agnostic]]. Since the French government does not collect data on religious preferences, all quoted numbers should be considered with caution.

==Attitudes with respect to minority religions and cults in France ==
{{main|About-Picard law}}
Since the 1970s and 1980s, an increasing number of new religious movements have become active in France. Certain body of beliefs such as [[Scientology]], the [[Children of God (New Religious Movement)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], the [[Raëlism]] or the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] were listed by parliamentary reports as dangerous or criminal [[cult]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp|title=Commission d'enquête sur les sectes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials and associations fighting excesses of such groups, justified these measures by the need to have appropriate legal tools and the need to fight criminal organizations masquerading as legitimate religious groups. Critics contended that those actions unfairly targeted minority religions, jeopardized freedom of religion, and were motivated by prejudice. The matters were made even more complex by the fact that some of the groups involved are based in the [[United States]], where they actively [[Lobbying|lobbied]] the intervention of the government of that country.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulties===
France, as well as other countries, was aware of various tragedies caused by groups labeled as "destructive cults" such as the [[Peoples Temple|People's Temple]], the [[Branch Davidians]] and [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and the suicide murders of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] which occurred in [[Quebec]], [[Switzerland]] and France. Furthermore, some groups such as the [[Church of Scientology]] were accused of defrauding their members.

The population in general is not in favor of groups described as cults. In 2000, a representative 1000 person [https://archive.is/20050324101513/http://www.csa-tmo.fr/dataset/data2K/opi20000215b.htm poll] indicated that the majority of the polled people considered cults a significant threat to [[democracy]] (73%), their family and friends (66%), and themselves (64%) and 86% (76% of adherents of other religions than Catholicism) favored legislation restricting cults.

Leaders of the French Protestant minority claim that freedom of religion was actually well protected in France and that cultural sensitivity and careful relationships with local authorities and other Christians could prevent most difficulties. 
* Jean-Arnold de Clermont, president of the French Association of Protestants:
::''"I have no time for the idea that we live in a country that represses religious liberties. We continue to enjoy total freedom in setting up religious organizations as long as the existing legislation is known and applied."''
*Stéphane Lauzet, the [[Nîmes]]-based general secretary of the French [[evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Alliance (part of the [[World Evangelical Fellowship]]):
::''"Christian groups encounter problems mostly when they misunderstand or ignore the complex technicalities of French law. Even aggressive evangelists can work without any real problems as long as they stick to the law."''

=== Complaints by minority religions and groups===
Some groups have complained that, following from the publications of those reports and the enactment of the [[About-Picard law]], they have suffered from discrimination by public authorities, private corporations and individuals.

The group ''[http://www.coordiap.com Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience]'', founded in January 2002, requested:
:''the dissolution of the MILS as its very purpose, "to fight against sects," is an affront to the French Constitution which guarantees the religious neutrality of the State and the principle of separation of Church and State''
:''the repeal of any discriminatory law containing the word "cult," "sect," "cultic," or "sectarian" as laws should not specify groups as "sectarian" or "cultic" as, in a democracy, all individuals and groups should be treated equally and in the same manner.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm|title=CAPLC pour la Liberté de Conscience, religion, croyance, conviction, pensée, culte,|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This group, however, has been qualified by a 2005 [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] report as a partisan organization whose "allegations are essentially anonymous and thus of uncertain provenance and reliability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219055614/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |archivedate=2005-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some limited controversy occurred in France concerning alleged religious discrimination regarding the security measures that the French government has deployed for official visits of [[China|Chinese]] officials and for festivities organised in collaboration with China, including the exclusion of pro-Tibet and pro-[[Falun Gong]] protesters from the path of the Chinese officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tibet.fr/jiang_zemin_en_france.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013053359/http://www.tibet.fr/jiang_zemin_en_france.htm |archivedate=2005-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2004/1/29/zip.html#0|title=Clearwisdom.net, Thursday, January 29, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2004/falun_001.htm#fbfj|title=CESNUR - Falun Gong Updates, January-March 2004|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] denounced the warm welcome of president Jiang Zemin in France, which it denounced as being motivated by economic prospects of trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20001117020000/http://www.fidh.org/lettres/lettre26.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many French politicians have denounced what they considered to be an over-zealous security apparatus in those visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fr.yuanming.info/a_images/2004/02/2004-02-24-soutien_fr.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050417001112/http://fr.yuanming.info/a_images/2004/02/2004-02-24-soutien_fr.jpg |archivedate=2005-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hldv.free.fr/ldebroissia/questions/visitepresidentc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020717121407/http://hldv.free.fr/ldebroissia/questions/visitepresidentc.html |archivedate=2002-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar controversial security measures have been implemented for the visit of former US president [[George W. Bush]], another foreign head of state controversial in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agircontrelaguerre.free.fr/article.php3?id_article=104]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reports by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom===
In its 2000 annual report by the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]], released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the [[U.S. Department of State]], it was reported that "The ensuing publicity [by the release of a parliamentary report against "sectes"] contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance and bias against minority religions. Some religious groups reported that their members suffered increased intolerance after having been identified on the list."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In its 2004 annual report by the same commission it  reports that "[...] official government initiatives and activities that targets "sects" or "cults" have fueled an atmosphere of intolerance toward members of minority religions in France. [...] These initiatives [the publication of reports characterizing specific groups as dangerous and the creating of agencies to monitor and fight these groups] and  are particularly troubling because they are serving as models for countries in Eastern Europe where the rule of law and other human rights are much weaker than in France".

They conclude with an assessment that since the restructuring of the main agency concerned with this issue (referring to the new MIVILUDES replacing its predecessor, MILS), have reportedly improved religious freedoms in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf Download PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051008044821/http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf |date=2005-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its February 2004 statement, the commission recommended that the U.S. government urge the government of France to ensure that any state regulations on public expression of religious belief or affiliation adhere strictly to international [[human rights]] norms and that the French government and legislature should be urged to reassess their initiatives in light of its international obligations to ensure that every person in France is guaranteed the [[Freedom of religion|freedom]] to manifest his or her religion or belief in public, or not to do so.

The Commission went on by giving advice to the French government that it should start to tackle immigration issues, which have been a topic of hot political debate for the past 25 years:
{{quote|The Commission also stated that though increased immigration in France in recent years has created new challenges for the French government, including integration of these immigrants into French society as well as problems of public order, these challenges should be addressed directly ...}}

The commission did not include France in their 2005 report.

==Official position about religious signs and symbols==
{{main|Anti-mask laws|French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|French ban on face covering}}
In 2004, France passed a law banning the use of "conspicuous" religious symbols in public schools, including the [[hijab]].&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |title=France |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206213909/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |archivedate=2011-02-06 |df= }} See drop-down essay on "Religious Freedom in France"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslims complained that the law infringed on their freedom of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observers.france24.com/en/content/20090605-obama-tackles-french-hijab-cairo-speech-france|title=Obama tackles the French on the hijab}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]] called the ban "a major affront to freedom of religion", noting that many Muslims believe it is mandated by religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The MWL and MPAC Strongly Oppose French Ban on Religious Expression|url=http://www.mwlusa.org/topics/dress/french_ban_hijab.htm|date=2003-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] stated that the law is "an unwarranted infringement on the right to religious practice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Roth Executive Director |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/02/26/france7666.htm |title=Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]], appointed by the US government, expressed concern for the law in its 2004 report. It stated that "The French government's promotion of its understanding of the principle of secularism should not result in violations of the internationally recognized individual right to freedom of religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf 2004 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051008044821/http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf |date=2005-10-08 }}, United States Commission on International Religious Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2010, an act of parliament was passed resulting in the ban on the wearing of face-covering headgear, including [[mask]]s, [[helmet]]s, [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]], [[niqāb]]s and other veils covering the face in public places, except under specified circumstances.&lt;ref name='nameofbill'&gt;{{Cite news| first = Peter | last = Allen | title = France's Senate backs National Assembly and bans women from wearing the burka in public | date = 14 September 2010 | publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1312016/Frances-Senate-bans-women-wearing-burka-public.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | work=Daily Mail | accessdate = 14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban also applies to the [[burqa]], a full-body covering, if it covers the face.&lt;ref name="nyt20100713"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/world/europe/14burqa.html|title=Parliament Moves France Closer to a Ban on Facial Veils|last=Erlanger|first=Steven|date=13 July 2010|work=The New York Times |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that a set of rules including a ban on religious signs or symbols at civil marriages was introduced in the 9th and 10th arrondissements of [[Marseille]]. The mayor-council of [[Marseille]] did not support the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Une mairie de Marseille interdit le port de signe religieux lors des mariages|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Religion/Urbi-Orbi/France/Une-mairie-de-Marseille-interdit-le-port-de-signe-religieux-lors-des-mariages-_NP_-2012-03-08-776310|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=[[La Croix]]|language=French|date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tanguy|first=Delphine|title=Marseille : les signes religieux interdits lors des mariages à la mairie ?|url=http://www.laprovence.com/article/a-la-une/marseille-les-signes-religieux-interdits-lors-des-mariages-a-la-mairie|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=[[La Provence]]|language=French|date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government activities against cults ==
{{see also|About-Picard law#Reactions}}

===Actions of the national government===
In 1982 premier minister [[Pierre Mauroy]] requested a report on ''sectes'' which was delivered by [[Alain Vivien]] in 1983. The "Rapport Vivien"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vivien|first=Alain|title=Les sectes en France expression de la liberté morale ou facteurs de manipulations ?|url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rap83b.htm|work=Rapport au Premier ministre 1983|publisher=Prevensectes.com|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines problems of families, possible reasons for this sudden increase in such groups, sects as described by themselves and by others, the legal situation in France and abroad, and recommends some actions like education of children in the sense of laïcité, better information of the general public, mediation between families and adherents by a family court, help to French adherents abroad, attention on the rights of children. It concludes with the Voltaire quotation: "''Que chacun dans sa loi cherche en paix la lumière.''" ("So that everyone within its law can search in peace for the light")

The [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] instituted the first [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] in 1995, headed by parliament members Alain Gest and Jacques Guyard, following the mass suicide of adepts of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]].

On March 21, 2000, the Justice Court of Paris found Jacques Guyard guilty of defamation for having called [[Anthroposophy]] a ''secte'' ("cult") practicing "mental manipulation". He was fined FF 20,000 and ordered to pay FF 90,000 to the anthroposophical Federation of [[Steiner school]]s. The Court stated that "the investigation [of that parliamentary report] was not serious. It is proved that it only considered affidavits by alleged 'victims' of Anthroposophy but that neither the authors of these affidavits nor the alleged perpetrators were heard by the [parliamentary] commission". The Paris judges also decided to strip Guyard of his parliamentary immunity in connection with this case.'' ([[Le Monde]] March 23, 2000)

The most controversial part of the report was the appendix, where a list of purported cults compiled by the general information division of the [[French National Police]] (''[[Renseignements généraux]]'') was reprinted. It contained 173 groups, including [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the Theological Institute of Nîmes (a fundamentalist [[Christian]] Bible college), and the [[Church of Scientology]]. Although this list has no statutory or regulatory importance, it is at the background of the criticism directed at France with respect to freedom of religion.

Major concerns listed in these official reports and other discussions include:
* the well-being of children raised in religious communities that isolate themselves from the rest of society, or, at least, ask their members to avoid social interaction with the rest of society;
* [[child abuse]], especially abusive [[corporal punishment]] or [[sexual abuse]];
* the defrauding of vulnerable members by the religious management;
* suicides and killings in [[destructive cult]]s;
* the advocacy of medical practices that are generally considered unsafe, and the prohibition of some "mainstream" medical practices;
* the aggressive [[proselytism|proselytizing]] of minors and vulnerable persons;
* the hidden influence peddling of certain groups in the administration and political circles.

The government of [[Alain Juppé]] created in 1996 the "''Observatoire interministériel des sectes''" ("interministerial board of observation of cults") which delivered yearly reports and out of which grew in 1998 the "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects/Cults" (MILS) headed by Alain Vivien. MILS was formed to coordinate government monitoring of ''sectes'' (name given to cults in France). In February 1998 MILS released its annual report. The activities of the MILS and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an anti-cult organization raised serious concerns and critiques from several human rights organizations and government bodies (See also [[About-Picard law#Reactions]]). In 1999, Vivien was put under police protection following threats and the burglary of his home ([[L'Humanité]], January 14, 1999; [https://web.archive.org/web/20050430103350/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385]).

Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism from groups targeted by the Report on Cult activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2002/fr_vivien.htm|title=Alain Vivien Resigns from President of the French Anti-Cult Mission - Alain Vivien démissionne de la présidence de la MILS|author=moreorless|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interministerial [[working group]] was formed to determine the future parameters of the Government's monitoring of sects, called the "Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances" ([[MIVILUDES]]; [http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/ official site]).

Headed by Jean-Louis Langlais, senior civil servant at the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]], MIVILUDES was charged with observing and analyzing movements that constitute a threat to public order or that violate French law, coordinating the appropriate response, informing the public about potential risks, and helping victims to receive aid. In its announcement of the formation of MIVILUDES, the Government acknowledged that its predecessor, MILS, had been criticized for certain actions abroad that could have been perceived as contrary to religious freedom. In an interview given in March 2003, Langlais emphasized that the issue at stake is not to fight "sects" as such but merely "deviances" these might have. However, he also admitted that it is difficult to define the concept of "deviances".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In May 2005 the former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin issued a circular  indicating that the list of cults published on the parliamentary report should no longer be used to identify cults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=PRMX0508471C|title=Circulaire du 27 mai 2005 relative à la lutte contre les dérives sectaires - Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
{{See also|Jehovah's Witnesses and governments#France}}
In a number of cases, minority religious groups have litigated against the national or local governments, or against private organizations, which they deemed to have infringed on their rights because of religious prejudice.

* The association of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have lost and won court cases regarding their tax-exempt status, specifically concerning action on the part of the government of France to imposed a retroactive 108% tax on all donations received to the organizational body of Jehovah's Witnesses in France, and/or a 60% tax on incoming donations. On June 30, 2011, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found the French government in violation of article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The ruling marked the first time France was found in violation of article 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press?i=003-3593926-4069518|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.scribd.com/doc/59824908/Comments-on-judgment-Jehovah-Witnesses-v-France|title=Comments on judgment Jehovah Witnesses v. France|work=Scribd|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001 the psychiatrist [[Jean-Marie Abgrall]] and called for by French justice as an expert concerning cult affairs won a court suit deposed against him by the [[Rael Movement]] (Belgian branch). The latter movement had seen two of its members convicted for [[child abuse]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://prevensectes.com/rael28.htm Procès Raël contre Jean-Marie Abgrall], [[Prevensectes]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 18, 2002, the  [[Court of Appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]] of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] reversed a decision by a lower court and convicted [[Jean-Pierre Brard]] – a French [[French National Assembly|deputy]], ''Journal 15-25 ans'', and the director of publication of this magazine, of libeling the Jehovah's Witnesses. The court ordered that a communiqué drafted by it be published in ''Journal 15-25 ans'' as well as in a national daily paper and that the defendants pay €4,000 to the Christian Federation of Jehovah's Witnesses. The verdict related to a September 2001 report on sects published by Journal 15-25 ans, where Brard accused the Jehovah's Witnesses of employing the same methods as international criminal organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coordiap.com/actu09.htm|title=CAPLC pour la Liberté de Conscience, religion, croyance, conviction, pensée, culte,|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy appealed the verdict to the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], which confirmed the conviction of Jean-Pierre Brard but canceled that of the director of publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007068741 Court of Cassation, September 30, 2003, no 03-80039].&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 6, 2002, the [[Auch]] court of large claims ordered the dissolution of an organization that had been explicitly created to prevent Jehovah's Witnesses from constructing a place of worship in Berdues. The court found that the organization's goal was to "hinder the free exercise of religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.droit-tj.fr/spip.php?article46|title=Doc : TGI Auch, 6 novembre 2002 - Droit des cultes &amp; Témoins de Jéhovah|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 17, 2002, the administrative court of [[Orléans]] annulled a municipal decision issued by the mayor of Sorel-Moussel, which granted him the preemptive right to purchase a plot of land that the local Jehovah's Witness community had intended to buy and use for the construction of a house of worship. The court considered that the mayor had abused his right of preemption, since he exerted it without having an urbanization project prior to preemption.&lt;ref name="coordiap.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coordiap.com/juri01.htm|title=CAPLC pour la Liberté de Conscience, religion, croyance, conviction, pensée, culte,|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 13, 2002, the administrative court of [[Poitiers]] annulled a municipal decision issued by the mayor of [[La Rochelle]], which refused the use of a municipal room to the Jehovah's Witnesses on grounds that the Witnesses were listed in the 1995 parliamentary report; the court ruled that, while a mayor may refuse the use of a room for a motive of public order, the motive that he used in this case was not a motive of public order.&lt;ref name="coordiap.com"/&gt;
* On March 21, 2000, the Justice Court of Paris found Jacques Guyard, one of the main author of the controversial parliamentary report against ''sects'' guilty of defamation for having called Anthroposophy a cult practicing "mental manipulation". He was fined, and his parliamentary immunity removed in connection with this case. ([[Le Monde]] March 23, 2000)
* On October 16, 2013, the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] condemned the refusals of the French administration to accept the religious ministers of Jehovah's Witnesses as prison [[chaplain]]s, explaining that the detainees "may exercise the religion of their choice, in accordance with the suitable conditions for organising the premises, within solely the limits imposed by security and good order in the institution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurel.info/spip.php?article2437 Jehovah's Witnesses chaplains must be approved for prisons, EUREL].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian mysticism}}
'''German mysticism''', sometimes called '''Dominican mysticism''' or '''Rhineland mysticism''', was a [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystical]] movement that was especially prominent within the [[Dominican order]] and in [[Germany]]. Although its origins can be traced back to [[Hildegard of Bingen]], it is mostly represented by [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]], and [[Henry Suso]]. Other notable figures include [[Rulman Merswin]] and [[Margaretha Ebner]], and the [[Friends of God]].

This movement often seems to stand in stark contrast with [[scholasticism]] and German Theology, but the relationship between scholasticism and German mysticism is debated. Viewed as a predecessor of the reformation, the contrast becomes very apparent. For example, the use of an approachable vernacular stands in stark contrast to the constrained Latin of the Scholastics, the increased focus on the laity stands in contrast to the more deeply sacramental understanding of the Church, and these elements are both taken up and transformed in the [[Martin Luther (resources)|writings of Martin Luther]]. German mysticism can also be viewed as a practical application of Scholasticism. Though Meister Eckhart is most well known for his popular German sermons, he also wrote a lengthy philosophical exposition of the same teachings in Latin. Some scholars have read him as a rather orthodox [[Thomist]], seeing his mysticism as flowing naturally from established teachings through Eckhart's own idiosyncrasies and exaggerations.

Some of the movement's characteristics:
* A focus on [[laymen]] as well as clerics
* An emphasis on instruction and [[preaching]]
* Downplaying [[ascetism]]
* A focus on the [[New Testament]] rather than the [[Old Testament]]
* A focus on the [[Christ]] rather than the [[Catholic Church|Church]]{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* A use of the vernacular ([[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) rather than [[Latin]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]

Some in the movement came under criticism by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] for [[heterodox]] or [[heresy|heretical]] opinions.

{{Thelema}}
'''Hadit''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|d|i|t}} (sometimes '''Had''') refers to a [[Thelemic]] deity. Hadit is the principal speaker of the second chapter of ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' (written or received by [[Aleister Crowley]] in 1904). He may refer to the serpent Apophis{{according to whom|date=October 2018}}, the [[Kundalini]], and the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]{{according to whom|date=October 2018}}. 

== Descriptions ==
Hadit identifies himself as the point in the center of the circle, the axle of the wheel, the cube in the circle, "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star," and the worshipper's own inner self. Hadit has been interpreted{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} as the inner spirit of man, the [[Holy Ghost]], the sperm and egg in which the DNA of man is carried, the Elixir Vitae. When juxtaposed with [[Nuit]] in ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', Hadit represents each unique point-experience. These point-experiences in aggregate comprise the sum of all possible experience, Nuith.

Hadit, "the Great God, the lord of the sky," is depicted on the [[Stele of Revealing]] in the form of the [[Winged sun|winged disk of the Sun]], [[Horus]] of [[Behdet]] (also known as the Behdeti). However, while the ancient Egyptians treated the Sun and the other stars as separate, Thelema connects the sun-god Hadit with every individual star. Furthermore, ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' says: "Every man and every woman is a star." &lt;ref&gt;The Book of the Law 1,3&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadit is the Secret Seed. In ''The Book of the Law'' he says; "I am alone: there is no God where I am.".&lt;ref&gt;The Book of the Law II,23&lt;/ref&gt; He is "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.".&lt;ref&gt;The Book of the Law II,6&lt;/ref&gt; He is identified with [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/220/crowley-comments.html the Old Comment] to ''Liber AL vel Legis'' II:22 says this explicitly&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Book of the Law'' he says, "I am the secret [[Serpent (symbolism)|Serpent]] coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down mine head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth are one. There is great danger in me...".&lt;ref&gt;The Book of the Law II,26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadit is the Fire of Desire at the Heart of Matter ([[Nuit]]){{according to whom|date=March 2018}}. The combination of the upward-pointing triangle of Hadit and the downward-pointing triangle of Nuit forms the Star of Spirit (the [[Hexagram]]). The union of the infinitely small Hadit and the infinitely great Nuit causes an explosive rapture which leads to [[samādhi]].

== History ==
The earlier, Egyptian version, went by the name of Heru-Behdeti or [[Horus]] of Behdet ([[Edfu]]), Haidith in [[greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruH.html#Horus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thoth]] let him take the form of the solar disk to help a younger version of Horus—Re-Horakhty, or [[Ra-Hoor-Khuit]]—in a battle with [[Set (mythology)|Set]] and his army. Both versions of Horus appear in the Egyptian image that Thelemites call [[Stele]] [[666 (number)|666]], a [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty 25]] or [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26]] offering stele formerly in the Boulaq Museum, but now in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, also known as the [[Stele of Revealing]]. Around the time of its creation, Egyptian funerary teachings apparently included "the new idea that the deceased could become one with the sun god, previously only a royal prerogative."&lt;ref&gt;Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, [http://www.wagenburg.at/staticE/page161.html online description of another wooden offering stele].

&lt;/ref&gt; His son and Ignacio's father, [[Joaquín Baleztena Muñagorri]], formed part of new Navarrese economic and political elites.&lt;ref&gt;Ángel García-Sanz Marcotegui, ''Elites económicas y políticas en la Restauración. La diversidad de las derechas navarras'', [in:]  ''Historia contemporánea'', 23 (2001), pp. 623-5; ''Annuario Riera'' of 1902 lists him among 20 "most important" rural owners in the merindad of Pamplona, see [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005006300&amp;page=1634&amp;search=joaquin+baleztena&amp;lang=es here]&lt;/ref&gt; Holding a number of rural properties in the [[comarca]] of [[Valles Meridionales (former comarca in Navarre)|Valles Meridionales]],&lt;ref&gt;José Andrés-Gallego, Pedro Pegenaute Garde, ''Navarra ca.1900-ca.1975'', s.l., available [http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/38216/1/CAPITULOS_DE_LIBROS299538%5B1%5D.pdf here], pp. 546-547&lt;/ref&gt; he was co-founder of [[Conducción de Aguas de Arteta]]&lt;ref&gt;compare David Allegría Suescun, ''Historia del abastecimiento de agua en la Comarca de Pamplona''  available [http://www.mcp.es/sites/default/files/documentos/historia_del_abastecimiento.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; and shareholder of a number of other local companies.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Carreras, ''Doctor Jordi Nadal: la industrialització i el desenvolupament econòmic d'Espanya'', vol. 2, Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|8447521451}}, 9788447521456 p. 910, Josean Garrues-Irurzun, ''Public utility of water and private service of production and distribution of electricity in Pamplona, 1893-1961'', Madrid 2008, available [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/17950/1/MPRA_paper_17950.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Elected [[Councillor|consejal]] of Pamplona in the 1880s and 1890s,&lt;ref&gt;elected on the Carlist-Basque ticket listed, García-Sanz 2001, pp. 623-5&lt;/ref&gt; he served as vicepresident of the local Circulo Carlista.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Joaquín Baleztena Muñagorri'' entry at ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' available [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/25508 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignacio's mother, María Dolores Ascárate Echeverría, was descendant to a Carlist family; her father served as officer under [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos V]] during the [[First Carlist War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 22.06.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignacio was born after the family had moved from Leitza to Pamplona. He received secondary education in the Piarist [[Colegio de los Escolapios]]&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 12.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised, like his 8 siblings, in the fervently Catholic ambience. His older sister, María Isabel, was initially supposed to marry [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]].&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 17.10.11&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother, [[Joaquín Baleztena Ascárate|Joaquín]], became the Carlist political leader in Navarre. His paternal cousins Arraiza Baleztena sympathised with Carlism and held different posts in the Pamplona ayuntamiento early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio was Teniente de Alcalde of Pamplona, while Juan Pedro was the Alcalde himself, see Araiza genealogy available [http://www.antzinako.org/RepLinajes/arraiza.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; His younger sister Dolores was a Carlist activist and author.

Married (1927) to Carmen Abarrategui Gorosábel,&lt;ref&gt;(1905-1992), daughter of [[Benito Abarrategui Zubía]] and Ascensión Gorosabel Eguidazu, see ''Geni'' genealogy service available [http://www.geni.com/people/Carmen-Abarrategui-Goros%C3%A1bel/6000000016842265309 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignacio fathered 10 children.&lt;ref&gt;''Geni'' genealogy service available [http://www.geni.com/people/Carmen-Abarrategui-Goros%C3%A1bel/6000000016842265309 here], see also the obituary in ''ABC'' 09.02.92 available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1992/02/09/115.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joaquíncho Baleztena Abarrategui|Joaquín (Joaquíncho)]] was active in ''[[:es:El Pensamiento Navarro|El Pensamiento Navarro]]'';&lt;ref&gt;see obituary in ''ABC'' 22.10.13 available  [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2013/10/22/059.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Javier Baleztena Abarrategui|Javier]] was director of [[Archivo General de Navarra]] and is author of historical and historiographical works related to the province,&lt;ref&gt;for bibliography see ''Dialnet'' service available  [http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/autor?codigo=140694 here]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cruz Maria Baleztena Abarrategui|Cruz Maria]] directed B-class movies.&lt;ref&gt;for filmography, see [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050140/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the family remained Carlist,&lt;ref&gt;in 1988, during the first visit of [[Juan Carlos de Borbón]] and his wife to Pamplona, the Baleztenas kept all windows and shutters closed (except the premises inhabited by Joaquincho Baleztena), see ''ABC'' 22.10.13 available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2013/10/22/059.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; some of them engaged in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Baleztena Abarrategui unsuccessfully ran for the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in 2011 on the [[:es:Derecha Navarra y Española|Derecha Navarra y Española]] ticket. The Baleztena house in Leitza remains a highly contested political symbol until today; during the wedding of Joaquíncho in 1971 it was protected by the police against [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]; in 1996 and 2012 it was assaulted by the Basque nationalists with the Spanish banner torn away from the balcony and burnt down, see ''ABC'' 20.08.96 available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1996/08/20/020.html here] and ''ABC'' 16.08.12 available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2012/08/16/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; A few of his grandchildren became public figures; [[Ignacio Baleztena Navarrete]]&lt;ref&gt;son of Joaquincho Baleztena and Pancha Navarrete, co-founder of [[Navarrese People's Union|UPN]] and an activist bent on fighting ETA&lt;/ref&gt; represents Navarre at the [[European Union|EU]] headquarters in [[Brussels]],&lt;ref&gt;appointment of a 31-year-old for a 78,000 euro job raised many eyebrows, though comments focused on Pancha Navarrete rather than on the Baleztena family, see ''Noticias de Navarra'' 19.12.13 available [http://m.noticiasdenavarra.com/2013/12/19/politica/navarra/barcina-coloca-al-hijo-de-pancha-navarrete-en-la-delegacion-de-navarra-de-bruselas here]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joaquin Baleztena Gurrea]] is a well known Pamplona [[physician]]&lt;ref&gt;specialising in [[geriatrics]] and co-founder of [[Peña Mutilzarra]] ; the association, founded in 1992, declares itself unpolitical and dedicated to traditional local customs; see its website available [http://www.mutilzarra.org/about/#about here]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[:es:Carola Baleztena|Carola Baleztena Olano]] is a TV starlet&lt;ref&gt;for filmography see [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050139/ here], for a sample of her movie performance see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSK6KmbHKbQ here]&lt;/ref&gt; and gossip media celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;compare [http://www.poprosa.com/espana/que-fue-de-carola-baleztena here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early public activity==
[[File:University of Salamanca 03.jpg|thumbnail|160px|University of Salamanca]]
Allegedly already as a child Ignacio took part in street protests against [[:es:Gamazada|Gamazada]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 04.06.13&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced his lifetime career as a youngster, co-organising and shaping various village feasts – especially the local [[santiburcios (feast)|santiburcios]] – in Leitza;&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 18.11.10; Baleztena continued to research, organize and design the Leitza santiburcios also later on, see ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 25.08.12, compare also the 1996 santiburcios assault on Casa Baleztena, ''ABC'' 20.08.96&lt;/ref&gt; in the family house he set up an amateur theatre, where he directed and performed along friends and relatives, staging also his own juvenile plays.&lt;ref&gt;he kept writing plays also later on, mostly comedies mixing absurd humour with political mockery: ''Bromicas de Cupido'', ''El Capitán Cornoboutt o una invernada en los hielos'', ''El ópalo de los Duques de Olofgrado'', ''Abundio, te la cedo'', ''Futri contra Campiñarri'', ''De cómo Kilikizarra murió y estiró la garra'', ''Cirilo por San Fermín pasó aventuras sin fin'', ''Los caballeros de la Luna'', ''El submarino de Dositeo'', ''Los misterios de Mendillorri'', quoted after Jaime del Burgo, ''Catálogo bio-bibliográfico'', Pamplona 1954, p. 144, available  [http://www.navarra.es/appsext/bnd/GN_Ficheros_PDF_Binadi.aspx?Fichero=RPVIANAnro-0038-0039-pagina0113.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; He commenced studying law in the [[Jesuit]] [[University of Deusto|Deusto college]] in [[Bilbao]], but left&lt;ref&gt;his extravert and jolly behaviour produced conflict with the college authorities, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 17.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; to study architecture in [[Madrid]] and to continue with law in [[Salamanca]];&lt;ref&gt;where he met and admired [[Miguel de Unamuno|de Unamuno]], ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 17.11.10, ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; during his academic years Baleztena continued with cultural activities writing short stories and couplets, first for friends and than for public.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 12.11.10. These juvenile attempts marked Baleztena's fascination with [[performing arts]], especially [[pantomime]], disguise, masks, [[puppetry]] etc&lt;/ref&gt; Contributing with short pieces to various periodicals, during the Salamanca years he set up his own,  ''El Bólido''.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 15.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his first academic curriculum in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;del Burgo 1954, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; returning to Pamplona somewhat earlier. Became engaged in a number of Catholic initiatives aimed against [[:es:Ley del Candado|Ley del Candado]], the most momentous having been the huge 1908 [[Gipuzkoa]]n gathering known as [[acto de Zumárraga]].&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 20.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; The event was heavily influenced by the Carlists; as part of their preparations Baleztena wrote Spanish lyrics of a traditional Carlist anthem "[[:es:Marcha de Oriamendi|Oriamendi]]", originally sung only in [[Basque language|Basque]].&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 21.11.10 and 22.11.10. The Spanish version of Oriamendi, written by Baleztena, became later much more popular than the original Basque lyrics. For history of the song, see Rafael Garcia Serrano, ''Cantatas de mi mochila'', [in:] ''Navarra fue la primera'', Pamplona 2006, {{ISBN|8493508187}}, pp. 523-530&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1908 he set up ''El Requeté de Pamplona'', a periodical intended for Carlist youth.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 15.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he was elected president of [[Juventud Jaimista (Carlist youth organisation)|Juventud Jaimista]] in Pamplona,&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 23.11.10; ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' says it was in 1912&lt;/ref&gt; though his leadership style was peculiar, with special focus on [[zarzuela]]s, [[Ball (dance)|balls]], [[Floral Games|juegos florales]],&lt;ref&gt;in 1928 he won one of the competitions as "Malkárra", awarded for his study on toponimia de Pamplona, see Iñaki Egaña, ''Quién es quién en la historia del país de los vascos'', Tafalla 2005, {{ISBN|8481363995}}, 9788481363999, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; historical [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, spectacles and other [[carnival]]esque performance genres.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 31.01.11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, having graduated in law from Salamanca, he was offered the job of personal secretary by his brother-in-law, the Spanish [[consul]] in [[Pau, France|Pau]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pablo Lucas Jaurrieta Múzquiz]], married to his sister Silvia, see ''Geni'' genealogical service available [http://www.geni.com/people/Silvia-Baleztena-Asc%C3%A1rate/6000000016829979811 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignacio remained in the Spanish consular service in [[France]] until 1918.&lt;ref&gt;'' Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 03.02.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public servant==
[[File:Amaiur.JPG|thumbnail|left|Navarre defenders monument, Maya]]
In 1918 Baleztena joined the Carlist-[[Fueros of Navarre|foralist]] list of candidates in the local elections; successful, he became [[Councillor|concejal]] of the Pamplona Ayuntamiento.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 10.02.11. Some sources claim he engaged in politics half-heartedly, as his genuine passion was culture, see [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first initiatives was to create [[Caja Navarra|Caja de Ahorros de Navarra]], an institution run by the [[:es:Diputación Foral de Navarra|Diputación Foral]] and providing popular affordable credit.&lt;ref&gt;'' Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 28.03.11&lt;/ref&gt; He made his name as a staunch advocate of traditional local legal establishments. During initial works on [[:es:Estatuto Vasco-Navarro|vasco-navarrese autonomy]] he co-founded [[Comité pro Autonomía]] and co-signed a proclamation, issued by [[Junta Gestora de la Juventud pro Navarra]], demanding restoration of traditional Navarrese foral regulations.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña''blog, entry 18.02.11, ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he represented the [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaimistas]] in [[Alianza Foral (Carlist-Basque coalition of 1920s)|Alianza Foral]] coalition and was successfully elected to the Navarrese Diputación Foral.&lt;ref&gt;consisting of 7 members: 3 for Pamplona, 1 for Aoiz, Estella, Tafalla and Tudela. Actually, Baleztena was declared victorious with no competition fielded. He replaced an [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]], [[Juan José Juanmartiñena]], as the Jaimistas changed their alliance strategy, see Elena Floristan Imizcoz, María Luisa Garde Etayo, ''El manifesto constitutivo de la Alianza Foral (1921)'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 49 (1988), p. 148, Andrés-Gallego, Pegenaute 1975, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; Re-elected in 1923 and 1926, he retained the post until 1928. Since 1925 he took part in talks between Diputación Foral and [[:es:Ministerio del Interior (España)|Ministerio de la Gobernación]],&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 26.05.11, ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; though he demonstrated some flexibility when negotiating changes to the foral regime;&lt;ref&gt;some of his fellow members resigned in protest against the imposed changes, but Baleztena chose to stay in, see Francisco Miranda Rubio, ''Política y Foralidad en Navarra durante la Dictadura de Primo de Rivera'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 66,(2005), pp. 345&lt;/ref&gt; in 1930 he formed part of the appointed [[Comisión Gestora]].&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 22.03.11, 27.06.11; he demanded reinstating traditional Navarrese establishments, Andrés-Gallego, Pegenaute 1975, p. 572&lt;/ref&gt; Baleztena kept endorsing a Navarrese identity also by other means, be it religious ([[Francis Xavier|San Francisco Javier]] commemorations), historical (unveiling of the [[:es:Castillo de Maya|monument to Navarrese heroes]] in [[:es:Maya (Navarra)|Maya]])&lt;ref&gt;Baleztena clashed with some fellow Carlists led by [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Pradera]], who vehemently opposed the monument as a means fostering Basque separatism, see 
Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis], Valencia 2009, p. 359, José Javier López Antón, ''Trayectoria ideológica del carlismo bajo Don Jaime III (1909-1931): aproximación y estudio de los postulados regionalistas del Jaimismo Navarro (1918-1931)'', [in:] ''Aportes'' 6/15 (1991), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; or scientific (opening a Navarrese section in Museum of Bayonne).&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 12.03.11, ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedi''&lt;/ref&gt;

Baleztena was vital to development and re-organisation of [[Archivo General de Navarra]],&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 26.05.11&lt;/ref&gt; the place where he spent more and more time as researcher starting late 1920s&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 22.09.11&lt;/ref&gt; and which turned into his primary employment in the 1930s, when he was discharged from most other duties. In 1928 nominated the municipal Delegado de Turismo,&lt;ref&gt;his nomination was opposed by the civil governor, see Floren Aoiz, ''El jarrón roto: la transición en Navarra: una cuestión de Estado'', Tafalla 2005, {{ISBN|8481363294}}, 9788481363296, p. 30; the book mentions the episode when discussing emergence of "navarrismo de orientación claramente fascista"', though it is not clear whether, according to author, Baleztena represented or opposed "fascismo navarro"&lt;/ref&gt; resuming the function in the 1940s as Secretario del Comité Provincial de Turismo.&lt;ref&gt;del Burgo 1954, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 he founded [[Museo de Recuerdos Históricos]] in Pamplona, intended as Carlist cultural outpost;&lt;ref&gt;initially it was intended to be named Museo de las Guerras Carlistas; the name was abandoned due to the pressure on part of the Francoist regime, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 9.1.14; the building is now hosting [[Museo Pablo Sarasate]], see turismo.navarra available [http://www.turismo.navarra.es/esp/organice-viaje/recurso/Ocioycultura/2922/Museo-Pablo-Sarasate.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was managing it as a director until the museum, due to run-down conditions of the building and amidst controversial circumstances, shut down in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;as part of a wider agreement, Museo de Recuerdos Históricos was to be moved to the Citadel of Pamplona, which was about to be handed over by the army to municipal authorities. Amidst mutual accusations between the Baleztenas and the Pamplona Ayuntamiento, most of the objects ended up in the Baleztena house. Once Dolores Baleztena became the general depositary, she started to make the objects available on various periodical displays and exhibitions. They were seized from one of them by [[:es:Partido Carlista de Euskalherria|Euskalherriko Karlista Alderdia]], a vasconavarrese branch of [[Carlist Party|Partido Carlista]], in 1975. The Baleztena family lost the ensuing lawsuit against EKA. Thirty years later some of the objects were donated by EKA to [[Museum of Carlism]], where they are currently on display. EKA is unhappy with the way Museum presents Carlism (children of the deceased EKA leader [[José Ángel Pérez-Nievas Abascal]] rejected invitation to attend the opening ceremony) and considers depositing other objects somewhere else, see José Fermín Garralda Arizcun blog available [http://historiadenavarraacuba.blogspot.com/2010/03/museo-del-carlismo-en-navarra.html here]  and Javier Hermoso de Mendoza blog available [http://www.sasua.net/estella/articulo.asp?f=museocarlismo here]; analysis of Pamplona ayuntamiento politics during late Francoism see María del Mar Larraza Micheltorena, ''El ayuntamiento pamplonés en el tardofranquismo'', [in:] ''La Transició de la dictadura franquista a la democràcia'', Barcelona 2005, {{ISBN|8460973972}}, pp. 68-79, available [http://centresderecerca.uab.cat/cefid/sites/centresderecerca.uab.cat.cefid/files/comunicacions.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1949 he was director of Museos de Navarra.&lt;ref&gt;some authors claim Baleztena was director of "Museo de Navarra", which seems to be a currently existing [[:es:Museo de Navarra|museum in Pamplona]], see Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffe, ''La reorganización del carlismo vasco en los sesenta.

On the other hand, del Burgo 1954, p. 144 claims he was director of "Museos de Navarra", which sounds like a department within the provincial administrative board&lt;/ref&gt; Active in a number of mostly culture-related municipal and provincial bodies, like [[Comisión de Monumentos]] or [[Instituto Principe de Viana]].&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 24.09.1972&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his life he became an iconic and proverbial Pamplona figure, dubbed "aitacho".&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 09.11.10; "pappy" or "daddy" in English; between 1940 and 1970 Pamplona changed from a mid-size provincial city of 50,000 inhabitants, providing services for the neighboring rural area, to an anonymous industrial urban centre of 150,000 people, "el Japón con boina roja", see Micheltorena 2005, p. 69. Currently none of the tourist leaflets distributed by the Pamplona tourist office mentions Baleztena and the staff is unaware of the Baleztena name&lt;/ref&gt;

==Man of feasts==
[[File:Gigantes pamplona ayuntamiento jorge urdanoz.jpg|thumbnail|giants of Pamplona 2008]]
Since early youth Baleztena demonstrated particular interest in everything related to [[Gigantes y cabezudos|Giants and Bigheads]];&lt;ref&gt;the old medieval ritual was reinstated by the city council around the year of 1860, see sanfermines.net available [http://sanfermines.net/ingles/comparsa.php here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was engaged in design, construction and carrying the figures.&lt;ref&gt;the figure of [[Biblical Magi|King Baltasar]] was later sort of reserved for Ignacio Baleztena; when due to age he was unable to carry the harness, member of his family took over, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 30.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; He later became an expert on gigantes, investigating their history and related rituals down to minuscule details.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 30.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; His interests gradually broadened to all Pamplonese feasts; in the 1920s he emerged as their key organizer&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 02.12.10&lt;/ref&gt; and expert, publishing a number of related works&lt;ref&gt;in 1920 Baleztena published his first book, ''Iruñerías'', a collection of his earlier pieces published in ''Radica'' and styled as tales from old Pamplona. His other books are ''Relaciones de la Santa Sede con los Monarcas navarros y sus legitimos herederos'' (1921), ''La Insignia de las Cinco Llagas'' (1932), ''Los toros en Navarra'' (1932), ''Los gigantes de Pamplona. Historia de esos simpáticos monigotes que tantosratos felices han proporcionado a Premin de Iruña'' (1933), ''De cómo Kilikizarra murió y estiró la garra'' (1935), ''Recuerdos históricos- El Capitán D. Manuel Vidondo y la batalla de Gulina'' (1942), see del Burgo 1954, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and incalculable newspaper pieces.&lt;ref&gt;he contributed to numerous newspapers, mostly Navarrese ones (''El Pensamiento Navarro'', ''Pregón'', ''Diario de Navarra''), though also to ''El Pueblo Vasco'' (San Sebastián), ''Euskalerria'' (Montevideo), ''Vida Vasca'' (Vitoria), ''La Fiesta Brava'' (Barcelona), ''Estampa Tradicionalista'' (Tolosa), ''Tradición Vasca'' (San Sebastian), listed after del Burgo 1954, 144; his pen-names were Premín de Iruña, Tiburcio de Okabío and José Miel, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 10.11.10. For a sample see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.07.1935, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000548525&amp;page=25&amp;search=baleztena&amp;lang=es here]&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution soon went far beyond cultivating local customs, as Baleztena was also reconstructing old-forgotten rituals and inventing new ones,&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 13.12.10&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating them into celebrations of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;like Cabalgata de Reyes, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 20.12.10 and 23.10.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holy Week]]&lt;ref&gt;like Las tribus de Israel, Angelico de Aralar and Un presente de Zabulon, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 03.04.12, 14.04.12&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]];&lt;ref&gt;like Rey en las calles, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 21.06.14&lt;/ref&gt; he launched also stand-alone customs like [[Procesión de San Saturnino]].&lt;ref&gt;also Carnavales de antaño or Fiesta del Rey de la Faba, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 30.11.13, 21.03.11&lt;/ref&gt; His activities went beyond Pamplona, as he revitalised local [[romeria]]s, like the one to [[Ujué]].&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 05.06.14&lt;/ref&gt; All feasts contained a strong if not vital religious component, like the massive 1922 celebrations commemorating San Francisco Javier, styled as "arquetipo navarro.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Dronda Martínez, ''Con Cristo o contra Cristo. Religión y movilización antirrepublicana en navarra (1931-1936)'', Tafalla 2013, {{ISBN|8415313314}}, 9788415313311, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Some were strongly flavoured by Carlism, like the annual pilgrimage to [[Javier, Spain|Javier]],&lt;ref&gt;in terms of attendance in the 1960s the [[:es:Javierada|Javieradas]] were eclipsed by another Carlist annual gatherings, namely the [[Montejurra|Montejurra aplecs]], which were also launched by Baleztena, namely Ignacio's sister Dolores, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''Navarra y el carlismo durante el régimen de Franco: la utopía de la identidad unitaria'', [in:] ''Investigaciones históricas: Época moderna y contemporánea'', 17 (1997), p. 309. In 1970s Montejurra dramatically lost popularity and attracts few hundreds now, see Jeremy MacClancy, ''The Decline of Carlism'', Reno 2000, {{ISBN|9780874173444}}, p. 275, his also ''An anthropological approach to carlist ritual: Montejurra during francoism'', [in:] ''Violencias fraticidas. Jornadas de Estudio del Carlismo'', Estella 2009, {{ISBN|9788423531653}} , pp. 299-322.

[[File:San Fermin Portada de Programa.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|sanfermines 1911]]
Baleztena remained particularly fascinated by the [[sanfermines]], investigating their history and forming part of [[Corte de San Fermín]].&lt;ref&gt;sort of organizing committee, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 02.07.12&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited for launching an unofficial feast anthem ''[[Uno de enero, dos de febrero (song)|Uno de enero, dos de febrero]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 13.12.10&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular ''Iruña-ko mezetak'' song,&lt;ref&gt;both were worked out together with Baleztena's friend and musician [[Silvano Cervantes Iñigo]], ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 13.12.10;&lt;/ref&gt; apart from a number of other unrelated chants.&lt;ref&gt;he also the author of other popular songs, like ''La Antoni e Ignacio'', ''Levántate pamplónica'', ''El cordero de Francisco'', ''La procesión del Viernes Santo'', listed after del Burgo 1954, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; It was Baleztena and his friends who in 1911 first performed [[:es:riau-riau|riau-riau]]; it remains debated whather the ritual was intended as a Carlist demonstration dogging the [[Spanish liberalism|Liberal]]-dominated city council&lt;ref&gt;sanfermines.com service available [http://www.sanfermin.com/index.php/en/la-fiesta/riau-riau/historia-del-riau-riau here]&lt;/ref&gt; or simply as a juvenile joke.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 11.01.11&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to [[Running of the Bulls|running of the bulls]] he was in favor of as few regulations as possible,&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 13.12.10&lt;/ref&gt; though none of the sources consulted mentions Baleztena running with the bulls himself. He remained one of key figures shaping sanfermines until the early 1960s, when he lost his grip on the event. The 1963-4 feasts were snatched by young Carlist progressists,&lt;ref&gt;in 1963 the Carlists staged a demonstration in favor of [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Carlos Hugo]] in front of the Ayuntamiento, in 1964, when the newly-wed Carlos Hugo ran with the bulls, Plaza del Castillo turned into a battlefield between Carlists and [[Falangists]]. The same year in Javier the locals prepared banners reading "Carlos e Irene, vosotros si podeis entrar", a reference to incidents earlier that year, when Juan Carlos de Borbón and his wife turned back to [[Aragon]] having learnt that the locals await them with sticks and stones, Javier Lavardín [José Antonio Parilla], ''Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de España'', Paris 1976, pp. 175, 240&lt;/ref&gt; who formatted them as their own political manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;in 1960s Baleztena-style Traditionalist feasts and celebrations, strongly saturated with religious element, were subject to increasing secularisation until the confessional dimension disappeared altogether, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El proceso de secularización de lasfiestas carlistas'', [in:] ''Zainak. Cuadernos de Antropología-Etnografía'', 26 (2004), pp. 781-802; first attempts to vandalise Carlist monuments, like graffiti on the Pamplona Monument of the Fallen walls, started to appear in the mid-1960s, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''Navarra y el carlismo durante el régimen de Franco: la utopía de la identidad unitaria'', [in:] ''Investigaciones históricas: Época moderna y contemporánea'' 17 (1997)p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Baleztena's interest in feasts and customs is peculiar as it combined three different approaches: this of a scientist ([[anthropologist]], [[historian]], [[ethnographer]], who pursues impartial scholarly studies),&lt;ref&gt;Baleztena was active in Principe de Viana and contributed some scholarly works (e.g. ''Toponimia del término de Pamplona'', [in:] ''Actas de la I Reunión de Toponimia Pirenaica'', Zaragoza 1949), though in general he tended to underline his amateurish stance and to mock scientists and scientific realm with all its rituals: conferences, lectures, universities, grades, professors, faculties, books, scientific articles etc; he was a rare guest at the Etnologia Vasca faculty at [[Universidad de Navarra]], headed by [[José Miguel de Barandiarán]]&lt;/ref&gt; this of a politician (who shapes popular customs as vehicles of propagating own set of values),&lt;ref&gt;for a sample see ''El Siglo Futuro'' 31.10.1935, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000562781&amp;page=12&amp;search=baleztena&amp;lang=es here]; it is worth noting that he fell short of directly contributing to the wartime propaganda; he is not mentioned in Francisco Javier Caspistegui, ''"Spain's Vendee": Carlist identity in Navarre as a mobilising model'', [in:] Chris Ealham, Michael Richards (eds.), ''The Splintering of Spain'', Cambridge 2005, {{ISBN|9780511132636}}, pp. 177-195&lt;/ref&gt; and this of a participant (who genuinely enjoys the feasts, contributes to them and takes part in them).&lt;ref&gt;he demonstrated vivid interest only in carnivalesque, ludic forms of entertainment closely related to folk customs, with much less focus on opera, drama theatre (except puppetry), literature etc&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars classify his approach as "[[costumbrismo]] nostálgico", which exalted religiosity and viewed modernising changes with anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Dronda Martínez 2013, pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider it a strategy of disseminating authoritarian discourse, which by means of cultural identification mobilised the society along conservative lines, a process similar to those employed by the [[Nazis]] in the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Javier Ugarte Tellería, ''Un episodio de "estilización" de la política antirrepublicana: la fiesta de San Francisco Javier de 1931 en Pamplona'', [in:] L. Castells (ed.), ''El rumor de lo cotidiano, Estudios sobre el País Vasco contemporáneo'', Bilbao 1999, pp. 159-182. In his other work, ''La nueva Covadonga insurgente: orígenes sociales y culturales de la sublevación de 1936 en Navarra y el País Vasco'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|847030531X}}, 9788470305313, Javier Ugarte Tellería makes repeated parallel references to Carlism and Nazism, e.g. comparing alliance between Carlism and upper strata to alliance between NSDAP and plutocracy (p. 38), Navarrese social fabric to East Prussian social fabric (p. 40), Requete standby of July 36 to SA standby in January 1933 (p. 148), Traditionalist means of cultural mobilization to Nazi means of cultural mobilization (p. 160), Navarrese conservative stronghold to Bavarian conservative stronghold (p. 231), mechanism of Spaniards embracing authoritarism to mechanisms of Germans embracing authoritarism (p. 245), the role of Bible to the role of Mein Kampf (p. 250), Carlists dumping electoral strategy to Hitler dumping insurrectionist strategy (p. 262), provocative Requete demonstrations to provocative SA demonstrations (p. 273), marginalization of socially radical Carlist aetistas to marginalization of socially radical Rohm faction in SA (p. 293, 426), Navarrese sense of foralism to German sense of Heimat (p. 306). Ignacio Baleztena is mentioned by Ugarte as a politician and "extravagant figure" rather than as a man of culture. Another author highlighting similarity between Carlist and Nazi cultural policy advances a somewhat competitive thesis, namely that the two promoted not traditional, but modern means of social mobilisation, named "reactionary modernism", see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''Paradójicos reaccionarios: la modernidad contra la República de la Comunión Tradicionalista'', [in:] ''El Argonauta Espanol'' 9 (2012), available [http://argonauta.revues.org/1409 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Some present it as means of maintaining traditional Navarrese identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 03.06.14, compare also Caspistegui 1997, esp. p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

Baleztena's [[mothertongue]] was Spanish;&lt;ref&gt;his father spoke [[Basque language|Basque]] as his mothertongue; his mother, María Dolores Ascárate Echeverría, was bilingual (her father was castellano-speaker, her mother was Basque-speaker), ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 12.04.11&lt;/ref&gt; he spoke [[Basque language|Basque]] with some difficulty, though he understood Basque very well.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 14.04.11&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his childhood spent in Leitza, he was well accustomed and indeed fascinated by the [[Basque culture]]. Faced with the new phenomenon of [[Basque nationalism|Basque national drive]], he opposed it with traditional vision of Basque identity;&lt;ref&gt;according to his son, Baleztena was guided by 3 ideas: to preserve Vasco-Navarrese traditions, to confront the Basque nationalism, and to promote Catholic and [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] perspective, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 01.03.12. His amateurish and politicized approach to Basque ethnicity paradoxically brought him close to scholarly anthropological work of [[:es:Julio Caro Baroja|Caro Baroja]], who denied that persistence of uniform Basque culture over considerable geographical area and throughout all the time is shown by a mere fact that a few vestiges were found that pertained to a Basque cultural cycle, see Jesus Azcona, ''To Be Basque and to Live in Basque Country The Inequalities of Difference'', [in:] Carol J.

In 1925 Baleztena co-founded [[Euskeraren Adiskideak]], a society promoting Basque culture in Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 26.04.11, ''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 he set up [[Záldiko Máldiko]], a semi-private group focusing on folk dances and performing on festivals across Spanish and French Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 17.02.12&lt;/ref&gt; The grouping was re-formatted in 1934 as a Basque cultural folk association named [[Muthiko Alaiak]], specialising in dance and theatric performances.&lt;ref&gt;introducing dances posed as traditional, though in fact heavily redesigned or plainly invented, like xingola-dantza, el aurresku, la espatadantza de Amaia, la uztai-dantza,  Banako, Binako y Launako, la zahagi-dantza, makil-dantza, see Muthiko web page available [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Dominated by Carlists, Muthiko functioned as a vehicle for promoting Traditionalist vision of Navarrese society,&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 01.02.12; some define his Carlism as lifestyle rather than ideology, and consider his cultural activities - Muthiko in particular - part of this outlook, see [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html here]; similar approach was demonstrated in Gipuzkoa by the Gipuzkoan Carlist Jefe, [[Antonio Arrúe Zarauz|Antonio Arrue]], see Manuel Martorell, ''Antonio Arrue, el carlista que colaboró en el relanzamiento de Euskaltzaindia'', [in:] ''Euskera: Euskaltzaindiaren lan eta agiriak'' 56/3 (2011), pp. 847-872&lt;/ref&gt; though Baleztena did not refrain from mocking authorities (first [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] and later [[Francoist]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web page]&lt;/ref&gt; especially by means of kurriños,&lt;ref&gt;the Navarrese version of [[Puppetry|theatre de guignol]]&lt;/ref&gt; performed often during local Carlist political events.&lt;ref&gt;like electoral meetings, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 24.2.12&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War Muthiko was considered the centre of antifrancoist Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;the group was considered "foco de falcondismo", see Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 268, 352; during the sanfermines of 1939 [[Ramón Serrano Suñer]] intervened with [[Luis Arellano Dihinx|Luis Arellano]] to prevent Muthiko from shouting "Viva el Rey", Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 247;  "gritaremos todos juntos: ¡Viva el Rey!" was the customary cry which used to commence all Muthiko performances, [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web page]&lt;/ref&gt; The group occasionally took part in official events,&lt;ref&gt;like opening of the Madrid [[Barajas airport]], see [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web pagel]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was registered as late as in 1949&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; and following continuous harassment,&lt;ref&gt;including arrests, suspensions, sealing of the premises, etc [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web page]&lt;/ref&gt; was re-opened in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; Though the last floor of the Baleztena house served as a stage for rehearsals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web page]&lt;/ref&gt; over time Baleztena lost control over Muthiko. As early as 1956 the communist intelligence considered the group a potentially promising area&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p.284&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;the years of 1962-1974 are considered "golden age" of the organisation by the current Muthikos; during that period the association opened new sections: mountain tourism, football, weight lifting and so on; its office was at the prestigious Plaza del Castillo; compare also the list of activities flavoured by anti-Francoism published at [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.htm Muthiko web page] l&lt;/ref&gt; it became a nucleus of socialism,&lt;ref&gt;MacClancy 2000, p. 210; [[Mariano Zufia]], one of the socialist Partido Carlista leaders, was a dantzari in Muthiko, see [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web page]&lt;/ref&gt; which it remains until today,&lt;ref&gt;compare the vision of Carlist participation in the Civil War offered by the official web site of Muthiko, "La realidad de todos es sabida, vista con la perspectiva y la objetividad que dan los años: los voluntarios son manipulados por los intereses de las clases dominantes y se ven envueltos en una lucha fratricida de tres años, pueblo contra pueblo, sin otro vencecor que la oligarquía" at [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web page]&lt;/ref&gt; actively promoting also the Basque nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;see postcard collections at [http://www.muthikoalaiak.org/pub/cas/CAS.html Muthiko web page]; note also the Muthiko graphical production, mocking the clergy and the popes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politician==
Since early youth Baleztena was active in juvenile Jaimist organisations. In 1919 he took part in [[Magna Junta Carlista de Biarritz]]&lt;ref&gt;one source claims that Ignacio (not Joaquin) was at that time jefe regional de Navarra, see César Alcalá, ''Cruzadistas y carloctavistas: historia de una conspiración'', Barcelona 2012, {{ISBN|9788493884253}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and set up a new Carlist weekly ''Radica'',&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 21.02.11&lt;/ref&gt; representing the movement first in the Pamplona ayuntamiento and in the 1920s in the Deputación Foral.&lt;ref&gt;Baleztena did not seem particularly belligerent or intransigent on dynastical side, as he did take part and possibly even strived to organise religious celebrations attended by Alfonso XIII, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 04.04.11&lt;/ref&gt; He considered taking part in "controlled" elections, planned by [[Dámaso Berenguer|Berenguer]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;and even issued an electoral proclamation, see Alberto García Umbón, ''Las Proyectadas elecciones del general Berenguer en Navarra'' (1930), [in:] ''Cuadernos de sección. Historia-Geografía San Sebastián'', 10 (2008), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; During first months of the Republic he forged a [[:es:Minoría Vasco-Navarra|Carlist-nationalist alliance]] prior to the [[Spanish general election, 1931|1931 elections]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 1975, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; and engaged in works on [[:es:Estatuto Vasco-Navarro|vasco-navarrese autonomy]]. Initially in favour,&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña blog'', entry 27.09.11; Irujo Aranzadi accused Ignacio of avoiding tangible commitments and breaking the agreement, Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''La Cuestión estatutaria en Navarra durante la Segunda República'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 52 (1991), pp. 197, 200, Manuel Ferrer Muñoz, ''Los frustrados intentos de colaboración entre el partido nacionalista vasco y la derecha navarra durante la segunda república'', [in:] Principe de Viana 49 (1988), pp. 129, 132&lt;/ref&gt; he withdrew his support when governmental draft moved religious issues from autonomous to central portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 27.09.11&lt;/ref&gt; Member of the regional Carlist authorities,&lt;ref&gt;Junta Regional Carlista de Navarra, headed by his brother Joaquin, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 28.09.11; Ignacio served later as a liaison between his expulsed brother and Navarrese Carlist authorities, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 15.02.12; he also sustained the movement financially, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; he got the family Pamplona house set ablaze by the leftist hit-squad in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;after its partial burning in April 1932 the family moved to Leitza and San Sebastián, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 02.11.11 to 22.12.11; his son claims that the perpetrators were led by an unidentified Teniente de Alcalde, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 16.01.12. The Baleztenas accused Gobiernador Civil, [[:es:Manuel Andrés Casaus|Manuel Andrés Casaus]], of inertia; Baleztena was also engaged in extinguishing fire following assaults on other institutions, like ''El Pensamiento Navarro'', ''El Diario de Navarra'' and finally, in March 1936, on Diputación Foral, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 27.04.12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 he briefly headed the Navarrese [[Requeté]].&lt;ref&gt;he replaced [[Agustín Telleria]], ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 15.02.12, to the disappointment of [[Generoso Huarte]], active on earlier organisation phases, Antonio Lizarza, ''Memorias de la conspiración'', [in:] ''Navarra fue la primera'', Pamplona 2006, {{ISBN|8493508187}}, p. 27; Baleztena Abarrategui claims his father handed over to [[:es: Antonio Lizarza|Lizarza]] late 1933, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 15.02.12; Lizarza claims that his appointment came in September 1934, Lizarza 2006, pp. 39-40. Slightly different version in Julio Aróstegui, ''Combatientes Requetés en la Guerra Civil española, 1936-1939'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499709758}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumbnail|150px|left|Don Javier, 1960]]

In the spring of 1936 Baleztena negotiated Carlist support with [[Emilio Mola|Mola]],&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 02.05.12, Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|8487863523}}, 9788487863523, pp.  28-29, Arostegui 2013, pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; within Carlism forming the faction pressing unconditional Carlist adherence to the coup.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkorn 1975, pp. 238, 248; according to some "attitude of the Baleztenas was extremely difficult to grasp", see Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 120-121. For dramatic discussion between the Baleztena-led Navarrese and [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]] in San Jean de Luz on July 12 see Lizarza 2006, p. 106. Javier Baleztena Abarrategui notes there were differences amongts the Carlists, but presents the stance of his father as a struggle to maintain unity, see  ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 17.05.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the outbreak of hostilities the Baleztena houses turned into important insurgent centres.&lt;ref&gt;the Pamplona house served as a press centre, the Leitza house served as military headquarters, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 06.06.12, 12.6.12&lt;/ref&gt; Ignacio helped to organise [[Tercio de San Miguel]];&lt;ref&gt;formed mostly by residents of Leitza, nearby villages and refugees from the neighboring Gipuzkoa,''Premín de Iruña blog'', entry 22.07.12&lt;/ref&gt; in the mayhem that followed he is noted for saving Leftist supporters and POWs.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña blog'', entries 24.07.12, 31.07.12; though some episodes are contested, see Martorell Peréz 2009, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Late July he volunteered&lt;ref&gt;''Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia'' claims he volunteered with his 6 sons, which seems unlikely given the oldest one was born in 1929&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Tercio María de las Nieves]] [[battalion]] and served in [[Aragón]],&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 28.08.12, also Penas Bernaldo 1996, p. 178; the rank-and-file soldiers of this battalion considered him "superhombre", Arostegui 2013, p. 407; formally he commanded a company (requeté), Arostegui 2013, p.  421; he continued to organise feasts and composed chants in the trenches, see Arostegui 2013, p. 871&lt;/ref&gt; later on transferred to [[Tercio de Cristo Rey]], deployed on the Madrid front&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 14.10.12, though he could have also served in Tercio de Lacar or Tercio de Navarra, see Pablo Larraz, Víctor Sierra-Sesúmaga, ''Requetés. De las trincheras al olvido'', Madrid 2010, {{ISBN|9788497349734}}, p. 714&lt;/ref&gt; and serving until the end of the war on the on-and-off basis.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. on leaves to take part in funeral of Alfonso Carlos in Vienna in autumun of 1936, to host Don Javier in Leitza in the summer of 1937, to organise Pamplona homages in October 1937 or to celebrate birth of his son in April 1938&lt;/ref&gt; His stance towards [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|unification]] is highly unclear,&lt;ref&gt;his son claims Baleztena viewed unification as treason on part of the militrary, see ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 05.03.13. Some suggest the Baleztenas took advantage of paralysis of Carlist governing bodies and pushed with the unification, see Javier Ugarte Telleria, ''El carlismo en la guerra del 36: la formación de un cuasi-estado nacional-corporativo y foral en la zona vasco-navarra'', [in:] ''Historia Contemporanea'' 38 (2009). pp. 69-70. Penas Bernalso 1996, pp. 265-7, 270 quotes Ignacio saying that except the monarchical issue, there were no major discrepancies between Carlism and Partido Unico; anxious to stay loyal to Don Javier, Baleztena agreed that for the time being national interest demanded compliance. Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 288-9 claims that the Baleztenas pressed Don Javier to accept the unification. The latest work, Mercedes Peñalba Sotorrío, ''Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul'', Estella 2013 does not mention either of the Baleztenas when describing the amalgamation process (though see p. 132). Some claim that the Baleztenas contested the intransigent opposition to unification of Fal Conde, but Don Javier kept considering them loyal, as he authorised Joaquín to enter the Falangist Consejo Naciónal, see Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 38-40, 49. It remains undisputed that in July 1937 Don Javier entrusted Baleztena with reorganisation of Navarrese Carlism, see Aurora Villanueva Martinez, ''Organizacion, actividad y bases del carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo'' [in:] ''Geronimo de Uztariz'' 19 (2003), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; though it soon evolved into opposition;&lt;ref&gt;he engineered ice-cold welcome of Franco during his visit to Pamplona in the autumn of 1937, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 05.03.13&lt;/ref&gt; contesting Carlist amalgamation into [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista|Movimiento]],&lt;ref&gt;Baleztena participated in the Carlist efforts to save ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' from amalgamation in the Francoist propaganda machine; the plot consisted of converting the party newspaper into a paper owned by a shareholding company by creating ''Editorial Navarra''; out of 600 shares, [[Tomás Domínguez Arévalo|de Rodezno]] held 200, Arellano 150 and Baleztena brothers 50 each, Eduardo González Calleja, ''La prensa carlista y falangista durante la Segunda República y la Guerra Civil (1931-1937)'', [in:] ''El Argonauta español'' 9 (2012), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; he brusquely rejected Franco's blandishments.&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 18.9.13&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]] the Baleztenas helped the French refugees&lt;ref&gt;especially members of the French Resistance, though also fleeing Jews, providing shelter in Pamplona, Leitza and other locations, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entries 16.10.13, 25.01.14; see also Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 266-8. Among the refugees there was [[:es:Enrique de Orleans (1908-1999)|Enrique Roberto Fernando María Luis Felipe de Orleans]], the French pretendent to the throne, see ''ABC'' 22.10.13&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrated anti-[[Axis powers|Axis]] sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;the Baleztenas entertained the British Foreign Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] in 1941, which was sort of political demonstration aimed against Spain joining the Axis, ''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 01.03.14; the Baleztenas opposed the apparently the pro-German stance taken by ''El Pensamiento Navarro'', see Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 263-264; for an opposite anti-British view, see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TCN56ZUSD0 here]&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually considered members of the intransigent "bando falcondista",&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Peréz 2009, p. 856, though there are other views. Villanueva Martínez 2003, p. 105 claims that Baleztena asked Fal to accept his resignation in 1942. Vazquez Prada 2012, p. 1131-3 presents the Baleztenas as pursuing an "independent" line until Joaquín was replaced as Navarrese jefe in 1957, though as late as the early 1960s he was appointed by Don Javier to represent Navarre in a planned Junta Foral Vasco-Navarra&lt;/ref&gt; though Ignacio made also some conciliatory gestures towards [[Francoism]].&lt;ref&gt;in November 1937 Ignacio Baleztena was nominated member of Comisión Depuradora, entrusted with purging Navarrese libraries; moreover, he represented Delegación de Cultura de la F.E.T. y de las J.O.N.S. in this body; the commission reported completing its works in September 1938; the issue is not clear as Baleztena was on the frontline at that time, see Reyes Berruezo Albéniz, ''Depuración de bibliotecas y censura de libros en Navarra durante la Guerra Civil de 1936'', p. 57 available [http://asnabi.datamina.net/revista-tk/revista-tk-0 here]; during the 1942 crisis, triggered by the Begoña incident, Ignacio insisted Carlists do not withdraw from the Pamplona ayuntamiento,  Villanueva Martínez 2003, p. 106. For confrontation between Carlists and the Falangists civil governors see Alvaro Baraibar Etxeberria, ''La Navarra sotto il Franchismo: la lotta per il controllo provinciale tra i governatori civili e la Diputacion Foral (1945-1955)'', [in:] ''Nazioni e Regioni'', Bari 2013, {{ISSN|2282-5681}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s the Baleztena brothers strived to rebuild clandestine&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Peréz 2009, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; or semi-official&lt;ref&gt;some scholars consider Hermandad de Caballeros Voluntarios de la Cruz, founded by Baleztena as religious pilgrimage group, an attempt to create semi-official Carlism organisation, Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Carlist structures, both counted among Navarrese Carlist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;in 1953 Fal talked to him on reconstruction of Carlist network, Martorell Peréz 2009, p. 344. The Baleztena grip on Navarrese Carlism is sometimes dubbed caciquismo, see Lavardín 1976, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 Ignacio engineered one of the most humiliating snubs that [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] had to take.&lt;ref&gt;Franco visited Pamplona to open new housing quarters and was scheduled to speak from the balcony of the Ayuntamiento building. Despite lavish decorations elsewhere, the neighboring Baleztena house was all closed and seemed abandoned, with immense portrait of San Francisco Javier on its facade. The bottom line of the message was manifestation of support to the Carlist regent, Don Javier. Indignant Franco cut down his speech to a minimum; the Baleztenas received threats from the Falangist Frente de Juventudes afterwards, Martorell Peréz 2009, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1954 he occasionally went into hiding, having been easy target of Falangist vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Peréz 2009, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|Carlist standard]]

The Baleztenas voiced against a union with [[Juan de Borbón, Count of Barcelona|Juanistas]],&lt;ref&gt;''Premín de Iruña'' blog, entry 27.06.13; the Baleztenas voted against publishing [[Ecto de Estoril]] in Pensamiento, Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffé, ''El papel del carlismo navarro en el inicio de la fragmentación definitiva de la comunión tradicionalista (1957-1960)'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 2011, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; which did not necessarily amount to endorsing [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]]'s claim to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;in 1941 Samuel Hoare understood from the Baleztenas that they were - under some conditions - prepared to accept Don Juan as a Carlist claimant, see Samual Hoare, ''Complacent Dictator'', London 1947, p. 141; during the emotional sessions of early 1956, Joaquin (the brothers are always referred to as very close to each other) addressed Don Javier "de Alteza", while the others used the "de Majestad" form, see Lavardin 1976, p. 27. The position of the Baleztenas is summarised by the author as "poca consistencia". Joaquin was also opposed (as the only member of the Navarrese junta) to Carlos Hugo appearing in Montejurra in 1957, Lavardín 1976 p. 40, and the family were not sure what to expect of him, Lavardín 1976, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s they criticised [[Manuel Fal Conde|Fal Conde]] as too conciliatory towards Francoism.&lt;ref&gt;by some the Baleztenas are counted among "los guipuzcoanos", a group (including also Antonio Arrue, Lascurain, marques del Valle de Santiago, Pablo Iturria, the young Larramendi, Gambra) which maintained personal rather than political rivalry with Fal, who was nevertheless accused by them of inactivity and inefficiency, see Lavardin 1976, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars claim that they engineered a plot to remove Fal,&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El nuevo rumbo político del carlismo hacia la colaboración con el régimen (1955-56)'', [in:] ''Hispania: Revista española de historia'' 69 (2009), p. 185, Vázquez de Prada 2011, p. 1115. In 1955 the Baleztenas were closely in touch with Don Javier, who even visited Leitza around the time he dismissed Fal, Lavardín 1976, p. 24. The same author claims the Baleztenas were criticised by younger Carlists for as running a clerical policy; a phrase was coined against them "menos accion catolica y mas accion carlista"&lt;/ref&gt; though his actual dismissal and new course adopted by Carlism suited the competing "unionistas"&lt;ref&gt;the pro-Juanista Carlists like Arauz de Robles or Rafael Olazábal criticised Fal as too rigid, see Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 392-393; Joaquin was dismissed in 1957 as his intransingent stance towards Francoism was incompatible with the new Carlist policy, Lavardín 1976, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; faction more. When the [[hugocarlistas (fraction within Carlism)|hugocarlistas]] appeared on the scene in the late 1950s, the Baleztenas seemed rather skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;In 1963 the Baleztenas hosted princess Alicia, than 87, which was viewed as counterweight to the Carlos Hugo sister, princess Maria Teresa, at that time spending a year in Pamplona, see Lavardín 1976, pp. 160, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Though they lent some support to [[Carlos Hugo]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1964 Dolores Baleztena defended [[Princess Irene of the Netherlands|Irene]], the newly wed wife of Carlos Hugo, Lavardín 1976, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained cordial relations with the Carlist claimant Don Javier until the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;in 1968, weeks before his expulsion from Spain, Don Javier stayed in Leitza visiting Ignacio Baleztena, Lavardín 1976, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; they confronted the progressives when power struggle erupted within Carlism in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;though due to their age, the Baleztenas were at the sidelines of current politics; the most comprehensive work on the issue, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias : el carlismo, 1962-1977'', Pamplona 1997, {{ISBN|8431315644}}, 9788431315641 does not mention Ignacio Baleztena at all; for confrontation of different cultural visions see Josep Miralles Clement, ''Aspectos de la cultura política del carlismo en el siglo XX'', [in:] ''Espacio, tiempo y forma'' 17 (2005), pp. 147-174, esp. the chapter La experiencia juvenil y estudiantil; see also MacClancy 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The last success of the Baleztenas was regaining control over ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;following removal of [[Javier María Pascual Ibañez]] as editor-in-chief after his 4-year tenure, see ''La Vanguardia'' 26.08.1970 available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1972/09/24/pagina-5/34314198/pdf.html here], also Martorell Peréz 2009, pp. 470-471; the partisan hugocarlista perspective in Josep Carles Clemente, ''Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo'', Barcelona 1977, {{ISBN|9788425307591}}, esp. the chapter ''El "affaire" de "El Pensamiento Navarro"'', pp. 63-71. Four years earlier Baleztena considered Pascual an appropriate candidate for leading the paper and endorsed him, Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El final de una ilusión. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, p. 304. It is worth noting that in 1968 Joaquíncho Baleztena intervened with [[Manuel Fraga]] to get Pascual released from jail, ''ABC'' 22.10.13 available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/2013/10/22/059.html here]; for details see Rosa Marina Errea, ''Javier María Pascual y "El pensamiento navarro": "con él llego el escándalo" (1966-1970)'', Pamplona 2007, {{ISBN|8477681929}}, 9788477681922&lt;/ref&gt; a short-lived victory&lt;ref&gt;another crisis in ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' followed in 1971, see ''La Vanguardia'' 21.12.1971 available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1972/09/24/pagina-13/34286341/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; as early 1970s Ignacio was expulsed from the socialist-dominated [[Carlist Party|Partido Carlista]].&lt;ref&gt;Josep Carlos Clemente, ''Breve historia de las guerras carlistas'', Madrid 2011, p. 248, the paragraph titled ''Ignacio y Joaquin Baleztena, caciques de Franco en Navarra''; Clemente 1977, p. 68 does not mention Ignacio and claims that it was his brother and his two sons who were expulsed in July 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prayer in Cairo 1865.jpg|thumb|''Prayer in [[Cairo]]'', painting by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], 1865.]]
'''Imam''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɑː|m}}; {{lang-ar|إمام}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|imām}}''; plural: {{lang|ar|أئمة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aʼimmah}}'') is an [[Islam]]ic leadership position. 

It is most commonly used as the title of a worship leader of a [[mosque]] and [[Muslim]] community among [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]]s. In this context, imams may lead [[Worship#Islam|Islamic worship]] services, serve as community leaders, and provide religious guidance. 

For [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Muslim]]s, the imam has a more central meaning and role in Islam through the concept of [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|imamah]]; the term is only applicable to those members of ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'', the house of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], designated as [[The Fourteen Infallible|infallibles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunni imams==
{{main|Imam khatib (Sunni Islam)}}
The Sunni branch of Islam does not have imams in the same sense as the [[Shi'a]], an important distinction often overlooked by those outside of the Islamic faith. In everyday terms, the imam for Sunni Muslims is the one who leads Islamic formal ([[Fard]]) prayers, even in locations besides the mosque, whenever prayers are done in a group of two or more with one person leading (imam) and the others following by copying his ritual actions of worship. Friday sermon is most often given by an appointed imam. All mosques have an imam to lead the ([[Worship|congregational]]) prayers, even though it may sometimes just be a member from the gathered congregation rather than an officially appointed salaried person. The position of [[women as imams]] is controversial. The person that should be chosen, according to [[Hadith]], is one who has most knowledge of the [[Quran]] and Sunnah (prophetic tradition) and is of good character.

The term is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam, often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni [[madhhab]]s, or schools of [[fiqh|jurisprudence (''fiqh'')]]. It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to [[Hadith]] or it may refer to the heads of [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]'s family in their generational times.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The following table shows the considered imams in the context of scholarly authority by Sunni Muslims:

'''The Position of Imams In Turkey'''

Imams are appointed by the state to work at mosques and they are required to be graduates of an [[İmam Hatip school|İmam Hatip high school]] or have a university degree in Theology. This is an official position regulated by the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/en/home|title=Presidency of Religious Affairs|website=www.diyanet.gov.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Turkey and only males are appointed to this position while female officials under the same state organisation work as preachers and Qur'an course tutors, religious services experts. These officials are supposed to belong to the [[Hanafi school]] of the Sunni sect.

A central figure in an Islamic movement is also called as an Imam like the Imam Nabhawi in Syria and [[Ahmad Raza Khan]] in India and Pakistan is also called as the Imam of Sunni Muslims.

==Shi'a imams==
{{Main|Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|The Twelve Imams}}

In the Shi'a context, an imam is not only presented as the man of God ''par excellence'', but as participating fully in the names, attributes, and acts that theology usually reserves for God alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amir-Moezzi|first1=Ali|title=Spirituality and Islam.|date=2008|publisher=Tauris|location=London|isbn=9781845117382|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imams have a meaning more central to belief, referring to leaders of the community. [[Twelver]] and [[Ismaili]] Shi'a believe that these imams are chosen by God to be perfect examples for the faithful and to lead all humanity in all aspects of life. They also believe that all the imams chosen are free from committing any sin, impeccability which is called ''[[ismah]]''. These leaders must be followed since they are appointed by God.

===Twelver===
Here follows a list of the [[Twelver Shi`ism|Twelvers]] imams:

{|class="wikitable" width="100%" style="background:#ffffff;"

! Number !! Name&lt;br&gt;(Full/[[Kunya (Arabic)|Kunya]]) !! Title&lt;br&gt;([[Arabic language|Arabic]]/[[Turkish language|Turkish]])&lt;ref&gt;The imam's Arabic titles are used by the majority of Twelver Shia who use [[Arabic]] as a [[liturgical language]], including the [[Usooli]], [[Akhbari]], [[Shaykhi]], and to a lesser extent [[Alawi]]. Turkish titles are generally used by [[Alevi]], a fringe Twelver group, who make up around 10% of the world Shia population. The titles for each imam literally translate as "First Ali", "Second Ali", and so forth. {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa  | last =  | first = | year = 2004 | publisher = Gale Group | ISBN = 978-0-02-865769-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;!!

[[Fatimah]], also Fatimah al-Zahraa, daughter of Muhammed (615–632), is also considered infallible but not an Imam. The Shi'a believe that the last Imam, the 12th Imam [[Mahdi]] will one day emerge on [[Qiyamah]].

==Imams as secular rulers==
At times, imams have held both secular and religious authority. This was the case in [[Oman]] among the [[Kharijite]] or [[Ibadi]] sects. At times, the imams were elected. At other times the position was inherited, as with the [[Yaruba dynasty]] from 1624 and 1742. See [[List of rulers of Oman]], the [[Rustamid dynasty]]: 776–909, [[Nabhani dynasty]]: 1154–1624, the [[Yaruba dynasty]]: 1624–1742, the [[Al Said]]: 1744–present for further information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=50, 437|last=Miles|first=Samuel Barrett|authorlink=Samuel Barrett Miles|title=The Countries and Tribes of the Persian Gulf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbsOoPpZiSEC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=2013-11-15|year=1919|publisher=Garnet Pub.|isbn=978-1-873938-56-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]] (1727-1896) was a [[Fula people|Fulani]] state in West Africa where secular power alternated between two lines of hereditary Imams, or ''almami''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=365|last1=Holt|first1=P. M.|last2=Holt|first2=Peter Malcolm|last3=Lambton|first3=Ann K. S.|author4=Bernard Lewis|title=The Cambridge History of Islam:|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y99jTbxNbSAC&amp;pg=PA365|date=1977-04-21|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29137-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] sect, imams were secular as well as spiritual leaders who held power in [[Yemen]] for more than a thousand years. In 897, a Zaidi ruler, [[al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya]], founded a line of such imams, a theocratic form of government which survived until the second half of the 20th century. (See details under [[Zaidiyyah]], [[History of Yemen]], [[Imams of Yemen]].)

[[Ruhollah Khomeini]] is officially referred to as Imam in [[Iran]]. Several Iranian places and institutions are named "Imam Khomeini", including a [[Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni|city]], an [[Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport|international airport]], a [[Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex|hospital]], and a [[Imam Khomeini International University|university]].

{{Fiqh |marital}}

'''Islamic views on adoption''' are generally distinct from practices and customs of [[adoption]] in other non-Muslim parts of the world like [[Western world|Western]] or [[East Asia]]n societies.

Raising a child who is not one's genetic child is allowed and, in the case of an orphan, even encouraged. But, according to the Islamic view, the child does not become a true child of the "adoptive" parents. For example, the child is named after the biological, not adoptive, father. This does not mean adoption is not allowed. It means that the adopted child doesn't carry the same name as its adoptive parents. In Islam it is considered a blessing to take care of an orphan, in fact it is considered a duty to some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/cs/parenting/a/adoption.htm|title=Adoption in Islam|author=Huda|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus many Muslims say that it is forbidden by Islamic law to adopt a child (in the common sense of the word), but permissible to take care of another child, which is translated into Arabic as {{lang|ar|الكفالة}} (''kafala''). The adoptive child can become a [[mahram]] to his adopted family, if he or she is breast-fed by the adoptive mother before the age of two (see [[milk kinship]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/la/IslamicView/Adoption.html|title=Adoption|work=angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be confusion between a child that has been orphaned and one who has been abandoned but is presumed to have living parents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef.org/sudan/UNICEF_Sudan_Technical_Briefing_Paper_1_-_Alternative_family_care.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hadith]] involving [[Aisha]] and [[Abu-Hudhayfah ibn Utbah]]'s adoptive son [[Salim mawla Abu Hudaifa]] states:
:Abu Hudhaifa, one of those who fought the [[battle of Badr]], with Allah's Apostle adopted Salim as his son and married his niece Hind bint Al-Wahd bin 'Utba to him' and Salim was a freed slave of an [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansari]] woman. Allah's Apostle also adopted Zaid as his son. In the Pre-Islamic period of ignorance the custom was that, if one adopted a son, the people would call him by the name of the adopted-father whom he would inherit as well, till Allah revealed: "Call them (adopted sons) By (the names of) their fathers." (33.5)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.335|title=Cmje|work=usc.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212143553/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.335|archivedate=2006-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
There is now some discussion about reconsidering some of the rules about Islamic adoptions. A groundbreaking study was done by the Muslim Women's Shura Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/about/shuracouncil/|title=The Global Muslim Women's Shura Council - WISE Muslim Women|work=wisemuslimwomen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 2011 titled, "Adoption and the Care of Orphan Children: Islam and the Best Interests of the Child".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/images/activism/Adoption_(August_2011)_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This report examined Islamic sources and concluded "adoption can be acceptable under Islamic law and its principle objectives, as long as important ethical guidelines are followed." The study represents a form of independent reasoning (ijtihad) and may raise some awareness and contribute toward shaping a future consensus (ijma) on the issue.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jurist.org/forum/2012/11/faisal-kutty-adoption-kafalah.php|title= Islamic Law, Adoptions and Kafalah|accessdate= 2012-11-14|publisher= jurist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic law scholar [[Faisal Kutty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/forum/2012/11/faisal-kutty-adoption-kafalah.php|title=JURIST - Islamic Law, Adoptions and Kafalah|work=jurist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that this report and a number of other developments in the area provide for some optimism that we may be at the cusp of a sea change in this area.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Kutty argues that the belief that closed adoption, as practiced in the West, is the only acceptable form of permanent childcare is a significant obstacle to its acceptance among many Muslims.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Faisal Kutty|year=2014|title=Islamic Law and Adoptions |ssrn=2457066}}&lt;!-- Seems to significantly differ from published version in 978-1-4438-7129-7 / http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/62311 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The situation is significantly different when we move to open adoptions, where there is not negation of the biological parentage. Kutty believes that there is sufficient basis in Islamic jurisprudence to argue for qualified support of adoptions and even international adoptions.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; He writes that it is undeniable that taking care of orphans and foundlings is a religious obligation and that the best interest of children has been a recurrent theme among the various juristic schools.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; Arguably one of the best ways to take care of these children is to place them in loving homes, provided that a child’s lineage is not intentionally negated or concealed.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; He argues that a reformed model {{additional citation needed|date=June 2017}} of Islamic adoptions will enable Muslims to fulfill this religious obligation while ensuring that the most vulnerable do not fall through technical cracks and will not be negatively impacted by formal rules that no longer serve their intended purposes.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

{{Judaism}}
[[Religious pluralism]] is a set of religious world views that hold that one's religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus recognizes that some level of truth and value exists in other religions. As such, religious pluralism goes beyond religious tolerance, which is the condition of peaceful existence between adherents of different religions or religious denominations.

Within the Jewish community there lies a common history, a shared language of prayer, a shared Bible and a shared set of [[rabbinic literature]], thus allowing for Jews of significantly different world views to share some common values and goals.

==Classical Jewish views==

===General classical views on other religions===
Traditionally, Jews believe that God chose the Jewish people to be in a [[Jews as a chosen people|unique covenant with God]], described by the [[Torah]] itself, with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the [[Oral Torah]].  Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission &amp;mdash; to be a [[light unto the nations]], practice [[Tikkun olam]] and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the [[Torah]]. This view, however, did not preclude a belief that [[God]] has a relationship with other peoples &amp;mdash; rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God. Each nation with its own unique relationship with God.

Biblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view: Moses refers to the "God of the spirits of all flesh" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|27:16|HE}}), and the [[Tanakh]] ([[Hebrew Bible]]) also identifies [[prophet]]s outside the community of Israel.  Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of [[Natan'el_al-Fayyumi|Nathanel ben Fayyumi]], a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, "God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...&lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language."(Levine, 1907/1966)  The [[Mishnah]] states that "Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God's greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other." (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) The [[Mishnah]] continues, and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life, Jewish or not-Jewish, has killed or saved an entire world. The Tosefta, a supplement to the Mishnah, states: "[[Righteous among the Nations|Righteous people of all nations]] have a share in the [[Olam Haba|world to come]]" (Tosefta Sanhedrin 13:1; Sanhedrin 105a; also Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Teshuvah 3:4).  The Midrash adds: "-Why does the Holy One, blessed be He, love the righteous? Because righteousness is not due to inheritance or family connections... If a man wants to become a Kohen or a Levite, he cannot.  Why?  Because his father was neither a Kohen nor a Levite. However, if someone wants to become righteous, even if he is a gentile, he can, because righteousness is not inherited. [Numbers Rabbah 8:2]

A traditional Jewish view is that rather than being obligated to obey the whole [[613 mitzvot]] that the Jews are obligated to, the other nation adhere to a common list of commandments under seven categories that God required of the children of [[Noah]]; [[Noahide laws]], (''i.e.'' all humanity, ten generations prior to the birth of [[Abraham]], the original father of Judaism).}

According to the [[Talmud]], the seven [[Noahide Laws]] are;
#שפיכת דמים - ''Sh'fichat damim,'' to refrain from bloodshed and [[murder]]
#דינים - ''Dinim,'' to establish [[laws]], and [[judiciary|courts of justice]]
#עבודה זרה - ''Avodah zarah,'' to refrain from  [[idolatry]],
#ברכת השם ''Birkat Hashem,'' - to refrain from [[blasphemy]],
#גילוי עריות - ''Gilui Arayot'' (''Gilui Arayos'' in the Ashkenazi pronunciation) to refrain from [[sexual immorality]] (traditionally, [[incest]], [[bestiality]], [[adultery]])
#גזל - ''Gezel,'' to refrain from [[theft]], and
#אבר מן החי - ''Ever min ha'Chai,'' to refrain from eating a limb torn from a still living animal{{clarify|reason=Implications of ''Ever min ha-Hai'' (אבר מן החי)? No unnecessary cruelty to animals?|date=June 2013}}

Any person who lives according to these laws is known as "The righteous among the [[gentiles]]". [[Maimonides]] states that this refers to those who have acquired [[knowledge]] of [[God]] and act in accordance with the [[Noahide laws]]. In the 2nd century a sage in the [[Tosefta]] declared "the righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come." (Tosefta, Sanhedrin 13)

Prophets of the Bible, while they repeatedly denounced the evils of the idolatrous nations (in addition to their denouncing the Jews' sins), they never call the nations to account for their idolatrous ''beliefs'' (i.e. worshiping multiple deities), but only for their evil ''actions'' (such as human sacrifice, murder, and miscarriages of justice). {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}.

The Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Peah, states:

"כתיב ומשפט ורב צדקה לא יענה אין הקב"ה משהא מתן שכרן של עושה מצות בגוי"

"It is written, "Justice and abundant righteousness he does not withhold".

===Classical views on Christianity===
{{main|Christianity and Judaism}}

Some [[rabbi]]s in the [[Talmud]] view [[Christianity]] as a form of idolatry, and therefore prohibited not only to [[Jew]]s, but to [[gentile]]s as well.{{citation needed|reason=Please cite|date=January 2015}} Rabbis with these views did not claim that it was idolatry in the same sense as pagan idolatry in Biblical times, but that it relied on idolatrous forms of worship (i.e. to a [[Trinity]] of gods and to [[statue]]s and [[saints]]) (see Babylonian Talmud Hullin, 13b). Other rabbis disagreed, and do not hold it to be idolatry for gentiles (see Tosafot on Babylonian Talmud Avodah Zarah 2a). The dispute continues to this day. (Jacob Katz, ''Exclusiveness and Tolerance'', Oxford Univ. Press, 1961, Ch.10)

[[Maimonides]], one of [[Judaism]]'s most important theologians and [[halakha|legal experts]], explained in detail why [[Jesus]] was wrong to create Christianity and why [[Muhammad]] was wrong to create [[Islam]]; he laments the pains Jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant Judaism (in the case of Christianity, called [[Supersessionism]]). However, Maimonides then goes on to say that both faiths can be considered a positive part of God's plan to redeem the world.

:''[[Jesus]] was instrumental [''or, "was an instrument"''] in changing the Torah and causing the world to err and serve another beside God. But it is beyond the human mind to fathom the designs of our Creator, for our ways are not God's ways, neither are our thoughts His. All these matters relating to Jesus of Nazareth, and the [[Ishmael]]ite [''i.e.'', [[Muhammad]] ] who came after him, only served to clear the way for the [[Jewish Messiah]] to prepare the whole world to worship God with one accord, as it is written 'For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.' ({{bibleverse||Zephaniah|3:9|HE}}). Thus the [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish hope]], and the [[Torah]], and the [[mitzvot|commandments]] have become familiar topics of conversation among those even on far isles, and among many people, un[[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcised]] of flesh and heart.'' (Maimonides, [[Mishneh Torah]], XI.4.)

The above paragraph was often censored from many printed versions where Christian censorship was felt.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Modern (post-Enlightenment era) Jewish views==

===Views on dialogue with non-Jews in general===
[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and a few [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]]  rabbis engage in [[interfaith]] religious dialogue, while most Orthodox rabbis do not.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Rabbi Lord [[Immanuel Jakobovits]], former Chief Rabbi of the [[United Synagogue]] of [[Great Britain]], describes a commonly held Jewish view on this issue: {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"Yes, I do believe in the Chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people - and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual - is "chosen" or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of [[Divine Providence|Providence]]. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] were chosen for their unique contributions to [[art]] and [[philosophy]], the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] for their pioneering services in [[law]] and [[government]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] for bringing [[parliament]]ary rule into the world, and the [[United States|Americans]] for piloting [[democracy]] in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of [[religion]] and [[morality]]; that was and is their national purpose."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German-Jewish philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] (1729–1786) taught that "According to the basic principles of my religion I am not to seek to convert anyone not born into our laws....We believe that the other nations of the Earth are directed by God to observe only the [[Natural law|law of nature]] and the [[Abrahamic religion|religion of the Patriarchs]]...I fancy that whosoever leads men to virtue in this life cannot be damned in the next."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}{{vague|date=January 2015}}

According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] article on [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543 Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah], {{dubious|date=January 2015}}{{vague|date=January 2015}} Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] (1697–1776) claimed: {{cquote|... the original intention of Jesus, and especially of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], was to convert only the Gentiles to the [[Seven Laws of Noah|seven moral laws of Noah]] and to let the Jews follow the [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]] &amp;mdash; which explains the apparent contradictions in the [[New Testament]] regarding the [[Biblical law in Christianity|laws of Moses]] and the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]].}}

===Views on Jewish-Christian dialogue{{POV-Statement|date=January 2015}}===

====Joseph Soloveitchik====
In practice, the predominant position of Modern Orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] in an essay entitled ''Confrontation''. He held that Judaism and Christianity are "two faith communities (which are) intrinsically antithetic". In his view "the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community. Hence the confrontation should occur not at a theological, but at a mundane human level... the great encounter between man and God is a holy, personal and private affair, incomprehensible to the outsider..."  As such, he ruled that theological dialogue between Judaism and Christianity was not possible.

However, Soloveitchik advocated closer ties between the Jewish and Christian communities. He held that communication between Jews and Christians was not merely permissible, but "desirable and even essential" on non-theological issues such as war and peace, the war on poverty, the struggle for people to gain freedom, issues of morality and civil rights, and to work together against the perceived threat of secularism.

As a result of his ruling, Orthodox Jewish groups did not operate in interfaith discussions between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and Jews about [[Vatican II]], a strictly theological endeavour. However, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA), with Soloveitchik's approval, then engaged in a number of interfaith dialogues with both Catholic and Protestant Christian groups.

Soloveitchik understood his ruling as advising against purely theological interfaith dialogue, but as allowing theological dialogue as part of a greater context. [[Bernard Rosensweig]] (former President of the RCA) writes "The RCA remained loyal to the guidelines which the Rav had set down [concerning interfaith dialogue] and distinguished between theological discussions and ethical-secular concerns, which have universal validity. Every program involving either Catholic or Protestant churches in which we participated was carefully scrutinized.... Every topic which had possible theological nuances or implications was vetoed, and only when the Rav pronounced it to be satisfactory did we proceed to the dialogue."

:An RCA committee was once reviewing possible topics for an inter-faith dialogue. One of the suggested topics was "Man in the Image of God." Several members of the committee felt that the topic had too theological a ring, and wished to veto it. When the Rav [Soloveitch] was consulted he approved the topic and quipped, "What should the topic have been? Man as a Naturalistic Creature?!"
:(''Lawrence Kaplan, Revisionism and the Rav: The Struggle for the Soul of Modern Orthodoxy Judaism'', Summer, 1999)

The basis for Soloveitchik's ruling was not narrowly legal, but sociological and historical. He described the traditional Jewish–Christian relationship as one of "the few and weak vis-à-vis the many and the strong", one in which the Christian community historically denied the right of the Jewish community to believe and live in their own way. His response was written in the light of past Jewish-Christian religious disputations, which traditionally had been forced upon the Jewish community. Those had as their express goal the conversion of Jews to Christianity. As recently as the 1960s many traditional Jews still looked upon all interfaith dialogue with suspicion, fearing that conversion may be an ulterior motive. This was a reasonable belief, given that many Catholics and most Protestants at the time in fact held this position. Reflecting this stance, Rabbi Soloveitchik asked the Christian community to respect "the right of the community of the few to live, create and worship in its own way, in freedom and with dignity."

====Other rabbinical views====
Many traditional rabbis agree; they hold that while cooperation with the Christian community is of importance, theological dialogue is unnecessary, or even misguided. Rabbi [[Eliezer Berkovits]] writes that "Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism."  (Disputation and Dialogue: Readings in the Jewish Christian Encounter, Ed. F.E. Talmage, Ktav, 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;291.)

In later years Solovetichik's qualified permission was interpreted more and more restrictively. (Tradition:A Journal of Orthodox Thought, Vol. 6, 1964) Today many Orthodox rabbis use Soloveitchik's letter to justify having no discussion or joint efforts with Christians.

In contrast, some Modern Orthodox rabbis such as [[Eugene Korn]] and [[David Hartman (rabbi)|David Hartman]] hold that in some cases, the primary issue in ''Confrontation''  is no longer valid; some Christian groups no longer attempt to use interfaith dialogue to convert Jews to Christianity. They believe that the relationship between Judaism and Christianity has reached a point where Jews can trust Christian groups to respect them as equals. Further, in most nations it is not possible for Jews to be forced or pressured to convert, and many major Christian groups no longer teach that the Jews who refuse to convert are [[Damnation#Religious|damned]] to [[hell]].

In non-Orthodox denominations of Judaism most rabbis hold that Jews have nothing to fear from engaging in theological dialogue, and may have much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik's distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.

====Ground rules for a Christian-Jewish dialogue {{POV-Statement|date=January 2015}}====
Conservative Rabbi [[Robert Gordis]] wrote an essay on "Ground Rules for a Christian Jewish Dialogue"; in all Jewish denominations, one form or another of these rules eventually became more or less accepted by parties engaging in Jewish-Christian theological dialogue.

Robert Gordis held that "a rational dialogue conducted on the basis of knowledge and mutual respect between the two components of the religio-ethical tradition of the Western world can prove a blessing to our age." His proposed ground rules for fair discussion are:

:(1) People should not label Jews as worshiping an inferior "Old Testament God of Justice" while saying that Christians worship a superior "God of Love of the New Testament." Gordis gives quotations from the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible) which in his view prove that this view is a misleading caricature of both religions that was created by selective quotation. (See [[Marcion]] for the historical source of this interpretation).

:(2) He holds that Christians should stop "the widespread practice of contrasting the primitivism, tribalism and formalism of the Old Testament (see also [[Antinomianism]]) with the spirituality, universalism, and freedom of the New, to the manifest disadvantage of the former." Gordis again brings forth quotations from the [[Tanakh]] which in his view prove that this is a misleading caricature of both religions, created by selective quotation.

:(3) "Another practice which should be surrendered is that of referring to Old Testament verses quoted in the New as original New Testament passages. Many years ago, [[Bertrand Russell]], a well known atheist, described the [[Ethic of Reciprocity|Golden Rule]] 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself' as New Testament teaching. When the Old Testament source ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:18|HE}}, the [[Great Commandment]]) was called to his attention, he blandly refused to recognize his error."  {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

:(4) Christians need to understand that while Judaism is based on the [[Hebrew Bible]], it is not identical to the religion described in it. Rather, Judaism is based on the Bible as understood through the classical works of [[rabbinic literature]], such as the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]. Gordis writes "To describe Judaism within the framework of the Old Testament is as misleading as constructing a picture of American life in terms of the Constitution, which is, to be sure, the basic law of the land but far from coextensive with our present legal and social system."

:(5) Jews must "rise above the heavy burden of historical memories which have made it difficult for them to achieve any real understanding, let alone an appreciation, of Christianity. It is not easy to wipe out the memories of centuries of [[persecution]] and [[wiktionary:massacre|massacre]], all too often dedicated to the advancement of the cause of the [[wikt:Prince of Peace|Prince of Peace]].....[It is] no easy task for Jews to divest themselves of the heavy burden of group memories from the past, which are unfortunately reinforced all too often by personal experiences in the present. Nevertheless, the effort must be made, if men are to emerge from the dark heritage of religious hatred which has embittered their mutual relationships for twenty centuries. There is need for Jews to surrender the stereotype of Christianity as being monolithic and unchanging and to recognize the ramifications of viewpoint and emphasis that constitute the multicolored spectrum of [[Christian denominations|contemporary Christianity]]."

Gordis calls on Jews to "see in Christian doctrine an effort to apprehend the nature of the divine that is worthy of respect and understanding" and that "the dogmas of the Christian church have expressed this vision of God in terms that have proved meaningful to Christian believers through the centuries." He calls on Jews to understand with tolerance and respect the historical and religious context which led Christians to develop the concepts of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]], the [[Incarnation]], [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], even if Jews themselves do not accept these ideas as correct. Similarly, Gordis calls on Christians to understand with tolerance and respect that Jews do not accept these beliefs, since they are in contradiction to the Jewish understanding of the [[Shema|unity of God]]. (Source: "The Root and the Branch", Chapter 4, Robert Gordis, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1962)

Recently, over 120 rabbis have signed the [[Dabru Emet]] ("Speak the Truth"), a document concerning the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. While affirming that there are substantial theological differences between the two religions, the purpose of Dabru Emet is to point out common ground. It is not an official document of any of the Jewish denominations per se, but it is representative of what many Jews feel. Dabru Emet sparked a [[controversy]] in segments of the Jewish community. Many Jews disagree with parts of it for a variety of reasons.

===Views on Jewish-Muslim dialogue===
Many Muslim and Jewish groups and individuals have together created [[projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs]], most of which have as one of their goals overcoming [[religious prejudice]].

The viewpoint of [[Conservative Judaism]] is summarized in ''Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism''. This official statement holds that
:"As Conservative Jews, we acknowledge without apology the many debts which Jewish religion and civilization owe to the nations of the world. We eschew triumphalism with respect to other ways of serving God. [[Maimonides]] believed that other monotheistic faiths, Christianity and Islam, serve to spread knowledge of, and devotion to, the God and the Torah of Israel throughout the world. Many modern thinkers, both Jewish and gentile, have noted that God may well have seen fit to enter covenants with many nations. Either outlook, when relating to others, is perfectly compatible with a commitment to one's own faith and pattern of religious life. If we criticize triumphalism in our own community, then real dialogue with other faith groups requires that we criticize triumphalism and other failings in those quarters as well. In the second half of the twentieth century, no relationship between Jews and Christians can be dignified or honest without facing up frankly to the centuries of prejudice, theological anathema, and persecution that have been thrust upon Jewish communities, culminating in the horrors of the Shoah ([[Holocaust]]). No relationship can be nurtured between Jews and Muslims unless it acknowledges explicitly and seeks to combat the terrible social and political effects of Muslim hostility, as well as the disturbing but growing reaction of Jewish anti-Arabism in the [[Land of Israel]]. But all of these relationships, properly pursued, can bring great blessing to the Jewish community and to the world. As the late Professor [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] put it, "no religion is an island."

===Views on dialogue with other religions===
A small number of modern Jewish theologians, such as [[Yehezkel Kaufman]] and [[Rabbi]] Joseph H. Hertz, have suggested that perhaps only the Israelites were forbidden to worship idols, but perhaps such worship was permissible for members of other religions. (Yehezkel Kaufman, "The Religion of Israel", Univ. of Chicago Press, 1960; J. H. Hertz, "Pentateuch and Haftorahs" Soncino Press, 1960, p.&amp;nbsp;759).  Most Jewish theologians disagree, saying that the original meaning of the text was to condemn idolatry in total. However, a growing number of Jewish theologians question whether [[Hindu]]s and [[Buddhist]]s today should be considered idolaters in the Biblical sense of the term. Their reasons are that modern day Buddhists, Hindus and others (a) do not literally worship "sticks and stones", as the idolaters in the Tanakh were described doing. Their beliefs have far more theological depth than ancient pagans{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, and they are well aware that icons they worship are only symbols of a deeper level of reality (though the same can be said of modern-day [[paganism|pagans]]), (b) they do not practice child sacrifice, (c) they are of high moral character, and (d) they are not anti-Jewish. Some Jews argue that God has a relationship with all gentile monotheists (or perceived monotheists), including Hindus, who in the past may have been (mis)interpreted as having a polytheist faith (see also [[Hindu views on monotheism]]), as well as with members of other religions such as [[Buddhism]].

{{Karnataka History}}
The '''Kadambas of Halasi''' was a [[South India]]n dynasty during the [[Classical India|Late Classical period]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]], which originated in the region of [[Halasi]], [[Karnataka]]; who were known for their own style of temple building. The [[Kadamba dynasty]] was founded by [[Mayurasharma]] in about 4th century AD. It was believed that Mayura was the first king of the dynasty and was the ruler during the time of [[Pallava]] King Vishnugopa of Kanchipuram. After losing to North Indian Emperor Samudragupta, Vishnugopa’s army had weakened. Mayura seized the opportunity, formed his own army and drove away the Pallavas from [[Kannada]] territory. On reaching ''[[Chandravalli]]'' (near [[Chitradurga]]), Mayura took shelter in a cave and founded his own dynasty.  [[Banavasi]], near [[Sirsi, Karnataka|Sirsi]], was their first capital and their rule extended to Gomantak or present day [[Goa]].

[[Halasi]] (Halsi or Halshi) is one of the ancient towns in [[Belgaum district]]. It was  Second capital of early [[Kadambas]] and a minor capital (during 980 AD - 1250 AD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; under later Kadambas. where there are ''Bhoo Varaha Narasimha temple,  Suvarneshwara temple,  Kapileshwar temple, Hatakeshwara temple, Kalmeshwara temple, Gokarneshwara temple and a [[Jain]] basadi'' built by the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]] rulers.

Halasi was a centre of confluence of [[Jainism]], [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]] during  early Kadambas. It was headquarters of ''Halasige-12,000'' province including parts of [[Belgaum District]], [[Dharwad District]] and [[Haveri District]].

Kadambas ruled Goa, Halasi as Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Halasi Inscriptions==

Full scale excavations at [[Halasi]] and ''Gudnapur'' are bound to yield the brick temples of this early period. That would, show the contribution of the [[Kadambas|Kadambas of Banavasi]] to the [[Jain]]a [[architecture of Karnataka]]. The existence of Jaina temples during the period of the Banavasi Kadambas is amply evidenced by their epigraphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.jainsamaj.org/literature/monuments-071004.htm
|title=JAINA MONUMENTS IN NORTH KARNATAKA
|publisher=By Dr. A. V. Narasimha Murthy
|accessdate=2008-09-03
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080323094530/http://www.jainsamaj.org/literature/monuments-071004.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the inscriptions mention gifts for worship and repair to Jaina temples. However, many of them refer to a Jaina temple at [[Halasi]]. The [[Jainism|Jaina]] temple now standing at Halasi can be dated from no earlier than the 11th century A.D. As to the basadis referred to in the inscriptions, perhaps they might have been built of perishable wood.

The earliest references to a grant by a Kadamba king to a Jaina saint is found in the Halasi copper plate of [[Kakusthavarma]]. It mentions that the granted village [[Khatagrama]] belonged to arhanta. However, a reference to a Jain temple (Chaityalaya) is found in the [[Devagiri]] copper plate of ''Mrigesavarma''. The inscription states that Mrigesavarma gave a grant for the sammarjana, upalepana, archana and bhagnasamskara of the Chaityalaya located at ''Brihatparalur''. Further he also donated for the enclosure of the Chaityalaya one nivartana of land. This clearly shows that the above Chaityalaya was big enough to have an enclosure also. In the [[Devagiri]] inscription of ''Vijaya Siva Mrigesavarma'' a reference is made to arhat sale where an image of [[Jinendra]] was kept.  Mrigesavarma's Halasi inscription of 8th regnal year states that the king built a Jinalaya in memory of his father in ''Palasika'' and granted lands to saints of ''Yapaniya, nirgrantha and kurchaka sangha''. Ravivarma's eleventh regnal year inscription found at Halasi refers to a grant for the abhisheka of Jinendra. Obviously this refers to a Jaina temple. Another inscription of the same king refers to the worship of Jinendra for which four nivartanas of land was granted .

The Halasi inscription of Ravivarma refers to interesting information. It states that the income from the gifted village should be used for eight-day festival in Kartikamasa in the Jinalaya at ''Palasikanagara''. It states at the end wherever Jinendra worship takes place properly, that place will prosper without any fear from enemies and the prowess of the king will improve. The Devagiri plates of prince Devavarma refers to gifts for the worship in the Chaityalaya and for the repairs of the Chaityalaya.

The famous ''Gudnapur inscription of Ravivarman'' is more explicit on this point. According to this inscription King Ravivarma built a temple, Kamajinalaya for Manmatha, very near the palace (rajavesma) and arranged for its worship by granting lands. At the same time he also gave grants to Kamajinalaya at Hakinipalli and Padmavati temple at ''Kalliligrama''.

According to ''Dr. [[B.R. Gopal]]'' who has edited this inscription has suggested that this Kamajinalaya is a temple for [[Bahubali]], as Bahubali is described as Manmatha. If this is so, the tradition of erecting gommata sculptures dates from the period of Kadambas and to sixth century A.D.

''Dr. A. Sundara'' has discovered a sculpture of Rati and Manmatha at the same place. Whether this was the sculpture worshipped in the Kamajinalya is uncertain. What is more important is the tradition of building Jaina temples for Manmatha and Padmavati.

According to A. Sundara's field work at [[Halasi]] throws very important light on this point. Very close to the ''Kallesvara temple at Halasi'', he discovered an ancient site dates from the [[megalithic]] and early historic periods. A large number of brick walls of the ancient period have been noticed by him in and around and he thinks that this represents the Jaina temple built during the Kadamba period.

In the Mrigesavarman of Kadambas of [[Palasika]] (AD 475-490) inscription mention about [[Yapaniya]].

A [[gospel]] (a contraction of [[Old English]] ''god spel'' meaning "good news/glad tidings (of the kingdom of God)", comparable to [[Koine Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''evangelion''){{sfn|Woodhead|2004|p=4}} is a written account of the career and teachings of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Tuckett|2000|p=522}} The term originally meant the Christian message itself, but in the 2nd century it came to be used for the books in which the message was set out.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=697}}&lt;ref group="Notes" name="Gospel"&gt;For gospel as the Christian message see the article [[The Gospel]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Gospels are a [[genre]] of [[Early Christian]] literature claiming to recount the life of Jesus. The [[development of the New Testament canon|New Testament]] has four [[canonical gospels]] which are accepted as the only authentic ones by the great majority of Christians, but many others exist, or used to exist, and are called either [[New Testament apocrypha]] or [[pseudepigraph]]a. Some of these have left considerable traces on [[Christian]] traditions, including [[iconography]].

* [[Gospel of Marcion]] – 2nd century; potentially an edited version of the Gospel of Luke or a document which predates Luke (see: [[Marcionism]])
* [[Gospel of Basilides]] – composed in Egypt around 120 to 140 AD; thought to be a gnostic [[gospel harmony]] of the canonical gospels

===Partially preserved gospels===
* [[Gospel of Peter]]

===Fragmentary preserved gospels{{Ref_label|A|α|none}}===
* [[Gospel of Eve]] – mentioned only once by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] circa 400, who preserves a single brief passage in quotation.
* [[Gospel of Mani]] – 3rd century – attributed to the Persian [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], the founder of [[Manichaeism]].
* [[Gospel of the Saviour]] (also known as the Unknown Berlin gospel) – highly fragmentary 6th-century manuscript based on a late 2nd- or early 3rd-century original. A dialogue rather than a narrative; heavily Gnostic in character in that salvation is dependent upon possessing secret knowledge.
* Coptic Gospel of the Twelve – late 2nd century [[Coptic language]] work – although often equated with the Gospel of the Ebionites, it appears to be an attempt to re-tell the Gospel of John in the pattern of the Synoptics; it quotes extensively from John's Gospel.

===Reconstructed gospels{{Ref_label|B|β|none}}===
* [[Secret Gospel of Mark]] – suspect: the single source mentioning it is considered by many to be a modern forgery, and it disappeared before it could be independently authenticated.
* [[Gospel of Matthias]]

===Lost gospels===
* [[Gospel of Cerinthus]] – ca. 90–120 AD – according to [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]&lt;ref&gt;Pan. Haer. 28.5.1., I 317.10&lt;/ref&gt; this is a Jewish gospel identical to the Gospel of the Ebionites and, apparently, a truncated version of Matthew's Gospel according to the Hebrews.
* Gospel of [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]] – mid-to-late 2nd century; a further edited version of Marcion's edited version of Luke.
* Gospel of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]]&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned by [[Tertullian]] in Adversus Valentinianos. According to [[Irenaeus]], it is the same as the [[Gospel of Truth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gospel of the [[Encratites]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] ascribed a gospel to the sect of [[Encratites]]. It is more probable however, that he referred to the Gospel of [[Tatian]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gospel of Andrew]] – mentioned by only two 5th-century sources ([[Augustine]] and [[Pope Innocent I]]) who list it as apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine and Innocent only mention it once with no information about it. If it’s the same as the Acts of Andrew, then it was written ca. 150–250 AD and isn’t lost, and it’s kind of a Christian retelling of the Odyssey, only with St. Andrew in the leading role.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gospel of Barnabas – this work is mentioned only once, in the 5th century [[Decretum Gelasianum|Decree of Gelasius]], which lists it as apocryphal – not to be confused with the 16th century [[Gospel of Barnabas]]. 
* [[Gospel of Bartholomew]] – mentioned by only two 5th-century sources which list it as apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]] mentions it twice: Catul. Script. Eccles. in Pantæn. and Præfat. in Comm. in Matt. It is also mentioned once in the Decree of Gelasius&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gospel of Hesychius – mentioned only by Jerome and the Decree of Gelasius that list it as apocryphal.&lt;ref name=gelasius&gt;This phrase is found in the Decree of Gelasius wherein certain gospels are condemned by that title. What they were is uncertain. Jerome speaks of "those books which go under the names of Lucian and Hesychius and are esteemed through the perverse humors of some"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gospel of Lucius&lt;ref name=gelasius/&gt; – mentioned only by Jerome and the Decree of Gelasius that list it as apocryphal.
* Gospel of Merinthus&lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of Merinthus is mentioned only by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] as one of those spurious gospels which he supposes were written in the apostles' time and referred to by Luke in Luke 1:1 "as not being a true and genuine account". [[Johann Albert Fabricius|Fabricius]] supposes that Merinthus and Cerinthus are the same person and that Cerinthus was changed into Merinthus by the way of banter or reproach. Although Epiphanius makes them into two different persons, yet in the heresy of the Cerinthians, he professes himself uncertain. He said "The Cerinthians are also called Merinthians as we see by the accounts we have; but whether this Cerinthus was also called Merinthus, a fellow laborer of his, God knows"(Jones, A new and full method of settling the canonical authority of the New Testament)&lt;/ref&gt; – mentioned only by Epiphanius; probably the Gospel of Cerinthus, and the confusion due to a scribal error.
* An unknown number of other [[Gnostics|Gnostic]] gospels not cited by name.&lt;ref&gt;The [[gnostics]] had various gospels. [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] speaks of their writing "The Revelation of Adam, and other false gospels"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gospel of the Adversary of the Law and the Prophets&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Contra Adversarium Legis et Prophetarum'', 2.3.14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Justin Martyr#Memoirs of the apostles|Memoirs of the Apostles]] – Lost narrative of the life of Jesus, mentioned by [[Justin Martyr]]. The passages quoted by Justin may have originated from a [[gospel harmony]] of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] composed by Justin or his school.

===Fragments of possibly unknown or lost (or existing) gospels{{Ref_label|A|α|none}}===
* [[Egerton Gospel|Papyrus Egerton 2]] – late 2nd-century manuscript of possibly earlier original; contents parallel John 5:39–47, 10:31–39; Matt 1:40–45, 8:1–4, 22:15–22; Mark 1:40–45, 12:13–17; and Luke 5:12–16, 17:11–14, 20:20–26, but differ textually; also contains incomplete miracle account with no equivalent in canonical Gospels
* [[Fayyum Fragment]] – a fragment of about 100 Greek letters in 3rd century script; the text seems to parallel Mark 14:26–31
* [[Oxyrhynchus Gospels|Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] – Fragments #1, 654, &amp; 655 appear to be fragments of Thomas; #210 is related to MT 7:17–19 and LK 6:43–44 but not identical to them; #840 contains a short vignette about Jesus and a Pharisee not found in any known gospel, the source text is probably mid 2nd century; #1224 consists of paraphrases of Mark 2:17 and Luke 9:50

* Papyrus Berolinensis 11710 – 6th-century Greek fragment, possibly from an apocryphal gospel or amulet based on John.
* Papyrus Cairensis 10735 – 6th–7th-century Greek fragment, possibly from a lost gospel, may be a homily or commentary.
* Papyrus Merton 51 – Fragment from apocryphal gospel or a homily on Luke 6:7.
* Strasbourg Fragment – Fragment of a lost gospel, probably related to [[Acts of John]].

==Medieval gospels==
* [[Gospel of the Seventy]] – a lost 8th–9th-century Manichean work
* [[Acts of Pilate|Gospel of Nicodemus]] – a post 10th-century Christian devotional work (or works) in many variants. The first section is highly dependent upon the 5th century "Acts of Pilate"
* [[Gospel of Barnabas]] – a 16th-century harmony of the four canonical gospels, probably of Spanish ([[Morisco]]) origin, or possibly Italian
* [[Gospel of the Secret Supper]] – a 12th-century Cathar scripture

==Modern gospels==
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]] (1908)
* [[Book of Mormon]] (Another Testament of Jesus Christ) (1830)
* [[Crucifixion of Jesus, by an Eyewitness]] (1907)&lt;ref&gt;The Eye-Witness gospel is a gospel written by Elsie Louise Morris and/or Benjamin Fish Austin. The gospel purports to be an old manuscript found in an old Alexandria Library giving a graphic and detailed account of Jesus as a friend of Jesus. The gospel states that Jesus did not die on the cross but died six months later. The gospel references the Essenes a lot and is allegedly written by an elder of the Essene order who was a close friend of Jesus.

* The Fifth Gospel (1908, Steiner)&lt;ref&gt;The Fifth Gospel by [[Rudolf Steiner]] is another gospel obtained from [[Akashic Record]]. The gospel is in the form of thirteen lectures. The book contains Zoroastrian themes along with Christian themes. The gospel states that the Lord's Prayer is based off an ancient pagan prayer that Jesus obtained from Ahriman. Steiner states that the Gospel can be read at Akashic Record. The gospel's authenticity is doubted because [[Levi Dowling]] and [[Edgar Cayce]] both produced stories of Jesus' life from Akashic Record. Most of the text can be read at Google Books with the title The Fifth Gospel: From the Akashic Record.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Fifth Gospel (1956, Naber)&lt;ref&gt;Hans Naber (aka Kurt Berna) was a soldier in World War II who claimed to have been given a message from Jesus Christ about the [[Shroud of Turin]] and that he didn't die on the cross. He claimed too much blood was on the Shroud and that corpses don't bleed and thus the person was probably alive or dying. He published a series of books in an attempt to prove that Jesus didn't die on the cross but survived and went to India. The Fifth Gospel (Das Fünfte Evangelium) was a book which he attempted to prove that Jesus traveled to India with [[Mary Magdelene]] and [[Thomas the Apostle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Gospel of the Childhood of Our Lord Jesus Christ According to St. Peter]] (1904)&lt;ref&gt;[[Catulle Mendes]] was a french poet, who claimed to have found gospel written by the Apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. He said he found the manuscript at the St. Wolfgang Abbey. Unlike other biblical hoaxes Mendes presented the manuscript. The manuscript was written in Old Latin that the Romans had used. However the manuscript was quickly proved to be a hoax as it was written by Mendes. The gospel is an infancy Gospel attributed to the Apostle Peter. It was originally written in Latin by Mendes but was eventually translated into French by Mendes. The title of the original book is L'Evangile de l'enfance de Notre Seigneur Jésus Christ selon Saint Pierre, mis en français par Catulle Mendès d'après le manuscrit de l'Abbaye de Saint Wolfgang or The Gospel of the infancy of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Saint Pierre, translated into French by Catullus Mendes from the manuscript of the Abbey of St. Wolfgang.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10585">The following is a '''list of [[Shaykh al-Islām|Sheikh-ul-Islam]]s of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'''. After the fondation of the Ottoman empire around 1300, the title of Sheikh-ul-Islam, formerly used in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], was given to a leader authorized to issue legal opinion or [[fatwa]]. During the reign of Sultan [[Murad II]], (1421-1444, 1446-1451) the position became an official title, with authority over other muftis in the empire. In the late 16th century, Sheikh-ul-Islam were assigned to appoint and dismiss supreme judges, high ranking college professors, and heads of Sufi orders. Prominent figures include Zenbilli Ali Cemali Efendi (c1445-1526), [[Ibn Kemal|Ibn-i Kemal (Kemalpasazade)]] (1468-1533) and [[Ebussuud Efendi]] (c1491-1574).&lt;ref&gt;Yurdakul, İlhami."Şeyhülislam (shaykhulislam)".

==List==
During the existence of the office (from 1424 to 1922), there were in total 131 Sheikh-ul-Islams. The longest-serving officeholder was [[Ebussuud Efendi]] for 29 years, the shortest was [[Memikzade Mustafa Efendi]] for 13 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Yakut 2005, p38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a list of ''şeyḫülislāmları'', see Yakut 2005, pp. 242–247&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Manāqib''''' (Arabic مَناقِب, also transliterated '''''manāḳib'''''; singular مَنْقَبَ, ''manqaba/manḳaba'') is a [[Literary genre|genre]] in [[Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Persian language|Persian]] literature, broadly encompassing "biographical works of a laudatory nature", "in which the merits, virtues and remarkable deeds of the individual concerned are given prominence" and particularly [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] (biographies of holy people). The principle goal of such works "is to offer to the reader a moral portrait and information on the noble actions of the individuals who constitute their subject or on the superior merits of a certain group".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ch.

Heinrichs, 2nd edn, 12 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1960–2005), {{DOI:10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_0660}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such texts are valuable sources for the socio-political and religious history of early and medieval Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Asma Afsaruddin, 'In Praise of the Caliphs: Re-Creating History from the Manaqib Literature', ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', 31 (1999), 329-50; &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/176215&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asma Afsaruddin, 'Excellences Literature', in &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), I 244-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The usage of the word ''manāqib'' has varied over time and from one author to another, which is reflected in medieval Arabic scholarship by diverse opinons about the word's [[Etymology|etymological]] meaning. The main possible explanations are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The [[Semitic root|root]] ''n-q-b'', which is associated with the meaning “perforate, pierce”, in which case the idea behind the term ''manāqib'' is that it succeeds in penetrating the secrets of its subject's biography.
* The verb ''naqaba'' means “walked, followed a narrow path”, so the term ''manāqib'' might derive from the idea that a biography is metaphorically a record of a person's journey through life: a similar development is apparent in the word ''[[Prophetic biography|sīra]]'', which literally means "journey" but is the term for a genre of prophetic biographies.

Because the term ''manāqib'' came to be closely associated with sufi saints, it later also came to mean "miracles".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Like many genre terms, the term ''manāqib'' is not neatly defined, and the usage of the term overlaps with a wide range of other Arabic genre terms. Some are fairly neutral in tone: ''tarjama'' ("biography"), ''taʿrīf'' ("history"), ''[[Akhbar|akhbār]]'' (collections of historical traditions), ''[[sīra]]'' ("biographies of prophets"). Others are more expressive: ''faḍāʾil''  (“virtues”), ''maʾāt̲h̲ir'' and ''mafākhir'' (“exploits”), and ''[[Akhlaq|akhlāq]]'' (apparently synonymous with ''manāqib'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Subject matter ==
The earliest texts labelled as ''manāqib'' have generally not survived, and their existence is known only from bibliographic lists made by medieval scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the 4th/10th century onwards, ''manāqib'' were produced focusing on biographies of the [[Imam|imams]] (''madhāhib'') who founded different schools of Islamic thought (''[[madhhab]]'') about ''[[Sharia|shariʿa]]'', primarily: [[Abu Hanifa|Abū Ḥanīfa]] (d. ca. 150/767), [[Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i|al-Awzāʿī]] (d. 157/774), [[Malik ibn Anas|Mālik b. Anas]] (d. 178/795), [[Al-Shafi‘i|al-S̲h̲āfiʿī]] (d. 204/820), and [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal]] (d. 241/355). These were intended to edify the communities associated with these schools of thought, encouraging people to emulate their founders' (supposed) virtues. The fashion extended to biographical dictionaries of the disciples of each school, and sometimes biographies of particular disciples, primarily: [[Ibn Taymiyyah|Ibn Taymiyya]] (d. 728/1328), [[Sahnun|Saḥnūn]] (d. 240/854), [[Al-Qabisi|al-Ḳābisī]] (d. 403/1012), and [[Abū Bakr Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān]] (d. 432 or 435/1040-3).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From this time too, however, ''manāqib'' were increasingly produced in praise of people who achieved the status of saints in some varieties of Islam, distinguished particularly by their (supposed) miracles. This trend pertained particularly to the Maghrib, with key subjects of ''manāqib'' including: [[Abu Yazid|Abū Yazīd]] (d. 336/947), [[Al-Rabīʿ ibn al-Ḳaṭṭān|al-Rabīʿ ibn al-Qaṭṭān]] (d. 334/946), al-Mammasī (d. 333/944), al-Sabāʾī (d. 356/966), al-Jabanyānī (d. 369/979), and the patron saint of Tunis, [[Sidi Mahrez|Sīdī Maḥrez]] (d. 413/1022). The genre then spread to Arab Africa more generally and onto the Turkic- and Persian-speaking worlds. Production of such texts declined around the seventeenth century CE.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The town is said to be named after ''Raja Man'' or ''Manik'', who is said to have built the village's stupa during the Buddhist era.&lt;ref name=Punjab&gt;{{cite book|title=Punjab District Gazetteers: Rawalpindi District (v. 28-A)|date=1907|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODBuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=rawalpindi+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ9KmriMPUAhVO7mMKHTXrApMQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=rawalpindi%20name&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The village is said to have been previously known as ''Manikpur'' or ''Maniknagar'', and was capital of the ancient Hindu ''[[Rakshasa]]s''.&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt; However, archaeological evidence does not support the conclusion that Manikpur was the capital of the ''Rakshasas'',&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt; and that the village's ruins were built during the Buddhist-era.&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt;

==Background==
[[Mankiala Stupa]] is a [[Gandhara]] era stupa built in the nearby village of Tope Mankiala to memorialize the place where, according to legend, [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] sacrificed some of his body parts to feed seven hungry tiger cubs.&lt;ref name="Islamabad Tourist Treasures Pg 1"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:KITLV 87969 - Unknown - Manikyala stupa at Rawalpindi in British India - 1897.tif|thumb|The stupa in 1897.]]
Mankiala dates from the Gandharan era, around 2000 years ago. The village had been previously described as the former grand capital of the mythological ''[[Rakshasa]]s'', though no archaeological evidence supports the theory of Mankiala serving as an ancient Hindu capital, and instead suggests that the area's ruins date from the [[Buddhist]] period.&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt; The settlement during the Buddhist era may have consisted of approximately 2,000 homes, interspersed with monasteries and 15 stupas.&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt; The archaeological site is believed to be on the same hillock where the modern village now stands.&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt; 

Mankiala's stupa was built in the reign of [[Kanishka]] (128-151 CE).&lt;ref name="Islamabad Tourist Treasures Pg 1"/&gt; The ancient settlement is believed to have been destroyed by fire,&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt; though there is no indication that it was purposely destroyed.&lt;ref name=Punjab/&gt; 

[[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], the first British emissary to [[Afghanistan]] chanced upon this stupa in 1808 AD and penned a detailed account in his memoir 'Kingdom of Caubul' (1815). According to an inscription on a stone the stupa was restored in 1891 by a regiment of the [[British Indian Army]]. Raja Usman was architect.

==Relics from stupa==
Mankiala stupa's relic deposits were all removed from the site during British colonial rule, and are all now housed in the [[British Museum]], were found by [[Jean-Baptiste Ventura]] in 1830 between 10 and 20 metres below the top of the dome. They were at one stage owned by the celebrated antiquarian [[James Prinsep]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=251886&amp;partId=1&amp;place=33154&amp;plaA=33154-3-1&amp;page=1 The British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mouth of the stupa has a gaping hole as a result of excavations by relic hunters in the past. It now has a barrier around it for safety reasons.&lt;ref name="Islamabad Tourist Treasures Pg 1"/&gt;

==Transportation ==
===Road===
Mankiala is located along the ''Kallar Syedan'' Road, which connects the city to [[Kallar Syedan]], and the [[N-5 National Highway]] that provides access to [[Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]].

===Rail===
[[Mankiala railway station]] is served by the [[Karachi–Peshawar Railway Line]].

== Etymology ==
The word ''nirvāṇa'', states Steven Collins, is from the verbal root ''vā'' "blow" in the form of past participle ''vāna'' "blown", prefixed with the preverb ''nis'' meaning "out". Hence the original meaning of the word is "blown out, extinguished". [[Sandhi]] changes the sounds: the ''v'' of ''vāna'' causes ''nis'' to become ''nir'', and then the ''r'' of ''nir'' causes [[retroflexion]] of the following ''n'': ''nis+vāna'' &gt; ''nirvāṇa''.{{sfn|Collins|2010|pp=63-64}}

The term ''nirvana'' in the soteriological sense of "blown out, extinguished" state of liberation does not appear in the [[Veda]]s nor in the [[Upanishad]]s. According to Collins, "the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it ''nirvana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, with the concept of soul and Brahman, appears in Vedic texts and Upanishads, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Müller |title=Theosophy Or Psychological Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjiD_XWea7cC |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-07326-4 |pages=307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''moksha'' is connected to the Vedic culture, where it conveyed a notion of ''amrtam'', "immortality",{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=29}}{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=136}} and also a notion of a ''timeless'', "unborn", or "the still point of the turning world of time". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying "the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time".{{refn|group=note|The wheel is a typical Vedic, or Indo-European, symbol, which is manifested in various symbols of the [[Historical vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and of Buddhism and Hinduism. See, for examples, [[Dharmacakra]], [[Chakra]], [[Chakravartin]], [[Kalachakra]], [[Dukkha]] and [[Mandala]].}} The hope for life after death started with notions of going to the worlds of the Fathers or Ancestors and/or the world of the Gods or Heaven.{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Heaven (Christianity)]] and Walhalla}}

The earliest [[Vedas|Vedic texts]] incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Hastings|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=Louis Herbert Gray|title=Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8TAAAAYAAJ |year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T.

Indeed any postulated Self would lead to attachment, for it seems that for the Buddha a Self fitting the description could legitimately be a suitable subject of attachment.

(...) the Buddhist concept of enlightened mind - bodhichitta - refers to a state beyond desire (dukkha) whereby the one who seeks nirvana has achieved shunyata, the emptiness or void described on pages 58-9."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moksha ===
{{main article|Moksha}}
The ancient soteriological concept in Hinduism is moksha, described as the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through self-knowledge and the eternal connection of Atman (soul, self) and metaphysical Brahman. Moksha is derived from the root ''muc*'' ({{lang-sa|मुच्}}) which means free, let go, release, liberate; Moksha means "liberation, freedom, emancipation of the soul".&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0800/mw__0853.html मुच] Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Robert Zimmer|title=Philosophies of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bRQ5fpTmwoAC&amp;pg=PA41|year=1951|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01758-1|page=41|quote=Moksa, from the root muc, "to loose, set free, let go, release, liberate, deliver" [...] means "liberation, escape, freedom, release, rescue, deliverance, final emancipation of the soul.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate ({{lang-sa|मुच्यते}})&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.

The traditions within Hinduism state that there are multiple paths (''marga'') to moksha: ''jnana-marga'', the path of knowledge; ''bhakti-marga'', the path of devotion; and ''karma-marga'', the path of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chad Meister|title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOCT3qFirJMC |year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-14179-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brahma-nirvana in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' ===
The term Brahma-nirvana appears in verses 2.72 and 5.24-26 of the Bhagavad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winthrop Sargeant (Translator)|editor=Christopher Key Chapple|title=The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COuy5CDAqt4C |year=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-1-4384-2840-6 |pages=157, 266–268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the state of release or liberation; the union with the [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="Flood" /&gt; According to Easwaran, it is an experience of blissful egolessness.{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=268}}

According to Zaehner, Johnson and other scholars, ''nirvana'' in the Gita is a Buddhist term adopted by the Hindus.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}} Zaehner states it was used in Hindu texts for the first time in the Bhagavad Gita, and that the idea therein in verse 2.71-72 to "suppress one's desires and ego" is also Buddhist.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}} According to Johnson the term ''nirvana'' is borrowed from the Buddhists to confuse the Buddhists, by linking the Buddhist nirvana state to the pre-Buddhist Vedic tradition of metaphysical absolute called Brahman.{{sfn|Fowler|2012|p=48}}

According to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of ''nirvana'' are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is [[shunyata]], emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|quote=The nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana [oneness with Brahman]|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=2009|title=The Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;– According to Gandhi|author=Mahatma Gandhi|editor=John Strohmeier|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oscar Martinez''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[United States|US]] [[mockumentary]]-style [[television series]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' played by Cuban-American actor [[Oscar Nunez]].&lt;ref name=NYDN&gt;Comedian Oscar Núñez has 9-to-5 fun at 'The Office', LEE HERNÁNDEZ, New York Daily News, April 21, 2008.

Martinez is an [[accountant]] at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], office of the paper distribution company [[Dunder Mifflin]] and gets his first name from Núñez; series producer [[Greg Daniels]] felt that "Oscar" sounded like a good accountant's name.&lt;ref&gt;Our Interview with Oscar from "The Office", Leah Weathersby, August 06, 2009, ''Armchair Commentary.

As a result, in earlier episodes, many co-workers erroneously attribute to him various Mexican stereotypes (e.g. being involved in drug cartels) but after his outing, his stereotypes are more focused on his being gay, particularly by Michael, which may explain their conflicted relationship.&lt;ref name=NYDN/&gt; Núñez explained in a 2008 interview that the character variously feels amusement, pity and hatred towards his fictional boss.&lt;ref name=NYDN/&gt; He has no specific counterpart in the original British series.

==Biography==

Oscar has worked at Dunder Mifflin for over nine years in 2008. He is openly [[Homosexuality|gay]] (after being publicly [[Outing|outed]] by Michael) and previously lived with his partner, Gil. Originally, Oscar was in [[the closet]], and Gil was believed to be his roommate. In earlier seasons, he is seen driving a [[Saturn Ion]].  This is the same Saturn that Angela can later be seen driving, such as in the episode "Niagara".  However, he is seen in the third season driving a [[Lexus RX 400h]], a company car he was lent as a result of his unwanted outing by Michael.

Though Oscar is openly gay in later episodes, in the episode "[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]", when asked by Jim "Who would you do?", Oscar offers the answer, "Pam"; also, in "[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]", he makes an intentionally vague reference to a woman he previously dated.

In a deleted scene from "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]", Oscar explains that he in fact notified Michael of his being gay during his job interview. This caused Michael to laugh repeatedly, and he hired Oscar on the spot because he was "the funniest person that [Michael] had ever met". Oscar then hid his sexuality from his co-workers (until he was outed) for fear of losing his job.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Luis Aldama  Latinos and Narrative Media: Participation and Portrayal 2013 1137361786- Page 16  "There is the Latino accountant, Óscar Martínez, on NBC's The Office (2005–2012), who is outted by his boss, Michael."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 1–2===
In the episode "[[Diversity Day (The Office)|Diversity Day]]", Michael makes an example of Oscar in a diversity training seminar for his being Mexican. Michael annoys Oscar by stating the word "Mexican" might be offensive because it has "certain connotations". In "[[The Alliance (The Office)|The Alliance]]", Oscar goes around the office asking for donations for his nephew's [[walkathon]] for [[cerebral palsy]]. In "[[Basketball (The Office)|Basketball]]", Oscar asks to be on Michael's team; however, Michael assumes he is good at baseball and boxing, but not basketball.&lt;ref&gt;Season 1&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Oscar's favorite pastimes at work is playing a paper football game dubbed "Hateball" (because Angela hates it) with [[Kevin Malone]] whenever Michael isn't around. He keeps a two-year running total of their scores. Oscar enjoys [[ice skating]], likes the office thermostat to be set to a chilly 66 degrees, and dressed up in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] on [[Halloween (The Office)|"Halloween"]]. He has a conflict with [[Angela Martin]] over her poster of babies dressed as [[jazz]] musicians and claims it offends him more than "hardcore pornography." In "[[The Secret (The Office)|The Secret]]," Oscar calls in sick, but Dwight discovers that Oscar spent the day shopping and ice skating with his "roommate" Gil, but Dwight's naivete stops him realizing the truth about Oscar's sexuality, which is here revealed to the viewers, and again indicated in the episode "[[Valentine's Day (The Office)|Valentine's Day]]", when Oscar receives a gift and unconvincingly tells Kevin it is from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Season 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 3–4===
In the first episode of the third season, "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]", Michael obliviously calls Oscar "[[Faggot (epithet)|faggy]]" for preferring the film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' to ''[[Die Hard]]''. Oscar is understandably upset and reports it to corporate. When Michael realizes Oscar is actually gay, he tries to make it up to him and embraces some [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay culture]]. Michael calls a meeting and announces that Oscar is gay in front of the entire staff, much to Oscar's shock and dismay. In the conference room, to show no hard feelings, Michael hugs Oscar then proceeds to try to kiss him. Oscar is both disgusted and horrified by Michael's actions and proclaims it has been "the worst, most backwards day of my life."

To prevent Oscar from suing the company for [[anti-gay discrimination]], the corporate manager, [[Jan Levinson]], gives him a three-month paid vacation to Europe and use of a company car, a silver [[Lexus RX 400h]], replacing his gold [[Saturn Ion]].  After going on his vacation with Gil, Oscar returns briefly in "[[A Benihana Christmas]]," but decides that it is too soon and leaves before anyone notices him. Oscar finally returns to the office in "[[The Return (The Office)|The Return]]" and Michael decides to throw a Mexican themed party for him. Angela, who had acted cold towards him when he came out, apologizes and invites him to be a part of the party planning committee. He is also shown in [[Business School (The Office)|"Business School"]] with his partner Gil at Pam's art show, agreeing with Gil that, although it's her first try, Pam's art lacks courage and honesty, which she overhears.

In "[[Beach Games]]", Michael announces that the winner of his ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''-style game will get his job. In an interview, Oscar states that if Dwight gets the position, he will transfer to [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. He also mentions that he is trying to get out of his relationship with Gil and that he "might [[heterosexuality|try women]] for a while; Angela thinks I can cross over."&lt;ref&gt;Season 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Fun Run]]", Kevin tries to use Oscar to see if Jim and Pam are dating. In a deleted scene, he says that he was raised [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], but now identifies as an [[agnostic]] [[Secular humanism|Secular Humanist]]. In "[[Money (The Office)|Money]]", Oscar helps Michael deal with his financial problems by going over his current finances. Oscar does this after Michael follows through with some bad advice from Creed, who advises Michael to declare bankruptcy will give him a clean financial state. With Pam and Toby, Oscar is a founding member of the Finer Things Club, which he refers to as the "gayest thing" about him "besides [[men who have sex with men|having sex with men]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]", Season 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasons 5–6===
Besides ice skating, Oscar is revealed to have an interest in [[yoga]].  In "[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]", he refers [[Holly Flax|Holly]] to his yoga teacher whom she later dates.  For Halloween, he dresses  as [[Uncle Sam]]. And in [[Business Ethics (The Office)|Business Ethics]], he comes the closest to congratulating Pam and Jim for their engagement, by commenting that he had assumed they were already engaged.

In "[[Business Trip (The Office)|Business Trip]]", he travels to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] with Michael and Andy, with whom he bonds when they drink [[Long Island iced tea]]s.  Drunk, he questions Andy's desire to marry Angela and they [[drunk dial]] her.  In the morning, Oscar has rebuilt his reserve, but does thank Andy for trying to hook him up with two men in the hotel bar the previous night; however, by "[[Lecture Circuit]]", Oscar has returned to being dismissive of Andy and refuses to listen when Andy wants advice on asking out an attractive female customer. Oscar also shows a liking for [[egg salad sandwich]]es.

In "[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]", during Dwight's over-the-top attempt to teach the office employees about fire safety, Oscar and everyone else are locked in the building, while under the impression that there is a fire. Oscar then attempts to escape by climbing into the ceiling, and is at first successful. However, his legs eventually fall through. Later, during a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] held by Michael, Oscar severely roasts Michael, yelling at him in Spanish with the intent to make him cry (his comments, in English, amount to Oscar screaming that he can't believe has to drive for hours every day to work for someone like Michael) which succeeds after Oscar and the branch humiliate Michael. Oscar later regrets it and apologizes to Michael. Michael accepts the apology, but not without roasting Oscar by pointing out "You're gay", which Oscar seems to accept.

Oscar also finds himself at odds with Pam during "[[The Surplus]]" when he reveals a $4,300 budget surplus to Michael that he suggests could be used to purchase a new copier. Jim sides with him over the issue and they take Michael out to lunch to further their agenda. But Oscar finally concedes to Pam and agrees to buying new chairs like she wanted, ruining Michael's plans to keep 15% of the surplus for himself when the sides remained deadlocked past a deadline for using the entire amount.

In "[[Blood Drive (The Office)|Blood Drive]]," Oscar opens up during Michael's "Lonely Hearts Party" at the office about being rejected by a man who claimed not to be gay, but was later spotted on a date at a gay nightclub in Kansas City. Along with the staff, a sympathetic Oscar walks out with Michael after the holiday party is over, showing he can empathize with anyone.

Oscar wears sandals without socks in the office on "[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]", which disgusts Angela and she objects to it. Oscar however, refuses to back down on Toby's request that he wear socks.

During the [[Company Picnic|company picnic]] when Meredith suggests forfeiting their volleyball game against corporate, an insightful Oscar points out that they need to go through with it, saying "Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked." after upper management decides to shut down the Buffalo branch after corporate hid the news.&lt;ref&gt;Season 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode "[[Gossip (The Office)|Gossip]]", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, he tells everyone that Oscar is the voice of the [[Taco Bell dog]]. Oscar also helps Andy cope when a rumor is spread that he is gay. In "[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]", Michael calls Oscar to his office to seek advice about his upcoming [[colonoscopy]] due to Michael thinking that it's going to be a lot like [[anal intercourse]] and feels Oscar would be well versed in that field, this makes Oscar visibly uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Season 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]", Pam's sister mistakes [[Kevin Malone|Kevin]] as Gil, Oscar's boyfriend, which greatly offends Oscar; Kevin is in turn insulted, telling Oscar that "he would be honored to be his boyfriend". In "[[Mafia (The Office)|Mafia]]", Oscar's psyche begins to crumble when Jim and Pam go on their honeymoon (they help maintain the "Coalition for Reason" in the office) and Michael, Dwight, Andy and Ryan began to believe that an [[Italian-American]] insurance salesman is in the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]. So much so that, much to their anger, he calls them on their honeymoon in desperate need to talk to someone normal. He is further annoyed when Kevin, fearing that he [Kevin] will go to jail for committing [[identity theft]] against Jim, suggests that Oscar, being a homosexual, would "love" prison (because of the occurrence of male on male [[prison rape]] ).

In "[[Murder (The Office)|Murder]]", Oscar does not take part in Michael's murder mystery game, preferring to keep working and keeping tabs on what's going on with Dunder-Mifflin in the wake of bankruptcy rumors. He hears that Corporate has ordered Accounting to stop payments to vendors and tries to interrupt the game to tell Michael, only to have Michael stay in character rather than allow the game to be disrupted. He tries to deliver the news in as someone who would inhabit the game's world but can't figure out a way to do so and just says it plainly. In [[Shareholder Meeting]], he visits the company conference with Michael due to his annoyance at how poorly and inefficiently the company is being run, but refuses the chance to tell the board what he really thinks.

In "[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]", Pam tries to play matchmaker, introducing the newly-single Oscar to the new gay warehouse worker Matt (played by [[Sam Daly]]). Oscar dismisses a nosy Pam and doesn't correct Matt when he calls him by the wrong name, Victor.  Later, he acts aloof and calls Matt by the wrong name.

In a deleted scene from "[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]", Michael acts surprised when he is told it was Oscar who came up with the idea to go out, not aware Oscar set up the happy hour plan so he could get to spend more time with Matt in a social setting. When Oscar asks why Michael is so surprised, Kevin responds by telling Oscar that he's [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] and a [[snob]]; a claim which Oscar then justifies by stating he hates the [[Philadelphia Opera]]. In the aired episode, Daryl initially picks up Oscar's interest in Matt, telling Oscar "You can be gay with him--just be straight with me", and later Daryl bluntly says that Matt is a dummy and not worth Oscar's time, before he watches with bemusement as Oscar quickly runs off when Matt invites him to play an arcade basketball game.

===Seasons 7–8===
In "[[Costume Contest]]", Oscar points out that the contest's coveted prize, a coupon catalog, only provides the thousands of dollars of savings promised if the person buys a lot of things they do not really need. He then puts on a bland "rational consumer" outfit to mock the contest, but is stunned to learn that he won (mainly because Kelly and others voted for him out of surety he would lose), Ryan wanted to shake things up a la his support for [[Ralph Nader]], and Creed says it was "the best [[Edward James Olmos]] costume I've ever seen".

In "[[China (The Office)|China]]", Oscar's know-it-all tendencies come to the fore when he is wrong about a fact related to urban population centers in China—and Michael was right about it. Oscar then wants to have Michael meet him for coffee, which Jim recognizes is a way for "Mr. Actually" (Oscar) to get to have the last word and show Michael up on the facts about China. However, while Oscar does make some points Michael can't rebut, Michael still wins over a number of watching co-workers when he makes an emotional argument about the U.S. and China that Oscar isn't able to counter.

In "[[Classy Christmas]]", Oscar, who was already annoyed at Angela for constantly talking about her State Senator boyfriend, meets him and immediately says in an interview that "he's gay". Later on at the party, Ryan walks away from their group to make a drink, and the Senator clearly watches Ryan's backside as he leaves. Oscar notices this and turns the camera with a shocked expression.

In "[[The Seminar]]", Oscar and Pam help Erin when she plays a scrabble game against Gabe on her phone so that she can pick the movie she wants to watch with him (''[[Wall-E]]''). Before Oscar can type in the final word, Pam suggests that Erin should be the one to do it. Oscar reluctantly gives her the phone and hints that she should type the word "apoplexy". Erin ends up typing "ape", and Oscar is left frustrated.

In "[[PDA (The Office)|PDA]]", Oscar strongly disapproves of Michael and Holly's public displays of affection. Later on, after the two announce that they are moving in together, Oscar comes around and tells them to kiss. The kiss causes Kevin to say, "Suck on that, Oscar", and Oscar frustratedly points out that he was the one who told them to kiss. In "[[Garage Sale (The Office)|Garage Sale]]", Oscar tries to sell a vast collection of ''Will and Grace'' memorabilia he has gathered over the years due to people mistakingly thinking he's a fan of the show. He is also part of the group that helps Michael think of a good way to propose to Holly.

In "[[Michael's Last Dundies]]", Oscar laughs at Michael's portrayal of Angela in the opening video of the award show. He tells the camera (when referring to the movie) "the analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content". Later, he has a brief solo in the employees' [[a cappella]] version of "[[Seasons of Love]]" (with altered lyrics) that they sing to Michael (who is soon departing). In it, he sings that he forgives Michael for kissing him (which previously happened in the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|third season]] premiere episode "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]").

In "[[Goodbye, Michael]]", Michael gives Oscar a miniature scarecrow figurine that he clearly made on his own, to symbolize the "[[brain]]" that Oscar gave to Michael, just like in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. In an interview, it was clearly intended as a joke on Michael's part, but Oscar accepts it as a serious gift. Oscar listens in as Angela shows off pictures of her and her boyfriend together, shaking his head at the fact the pictures hint heavily at the boyfriend being gay but Angela continues not to see it. In the extended version of the episode, Oscar says in a talking-head interview that Michael once asked him if "gay guys squeeze each other's boobs", and gives a little laugh while citing that he will never forget that.

In "[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]", Dwight makes everybody recite the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]]. The camera focuses on Oscar during [[Criticism of the Pledge of Allegiance|the phrase "under God" which he does not say]].

Oscar finds himself on the "winners" side of new boss [[Robert California]]'s ([[James Spader]]) "[[The List (The Office)|List]]". Along with Jim, Oscar appears visibly uncomfortable when he finds this out.

During "[[The Incentive]]", Andy manages to rouse the staff into doubling sales by promising to get a tattoo of their choice, on Andy's buttocks. With the rest of the staff, Oscar joins in on the bet and is witness to Andy's tattoo at the shop.

In "[[Garden Party (The Office)|Garden Party]]", Oscar, along with other staff, listens to Andy's father verbally browbeat his son on Jim and Pam's baby monitor. With Darryl, they cheer Andy up with a barbecue. The two later confide in a talking head interview that they understand why Andy has a need to prove himself to everyone.

===Season 9===

In "[[New Guys]]", Angela pleads with Oscar to adopt her cat, Comstock, to which Oscar refuses and insists he's a dog person.  But when he learns that the cat is a favorite of her husband's, Oscar changes his mind and adopts Comstock. It's later implied that Oscar is having an affair with Robert, judging by a secretive phone call he makes to let him know of adopting Comstock.  In "[[The Boat (The Office)|The Boat]]", the affair is confirmed after the cameras catch Oscar kissing Robert. When Oscar sees that Kevin saw them, he goes to great lengths to ensure that Kevin keeps the secret, which he does.

In "[[The Whale (The Office)|The Whale]]", Angela confides to Oscar that she suspects Robert is cheating on her and they follow Robert to his gym. When Angela sees Robert making a call, after asking "who is he calling," and Oscar's phone begins to ring, she finally suspects that Oscar may be the one having an affair with Robert. In "[[The Target (The Office)|The Target]]", Angela seeks revenge on Oscar and hires a hitman to attack him but is talked out of it by Dwight. Oscar allows her to kick him in the shin instead. In "[[Vandalism (The Office)|Vandalism]]", Oscar and Angela compete uncomfortably for the affections of Robert at Angela's son's birthday party, but Oscar later suspects that Robert may have invited him only to boost Latino representation for his political campaign. Later, Oscar and Angela reconcile after he invites her to move in with him when she and Robert break up and she is evicted from her apartment.

In "[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]", one year after the airing of the documentary, Oscar is revealed to be running for [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] (it is possible, but not explicitly stated, that Robert's re-election bid failed after he was outed by the documentary, meaning Oscar may be running for Robert's old seat) and he is the godfather of Angela and Dwight's son. Oscar also brings some of his old condescension to events around Dwight's wedding; at the dinner for Dwight and his old friends, when he learns that Andy has gotten a job at Cornell's Office of Admissions he assumes that it is volunteer work or an internship, leading Andy to somewhat annoyedly say that the job is a full-time paid position.

'''Oscar Devereaux Micheaux''' ({{IPAc-en|US|audio=En-us-Oscar-Micheaux.ogg|m|ɪ|ˈ|ʃ|oʊ}}; January 2, 1884 – March 25, 1951) was an [[African-American]] author, film director and independent producer of more than 44 films. Although the short-lived [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company]] was the first movie company owned and controlled by black filmmakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=The Lincoln Motion Picture Company a First for Black Cinema| url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/lincoln-motion-picture-company-first-black-cinema | work=African American Registry | date=May 24, 2005 | accessdate=February 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheaux is regarded as the first major African-American feature filmmaker, a prominent producer of [[race film]], and has been described as "the most successful African-American filmmaker of the first half of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eg4ozQZoEbUC&amp;pg=PA53|first=Dan|last=Moos|title=Outside America: Race, Ethnicity, and the Role of the American West in National Belonging|publisher=University Press of New England|year=2005|page=53|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced both [[silent films]] and sound films when the industry changed to incorporate speaking actors.

==Early life and education==
Micheaux was born on a farm in [[Metropolis, Illinois]], on January 2, 1884.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CzdfLgAACAAJ&amp;dq Betti Carol VanEpps-Taylor, ''Oscar Micheaux – A Biography: Dakota Homesteader, Author, Pioneer Film Maker''], Dakota West, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fifth child born to Calvin S. and Belle Michaux&lt;!--do not alter to "Micheaux" or the following sentence makes no sense--&gt;, who had a total of 13 children. In his later years, Micheaux added an "e" to his last name. His father was born a slave in [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Because of its surname, his father's family appears to have been associated with French-descended settlers. [[French Huguenot]] refugees had settled in Virginia in 1700; their descendants took slaves west when they migrated into Kentucky after the [[American Revolutionary War]].

In his later years, Micheaux wrote about the social oppression he experienced as a young boy. His parents moved to the city so that the children could receive a better education. Micheaux attended a well-established school for several years before the family eventually ran into money troubles and were forced to return to the farm. The discontented Micheaux became rebellious and his struggles caused problems within his family. His father was not happy with him and sent him away to do marketing in the city. Micheaux found pleasure in this job because he was able to speak to many new people and learned social skills that he would later reflect in his films.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

When Micheaux was 17 years old, he moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to live with his older brother, then working as a waiter. Micheaux became dissatisfied with what he viewed as his brother’s way of living "the good life". He rented his own place and found work in the [[Union Stock Yards|stockyards]], which he found difficult.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; He moved from the stockyards to the steel mills, holding down many different jobs.

After being "swindled out of two dollars" by an employment agency, Micheaux decided to become his own boss. His first business was a shoeshine stand, which he set up at a wealthy African American barbershop, away from Chicago competition. He learned the basic strategies of business and started to save money. He became a [[Pullman porter]] on the major railroads,&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; at that time considered prestigious employment for African Americans because it was relatively stable, well paid, and secure, and it enabled travel and interaction with new people. This job was an informal education for Micheaux. He profited financially, and also gained contacts and knowledge about the world through traveling as well as a greater understanding for business. When he left the position, he had seen much of the United States, had a couple of thousand dollars saved in his bank account, and had made a number of connections with wealthy white people who helped his future endeavors.

Micheaux moved to [[Gregory County, South Dakota]],&lt;ref&gt;https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx?accession=126762&amp;docClass=SER&amp;sid=u2rxduzi.xqi&lt;/ref&gt; where he bought land and worked as a [[Homestead Act|homesteader]].&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; This experience inspired his first novels and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/oscar-micheaux-9407584|title="Oscar Micheaux biography", Bio|work=biography.com|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His neighbors on the frontier were predominately blue collar whites. "Some recall that [Micheaux] rarely sat at a table with his blue collar white neighbors." Micheaux’s years as a homesteader allowed him to learn more about human relations and farming. While farming, Micheaux wrote articles and submitted them to the press. ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' published one of his earliest articles.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In South Dakota, Micheaux married Orlean McCracken. Her family proved to be complex and burdensome for Micheaux. Unhappy with their living arrangements, Orlean felt that Micheaux did not pay enough attention to her. She gave birth while he was away on business, and was reported to have emptied their bank accounts and fled.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Orlean’s father sold Micheaux's property and took the money from the sale. After his return, Micheaux tried unsuccessfully to get Orlean and his property back.

==Writing and film career==
[[File:Oscar Micheaux 1919 newspaperad.jpg|thumb|Oscar Micheaux in 1919.]]
Micheaux decided to concentrate on writing and, eventually, filmmaking, a new industry. He wrote seven novels.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; In 1913, 1,000 copies of his first book, ''The Conquest: The Story of a Negro Homesteader'', were printed.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; He published the book anonymously, for unknown reasons. Based on his experiences as a homesteader and the failure of his first marriage, it was largely autobiographical. Although character names have been changed, the [[protagonist]] is named Oscar Devereaux. His theme was about African Americans realizing their potential and succeeding in areas where they had not felt they could. The book outlines the difference between city lifestyles of Negroes and the life he decided to lead as a lone Negro out on the far West as a pioneer. He discusses the culture of doers who want to accomplish and those who see themselves as victims of injustice and hopelessness and who do not want to try to succeed, but instead like to pretend to be successful while living the city lifestyle in poverty. He had become frustrated with getting some members of his race to populate the frontier and make something of themselves, with real work and property investment. He wrote over 100 letters to fellow Negroes in the East beckoning them to come West, but only his older brother eventually took his advice. One of Micheaux's fundamental beliefs was that hard work and enterprise would make any person rise to respect and prominence no matter his or her race.

In 1918, his novel ''The Homesteader'', dedicated to [[Booker T. Washington]], attracted the attention of [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company#History|George Johnson]], the manager of the [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company]] in [[Los Angeles]]. After Johnson offered to make ''The Homesteader'' into a new feature film, negotiations and paperwork became inharmonious.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Micheaux wanted to be directly involved in the adaptation of his book as a movie, but Johnson resisted and never produced the film.

Instead, Micheaux founded the Micheaux Film &amp; Book Company of [[Sioux City]] in [[Chicago]]; its first project was the production of ''The Homesteader'' as a feature film. Micheaux had a major career as a film producer and director: He produced over 40 films, which drew audiences throughout the U.S. as well as internationally.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Micheaux contacted wealthy academic connections from his earlier career as a porter, and sold stock for his company at $75 to $100 a share.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Micheaux hired actors and actresses and decided to have the premiere in Chicago. The film and Micheaux received high praise from film critics. One article credited Micheaux with “a historic breakthrough, a creditable, dignified achievement”.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Some members of the Chicago clergy criticized the film as [[libel]]ous. ''The Homesteader'' became known as Micheaux’s breakout film; it helped him become widely known as a writer and a filmmaker.

In addition to writing and directing his own films, Micheaux also adapted the works of different writers for his [[silent pictures]]. Many of his films were open, blunt and thought-provoking regarding certain racial issues of that time. He once commented: "It is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state, that we can raise our people to greater heights."&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; Financial hardships during the [[Great Depression]] eventually made it impossible for Micheaux to keep producing films, and he returned to writing.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

==Significant films==
Micheaux’s first novel ''The Conquest'' was adapted to film and re-titled ''The Homesteader''.&lt;ref name="Lupack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjO7_Ju7lWUC|title=Literary Adaptations in Black American Cinema|work=google.com|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film, which met with critical and commercial success, was released in 1919. It revolves around a man named Jean Baptiste, called the Homesteader, who falls in love with many white women but resists marrying one out of his loyalty to his race. Baptiste sacrifices love to be a key symbol for his fellow African Americans. He looks for love among his own people and marries an African-American woman. Relations between them deteriorate. Eventually, Baptiste is not allowed to see his wife. She kills her father for keeping them apart and commits [[suicide]]. Baptiste is accused of the crime, but is ultimately cleared. An old love helps him through his troubles. After he learns that she is a [[mulatto]] and thus part African, they marry. This film deals extensively with race relationships.

Micheaux’s second silent film was ''[[Within Our Gates]]'', produced in 1920.&lt;ref name="Lupack" /&gt; Although sometimes considered his response to the film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', Micheaux said that he created it independently as a response to the widespread social instability following [[World War I]]. ''Within Our Gates'' revolved around the main character, Sylvia Landry, a [[mixed-race]] school teacher. In a flashback, Sylvia is shown growing up as the adopted daughter of a [[sharecropper]]. When her father confronts their white landlord over money, a fight ensues. The landlord is shot by another white man, but Sylvia's adoptive father is accused and lynched with her adoptive mother.

Sylvia is almost raped by the landowner’s brother but discovers that he is her biological father. Micheaux always depicts African Americans as being serious and reaching for higher education. Before the flashback scene, we see that Sylvia travels to Boston, seeking funding for her school, which serves black children. They are underserved by the segregated society. On her journey, she is hit by the car of a rich white woman. Learning about Landry's cause, the woman decides to give her school $50,000.

In the film, Micheaux depicts educated and professional people in black society as light-skinned, representing the elite status of some of the mixed-race people who comprised the majority of African Americans free before the Civil War. Poor people are represented as dark-skinned and with more undiluted African ancestry. Mixed-race people also feature as some of the villains. The film is set within the [[Jim Crow era]]. It contrasted the experiences for African Americans who stayed in rural areas and others who had migrated to cities and become urbanized. Micheaux explored the suffering of African Americans in the present day, without explaining how the situation arose in history. Some feared that this film would cause even more unrest within society, and others believed it would open the public’s eyes to the unjust treatment by whites of blacks.&lt;ref name="Lupack" /&gt; Protests against the film continued until the day it was released.&lt;ref name="Lupack" /&gt; Because of its controversial status, the film was banned from some theaters.&lt;ref name="Lupack" /&gt;

Micheaux adapted two works by [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], which he released under their original titles: ''[[The Conjure Woman (film)|The Conjure Woman]]'' (1926) and ''[[The House Behind the Cedars]]'' (1927). The latter, which dealt with issues of [[mixed race]] and [[passing (sociology)|passing]], created so much controversy when reviewed by the Film Board of Virginia that he was forced to make cuts to have it shown. He remade this story as a sound film in 1932, releasing it with the title ''[[Veiled Aristocrats]]''. The silent version of the film is believed to have been lost.

==Themes==
Micheaux's films were made during a time of great change in the African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.albany.edu/jmmh/vol3/micheaux/micheaux.html|title = The Journal for MultiMedia History Volume 3~ 2000|date = 2000|accessdate = November 15, 2014|website = Homestead to Lynch Mob: Portrayals of Black Masculinity|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His films featured contemporary black life. He dealt with racial relationships between blacks and whites, and the challenges for blacks when trying to achieve success in the larger society. His films were used to oppose and discuss the racial injustice that African Americans received. Topics such as lynching, job discrimination, rape, mob violence, and economic exploitation were depicted in his films.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These films also reflect his ideologies and autobiographical experiences. The journalist Richard Gehr said, "Micheaux appears to have only one story to tell, his own, and he tells it repeatedly."&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

Micheaux sought to create films that would counter white portrayals of African Americans, which tended to emphasize inferior stereotypes. He created complex characters of different classes. His films questioned the value system of both African-American and white communities as well as caused problems with the press and state censors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Style==
The critic Lupack described Micheaux as pursuing moderation with his films and creating a "middle-class cinema".&lt;ref name="Lupack" /&gt; His works were designed to appeal to both middle- and lower-class audiences.

Micheaux said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"My results…might have been narrow at times, due perhaps to certain limited situations, which I endeavored to portray, but in those limited situations, the truth was the predominate characteristic. It is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state, that we can raise our people to greater heights. I am too imbued with the spirit of [[Booker T. Washington]] to engraft false virtues upon ourselves, to make ourselves that which we are not."&lt;ref name="Lupack" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote getto
&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4777">[[Image:Pacific Conference of Churches logo.gif|thumb|Border|right|text-top|alt=PCC logo|The logo of the PCC.]]The '''Pacific Conference of Churches (PCC)''' is an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] organization representing [[Christian]] churches in the [[Pacific Islands|Pacific]] region. It seeks the visible unity of the church on issues of justice, peace and integrity of creation, initiatives on capacity building, and solidarity with its members during times of natural disasters and internal social upheavals.

== History ==
The roots of the Pacific Conference of Churches can be traced to a 1961 consultation held at [[Malua]] Theological Seminary in [[Samoa]], followed by its founding in 1966 when its first assembly met on the [[Loyalty Islands|Loyalty Island]] of [[Lifou Island|Lifou]], [[New Caledonia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/pacific/pcc|title=Pacific Conference of Churches|last=|first=|date=|website=World Council of Churches|language=en|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first chairman was the [[Tonga|Tongan]] [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Sione 'Amanaki Havea]], serving from 1966 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wcc-coe.org/wcc/who/obits.html|title=2000: The year in review: Obituaries|last=|first=|date=|website=World Council of Churches|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From very modest beginnings in the early 1960s, its membership is now numbered at about 27 Pacific member Churches and 11 National Council of Churches (NCCs). The head office of the Pacific Conference of Churches is based in [[Suva]], [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Programmes ==

At their meeting in [[Pago Pago]], [[American Samoa]], in 2007, the ninth General Assembly of the Pacific Conference of Churches agreed on six main programmes to focus on.
# [[Ecumenism]] in the Pacific
# [[Human Rights]]
# Good Governance and Leadership
# Environment and [[Climate Change]]
# [[HIV]] / [[AIDS]]
# [[Globalization]] and Trade

Furthermore, there are two sectoral programmes specifying on certain target groups.
# Women Development
# Youth Empowerment

== Vision ==

PCC is “a fellowship of Churches and Church organisations […] that seeks to fulfill together their common calling to the Glory of One God – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit” (PCC Constitution Part 4).

In essence, PCC strives toward a vision of a Pacific region that is characterized by the values of unity, solidarity, justice, peace, dialogue and leadership after the heart and mind of Jesus, and a spirituality that gives grounding and substance to PCC’s existence and to the work it does.

== Mission ==

Recognising PCC's Aims as stipulated in its Constitution (Part 5), its mission is to:
# Encourage and promote a spirit of ecumenism among the Churches in the Pacific.
# Encourage and support member Churches to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in studying and working towards the full visible unity of the one undivided Church.
# Help members evaluate their work in mission and to help them co-ordinate, organize and plan together so that wherever possible their personnel, finance and material resources can be more effectively utilized in joint action for mission. 
# Encourage and promote among members a greater awareness of justice, peace, integrity of creation and human development among the people and nations of the Pacific region and the world. 
# Facilitate mutual consultation on issues affecting Church relationship and other issues of common concern among the members. 
# Encourage and promote active participation by members in the wider ecumenical movement. 
# Be a means whereby the Churches of the Pacific can help each other and help Churches and other organizations in other parts of the world in times of natural disaster and special need, or to secure help from the Churches in the other parts of the world in times of similar natural disaster or need. 
# Encourage and promote programmes and disseminate information for the preaching and spreading of the Word of God. 
# Undertake such co-operative activities and programmes on behalf of members as the Assembly may from time to time approve. 
# Encourage and promote inter-faith dialogue.

'''Religion in New Zealand''' encompasses a wide range of groups and beliefs. [[Christianity in New Zealand|Christianity]] is the most common religion with almost half (48 percent) of the population at the [[2013 New Zealand census]] declaring an affiliation.&lt;ref name="QUICKSTATS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/religion.aspx|accessdate=24 August 2017|title=2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity – Religious affiliation|date=15 April 2014|publisher=Stats NZ – stats.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around six percent of the population affiliated with non-Christian religions, with [[Hinduism in New Zealand|Hinduism]] being the largest at over two percent, while 42 percent of New Zealanders stated they had no religion in the most recent census and 4 percent made no declaration.

New Zealand has no [[state religion]] or [[established church]], although Anglicanism is required to be the religion of the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Monarch of New Zealand]] (who is described as "Defender of ''The'' Faith"). [[Freedom of religion]] has been protected since the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref name="established"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/hrc_new/hrc/cms/files/documents/25-May-2007_08-24-50_NSRD_booklet.pdf|title=Religious Diversity in New Zealand - Statement on Religious Diversity|publisher=New Zealand Human Rights Commission and Victoria University|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[History of New Zealand|European colonisation]] the religion of the indigenous Māori population was [[Māori religion|animistic]], but the subsequent efforts of [[missionaries]] such as [[Samuel Marsden]] resulted in most Māori converting to Christianity. The majority of 19th-century European migrants came from the British Isles, establishing the three dominant denominations in New Zealand – [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia|Anglicanism]], [[Catholic Church in New Zealand|Catholicism]] and [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand|Presbyterianism]]. The tendency for Scottish migrants to settle in [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] saw Presbyterianism predominate in these regions while Anglicanism predominated elsewhere; the effect of this is still seen in religious affiliation statistics today. While 47.5 percent of New Zealanders affiliate with Christianity, regular [[church attendance]] is probably closer to 15%.&lt;ref name="bibleengagement"&gt;{{cite book | last = Opie | first = Stephen | title = Bible Engagement in New Zealand: Survey of Attitudes and Behaviour | pages = 4 | publisher=Bible Society of New Zealand | date = June 2008 | url =http://biblesociety.org.nz/mediafiles/bible-society-research-2008.pdf | id = | accessdate =29 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526105617/http://biblesociety.org.nz/mediafiles/bible-society-research-2008.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people affiliated with Christianity has declined since the 1990s, and those stating that they have [[Irreligion in New Zealand|no religion]] have increased. With increased immigration to New Zealand, especially from Asia, the number of people affiliating with non-Christian religions has also increased.

The first Christian services conducted in New Zealand were carried out by Father [[Paul-Antoine Léonard de Villefeix]], the Dominican chaplain on the ship ''Saint Jean Baptiste'' commanded by the French navigator and explorer [[Jean-François-Marie de Surville]]. Villefeix was the first Christian minister to set foot in New Zealand, and he celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] near Whatuwhiwhi in [[Doubtless Bay]] on Christmas Day in 1769. He is reported to have also led prayers for the sick the previous day and to have conducted Christian burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King |first=Michael|title=''The Penguin History of New Zealand'' |year= 2003 |publisher=Penguin|accessdate=19 January 2011 |location=Auckland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first_service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Marsden's first service|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/samuel-marsdens-first-service|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=21 August 2017|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--See both 'first services' noted in source--&gt;

Though in Britain the [[Anglican]] Church was an established [[State religion|state church]], by the middle of the 19th century even the Anglicans themselves sometimes doubted this arrangement, while the other major denominations of the new colony (Presbyterians, Methodist and Catholics, for example) obviously preferred that the local set up allowed for all their groups.&lt;ref name="NZHA70"&gt;''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' (1997) McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, Plate 70&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first recorded communal Jewish service in New Zealand was held on 7 January 1843 in Wellington, although individual Jews were amongst earlier explorers and settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wjcc.nz/about-us/|title=About us|date=2014-11-04|work=Wellington Jewish Community Centre|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waves of new immigrants brought their particular (usually Christian) faiths with them. Initial denominational distribution very much reflected the fact that local immigrant communities started small and often came from comparatively small regions in the origin countries in Great Britain. As a result, by the time of the 1921 census, no uniform distribution existed amongst non-Māori Christians, with Presbyterians as the dominant group in [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]], Anglicans in the [[Far North District|Far North]], the [[Gisborne region|East Cape]] and various other areas including [[Banks Peninsula]], while Methodists flourished mainly in [[Taranaki]] and the [[Manawatu District|Manawatu]]. Catholicism meanwhile was the dominant religion on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] with its many mining concerns, and in [[Central Otago]].&lt;ref name="NZHA70"/&gt; The [[Catholic Church in New Zealand|Catholic Church]], while not particularly dominant in terms of pure numbers, became especially known throughout the country in the early and middle 20th century for its strong stance on education, establishing large numbers of schools.&lt;ref name="NZHA70"/&gt;

Beginning in the mid-1960s church membership and attendance declined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stenhouse|first1=John|title=Religion and society - Towards a more secular society, 1970–21st century|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/religion-and-society/page-8|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 42% of the population said they had no religion.&lt;ref name="culture_tables"/&gt; However, immigration since 1991 has seen the growth of new religions such as [[Hinduism in New Zealand|Hinduism]], Buddhism and [[Sikhism in New Zealand|Sikhism]] growing rapidly. However, a large portion of the growth of these religions has occurred in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10837744&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Religious affiliation in New Zealand 1991-2013 - bar chart.svg|thumb|right|300px|Religious affiliations of New Zealanders in the last five censuses.]]
[[File:2013 NZ census people stating no religion by sex.gif|thumb|right|[[Irreligion in New Zealand]] is highest among males and younger generations; with the exception of the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of New Zealanders under 35 are irreligious.]]

=== Religious affiliation ===
[[New Zealand census]]es have collected data on religious affiliation since 1851.
[[Statistics New Zealand]] state that:
{{quote|Religious affiliation is a variable of strong interest to religious organisations, social scientists, and can be used as an explanatory variable in studies on topics such as marriage formation and dissolution, fertility and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Religious Affiliation | work = Statistics NZ Home &gt; Methods and services &gt; Surveys and methods &gt; Classifications and standards &gt; Classifications and related statistical standards &gt; | publisher = Statistics New Zealand (www.stats.govt.nz) | url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods_and_services/surveys-and-methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/religious-affiliation.aspx | accessdate = 29 May 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100526194354/http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods_and_services/surveys-and-methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/religious-affiliation.aspx | archive-date = 26 May 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One complication in interpreting religious affiliation data in New Zealand is the large proportion who object to answering the question, roughly 173,000 respondents in 2013. Most reporting of percentages is based on the total number of responses, rather than the total population.&lt;ref name="2006quick"/&gt;

In the early 20th century New Zealand census data indicates that the vast majority of New Zealanders affiliated with Christianity. The total percentages in the 1921 non-Māori census were: 45% Anglicans, 19.9% Presbyterians, 13.6% Catholics, 9.5% Methodists and 11.2% Others. Statistics for Māori became available only from 1936, with 35.8% Anglicans, 19.9% Ratana, 13.9% Catholics, 7.2% Ringatu, 7.1% Methodists, 6.5% Latter Day Saints, 1.3% Methodists and 8.3% Others recorded at this census.&lt;ref name="NZHA70"/&gt;

The population increased 7.8% between the 2006 and 2001 census. The most notable trend in religion over that time is the 26.2% increase in the number of people indicating [[Irreligion|no religion]].

==== Religious affiliation statistics ====
The table below is based on religious affiliation data recorded at the last three censuses for usually resident people. Note that figures and percentages may not add to 100 percent as it is possible for people to state more than one religion.&lt;ref name="culture_tables"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/tables.xls |title= 2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity – tables |publisher= [[Statistics New Zealand]] |date= 15 April 2014 |accessdate= 18 July 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140524102811/http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/tables.xls |archivedate= 24 May 2014 |df= dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note also that the trend indicators are based on the change in percentage of the population, not the number of adherents.

Mirroring contemporary [[Immigration to New Zealand| trends in immigration to New Zealand]], immigrant religions increased fastest between the 2006 and 2013 censuses; [[Sikh]] by 102% to 19,191, [[Hindu]] by 39% to 89,319, Islam by 28% to 46,149, and [[Buddhist]] by 11% to 58,404. [[Hinduism]] emerged as the second-largest religious group in [[New Zealand]] after [[Christianity]] in the 2006 census. 

Mainstream [[Christian denomination]]s, while still representing the largest categories of census-categorised religious affiliation, have not kept pace with population increases. While New Zealand's total population increased from 4,027,947 in 2006 to 4,242,048 in 2013,{{Citation needed|date= July 2015}} [[Anglican]] numbers fell by 95,154 to 459,771 (11.79% of the overall population) over the same period, and [[Presbyterian]] adherents decreased by 69,936 to 330,903 (8.47%). [[Catholic Church| Catholic]] numbers decreased by 16,053 to 492,384 (12.61%). The only other religious groups above 100,000 members are "Christian (not further defined)" and [[Methodist]]. Compare this with numbers in 1901, when 42% of people identified with the Anglican denomination, 23% with Presbyterianism, and 14% with Catholicism.{{Citation needed|date= May 2010}} At that time 1 in 30 people did not identify with any religion - compared with 1 in 3 {{as of | 2013 | lc = on}}.

Of the major ethnic groups in New Zealand, people belonging to European and Māori ethnicities were the most likely to be irreligious, with 46.9 percent and 46.3 percent stating so in the 2013 census. Those belonging to Pacific and Middle Eastern/Latin American/African were least likely to be irreligious at 17.5 percent and 17.0 percent respectively.&lt;ref name="2013commentary"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/religion.aspx | title= 2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity -- Religious affiliation | publisher= Statistics New Zealand | date= 15 April 2014 | accessdate= 25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Massey University]] conducted an [[International Social Survey Programme]] survey in New Zealand. Around one thousand New Zealanders above the age of 18 sent mail responses to questions on religious belief and practice. Results indicated that 27% of the population strongly believed in God, 45% believed in God or a higher power at least some of the time or to some extent, 15% were agnostic, and 13% were [[atheist]] (with a 3% margin of error).&lt;ref&gt;

===Regional trends===
[[File:NZ Religious denominations by TA 2013.svg|thumb|right|300px|Dominant Christian denominations in each territorial authority, 2013 census.&lt;br /&gt;Chatham Islands is tied largest between Anglicans and Catholics.]]
Immigration and settlement trends have created religious differences between the regions of New Zealand. The 19th-century settlement of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrants in Otago and Southland is still reflected today in the dominance of Presbyterianism in the lower South Island. The English mainly settled in the North Island and Upper South Island, reflecting the dominance of Anglicanism in these areas.

In the 2013 census, two of [[Regions of New Zealand|New Zealand's sixteen regions]] had a Christian majority: [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] (51.9 percent) and [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] (50.5 percent) and two regions had a non-religious majority: [[Tasman Region|Tasman]] (51.4 percent) and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] (51.0 percent).&lt;ref name="culture_tables" /&gt;

===Jedi census phenomenon===
Encouraged by an informal email campaign, over 53,000 people listed themselves as [[Jedi]] in New Zealand's 2001 census (over 1.5% of responses). If the Jedi response had been accepted as valid it would have been the largest non-Christian religion in New Zealand, and second-largest religion overall. However, [[Statistics New Zealand]] treated Jedi responses as "Answer understood, but will not be counted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?ObjectID=2352142| title=Jedi Order lures 53,000 disciples|work=The New Zealand Herald| date=31 August 2002| first=Alan| last=Perrott| accessdate=5 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Dunedin]] (a university town) had the highest population of reported Jedi per capita{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christianity in New Zealand}}
After the arrival of large numbers of European immigrants (most of whom were British), Māori enthusiastically adopted Christianity in the early 19th century, and to this day, Christian prayer ([[karakia]]) is the expected way to begin and end Māori public gatherings of many kinds. Christianity became the major religion of the country, with the [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches all establishing themselves strongly. The arrival of other groups of immigrants did little to change this, as Pacific Islanders and other primarily Christian ethnic groups dominated immigration until the 1970s.

In the following decades, Christianity declined somewhat in percentage terms, mostly due to people declaring themselves as having no religion as well as by the growth of non-Christian religions. The five largest Christian denominations in 2001 remained the largest in 2006. The Catholic and Methodist denominations increased, but the Anglican denomination, the Presbyterian, Congregation and Reformed denomination, and undefined Christian denominations decreased. While smaller groups, there were larger percentage increases in affiliations with other Christian denominations between 2001 and 2006: Orthodox Christian religions increased by 37.8 percent, affiliation with Evangelical, Born Again and Fundamentalist religions increased by 25.6 percent, and affiliation with Pentecostal religions increased by 17.8 percent.&lt;ref name="2006quick"&gt;{{cite web | title=QuickStats About Culture and Identity | work=Statistics NZ Home &gt; Census &gt; 2006 Census Data &gt; About a Subject | publisher=Statistics New Zealand (www.stats.govt.nz) | url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/culture-and-identity/religious-affiliation.aspx | accessdate=29 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fc6Twaqe?url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/culture-and-identity/religious-affiliation.aspx | archivedate=3 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite strong affiliation to Christianity by New Zealanders throughout the country's history, church attendance in New Zealand has never been high compared to other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ward | first = Kevin | title = Towards 2015: the future of mainline Protestantism in New Zealand | journal=Journal of Beliefs &amp; Values  | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–23 | publisher=Research Unit, Department of Internal Affairs | date = 1 April 2006 | url =http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a745949156 | issn =  | isbn = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of church attendance today range from 10–20%, while research by the Bible Society of New Zealand in 2008 indicated that 15% of New Zealanders attend church at least once a week, and 20% attend at least once a month.&lt;ref name="bibleengagement"/&gt;

Islam in New Zealand began with the arrival of Muslim Chinese [[Gold prospecting|gold prospectors]] in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="muslimzea"&gt;{{cite web | title = The New Zealand Muslim Community | work=Islam in NZ | publisher=The Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand | url =http://www.fianz.co.nz/index.php?/aboutus/nzmuslims_content.php | accessdate =10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Islamic organisation in New Zealand, the [[New Zealand Muslim Association]], was established in [[Auckland]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.fianz.co.nz/history|website=www.fianz.co.nz|publisher=FIANZ|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960 saw the arrival of the first [[imam]], [[Maulana Said Musa Patel]], from [[Gujarat]], India.&lt;ref name="muslimthesis"&gt;Bishop, Martin C. '“A History of the Muslim Community in New Zealand to 1980”, thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of M.A. in history at the [[University of Waikato]]' ([[Waikato University]], 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale Muslim immigration began in the 1970s with the arrival of [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indians]], followed in the 1990s by refugees from various war-torn countries.&lt;ref name="muslimzea"/&gt; In April 1979 the three regional Muslim organisations of [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], [[Wellington]] and Auckland, joined together to create the only national Islamic body – the [[Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="muslimthesis"/&gt; Early in the 1990s many migrants were admitted under New Zealand's refugee quota, from war zones in [[Somalia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], Afghanistan, [[Kosovo]] and [[Iraq]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Since the [[11 September attacks]] there was a spike in conversions to Islam among Maori prisoners in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hume | first = Tim | title = Disenchanted Maori find spiritual crutch in Islam | newspaper=Sunday Star-Times  | publisher=| url =  http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12022835.html | accessdate =10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hume | first = Tim | title = Muslim faith draws converts from NZ prisons | newspaper=Sunday Star-Times  | publisher=| date = 17 October 2004 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12022860.html | accessdate =10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 census, 1.2 percent of the population, or 46,150 people, identified themselves as Muslim. Over two-thirds (67.5 percent) live in the Auckland region. Just over one-quarter (25.7 percent) are New Zealand born.

===Judaism===
{{Main|History of the Jews in New Zealand}}
The history of the Jews here begins in the 1830s including noted early settler [[Joel Samuel Polack]] and continued to grow from immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Landman | editor-first = Isaak | last = Werner | first = Alfred | title = New Zealand | encyclopedia = [[The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia]] | volume = 08 | pages = 205 | publisher=Varda Books | id = | url = http://www.publishersrow.com/Preview/index.asp?shid=1&amp;pid=1&amp;bid=2867&amp;fid=undefined&amp;pg=217&amp;o=1247834105093&amp;bmnta=NEW+ZEALAND | accessdate =10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent New Zealand Jews in history include 19th-century [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Premier]] [[Julius Vogel]] and at least five [[Mayor of Auckland|Auckland mayors]], including [[Dove-Myer Robinson]].

The majority of New Zealand Jews reside in [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]],&lt;ref name="Stephen Kevin p. 538"/&gt; though there is also a significant Jewish community in [[Dunedin]] which is believed to have the world's southernmost permanent synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Levine | first = Stephen I. | title = The New Zealand Jewish community | publisher=Lexington Books | year = 1999 | pages = 30 | url = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7391-0003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 0.2% of the population identified as Jewish/Judaism.&lt;ref name="2006table28"/&gt;

===Māori religion===
{{Main|Māori religion}}
Traditional Māori religion, that is, the pre-European belief system of the [[Māori people|Māori]], was little modified in its essentials from that of their tropical Eastern Polynesian homeland, conceiving of everything, including natural elements and all living things, as connected by common descent through [[whakapapa]] or genealogy. Accordingly, all things were thought of as possessing a life force or "mauri". Very few Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs (2,412 people at the 2006 census).&lt;ref name="2006table28"/&gt;

Two specific Māori branches of Christianity, [[Rātana]] and [[Ringatū]] are widely followed by many in the Māori community.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hinduism in New Zealand}}

[[Hinduism]] is the second largest religion in New Zealand after Christianity, with over 89,000 adherents according to the 2013 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/data-tables/total-by-topic.aspx Table 28, 2013 Census Data – QuickStats About Culture and Identity – Tables]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Hindus in New Zealand grew modestly until the 1990s when the Immigration Act 1987, the Immigration Amendment Act 1991 and [[Economic liberalisation in India|India's Economic Liberalisation in 1991]] changed immigration laws and India's standard of living. The eased immigration laws resulted in the number of Hindus growing from 18,000 in 1991 to 40,000 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/immigration-regulation/page-5&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism currently makes up 2.1% of the New Zealand population, and is the fast growing religion in the country(for religions with more than 20,000 adherents).&lt;ref&gt;http://worldhindunews.com/2014020517591/sikh-and-hindu-religions-had-the-fastest-rates-of-growth-auckland-census-shows/&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of Hinduism has been in almost in line with Indian immigration, which has resulted in various [[Little India (location)|Ethnic Enclaves]] (known as [[Little India (location)|Little India]]) appearing.

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism in New Zealand}}
Buddhism is the third largest religion in New Zealand, at 1.3% of the population.&lt;ref name="2006table28"/&gt; In 2007 the NZ$20&amp;nbsp;million [[Fo Guang Shan Temple, Auckland|Fo Guang Shan Temple]] was opened in Auckland for the promotion of [[Humanistic Buddhism]]. It is the largest Buddhist temple in New Zealand.

===Sikhism===
[[File:Sachkhand gurudwara.jpg|thumb|253x253px|right|Image of a Gurudwara, the Sikh place of worship, South Auckland.]] 
{{Main|Sikhism in New Zealand}}
Sikhs have been in New Zealand for more than a century, with the first arriving in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] in the 1880s. The Sikhs grew almost four-fold between 2001 and 2013 and comprised 0.43% of the population as of 2013. Today they have a strong presence in Auckland, and especially in South Auckland and [[Manukau City|Manukau]] with the current National Party's Member of Parliament for Manukau [[Kanwal Singh Bakshi]] being a Sikh.&lt;ref name="2006quick"/&gt;
There were thirteen [[gurdwara]]s (the Sikh place of worship) in New Zealand in 2010. The largest Sikh Gurdwara, the NZ$10million Kalgidhar Sahib, is situated in [[Auckland]] at Takanini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Gurdwaras |work=New Zealand Sikhs |publisher=Harpreet Singh |url=http://www.sikhs.co.nz/Gudwara/index.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080927130330/http://www.sikhs.co.nz/Gudwara/index.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion in culture and the arts==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
Although New Zealand is a largely secular country, religion finds a place in many cultural traditions. Major Christian events like Christmas and Easter are official [[Public holidays in New Zealand|public holidays]] and are celebrated by religious and non-religious alike, as in many countries around the world. The country's national anthem, [[God Defend New Zealand]], mentions God in both its name and its lyrics. There has been occasional controversy over the degree of [[separation of church and state]], for example the practice of prayer and religious instruction at school assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maxim.org.nz/index.cfm/policy___research/article?id=844|title=Maxim Institute: Prayer in Schools|accessdate=17 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110130240/http://www.maxim.org.nz/index.cfm/policy___research/article?id=844|archive-date=10 November 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconic [[Futuna Chapel]] was built as a Wellington retreat center for the Catholic Marist order in 1961. The design by [[Māori people|Maori]] architect John Scott, fuses [[Modernist]] and indigenous design principles.

Christian and [[Māori people|Maori]] choral traditions have been blended in New Zealand to produce a distinct contribution to [[Christian music]], including the popular hymns [[How Great Thou Art (hymn)#M.C4.81ori|Whakaria Mai]] and Tama Ngakau Marie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Christian individuals in politics===
Religion has played and continues to play a 'significant and sometimes controversial role' in the [[politics of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rex Ahdar &amp; John Stenhouse | title = God and Government | publisher=University of Otago Press | year = 2000 | location =  Dunedin | pages = 9 | url =  | id =| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most New Zealanders today consider politicians' religious beliefs to be a private matter,&lt;ref&gt;Brian Colless and Peter Donovan, 'Editor's Introduction', in Brian Colless and Peter Donovan, eds, ''Religion in New Zealand Society'', 2nd edition, Palmerston North: Dunmore Press, 1985, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; a large number of New Zealand Prime Ministers have been professing Christians, including [[Jenny Shipley]], [[Jim Bolger]], [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]], [[David Lange]], [[Robert Muldoon]], [[Walter Nash]], [[Keith Holyoake]], and [[Michael Joseph Savage]]. Former Prime Ministers [[John Key]] and [[Helen Clark]] were agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Clark-and-Key-spar-in-final-TV-debate-before-election/tabid/209/articleID/78661/Default.aspx|author=NZPA|date=5 November 2008 |title=Clark and Key spar in final TV debate before election|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3554978|author=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=16 March 2004|title=Insults get personal between Clark and Brash|accessdate=8 July 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly-former Prime Minister [[Bill English]] is Catholic and has acknowledged that religious groups should contribute to political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.challengeweekly.co.nz/story3.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304144442/http://www.challengeweekly.co.nz/story3.htm |archivedate=4 March 2008 |title=Church has vital place in our secular society |accessdate=1 October 2009|publisher=Challenge Weekly 66 (6)|date=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Reeves|Sir Paul Reeves]], [[Archbishop of New Zealand|Anglican Archbishop and Primate of New Zealand]] from 1980 to 1985, was appointed [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] from 1985 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sir Paul Reeves |url=https://gg.govt.nz/publications/sir-paul-reeves |publisher=The Governor-General of New Zealand |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Robert Smith|Murray Smith]] was a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1972 to 1975. His interest in governance continued when he later enrolled in the Bahá’í Faith and contributed in national and international roles within the [[Bahá'í International Community|Bahá'í Community]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081010194342/http://www.bahai.org.nz/Bahai_Institutions_and_Governance_Booklet.PDF Bahá’í Institutions and Global Governance] An address given at the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of New Zealand, on 28 April 2007.

===Christian political parties===
Christian political parties have usually not gained significant support, a notable exception being the [[Christian Coalition (New Zealand)]] polling 4.4% in the 1996 general election. Christian parties have often been characterised by controversy and public disgrace. Many of these are now defunct, such as the [[Christian Democrat Party (New Zealand)|Christian Democrat Party]], the [[Christian Heritage New Zealand|Christian Heritage Party]] which discontinued in 2006 after former leader [[Graham Capill]] was convicted as a child sex offender,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Capill sentenced to nine years for child sex crimes |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10335782 |date=14 July 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Destiny New Zealand]], [[The Family Party]] and the [[New Zealand Pacific Party]] whose leader, former [[New Zealand Labour Party]] MP [[Taito Phillip Field]] was convicted on bribery and corruption charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guilty verdicts for Taito Phillip Field |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10587391 |date=4 August 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Future]] has been more successful, which although not a Christian party has had significant Christian backing. The two main political parties, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] and [[New Zealand National Party|National]], are not religious, although religious groups have at times played a significant role (e.g. the [[Ratana]] Movement). Politicians are often involved in public dialogue with religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/parachute-music-festival/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500869&amp;objectid=10421364| title= Even politicians are popular at huge Christian music fest |work=The New Zealand Herald| date = 29 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10642345   |title=Hindu group accused of 'hijacking' other faiths |accessdate=1 October 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exclusive Brethren#New Zealand|Exclusive Brethren]] gained public notoriety during the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]] for distributing anti-Labour pamphlets, which former National Party leader [[Don Brash]] later admitted to knowledge of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=NZPA |title=Brash knew about Exclusive Brethren pamphlets |date=8 September 2005 |work=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10344635 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation of church and state===
New Zealand has no [[established church]].&lt;ref name="established"/&gt; However the following anomalies exist:
* New Zealand’s [[head of state]] or monarch must declare that they are a Protestant Christian and will uphold the Protestant succession according to the declaration required by the Accession Declaration Act 1910.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/imperial/1910/0029/latest/DLM12656.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Section 3 of the Act of Settlement 1700 requires that the King or Queen of New Zealand must be an Anglican.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/imperial/1700/0002/latest/DLM11131.html?src=qs&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Title of the [[Queen of New Zealand]] includes the statement "[[by the grace of God]]" and the title [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1974/0001/latest/DLM411821.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the discussions leading to the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] Governor Hobson made a statement (which had no particular legal or constitutional significance) concerning freedom of religion (sometimes called the 'fourth' article).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treaty2u.govt.nz/the-treaty-up-close/the-content-of-the-treaty/index.htm | title=The Content of the Treaty | publisher=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |accessdate =16 June 2010 | quote= ''The Governor says the several faiths of England, of the Wesleyans, of Rome, and also Māori custom shall be alike protected by him.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the government issued a [[National Statement on Religious Diversity]] containing in its first clause "New Zealand has no official or established religion." The statement caused controversy in some quarters, opponents arguing that New Zealand's head of state [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].&lt;ref name="tamaki_statement"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=301&amp;objectid=10424395 | title=Denying state religion like treason, says Brian Tamaki – ''New Zealand Herald'' 17 February 2007 | author=Collins, Simon | accessdate=20 April 2007 | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=17 February 2007}}''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Queen does not act in that capacity as the [[Queen of New Zealand]]; although she retains the styling of [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] within her official title in that role. A poll of 501 New Zealanders in June 2007 found that 58% of respondents did not think Christianity should be New Zealand's official religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Research New Zealand |url=http://www.researchnz.com/pdf/Media%20Releases/RNZ%20Media%20Release%20-%20Xtiannation.pdf |title=Limited Support for Christianity as Official Religion |date=17 June 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709233131/http://www.researchnz.com/pdf/Media%20Releases/RNZ%20Media%20Release%20-%20Xtiannation.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's parliament opens its proceedings with a specifically Christian prayer. In 2007 parliament voted to retain the Christian prayer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/how-parliament-works/speaker/press-releases/48Speakpress150620071/mps-vote-to-retain-prayer&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there has been increasing recognition of Māori spirituality in political discourse and even in certain government legislation. In July 2001 MP [[Rodney Hide]] alerted parliament to a state funded ''hikitapu'' (''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]''-lifting) ceremony at the opening of the foreign embassy in Bangkok. It was revealed that the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] had a standard policy of employing Māori ritual experts for the opening of official offices around the world.&lt;ref name="backdoor"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kolig |first1=Eric |authorlink1= |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Stenhouse |editor1-link= |others= |title=The Future of Christianity: Historical, Sociological, Political and Theological Perspectives from New Zealand  |year=2004 |publisher=AFT Press |location=Adelaide  |pages=183–204  |chapter=Coming through the Backdoor |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Resource Management Act 1991]] recognises the role of Māori spiritual beliefs in planning and environmental management.&lt;ref name="backdoor"/&gt; In 2002 local Māori expressed concerns that the development of the Auckland-Waikato expressway would disturb the ''[[taniwha]]'', or guardian spirit, of the Waikato River, leading to delays and alterations to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3050421 | title=Taniwha road gets all clear |work=The New Zealand Herald. 2 January 2003 | date=8 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only prosecution, in 1922, was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;''The King v. Glover'' (1922) GLR 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine of her works have been made into films,&lt;ref name="RGtrust"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rumer Godden Literary Trust homepage | url = http://www.rumergodden.com/index.php | website = www.rumergodden.com | access-date = 17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' in 1947.

A few of her works were co-written with her older sister, novelist [[Jon Godden]], including ''[[Two Under the Indian Sun]]'', a memoir of the Goddens' childhood in a region of India now part of [[Bangladesh]].

==Early life==
[[File:Cover of Black Narcissus (1939) by Rumer Godden.jpg|thumb|Cover of Black Narcissus (1939), published by Little Brown Co.]]
Godden was born in [[Eastbourne]],&lt;ref name="IndepObit"/&gt; [[Sussex]], England.

Godden returned to the United Kingdom with her sisters to continue her interrupted schooling in 1920, spending time at [[Moira House Girls School]] in Eastbourne and eventually training as a dance teacher. She went back to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] in 1925 and opened a dance school for English and Indian children.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Godden ran the school for 20 years with the help of her sister Nancy. During this time she published her first best-seller, the 1939 novel ''[[Black Narcissus]]''.

==Writing career==
[[File:Greengage summer.JPG|thumb|upright|''The Greengage Summer'' (1958), 1962 Pan paperback edition]]
In 1942, after eight years in an unhappy marriage (one she entered into in 1934 because she was pregnant),&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; she moved with her two daughters, Jane and Paula, &lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite web | last = Yarrow | first = Andrew L. | title = Rumer Godden, an Author Who Evoked Her Childhood in Colonial India, Is Dead at 90 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/10/books/rumer-godden-an-author-who-evoked-her-childhood-in-colonial-india-is-dead-at-90.html | website = www.nytimes.com | date = 11 November 1998 | access-date = 17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (her husband Laurence Foster having joined the army)&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; to [[Kashmir]], living first on a houseboat and then in a rented house where she started a farm. After a mysterious incident in which it appeared that an attempt had been made to poison both her and her daughters, she returned to Calcutta in 1944; the novel ''Kingfishers Catch Fire'' was based on her time in Kashmir. She returned to the United Kingdom in 1945 to concentrate on her writing, frequently moving house but living mostly in [[Sussex]] and London, and was divorced in 1948.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; After returning from America to oversee the script for the movie of her book ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'', Godden married civil servant James Haynes Dixon on 26{{nbsp}}November 1949.

In the early 1950s Godden became interested in the Catholic Church, though she did not officially convert until 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tickle |first=Phyllis |title=Introduction to In This House of Brede |year=2005 |publisher=Loyola Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several of her later novels contain sympathetic portrayals of Catholic priests and nuns. In addition to ''Black Narcissus'', two of her books deal with the subject of women in religious communities. In ''Five for Sorrow, Ten for Joy'' and ''[[In This House of Brede]]'' she acutely examined the balance between the mystical, spiritual aspects of religion and the practical, human realities of religious life.

A number of Godden's novels are set in India, the atmosphere of which she evokes through all the senses; her writing is vivid with detail of smells, textures, light, flowers, noises and tactile experiences. Her books for children, especially her several doll stories, strongly convey the secret thoughts, confusions, disappointments and aspirations of childhood.  Her plots often involve unusual young people not recognized for their talents by ordinary lower- or middle-class people but supported by the educated, rich, and upper-class, to the anger, resentment, and puzzlement of their relatives. She won a [[1972 Whitbread Awards|1972 Whitbread award]] for ''[[The Diddakoi]]'', a young adult novel about Gypsies, televised by the BBC as ''[[Kizzy (TV series)|Kizzy]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Later life and death==
In 1968 she took the tenancy of [[Lamb House]] in [[Rye, East Sussex]], where she lived until the death of her husband in 1973. She moved to [[Moniaive]] in [[Dumfriesshire]] in 1978, when she was 70, to be near her daughter Jane.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; She was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in 1993. She visited India once more, in 1994, returning to Kashmir for the filming of a BBC ''Bookmark'' documentary about her life and books.

Rumer Godden died on 8 November 1998 at the age of 90 after a series of strokes; her ashes were buried with those of her second husband in Rye.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Sandra Moreschi''' (born December 7, 1946) is an Italian designer of [[Jewish ceremonial art]].

Since the end of the 1980s, Sandra Moreschi has been combining symbols of the Jewish tradition with contemporary design. From 1990 to 2016 she managed a store, Saray, located in the heart of the [[Roman Ghetto]] in via [[Porticus Octaviae|Portico d'Ottavia]]. During this time, she collaborated with Italian artisan shops, among them the Bottega Gatti of [[Faenza]]. Her works are present in important private, museum and institutional collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brockman|first1=Elin Schoen|title=The Jewish Traveler: Rome|url=http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2010/08/17/jewish-traveler-rome/|website=Hadassah Magazine|date=Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Scientology]] says that a human is an [[immortality|immortal]], [[Spirit|spiritual being]] ([[thetan]]) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable [[Past lives#Scientology|past lives]] and it is observed in advanced [[Scientology]] texts that lives preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth were lived in [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial cultures]]. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] will eventually come across and recount a [[Incident (Scientology)|common series of events]].

According to the Church, founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s discovery of the thetan places Scientology at the heart of the human quest for meaning, and proves that "its origins are as ancient as religious thought itself." However, Scientology considers that its understanding of the thetan distinguishes it from other religious traditions, especially Judaism and Christianity, in three important ways. First, while many religions fuse the concept of the body and the soul, the thetan (spirit) is separate and independent. Second, unlike the three great world monotheisms, Scientologists believe in past lives and that the thetan has lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes. Third, contrary to Christian concepts of [[original sin]], Scientology holds to the intrinsic goodness of a being and believes that the spiritual essence has lost touch with its nature. "The spirit, then, is not a thing," Hubbard writes. "It is the creator of things."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David | last2 = Cowan | first2 = Douglas | title = Cults and new religions: a brief history | accessdate = 2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientology]] describes itself as the study and handling of the [[spirit]] in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. Scientologists also believe that people have innate, yet suppressed, power and ability which can be regained if [[Clear (Scientology)|cleared]] of enforced and unwanted behaviour patterns and discomforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Road To Total Freedom|series=Panorama|publisher=BBC|airdate=April 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Farley|first = Robert|title = Scientology nearly ready to unveil Super Power|publisher = St. Petersburg Times|date=May 6, 2006|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/06/Tampabay/Scientology_nearly_re.shtml/|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology is described as "a religion to help people use scientific approaches to self-actualize their full potential."&lt;ref name=Gutjahr&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30227336 | title = Reference: The State of the Discipline: Sacred Texts in the United States | journal = Book History | first = Paul C. | last = Gutjahr | volume = 4 | pages = 335–370 | doi=10.1353/bh.2001.0008 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers reach their full potential "when they understand themselves in their true relationship to the physical universe and the Supreme Being. "&lt;ref name=Gutjahr/&gt; There have been many scholarly studies of Scientology and the books are freely available in bookshops, churches and most libraries.&lt;ref name=Gutjahr/&gt;

The Church of Scientology believes that "Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe," as stated in the Creed of the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = James R. | title = Scientology | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2009  | location = Cary, NC | isbn = 978-0-19-533149-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Wallis of Columbia University describes Scientology as "a movement that straddles the boundaries between psychology and religion, [offering] a graded hierarchy of 'auditing' and training" with the intention of releasing the individual's full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reference: The Road to Total Freedom, a Sociological Analysis of Scientology | journal = Review of Religious Research | date = Autumn 1978 | first = Kenneth E. | last = Burnham | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 119 | doi=10.2307/3509964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology does not require that their members must exclusively believe in Scientology, distinguishing it from biblical religions. Scientologists may profess belief in other religions, such as Protestantism and Catholicism, and may participate in their activities and sacred rites. Jacob Neusner emphasizes this in the section on Scientology in his book ''World Religions in America.''&lt;ref name=Neusner&gt;{{cite book|last=Neusner|first=Jacob|year=2003|title=World Religions in America|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=221–236|isbn=0-664-22475-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[J. Gordon Melton]], "Scientologists aim to utterly make the world instead of taking refuge from it," as they participate in culture instead of being isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Veenker |first=Jody |last2=Rabey |first2=Steve |title=Building Scientopolis: How Scientology remade Clearwater, Florida--and what local Christians learned in the process |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/september4/7.90.html |work=[[Christianity Today]] |date=2000 |pages=90–99 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology is inherently nondenominational and open to individuals, regardless of religious background; according to Mary A. Mann, it contains the elements necessary for a global religion and caters to  people of all different ethnicities and educational upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first1=Mary A. |title=Science and Spirituality |work=Science |publisher=2004 |accessdate=2015-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson writes that Scientology "constitutes a religious system set forth in the terms of scientific discourse." Hubbard similarly states that "along with science, Scientology can achieve positive invariable results. Given the same conditions, one always get the same results&amp;nbsp;... What has happened is the superstition has been subtracted from spiritual studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Charisma and the iron cage: Rationalization, science and scientology | journal = Social Compass | date = March 2004 | first = Simon | last = Locke | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 111–131 | doi=10.1177/0037768604040794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytical mind is similar to the conscious mind, which processes daily information and events. The reactive mind produces the mind's "aberrations" such as "fear, inhibition, intense love and hate and various psychosomatic ills" which are recorded as "engrams."&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, Mark. "In The Clear." Nation 293.19 (2011): 31-35. Academic Search Complete. Web. 2 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology believes that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized.&lt;ref name="J. Gordon Melton p. 224"&gt;J.

Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or ''auditor.''&lt;ref name="Neusner229-230"&gt;{{harvnb|Neusner|2003|pp=229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bears a superficial similarity to [[Confession (religion)|confession]] or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice the way a pastor or priest might do.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Instead, the auditor's task is to help a person discover and understand engrams, and their limiting effects, for him- or herself.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Most auditing requires an [[E-meter]], a device that measures minute changes in [[electrical resistance]] through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal "cans"), and a small current is passed through them.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt;

Scientology believes that watching for changes in the E-meter's display helps locate engrams.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it, in order to help him or her eliminate the engram, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the engram's "charge" has been dissipated and the engram has in fact been cleared.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; As the individual progresses, the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt; At the more advanced OT auditing levels, Scientologists perform solo auditing sessions, acting as their own auditors.&lt;ref name=Neusner229-230 /&gt;

===Auditing===
{{Main article|Auditing (Scientology)}}

One central practice of Scientology is an activity known as "auditing" (listening) which seeks to elevate an adherent to a state of [[Auditing (Scientology)|"clear"]], one of freedom from the influences of the [[reactive mind]]. The practice is one wherein a counselor called an "auditor" addresses a series of questions to a [[preclear]], observes and records the preclear's responses, and acknowledges them. An important element in all forms of auditing is to not suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance the auditor create a truly safe and distraction-free environment for the session.

The term "Clear" is derived from a button on a calculator that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are "optimal individuals" and "they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion." Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives, "be healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills."&lt;ref name="ZP"&gt;{{harvnb|Zellner|1998|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Auditing" is sometimes seen as controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within what are called "preclear folders". Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person's auditing progress.

Auditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject's [[galvanic skin response]] in a manner similar to a [[polygraph]] (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6S9MPQYvPFwC&amp;pg=PT78 |page=78 |title=Religions of the Stars: What Hollywood Believes and How It Affects You |last=Abanes |first=Richard |publisher=Baker Books |year=2009 |isbn=1-4412-0445-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which "aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of 'clear.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595091823/Scientology-Church-now-claims-more-than-8-million-members.html?pg=all|title=Scientology: Church now claims more than 8 million members|author=Elaine Jarvik|date=September 18, 2004|work=DeseretNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditors do not receive final certification until they have successfully completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in.{{Original research inline|date=December 2008}} Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family. Church members pair up often to get their training, doing the same course at the same time, so that they can audit each other up through the various Scientology levels.

According to scholar Harriet Whitehead, the Church of Scientology "has developed a fine-tooled hierarchically organized system of audit (training) sessions where the technology of these sessions, in fact, is the treatment leading to processes of renunciation and eventually reformulation in the individual," which is similar to psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reference: Renunciation and Reformulation: A Study of Conversion in an American Sect: Review by: Karl Peter | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | date = September 1988 | first = Harriet | last = Whitehead |author2=Karl Peter  | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–456| id = | doi=10.2307/1387393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional tone scale and survival===
{{main article|Emotional tone scale|Science of Survival}}
Scientology uses an emotional classification system called the ''[[Emotional tone scale|tone scale]]''.&lt;ref name="nowreligion"&gt;{{cite book |author=Malko, George |title=Scientology: The Now Religion |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |year=1970 |page=109 |isbn=978-1-112-96373-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tone scale is a tool used in auditing; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person's place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering his or her condition.&lt;ref name="tone scale"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kkj3yBwED2IC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Scientology+tone+scale |title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion, page 132 |author=John Corrigan |isbn=978-0-19-517021-4 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology emphasizes the importance of ''survival'', which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as ''"[[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]]"''.&lt;ref name="Wallis1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1.txt |title=The Road to Total Freedom A Sociological analysis of Scientology, page 1 |author=Roy Wallis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015230830/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wallis/wallis1.txt |archivedate=October 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamics"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family.&lt;ref name="Wallis1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton25"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and the Infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being.&lt;ref name="Wallis1" /&gt; The optimum solution to any problem is held to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics.&lt;ref name="Wallis1"/&gt;

===ARC and KRC triangles===
The ARC and KRC triangles are [[concept map]]s which show a relationship among three concepts to form another concept. These two triangles are present in the Scientology logo.

The KRC triangle is the uppermost triangle. It combines the components of "Knowledge" "Responsibility" and "Control". A Scientologist must gain ''Knowledge'' of, take ''Responsibility'' for, and effectively exert ''Control'' over elements of his or her environment.

The ARC triangle is the lower triangle. It is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for.&lt;ref name="Neusner"/&gt; It combines three components: "Affinity" is the degree of affection, love or liking, i.e. an emotional state.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; "Reality" reflects [[consensual reality]], that is agreements on what is real.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; "Communication", believed to be the most important element of the triangle, is the exchange of ideas.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Scientologists believe that improving one of the three aspects of the ARC triangle "increases the level" of the other two but the most important aspect of this triangle is "communication" mainly because communication drives the other two aspects: "affinity" and "reality".&lt;ref name="GallagherAshcraft2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eugene V. Gallagher|author2=W. Michael Ashcraft|title=Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America &amp;#91;Five Volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZiScvbS6-cC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Eugene+Gallagher+scientology|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-05078-7|page=116|accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists believe that ineffective communication is a chief cause of human survival problems, and this is reflected by efforts at all levels within the movement to ensure clear communication, the presence of unabridged standard dictionaries for example being an established feature of Scientology centers.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Scientologists believe that the three elements are fundamental between individuals “in that to communicate with a person one must have some affinity for him or her,” as Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes it. According to Scientology doctrine, the break in the flow of ARC that hinders survival must be handled in auditing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L. Ron Hubbard’s Formulation of Therapy and Religion in Dianetics and Scientology, 1950–1986 |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |date=June 24, 2016 |last=Christensen |first=Dorthe Refslund |doi=10.5840/asrr201662323 |volume=7 |pages=155–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two triangles are connected by a letter "S", standing for SCIO (Latin &gt; "I Know"). Church of Scientology doctrine defines ''scio'' as 'knowing in the fullest sense of the word'. It links the two triangles together.

===The Dynamics===
Hubbard introduced the Scientology cross in the 1950s as the central symbol for the church. He described the eight points of the cross as symbolizing the "eight dynamics" or eight measures for survival that all human beings have, which includes the urge to service as a spiritual being and the urge to survive as a godlike entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780691146089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard writes that survival is moving away from death and towards immortality, and that human beings are constantly on the search for feelings of pleasure and motivated by the avoidance of pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Scientology A Thorough Analysis of L. Ron Hubbard’s Formulation of Therapy and Religion in Dianetics and Scientology, 1950–1986 |journal=Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review |date=June 24, 2016 |last=Christensen |first=Dorthe Refslund |doi=10.5840/asrr201662323 |volume=7 |pages=155–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The first dynamic is the urge toward survival of self. 
#The second dynamic is the urge toward survival through sex, or children. This dynamic actually has two divisions. The second dynamic (a) is the sexual act itself and second dynamic (b) is the family unit, including the rearing of children.
#The third dynamic is the urge toward survival through a group of individuals or as a group. Any group or part of an entire class could be considered to be a part of the third dynamic. The school, the club, the team, the town, the nation are examples of groups.
#The fourth dynamic is the urge toward survival through all mankind and as all mankind.
#The fifth dynamic is the urge toward survival through life forms such as animals, birds, insects, fish and vegetation, and is the urge to survive as these.
#The sixth dynamic is the urge toward survival as the physical universe and has as its components ''Matter'', ''Energy'', ''Space'' and ''Time'', from which we derive the word MEST.
#The seventh dynamic is the urge toward survival through spirits or as a spirit. Anything spiritual, with or without identity, would come under the seventh dynamic. A sub-heading of this dynamic is ideas and concepts such as beauty and the desire to survive through these.
#The eighth dynamic is the urge toward survival through the Supreme Being, or more exactly, infinity.

===Thetans===
{{See also|Purification Rundown}}

According to L. Ron Hubbard's book ''The History of Man'', published in 1952, there are two entities housed by the human body, a genetic entity (whose purpose is to carry on the evolutionary line) and a "Thetan" or consciousness "that has the capacity to separate from body and mind." According to Hubbard, "In man's long evolutionary development the Thetan has been trapped by the engrams formed at various stages of embodiment." Scientology training is aimed at clearing the person of all engrams, thus creating an "Operating Thetan." "Among the abilities of the Operating Thetan is the soul's capacity to leave and operate apart from the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Melton | first = J.

People are viewed as spiritual beings that have minds and bodies and a person's "spiritual essence" is called the ''Thetan''.&lt;ref&gt;Pretorius, SP 2006. 'The concept "salvation" in the Church of Scientology', HTS Teologiese Studies/ Theological Studies, vol. 62, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;313–327&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology teaches that "a thetan is the person himself, not his body or his name or the physical universe, his mind or anything else." According to the doctrine, "one does not have a thetan, he is a thetan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bromley | first1 = David G. | title = Making Sense of Scientology: Prophetic, Contractual | editors = James R.

====Exteriorization====
'''Exteriorization''' is a practice in which a thetan functions independently of the physical body, sometimes as a result of [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] process [[R2-45]].&lt;ref name="ReligionInc"&gt;{{cite book | first=Stewart | last=Lamont | title=[[Religion Inc.]] | publisher=Harrap Ltd | location=London | year=1986 | chapter=1.

===Afterlife===
In Scientology, the [[human body]] is regarded as similar to that of other religions in that, at death, the [[spirit]] will  leave the body. "Life and personality go on. The physical part of the organism ceases to function." &lt;ref&gt;Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology believes in the "immortality of each individual's spirit," therefore making death not a significant worry. The spirit acquires another body necessary for growth and survival. To achieve an individual's true identity is the primary goal.&lt;ref name="ZP" /&gt;

According to Scientology beliefs, Scientology itself is a blend of science and spirituality, with belief in an immortal spirit and in improving that spirit here on Earth using Scientology's methods. Scientologists do not typically dwell on Heaven or Hell or the afterlife, instead focusing on the spirit. Many Scientologists also belong to other churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.good4utah.com/news/local-news/inside-the-utah-church-of-scientology  |title=Inside the Utah Church of Scientology |last=Carlisle |first=Randall |accessdate=2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scientology doctrine, salvation is achieved through “clearing” engrams and implant, the source of human misery, through the auditing process. Salvation is limited to the current life and there is no “final salvation or damnation,” author Richard Holloway writes. “Life is a not a one-shot deal. There is only the eternal return of life after life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holloway |first1=Richard |title=A Little History of Religion |publisher=Yale University Press |date=September 20, 2016 |isbn=978-0300208832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scientology beliefs, "the individual comes back. He has a responsibility for what goes on today since he will experience it tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology: the facts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9370678/What-is-Scientology.html|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-beliefs/reincarnation.html|title=Position on Reincarnation &amp; Past Lives: Official Church of Scientology|author=|date=|work=scientology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Scientology book, ''A History of Man'', Hubbard discusses that a human's past experiences make up that person's present identity. These include experiences as atoms, seaweed, plankton and clams, pointing to the belief in recurring lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sampling of the New Religions: Four Groups Described |journal=International Review of Mission  |year=1978 |last=Weldon |first=John |volume=67 |issue=268 |pages=407–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1758-6631.1978.tb01274.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===God===
The Church of Scientology states that it has no set [[dogma]] on God and allows individuals to come to their own understanding of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/faq/scientology-beliefs/what-is-the-concept-of-god-in-scientology.html|title=Does Scientology have a concept of God?|author=|date=|work=scientology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scientology, "vastly more emphasis is given to the godlike nature of the person and to the workings of the human mind than to the nature of God."&lt;ref name="ZP" /&gt; Hubbard did not clearly define God in Scientology. When pressed about their belief, Scientologists mention the "eight dynamic" which they say is the "God dynamic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Images of Religions and Religious History in the Works of L.

Scientologists believe in an "Infinity" ("the All-ness of All"). They recite a formal prayer for total freedom at meetings, which include the verses "May the author of the universe enable all men to reach an understanding of their spiritual nature. May awareness and understanding of life expand, so that all may come to know the author of the universe. And may others also reach this understanding which brings Total Freedom&amp;nbsp;... Freedom from war, and poverty, and want; freedom to be; freedom to do and freedom to have. Freedom to use and understand Man's potential – a potential that is God-given and Godlike." The prayer commences with "May God let it be so."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faithology.com/practices/weekly-worship-in-scientology&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientologists affirm the existence of a [[deity]] without defining or describing its nature. L. Ron Hubbard explains in his book ''Science of Survival'', "No culture in the history of the world, save the thoroughly depraved and expiring ones, has failed to affirm the existence of a Supreme Being. It is an [[empirical observation]] that men without a strong and lasting faith in a Supreme Being are less capable, less ethical and less valuable." Instead of defining God, members assert that reaching higher states of enlightenment will enable individuals to make their own conclusions about the Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashcraft-Eason |first1=Lillian |last2=Martin |first2=Darnise C. |last3=Oladermo |first3=Oyeronke |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4kBbOOWRDsC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=scientology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUvsGT-5jKAhVN-2MKHWkeDew4KBDoAQhYMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology&amp;f=false |title=Women and New and Africana Religions |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |accessdate=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church considers itself scientific, although this belief has no basis in [[institutional science]].&lt;ref name=Rothstein2014&gt;Rothstein, Mikael. "Science and Religion in the New Religions."

The "science" of [[Dianetics]], however, was [[Pseudoscience|never accepted by the scientific community]].&lt;ref name=Rothstein2014/&gt; Rothstein also writes that there is a possibility that Scientology partly owes its existence to the conflict with the conventional scientific community, which hindered Hubbard’s original intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements |volume=1 |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |publisher=OUP USA |year=2008 |isbn=9780195369649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that Scientology differs from the [[scientific method]] in that Scientology has become increasingly [[self-reference|self-referential]], while true science normally compares competing [[scientific theory|theories]] and [[fact#In science|observed facts]].&lt;ref name=Rothstein2014/&gt;

Hubbard originally claimed and insisted that Dianetics was based on the scientific method. He taught that "the scientific sensibilities [carry] over into the spiritual realities one encounters via auditing on the [[e-meter]]." Scientologists commonly prefer to describe Hubbard's teachings with words such as knowledge, technology and workability rather than belief or faith. Hubbard described Dianetics and Scientology as "technologies" based on his claim of their "scientific precision and workability." Hubbard attempted to "break down the barrier between scientific (objective, external) and religious (subjective, internal) forms of knowledge." Hubbard describes Scientology's [[epistemology]] as "radically subjective: Nothing in Scientology is true for you unless you have observed it and it is true according to our observation." This is a type of self-legitimation through science which is also found in other religions such as [[Christian Science]], [[Religious Science]], and [[Moorish Science Temple of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Walking in Ron's Footsteps: "Pilgrimage" Sites of the Church of Scientology |journal=Numen |year=2016 |last=Westbrook |first=Donald A. |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=71–94 |issn=0029-5973 |doi=10.1163/15685276-12341409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtW90YkkB3gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=scientology+by+james+lewis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizgaap1OHJAhUENiYKHQ4PDn8Q6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology%20by%20james%20lewis&amp;f=false |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780199715954 |accessdate=2016-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[William Sims Bainbridge]] cites Scientology's origins in the [[subculture]]s of [[science fiction]] and "harmony" with scientific [[cosmology]]. Science fiction, viewed to work for and against the purposes of science, has contributed to the birth of [[new religions]], including Scientology. While it promotes science, it distorts it as well. Science fiction writer [[A.E. van Vogt]] based the early development of Dianetics and Scientology on a novel based on [[General Semantics]], a [[pseudoscience]] created by Alfred Korzybski for the purpose of curing personal and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William Sims.

Members of the Church believe that Hubbard "discovered the [[existential]] truths that form their [[doctrine]] through research," thus leading to the idea that Scientology is science. Hubbard created what the church would call a "spiritual technology" to advance the goals of Scientology. According to the church, "Scientology works 100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerely desires to improve his life." The underlying claims are that Scientology is "exact" and "certain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first1=Lawrence |title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief |edition=unabridged |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2013 |isbn=9780385350273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]], writing for ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 2011, said that Scientology's methods lacked enough study to qualify as a science, but that the story of [[Xenu]] and Scientology's other [[creation myth]]s were no less tenable than other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-real-science-behind-scientology/|title=The Real Science behind Scientology|last=Shermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|date=2011-11-01|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B. Hubbard, J. Hatfield and J. Santucci compare Scientology's view of humanity to the [[Yogachara]] school of [[Buddhism]], saying that both have been described as "the most scientific" among new and traditional religions respectively. B. Hubbard et al. cite the use of technical language and the claim that teachings were developed through observation and experimentation. They also emphasize that many investigators and researchers consider Scientology to be a [[pseudoscience]] because of its absolute and meta-[[empirical]] goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Benjamin Jerome|author2=John T. Hatfield|author3=James A. Santucci|title=An Educator's Classroom Guide to America's Religious Beliefs and Practices|date=2007|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=9781591584094|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UWBIuX7TPk8C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=isbn%3A9781591584094&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Kocku von Stuckrad stated that Scientology is an example of the phenomenon of both the “scientification of religion” and the “sacralization” of science. Donald A. Westbrook elaborates that there is apparently an “ongoing and dialectical relationship” between religion and science in Hubbard’s teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first1=Donald A. |title=Handbook of Scientology |chapter=Researching Scientology and Scientologists in the United States: Methods and Conclusions |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Among the Scientologists: History, Theology and Praxis'', the e-meter is the most prominent signifying tool of Scientology’s scientific leanings and claim to being technology. It is essentially a tool in mental and spiritual counseling or Auditing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first1=Donald A. |title=Among the Scientologists: History, Theology and Praxis |publisher=Oxford Studies |year=2018 |isbn=9780190664978 |accessdate=2018-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bridge to Total Freedom===
[[The Bridge to Total Freedom]] is the means by which Scientologists undertake personal development. Processing is the actual practice of [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] which directs questions towards areas of travail in a person's life to get rid of barriers that inhibit his or her natural abilities. This process is supposed to bring greater happiness, intelligence and success.&lt;ref&gt;Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; Training is also given in the process of auditing others.&lt;ref name="BridgebyNeusner"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MJrFwCHJQkC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=site:.edu+Scientology+%22a+religion%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA228,M1 |title=Book: World Religions in America by Jacob Neusner &amp;#124; page 228 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bridge to Total Freedom is considered a metaphor for the spiritual life of the believer, and is also a detailed outline of the process a Scientologist undergoes in order to develop spirituality. It follows a strict hierarchy with ascending levels.

The main goal of the first stage is to be freed from limitations of the [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]] universe (MEST standing for [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]] and [[time]]), while the second stage is about regaining creative powers as a spiritual being which have been lost according to the teachings of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |edition=4 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2016-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection of Psychology and Psychiatry===
{{Further information|Scientology and psychiatry|Citizens Commission on Human Rights|Psychiatry: An Industry of Death}}
[[File:Scientology psychiatry kills.jpg|right|thumb|Scientologists on an anti-[[psychiatry]] demonstration]]
Scientology is publicly, and often vehemently, opposed to both [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html] Scientology's views on the evils of [[materialism]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Paulette | last=Cooper | authorlink=Paulette Cooper | title=Scientology Versus Medicine in Scandal of Scientology | publisher =Web Edition| year=1997 | url= http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/tsos/sos-16.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Mieszkowskii | first=Katharine | title=Scientology's War on Psychiatry | journal=[[Salon.com]] | year=2005 | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710060622/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and encourage alternative care based on [[spiritual healing]].
 
The psychiatric establishment rejected Hubbard's theories in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="GA184" /&gt; Ever since, Scientology has argued that psychiatry suffers from the fundamental flaw of ignoring humanity's spiritual dimension, and that it fails to take into account Hubbard's insights about the nature of the mind.&lt;ref name="Melton49"/&gt; Scientology holds psychiatry responsible for a great many wrongs in the world, saying it has at various times offered itself as a tool of political suppression and "that psychiatry spawned the ideology which fired Hitler's mania, turned the Nazis into mass murderers, and created the Holocaust."&lt;ref name="GA184" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton49"/&gt;

The anti-psychiatry organization [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] (CCHR) was founded by Hubbard in 1969. It operates [[Psychiatry: An Industry of Death]], an anti-psychiatry museum.&lt;ref name="GA184"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton49"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through CCHR, Scientology has made claims of psychiatric abuse. The anti-psychiatry organization has had political accomplishments: In 1986, it published a manifesto against psychiatry and psychotropic medication, which was included in a document by the United Nations which saw wide circulation; In 2006, a bill drafted by the group was passed by the Arizona senate "mandating an additional consent form be presented to subjects considering participation in psychiatric research." The form in question "differentiates real disease from mental illness." A similar CCHR bill was rejected by the Florida house, "mandating that a long, ominous-sounding statement about the dangers of psychoactive drugs be presented to parents prior to school referral for mental health evaluation." The movement has gained momentum{{Clarify|reason = What exactly does "gained momentum" mean here, and what movement are we talking about?|date=February 2016}} across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Awakening to Scientology |journal=Brown University Child &amp; Adolescent Behavior Letter |year=2006 |last=Fritz |first=Gregory K. |volume=22 |issue=7 |issn=1058-1073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How Scientology defines ethics ===
{{Main article|Ethics (Scientology)}}
Scientology teaches that progress on [[The Bridge to Total Freedom]] requires and enables the attainment of high moral and ethical standards.&lt;ref name="BridgebyNeusner"/&gt; According to Hubbard, the goal of ethics is to remove impediments to survival, and ethics is essentially a tool to "get technology in", meaning Scientology's use of the term technology.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} [[Stephen A. Kent]] describes Scientology ethics as "a peculiar brand of [[morality]] that uniquely benefitted [the Church of Scientology] ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people's interests in things other than Scientology. In this 'ethical' environment, Scientology would be able to impose its courses, philosophy, and '[[Scientology Justice|justice system]]' — its so-called technology — onto society."&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Stephen A. Kent|authorlink = Stephen A. Kent|date = September 2003|title = Scientology and the European Human Rights Debate: A Reply to Leisa Goodman, J. Gordon Melton, and the European Rehabilitation Project Force Study|journal = [[Marburg Journal of Religion]]|volume = 8|issue = 1|url = http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/kent3.html|accessdate = 2006-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology's system of ethics is designed to motivate members to expand the church, as members' ethical level is tied to their performance in recruiting new members.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied teachings==
{{See also|L. Ron Hubbard|Scientology bibliography}}
The church makes it clear that Hubbard is considered the sole source of Dianetics and Scientology: "The Scientology religion is based exclusively upon L. Ron Hubbard's research, writings and recorded lectures – all of which constitute the Scriptures of the religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |last2=Hammer |first2=Olav |title=The Invention of Sacred Tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |accessdate=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work, recorded in 500,000 pages of writings, 6,500 reels of tape and 42 films, is archived for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert W. | last = Welkos |author2=Sappell, Joel  | title = Church Scriptures Get High-Tech Protection | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientologysided062490,0,7493097.story | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = June 24, 1990 | accessdate = 2008-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Technology Center]] holds "the ultimate ecclesiastical authority and the pure application of L.

Individuals applying Hubbard's techniques who are not officially connected to the Church of Scientology are considered part of the "[[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]]". Some of these individuals were litigated against for using and modifying the practices for their own use and that of others, thereby infringing the law on [[patent law|patent]], [[trademark law|trademarks]], or [[trade secret]]s.

Scientologists avoid the terms as “belief” or “faith” in describing the body of Scientology knowledge and its purpose in their lives. They use “knowing” and “reality” and the “efficacy of the technology” to describe their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first1=Donald A. |title=Among the Scientologists: History, Theology and Praxis |publisher=Oxford Studies |year=2018 |isbn=9780190664978 |accessdate=2018-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Handling" of Psychosis===
{{main article|Introspection Rundown}}
The Introspection Rundown is a controversial Church of Scientology auditing process that is intended to handle a psychotic episode or complete mental breakdown. Introspection is defined for the purpose of this rundown as a condition where the person is "looking into one's own mind, feelings, reactions, etc."&lt;ref&gt;''Technical Bulletins X'' Bridge Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|0-88404-481-5}} (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The Introspection Rundown came under public scrutiny after the death of [[Lisa McPherson]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/death-in-slow-motion-part-2-of-3-in-a-special-report-on-the-church-of/1012234 |title=Death in slow motion: Part 2 of 3 in a special report on the Church of Scientology |author=Tobin and Childs |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |date=June 21, 2009 |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Word Clearing" and "Learning on a Gradient"===
On November 12, 1952, Hubbard delivered a lecture entitled "Precision Knowledge: Necessity to know terminology and law" emphasizing the importance to precise terminology.   Scientology defined methods of correcting "misunderstoods" ("misunderstood word or symbol").  Scientologists have their own ''Technical Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|0-686-30803-4}}, {{ISBN|0-88404-037-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; featuring modified definitions of existing English words. Scientology dictionaries also include specialized terminology such as "enturbulate" and "havingness."

Critics of Scientology have accused Hubbard of "loading the language" and using [[Scientology terms|Scientology jargon]] to keep Scientologists from interacting with information sources outside of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Branch | first = Craig | title = Applied Scientology in Public Schools? | work = The Watchman Expositor | publisher = [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]] | year = 1997 | url = http://www.watchman.org/sci/appliedscientology.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wakefield | first = Margery | title = Understanding Scientology | publisher = Coalition of Concerned Citizens | year = 1991 | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/us.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology teaches that that material must be learned "on a gradient", that is, in order without skipping or skimming material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Bryan | authorlink3 = Bryan R. Wilson | title = Religion in sociological perspective | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1989 | accessdate = 2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scientology doctrine, the idea of communication has a high status. In the book ''Sects, Cults, and Spiritual Communities,'' Petrowsky and Zellner state that in the Scientology belief system, “misinformation or miscommunication is analogous to original sin, inhibiting individual growth and relationships with others.” The “misunderstood word” is a central teaching in Scientology. Failure in reading comprehension is attributed to it.&lt;ref name="ZP" /&gt;

===Interpretation and context===
Scientology discourages secondary interpretation of its writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MJrFwCHJQkC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=site:.edu+Scientology+%22a+religion%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA229,M1 |title=Book: World Religions in America By Jacob Neusner, page 230 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Students of Scientology are taught to direct others to those original sources, rather than to convey any interpretation of the concepts in their own words. Emphasis is placed on keeping the writings in context.

===Silent birth===

{{main article|Silent birth}}
Advocated by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, silent birth describes "the process of childbirth where labor and delivery is done in a calm and loving environment." To provide quiet surroundings for the delivery of the baby, individuals in his/her immediate vicinity are prompted not to speak. According to Scientology practices, silent birth is "mandatory to provide the best possible environment for the pregnant mother and her new baby." Shouting, laughing or making loud remarks must be avoided while the baby is being pushed out. According to ''The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World,'' "its origins are fundamentally rooted in the principle that women, particularly expectant mothers, be given the utmost care and respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Navodita | first = Pande | editor = Mary Zeiss Stange |editor2=Carol K. Oyster |editor3=Jane E. Sloan | encyclopedia = The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World | title = Silent Birth (Scientology) | edition = 2nd | year = 2000 | publisher = SAGE Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | pages = 1778–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holidays===
{{Main article|Scientology holidays }}
There are several holidays celebrated by Scientologists, notably L. Ron Hubbard's birthday in March, the Anniversary of the first publication of Dianetics in May, [[Sea Org]] Day in August, Auditor's Day in September and the International Association of Scientologists (IAS) Anniversary in October.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon. "Scientology, Holidays of the Church of." Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations. Ed. J. Gordon Melton. Vol. 2. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2011. 789–791. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. January 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Most official celebrations are scheduled on weekends as a convenience to members. Scientologists also celebrate holidays such as Christmas, Easter and New Year's Eve, as well as other local celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/wis/wiseng/39/39-idx.htm |title=Scientology Beliefs &amp; Practices: What is Scientology? |publisher=Scientology.org |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists also celebrate religious holidays depending on other religious beliefs, as Scientologists very often retain their original affiliations with faiths in which they were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/10/31/christian.scientology/index.html | work=CNN | title=Some Christian pastors embrace Scientology - CNN.com | date=November 1, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunday services===
A Scientology Sunday service has a sermon, similar to other religions in the United States. It typically begins at 11am and Hubbard’s writings are read aloud during the service. Much like other religions’ services, music is played or sometimes musical performances are enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America 4th edition |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780664233204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister speaks on Scientology doctrine, announces that weekly activities of the community and recent updates from churches around the world. Scientologists also say “A Prayer for Total Freedom,” asking the “author of the universe” to help them as they seek enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashcraft-Eason |first1=Lillian |last2=Martin |first2=Darnise|last3=Olademo |first3=Overonke |title=Women and New African Religions |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=9780275991562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They way Scientology’s service has been executed has not changed. The minister chooses from a limited selection of possible sermons and group processing exercises. He creates the sermon within the parameters of a literal interpretation of Hubbard’s canonical teachings, functioning similar to other indigenous theologians who work with canonical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientology: Religious Studies Approaches |journal=Numen |year=2016 |last=Lewis |first=James R. |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=6–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to religion scholar [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], Sunday services are more for interested non-members and the holidays and events are more for existing members of the church.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2017"/&gt;

===Rituals===
The church’s rituals can be categorized four ways: first, rituals performed for spiritual transformation; second, collective ceremonies usually called events, including Hubbard’s birthday; third, rites of passage including weddings and funerals; and fourth, those that mimic Christian rituals, such as Sunday services. Events include the anniversary of Dianetics, the anniversary of [[Freewinds]] and Auditor’s Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Significance of Rituals in Scientology: A Brief Overview and a Few Examples |journal=Numen |year=2016 |last=Rothstein |first=Mikael |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=54–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
Scientologists also undergo training aside from auditing, which consists of several levels of courses about daily life improvement using various tools, and auditing techniques, so that members are able to perform the same procedure to other Scientologists.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2017"/&gt;
 
===Applications of "Ethics" and "Disconnection"===
{{main article|Ethics (Scientology)|Suppressive Person|Disconnection}}
Scientology has an internal justice system (the ''Ethics'' system) designed to deal with unethical or antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name="GA180"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton34"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics officers are present in every org; they are tasked with ensuring correct application of Scientology technology and deal with violations such as non-compliance with standard procedures or any other behavior adversely affecting an org's performance, ranging from errors and misdemeanors to crimes and suppressive acts, as defined by internal documents.&lt;ref name="GA181"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology teaches that spiritual progress requires and enables the attainment of high ''"[[Ethics (Scientology)|ethical]]"'' standards.&lt;ref name="Neusner228"&gt;{{harvnb|Neusner|2003|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scientology, rationality is stressed over morality.&lt;ref name="Neusner228"/&gt; Actions are considered ''ethical'' if they promote ''survival'' across all eight ''dynamics'', thus benefiting the greatest number of people or things possible while harming the fewest.&lt;ref name="Melton33-34"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Scientology states that many social problems are the unintentional results of people's imperfections, it asserts that there are also truly malevolent individuals.&lt;ref name="GA177"&gt;{{harvnb|Cowan|Bromley|2006|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard believed that approximately 80 percent of all people are what he called ''social personalities''{{spaced ndash}}people who welcome and contribute to the welfare of others.&lt;ref name="GA177" /&gt; The remaining 20 percent of the population, Hubbard thought, were ''[[Suppressive Person]]s''.&lt;ref name="GA177" /&gt; According to Hubbard, only about 2.5 percent of this 20 percent are hopelessly antisocial personalities; these make up the small proportion of truly dangerous individuals in humanity: "the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords."&lt;ref name="GA177" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZP146-147"&gt;{{harvnb|Zellner|1998|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists believe that any contact with suppressive or antisocial individuals has an adverse effect on one's spiritual condition, necessitating [[disconnection]].&lt;ref name="GA177" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ZP146-147" /&gt;

In Scientology, defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons,&lt;ref name="isbn978-0-04-445687-2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marshall, Gordon |title=In praise of sociology |publisher=Unwin Hyman |location=Boston |year=1990 |page=187 |isbn=978-0-04-445687-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strangetimes101"&gt;{{harvnb|Flowers|1984|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="netwars"&gt;{{cite book |author=Grossman, Wendy |title=Net. wars |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |year=1997 |page=73 |isbn=978-0-8147-3103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn978-0-691-12582-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenawalt, Kent |title=Religion and the Constitution |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2006 |page=298 |isbn=978-0-691-12582-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors.&lt;ref name="Melton36"&gt;{{harvnb|Melton|2000|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Scientologist who is actively in communication with a suppressive person and as a result shows signs of antisocial behaviour is referred to as a ''Potential Trouble Source''.&lt;ref name="newreli"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bednarowski, Mary Farrell |title=New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America (Religion in North America) |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1995 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-253-20952-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="altreliny"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Timothy |title=America's alternative religions |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=1995 |page=388 |isbn=978-0-7914-2397-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fair Game"===
{{main article|Fair Game (Scientology)}}
The term ''Fair Game'' is used to describe policies and practices carried out by the Church against people the Church perceives as its enemies. Hubbard established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization.&lt;ref name="urban2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|date=June 2006|title=Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=74|issue=2|pages=356–389|issn=1477-4585|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj084|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|year=2008|title=Secrecy and New Religious Movements: Concealment, Surveillance, and Privacy in a New Age of Information|journal=Religion Compass|publisher=Wiley |volume=2|issue=1|pages=66–83|issn=1749-8171|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8171.2007.00052.x|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals or groups who are "Fair Game" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="streeter_fairgame"&gt;{{Harvnb|Streeter|2008|pp=217–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a [[Operation Snow White|program of covert and illegal infiltration]] of the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and other [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] agencies during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban2008" /&gt; They also conducted private investigations, [[character assassination]] and [[lawsuit|legal action]] against the Church's critics in the media.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt; The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.&lt;ref name="wollersheim212calapp3d872"&gt;Wollersheim v.

===Splinter groups:  Independents,  Miscavige's RTC, and "Squirreling" ===
While ''Scientology'' generally refers to [[David Miscavige|Miscavige]]-led [[Church of Scientology]], many other groups practice Scientology. These groups, collectively known as the [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the official Church of Scientology, as well as entirely new members.   In 1965, a longtime Church member and "Doctor of Scientology" Jack Horner (b. 1927), dissatisfied with the Church's "ethics" program, developed Dianology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melton|first1=J. G. (Ed.)|chapter=Church of Eductivism |title=Encyclopedia of American Religions|year=2003|publisher=Detroit: Gale|page=815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capt. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="freezone_orgintro"&gt;{{cite web|author=Free Zone Assoc. |url=http://www.freezone.org/news/intro.htm |title=Introduction |publisher=Freezone.org |date=January 30, 2002 |accessdate=September 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109194238/http://www.freezone.org/news/intro.htm |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church labels these groups as "[[Squirreling|squirrels]]" in [[Scientology terminology|Scientology jargon]] and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On January 1, 1982, Miscavige established the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC).&lt;ref name="LewHam24"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Hammer|2007|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 1982, the [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] was established by former top Scientologists in disagreement with RTC.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Zellner ''Extraordinary Groups'', p. 295, Macmillan, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7167-7034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and believes that the Church of Scientology has departed from its original philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freezone.org/english.htm |title=Free Zone |accessdate=July 13, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409102933/http://www.freezone.org/english.htm |archivedate=April 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Advanced Ability Center]] was a breakaway organization from the [[Church of Scientology]] established by former Scientologist [[David Mayo (Scientology)|David Mayo]] after he left the Church in February 1983 – a time when most of Scientology's upper and middle management split with [[David Miscavige]]'s organization.&lt;ref name=Nordhausen&gt;[[#Nordhausen|Nordhausen &amp; Billerbeck (2008)]], pp. 469–470&lt;/ref&gt; David Mayo had been Hubbard's own [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditor]].&lt;ref name=Nordhausen /&gt;

More recently, high-profile defectors [[Mark Rathbun]] and [[Mike Rinder]] have championed the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sweeney | first = John | title = Mr Shouty and Cruise: the rematch | date = September 26, 2010 | work = The Sunday Times | url = | quote = Marty Rathbun, who like Rinder is now an independent scientologist ...

'''Sultana''' or '''sultanah''' ({{IPA-ar|s|ʌ|l|ˈ|t|ɑː|n|ə}}; {{Lang-ar|سلطانه}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sulṭānah}}'') is a female [[Royal and noble ranks|royal title]], and a feminine form of the word [[sultan]]. This term has been officially used for female [[monarch]]s in some [[Islam|Islamic]] states, and historically it was also used for sultan's consorts. Nevertheless, westerners have also used the title to refer to Muslim women monarchs and sultan's women relatives who do not hold this title officially.

==Term==
The term sultana is a feminine form of the word [[sultan]] ({{lang-ar|سلطان}}), an Arabic [[abstract noun]] meaning "strength", "authority", "rulership", derived from the [[verbal noun]] {{lang|ar|سلطة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sulṭah}}'', meaning "authority" or "power". Later, sultan came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall [[caliphate]], or to refer to a powerful [[governor]] of a province within the caliphate.

==Usage==

===Ruling sultana===
Some Muslim female monarchs chose to adopt the title of Sultana/Sultanah when they ascended to the throne. 

====North Africa==== 
In the former Kingdom of [[Touggourt]], now part of [[Algeria]], there was one ruling sultana: Aïsha.

====Southeast Asia====
In [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate]] (now part of [[Indonesia]]), Sultana Seri Ratu Nihrasyiah Rawangsa Khadiyu (r. 1406-1427) became the sole ruler.
In [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh Darussalam]] (now part of [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]), there have been four ruling sultanas:
* Sultana [[Seri Ratu Ta'jul Alam Syafiatuddin Syah of Aceh]] (1641-1675) - daughter of [[Sultan Iskandar Muda]] the Great, and wife of [[Sultan Iskandar Tani]]. She spoke 6 languages, [[Acehnese_language|Acehnese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Persian language|Persian]].
* Sultana [[Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah|Seri Ratu Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah]] (1675-1678).
* Sultana [[Inayat Zakiatuddin Syah|Seri Ratu Zakiatuddin Inayat Syah]] (1678-1688).
* Sultana [[Zainatuddin of Aceh|Seri Ratu Kamalat Syah]] (1688-1699). Replaced by her husband, under pressure from the Mufti of [[Mecca]].

In [[Maldives]], there have been five ruling sultanas:
* [[Khadijah of the Maldives|Khadijah]] (1347–1363, 1364–1374, 1376–1380)
* [[Raadhafathi of the Maldives|Raadhafathi]] (1380)
* [[Dhaain of the Maldives|Dhaain]] (1383–1388)
* [[Kuda Kala Kamanafa’anu]] (1607–1609)
* [[Amina of the Maldives|Amina]] (1757–1759)

On 5 May 2015, [[Hamengkubuwono X]], Sultan and Governor of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], Indonesia, appointed his eldest daughter, Lady Nurmalita Sari (henceforth titled [[Princess Mangkubumi]]), as his [[heiress presumptive]]. If she does succeed her father, she will become the first Javanese woman to become a Sultan in her own right.

===Sultana consort===
Sultana is also used for sultan's wives. Between 1914 and 1922, [[List of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty|monarchs]] of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] used the title of [[Sultan of Egypt]], and their wives were legally styled as sultanas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rizk |first=Yunan Labib |date=13–19 April 2006 |title=A palace wedding |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |issue=790 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/790/chrncls.htm |accessdate=2010-02-27 |quote=... Britain granted the rulers among the family the title of sultan, a naming that was also applied to their wives. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504063720/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/790/chrncls.htm |archivedate=4 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two women held the title of sultana during the short-lived Sultanate of Egypt: [[Melek Tourhan]], the wife of Sultan [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]], and [[Nazli Sabri]], the wife of Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]]. Nazli Sabri became [[Queen consort|queen]] (''malika'') following the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] in 1922, and it is with the latter title that she is almost always associated. Melek Tourhan, on the other hand, legally retained the title of sultana even after Egypt became a kingdom, and is often referred to simply as Sultana Melek.

Sultana is also title for consort of ruler in some [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|Malaysian states]]. Some consorts who hold this title are
* [[Sultanah Kalsom binti Abdullah]], second wife of [[Ahmad Shah of Pahang]]. She became [[Pahang|Sultanah of Pahang]] on 30 September 1992.
* [[Sultanah Nur Zahirah]], wife of [[Mizan Zainal Abidin of Terengganu]]. She became [[Terengganu|Sultanah of Terengganu]] on 12 July 1998.
* [[Sultanah Haminah Hamidun]], second wife of [[Abdul Halim of Kedah]]. She became [[Kedah Sultanate|Sultanah of Kedah]] on 21 November 2003 after her predecessor's death.

==Claim==
In the west, the title of sultana is also used to refer to many female Muslim monarchs who don't hold this title officially.

Raziya al-Din, usually referred to in history as [[Razia Sultana]], was the [[Sultan of Delhi]] in [[India]] from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary.&lt;ref name="herstory"&gt;Gloria Steinem (Introduction), [http://www.crescentlife.com/thisthat/feminist%20muslims/razia.htm  ''Herstory: Women Who Changed the World,''] eds.

Sultana was also often used to refer to women relatives of a sultan and other Muslim monarch or female members of Muslim dynasties, especially mothers and chief wives. In fact, many sultanates used other title for sultan's chief consort, some of which derived from non-Arabic language.

''Permaisuri'', a title for a chief wife of a sultan in many sultanates and Muslim kingdoms in southeast Asia, is derived from [[Tamil language|Tamil]] பரமேஸ்வரி (paramēsvari), from [[Sanskrit]] परमेश्वरी (parameśvarī), 'supreme lady'. This title is still used for the consort of [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], monarch and head of state of [[Malaysia]]. The formal way of addressing her is [[Raja Permaisuri Agong]].

In [[Brunei]], [[Malay styles and titles#Brunei|official title]] for a chief wife of the sultan is ''Seri Baginda Raja Isteri'', derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[raja]]'' (राजा, equivalent with "king") and ''isteri'' (equivalent with "women" or "lady"). The official title for sultan's mother is ''Seri Suri Begawan Raja Isteri''.

''[[Shahbanu]]'', title for the wife of Iran's monarch, is derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''[[shah]]'' (شاه, equivalent with "king") and ''[[banu (name)|banu]]'' (بانو, translated as "lady"). Upon assuming the title in 1967, [[Farah Pahlavi]], the third wife of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], was the first ''shahbanu'' to be crowned in Iran since the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. ''Shahbanu'' often translated in English as "empress".

Some Muslim monarchs also used the title ''malika'' ([[Arabic]]: ملكة), a feminine form of the word ''[[malik]]'', for their wives. This title is still used in many Muslim kingdoms, like [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]]

===Ottoman royalty===
Since 16th century, [[List of Ottoman titles and appellations|Ottoman]] used the title ''sultan'' for imperial princesses after their given names (e.g. [[Mihrimah Sultan]] and [[Hatice Sultan (daughter of Selim I)|Hatice Sultan]]). They were all non-ruling royalty; in the western sense, princesses, not queens or empresses. The monarch's mother, who had more power, had the title [[Valide Sultan]] (e.g. [[Hafsa Sultan (wife of Selim I)|Hafsa Sultan]]). She was referred to by this title alone, without her given name. Principal consort had the title [[Haseki Sultan]] (e.g. [[Hürrem Sultan]]). Non-principal consorts had the title ''[[hatun]]'', equivalent to ''[[lady]]''. This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire |last=Peirce |first=Leslie P. |publicationplace=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507673-7 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, westerners often translated their official title, ''sultan'', to ''sultana'', possibly to distinguish them from the Ottoman ruler.

[[File:The dance of Shiva.jpg|thumb|The dance of Shiva]]
[[File:Shiva as the Lord of Dance LACMA edit.jpg|thumb|220px|Shiva Natarajan, the Lord of the Dance. [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Chola Dynasty]], India]]
'''{{IAST|Tāṇḍavam}}''' (Kannada: ತಾಂಡವ, Tamil: தாண்டவம்) (also known as '''{{IAST|Tāṇḍava natyam}}''') is a divine dance performed by the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]]. Shiva's Tandava is described as a vigorous dance that is the source of the cycle of creation, preservation and dissolution. While the '''Rudra Tandava''' depicts his violent nature, first as the creator and later as the destroyer of the universe, even of death itself; the '''Ananda Tandava''' depicts him as joyful. In [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] tradition, Shiva as [[Nataraja]] (lit. "Lord of dance") is considered the supreme lord of dance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/Avatars/Natar.html  "Nataraja", ''Manas,'' UCLA]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Saivism}}
The Tandavam takes its name from '''Tandu''' ({{IAST|taṇḍu}}), the attendant of Shiva, who instructed [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]] (author of the [[Natya Shastra]]) in the use of ''Angaharas'' and ''[[Karana dance|Karana]]s''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-natyashastra/d/doc209696.html Natya-shastra IV.263-264]&lt;/ref&gt;, modes of the Tandava at Shiva's order. Some scholars consider that Tandu himself must have been the author of an earlier work on the [[dramaturgy|dramatic art]]s, which was incorporated into the Natya Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;''Quarterly Journal of the Andhra Historical Research Society,'' part III, pp. 25-26, as cited in {{sfn|Manohar Laxman Varadpande|1987|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the classical arts of dance, music and song may derive from the [[mudra]]s and rituals of [[Shaiva]] tradition.

[[File:Kadavul tandavas.jpg|thumb|Some of the 108 ''Karanas'' of ''Nataraja'' at Kadavul Hindu Temple, on Kauai, Hawaii. It is one of the few complete collections in existence, commissioned by [[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] in the 1980s. Each sculpture is about 12 inches tall. [[Chidambaram Temple]] is also known to have a complete set.]]
The 32 Angaharas and 108 Karanas are discussed by Bharata in the 4th chapter of the Natya Shastra, ''Tandava Lakshanam''.&lt;ref&gt;Ragini Devi, ''Dance Dialects of India,''  pp.29-30.  Motilal Banarsidass (1990)   {{ISBN|81-208-0674-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karana is the combination of hand gestures with feet to form a dance posture. Angahara is composed of seven or more Karanas.{{sfn|Manohar Laxman Varadpande|1987|p=154}} 108 karanas included in Tandava could be employed in the course of dance, fight, and personal combats and in other special movements like strolling.

The dance is a pictorial allegory of the five principle manifestations of eternal energy:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahashivratri.org/shiva-tandava.html   Ananda Coomaraswamy, cited at www.mahashivratri.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* ''Srishti'' - creation, evolution
* ''[[Sthiti]]'' - preservation, support
* ''Samhara'' - destruction, evolution
* ''Tirobhava'' - illusion
* ''Anugraha'' - release, emancipation, grace
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus Tandava symbolizes the cosmic cycles of creation and destruction, as well as the daily rhythm of birth and death.

[[File:Shiva-dance.png|left|thumb|Rudra Tandava: A dancer depicting Shiva kicking [[Yama]], the god of Death.]]
Tandava, as performed in the sacred dance-drama of southern India, has vigorous, brisk movements. Performed with joy, the dance is called ''[[Ananda (disambiguation)|Ananda]] Tandava''.  Performed in a violent mood, the dance is called ''[[Rudra]] Tandava''. In the Hindu texts, at least seven types of Tandava are found:  Ananda Tandava, Tripura Tandava, Sandhya Tandava, Samhara Tandava, Kali (Kalika) Tandava, Uma Tandava and Gauri Tandava.{{sfn|Manohar Laxman Varadpande|1987|p=154}} However, some people believe that there are 16 types of Tandava.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"How many various dances of Shiva are known to His worshipers I cannot say. No doubt the root idea behind all of these dances is more or less one and the same, the manifestation of primal rhythmic energy.  Whatever the origins of Shiva's dance, it became in time the clearest image of the activity of God which any art or religion can boast of." - [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/Avatars/Natar.html  Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, "The Dance of Shiva", in ''The Dance of Shiva: Fourteen Indian Essays,'' rev. ed. (New York: Noonday Press, (1957)] {{ISBN|81-215-0153-9}}.  Cited, "Nataraja", ''Manas,'' UCLA&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dance performed by Shiva's wife [[Parvati]] in response to Shiva's Tandava is known as [[Lasya]], in which the movements are gentle, graceful and sometimes erotic.  Some scholars consider Lasya to be the feminine version of Tandava. Lasya has 2 kinds, Jarita Lasya and Yauvaka Lasya.

The Hindu scriptures narrate various occasions when Shiva or other gods have performed the Tandava. When [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] (first wife of Shiva, who was reborn as Parvati) jumped into the Agni Kunda (sacrificial fire) in [[Daksha]]'s [[Yajna]] and gave up her life, Shiva is said to have performed the Rudra Tandava to express his grief and anger. The ''Shivapradosha stotra'' says when Shiva performs the ''Sandhya Tandava'', the other gods like [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], [[Sarasvati]], [[Lakshmi]] and [[Indra]] play musical instruments and sing Shiva's praises.{{sfn|Manohar Laxman Varadpande|1987|p=154}} [[Ganesha]], the son of Shiva, is depicted as ''Ashtabhuja tandavsa nritya murtis'' (Eight armed form of Ganesha dancing the Tandava) in temple sculptures.{{sfn|Manohar Laxman Varadpande|1987|p=5}} [[Shiva Tandava Stotram]] is a stotra (Hindu hymn) that describes Shiva's power and beauty. The [[Bhagavata Purana]] talks of [[Krishna]] dancing his Tandava on the head of the serpent [[Kaliya]].{{sfn|Manohar Laxman Varadpande|1987|p=98}} According to [[Jain]] traditions, Indra is said to have performed the Tandava in honour of [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)]] on the latter's birth.{{sfn|Manohar Laxman Varadpande|1987|p=146}}

He has held the positions since 26 December 2012.&lt;ref name="28 December 2012"&gt;''[[Daily Yomiuri]]'' [https://archive.is/20130121032432/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T121227003607.htm 28 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Asō, a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], was born in [[Iizuka, Fukuoka|Iizuka]] in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] on 20 September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2006/08/20/afx2961236.html "Japanese foreign minister to announce bid to replace Koizumi"], ''Forbes'', 20 August 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222054421/http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2006/08/20/afx2961236.html |date=22 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Takakichi Asō, was the chairman of the Aso Cement Company and a close associate of Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]];{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} his mother Kazuko Asō was Prime Minister [[Shigeru Yoshida]]'s daughter. Tarō is also a great-great-grandson of [[Ōkubo Toshimichi]], and his wife, Chikako is the third daughter of Prime Minister [[Zenkō Suzuki]]. His younger sister, [[Princess Tomohito of Mikasa|Nobuko, Princess Tomohito of Mikasa]], is a cousin-in-law of [[Emperor Akihito]].

Asō graduated from the Faculty of Politics and Economics at [[Gakushuin University]],&lt;ref&gt;name="ReferenceA"&gt;japan.kantei.go.jp/97_abe/meibo/daijin/1208723_10042.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="Cute booze"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Former Prime Minister Wants Japanese Youth To Drink Cute Booze|url=https://kotaku.com/5673326/yes-this-man-was-prime-minister-of-japan|accessdate=19 January 2018|publisher=Kotaku|date=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Asō spent two years working for a diamond mining operation in [[Sierra Leone]] before [[Sargents Coup|civil war]] forced him to return to Japan. Then he joined his father's company in 1966, and served as president of the Aso Mining Company from 1973 to 1979. Working for the company, he lived in [[Brazil]] during the 1960s and became fluent in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20080926/not_imp248260,0.php Article] on ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'', 26 September 2008. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of the Japanese [[Shooting sports|shooting]] team at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] and President of the Japan [[Junior Chamber International|Junior Chamber]] in 1978.

==Political career==
===Cabinet Minister===
He joined the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] of [[Jun'ichirō Koizumi]] in 2003 as Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications. On 31 October 2005, he became Minister for Foreign Affairs. There has been some speculation that his position in the Cabinet was due to his membership in the Kōno Group, an LDP caucus led by pro-Chinese lawmaker [[Yōhei Kōno]]: by appointing Asō as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Koizumi may have been attempting to "rein in" Kōno's statements critical of Japanese foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hideo Hamada, [http://www.janjan.jp/kokkai_watch/0511/0511014602/1.php?PHPSESSID=f82b662b2b519ee16fdaf8d6dc44f89b "The Diet Now: Containment and Division"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Janjan.jp, 1 November 2005. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidate for the LDP Leadership===
Asō was one of the final candidates to replace Koizumi as prime minister in 2006, but lost the internal party election to [[Shinzō Abe]] by a wide margin. Both Abe and Asō are conservative on foreign policy issues and have taken confrontational stances towards some [[East Asia]]n nations, particularly [[North Korea]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[People's Republic of China]]. Abe was considered a more "moderate" politician than the more "hard-line" Asō, and led Asō in opinion polling within Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cominganarchy.com/archives/2005/11/01/hardline-hawk-or-unapologetic-bigot "Hardline Hawk or Unapologetic Bigot?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117130310/http://www.cominganarchy.com/archives/2005/11/01/hardline-hawk-or-unapologetic-bigot/ |date=17 January 2006 }}, ''Coming Anarchy'', 1 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Asō's views on multilateralism are suggested in a 2006 speech, "Arc of Freedom and Prosperity: Japan's Expanding Diplomatic Horizons".&lt;ref&gt;Calder, Kent E. and Francis Fukuyama.

Asō acknowledged that he would most likely lose to Fukuda, but said that he wanted to run so that there would be an open election, saying that otherwise LDP would face criticism for making its choice "through back-room deals".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/16/asia/AS-POL-Japan-Politics.php "Former FM Aso acknowledges probable defeat in Japan's leadership race"], from The Associated Press on ''International Herald Tribune'', 16 September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013093732/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/16/asia/AS-POL-Japan-Politics.php |date=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election, 2007|President election]], held on 23 September, Fukuda defeated Asō, receiving 330 votes against 197 votes for Asō.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voanews.com/english/2007-09-23-voa5.cfm "Fukuda Chosen to Replace Abe as Japan's Prime Minister"], ''VOANews.com'', 23 September 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820033055/http://voanews.com/english/2007-09-23-voa5.cfm |date=20 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120525183219/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20070923dy01.htm "Fukuda wins LDP race / Will follow in footsteps of father as prime minister"], ''The Daily Yomiuri'', 23 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2008, Fukuda appointed Asō as Secretary-General of LDP, a move that solidified Asō's position as the number two man in the party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20081016032320/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080802TDY01303.htm "Fukuda overhauls Cabinet / LDP executive shakeup also elevates Aso to party No. 2"], The Yomiuri Shimbun, 2 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime Minister of Japan===
Unexpectedly on 1 September 2008, Fukuda announced his resignation as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/archive/news/2008/09/01/20080901p2a00m0na020000c.html "Fukuda announces resignation as prime minister of Japan"]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}, ''The Mainichi Daily News'', The Mainichi, 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Five LDP members including Asō ran for new party President to succeed Fukuda. On 21 September, one day before votes of Diet party members, Asō reportedly told a crowd of supporters outside Tokyo: "The greatest concern right now is the economy." "America is facing a financial crisis ... we must not allow that to bring us down as well."&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;Joseph Coleman, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hlQO-kyvIEyrc0I90V5l0LFN7JTwD93BK79G0 "Japan ruling party turns to brash Aso"], The Associated Press, 22 September 2008. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally on 22 September, Asō did win. He was elected as President of LDP with 351 of 525 votes (217 from 384 Diet party members, 134 from 47 prefecture branches); [[Kaoru Yosano]], [[Yuriko Koike]], [[Nobuteru Ishihara]], [[Shigeru Ishiba]] got 66, 46, 37, 25 votes respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/jimin/ayumi/index.html "党のあゆみ・総裁選挙"], Liberal Democratic Party. {{ja icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029003431/http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/jimin/ayumi/index.html |date=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/select/opinion/closeup/news/20080923ddn003010032000c.html クローズアップ２００８：自民新総裁に麻生氏　総選挙へ切り札] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924135013/http://mainichi.jp/select/opinion/closeup/news/20080923ddn003010032000c.html |date=24 September 2008 }}, ''毎日新聞'': Osaka – Evening edition, The Mainichi, 23 September 2008. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chosen&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqszq8agglGSFXJ4S7Nv0OsSe1_A "Conservative Aso chosen as Japan PM"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925103044/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqszq8agglGSFXJ4S7Nv0OsSe1_A |date=25 September 2008 }}, AFP, 22 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later on 24 September, Asō was designated by the Diet as Prime Minister, and was formally appointed to the office by the Emperor on that night. In the House of Representatives (lower house), he garnered 337 out of 478 votes cast; in the [[House of Councillors]] (upper house), [[Ichirō Ozawa]], President&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpj.or.jp/english/about_us/index.html "About us"], The Democratic Party of Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan, was named through two times of ballots.&lt;ref name="PM_designation@Mainichi"&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20080924p2a00m0na013000c.html "LDP President Aso elected prime minister"], ''The Mainichi Daily News'', [[Mainichi Shimbun|The Mainichi Newspapers]], 24 September 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924185205/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20080924p2a00m0na013000c.html |date=24 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM_designationKNI"&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/5TH+LD%3A+Aso+elected+Japan's+prime+minister,+to+form+Cabinet.-a0186684851 5TH LD: Aso elected Japan's prime minister, to form Cabinet], [[Kyodo News International]] (September 24, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Because no agreement was reached at a joint committee of both Houses, the resolution of the House of Representatives became the resolution of the Diet, as is stipulated in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="PM_designationKNI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html "The Constitution of Japan"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214104438/http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html |date=14 December 2013 }}.

Later on the same day as his election as Prime Minister, Asō personally announced his new Cabinet (this is normally done by the [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]]). His Cabinet was markedly different from the preceding Cabinet under Fukuda. Five of its members had never previously served in the Cabinet, and one of them, 34-year-old [[Yūko Obuchi]], was the youngest member of the Cabinet in the post-war era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080925TDY01303.htm "Aso elected premier / Announces Cabinet lineup himself; poll likely on Nov. 2"], The Yomiuri Shimbun, 25 September 2005. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Asō flew to Washington to meet with [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] in February 2009. He was the first foreign leader to visit the Obama White House; however, reports suggested that the new administration was interested less in giving Asō a political boost than in sending a message that Japan continues to be an important ally and partner&lt;ref&gt;Klug, Foster.

===Political Comeback and return to the cabinet===
When Shinzo Abe returned to the Prime Minister's office in 2012, Aso is appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. He is the first former Japanese Prime Minister to subsequently serve as Deputy Prime Minister.

==Controversial statements==

In 2001, as economics minister, he was quoted as saying he wanted to make Japan a country where "rich Jews" would like to live.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|title=Blue eyes, blond hair: that's US problem, says Japanese minister|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=23 March 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,,2040957,00.html|accessdate=19 September 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, during the opening ceremony of the Kyushu National Museum which also displays how other Asian cultures have influenced Japanese cultural heritage, he praised Japan for having "one culture, one civilization, one language, and one ethnic group", and stated that it was the only such country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Reed, [http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=f6f50bd7a1687ece711a7ef721bb6fb8 "Ghosts of Wartime Japan Haunt Koizumi's Cabinet"], ''New America Media'', 3 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a lecture in Nagasaki Prefecture, Asō referred to a Japanese peace initiative on the [[Middle East]], stating, "The Japanese were trusted because they had never been involved in exploitation there, or been involved in fights or fired machine guns. Japan is doing what the Americans can't do. It would probably be no good to have blue eyes and blond hair. Luckily, we Japanese have yellow faces."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

''[[Kyodo News]]'' reported that he had said on 4 February 2006, "our predecessors did a good thing" regarding [[compulsory education]] implemented during Japan's colonization of [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kyodo, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060205a8.html "Taiwan colonization was 'good': Aso]", ''The Japan Times Online'', 5 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2005, he said China was "a neighbour with one billion people equipped with nuclear bombs and has expanded its military outlays by double digits for 17 years in a row, and it is unclear as to what this is being used for. It is beginning to be a considerable threat".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4551642.stm Japan alarmed by Chinese 'threat']", ''BBC'', 22 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2006, he called for the emperor to visit the controversial [[Yasukuni Shrine|Yasukuni]] shrine. He later backtracked on the comment, but stated that he hoped such a visit would be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Kyodo,"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-01/29/content_516354.htm Aso rapped for emperor shrine visit remark]", ''CHINAdaily.com.cn'', 29 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mainichi Daily News]]'' reported that on 9 March 2006 he referred to [[Taiwan]] as a "law-abiding country", which drew strong protest from [[Beijing]], which considers the island a part of [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20060309p2a00m0na026000c.html MDN.mainichi-msn.co.jp]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 2008, ''[[Shimbun Akahata|Akahata]]'', the daily newspaper published by [[Japanese Communist Party]] released a compiled list of these and other statements as the front-page article criticizing Asō.&lt;ref name="asogaffe"&gt;[http://www.jcp.or.jp/akahata/aik07/2008-09-23/2008092302_03_0.html "新総裁 麻生氏 発言録"], ''しんぶん赤旗'', Japanese Communist Party, 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This compilation as well as similar lists of blunders have been frequently cited in the Japanese media.

''[[Yahoo! News]]'' reported that he had said on 9 January 2009, "To work is good. It's completely different thinking from the Old Testament."&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo, [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090108/lf_afp/japanpoliticsculturereligionoffbeat_newsmlmmd "World religions can learn from Japan: PM]", ''Yahoo!News'', 9 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While speaking at a meeting of the National Council on Social Security Reform, in 2013, Asō referred to patients suffering from serious illness as "tube persons" and remarked that they should be "allowed to die quickly" if they desired it. "Heaven forbid I should be kept alive if I want to die", he is quoted as saying. "You cannot sleep well when you think it's all paid by the government. This won't be solved unless you let them hurry up and die."&lt;ref&gt;"Japanese deputy PM sorry for harsh remarks about seniors." Ottawa Citizen. (January 23, 2013 Wednesday ): 174 words. Web. Date Accessed: 2017/10/30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, while campaigning in Sapporo for the general election, Asō said that rising social welfare costs were not solely due to an aging population. He said, "There are many people who are creating the image that (the increasing number of) elderly people is bad, but more problematic is people who don't give birth",. The comment was labeled as insensitive to those who are not able to have children for biological or economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;"Gaffe-prone Taro Aso puts his foot in it again." China Daily. (December 9, 2014 Tuesday ): 260 words. Web. Date Accessed: 2017/10/30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aso caused a stir in June 2018 when he boasted that the large support towards the LDP among voters under 35 in the [[Japanese general election, 2017|2017 general election]] was due to the demographics being illiterate about the news and current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/24/national/politics-diplomacy/aso-says-ldp-garners-support-young-voters-not-read-newspapers-often/ "In media jab, beleaguered Finance Minister Taro Aso ties lack of young newspaper readers to LDP’s ‘popularity’" - [[Kyodo News]] via the [[Japan Times]] - 24 June 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Aso downplayed alleged sexual harassment charges against his ministry’s top bureaucrat by saying that “there is no such thing as a sexual harassment charge”. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/08/national/japanese-protest-taro-asos-sexual-harassment-comments/|title=Taro Aso repeats comment on alleged sexual harassment that sparked nationwide protest one day earlier|date=2018-05-08|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to comment on a formal complaint submitted to his ministry on the alleged sexual harassment, Aso-san’s remarked that his “only thought was that it would have been easier to read if they used a bigger font” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-20/on-sexual-harassment-complaint-japan-s-aso-objects-to-font-size|title=Japanese Official Says Font Size on Sexual Harassment Complaint Was Too Small|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aso Mining POWs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Australian]] [[POW]]s forced to work at the Aso mining company, photographed in August 1945.]]In mid-2008 Asō conceded that his family's coal mine, Aso Mining Company, was alleged to have forced [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to work in the mines in 1945 without pay. Western media reported that 300 prisoners, including 197 Australians, 101 [[United Kingdom|British]], and two [[Netherlands|Dutch]], worked in the mine. Two of the Australians, John Watson and Leslie Edgar George Wilkie, died while working in the Aso mine.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, William, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070529zg.html Aso Mining's POW labor: the evidence]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 10,000 Korean conscripts worked in the mine between 1939 and 1945 under severe, brutal conditions in which many of them died or were injured while receiving little pay. The company, now known as the Aso Group, is run by Asō's younger brother. Asō's wife serves on its [[board of directors]]. Asō headed the company in the 1970s before going into politics.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, William, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20081028zg.html WWII forced labor issue dogs Aso, Japanese firms]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 October 2008, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on a request from [[Yukihisa Fujita]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Foreign Ministry]] investigated and announced on 18 December 2008 that Aso Mining had, in fact, used 300 Allied POWs at its mine during World War II. The ministry confirmed that two Australians had died while working at the mine, but declined to release their names or causes of deaths for "privacy reasons". Said Fujita, "Prisoner policy is important in many ways for diplomacy, and it is a major problem that the issue has been neglected for so long."&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Masami, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081219a1.html It's official: Aso family mine used POW labor]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 19 December 2008, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Asō has not responded to requests from former laborers to apologize for the way they were treated by his family's company.&lt;ref&gt;"Ito, Masami, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090619a3.html Pair seek POW apology from Aso]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 20 June 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reading mistakes===
The Japanese media noted in November 2008 that Asō often mispronounced or incorrectly read [[kanji]] words written in his speeches, even though many of the words are commonly used in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters "[http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=226060 Japan PM Faces Reading Test As Popularity Sags] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201023132/http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=226060 |date=1 February 2009 }}", "Javno", 20 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Asō spoke of the speaking errors to reporters on 12 November 2008 saying, "Those were just reading errors, just mistakes."&lt;ref&gt;Hongo, Jun, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081114a4.html Aso raises eyebrows with nonwords and wrong words]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Asō's tendency for malapropisms has led comparisons to [[George W.

An anatomy professor from the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Takeshi Yoro]], speculated that Asō could possibly suffer from [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/200811/g2008112601_all.html 誤読連発の麻生は「読字障害」？ 養老孟司氏が分析]&lt;!-- Dead Link --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonaka incident===
In 2001, Asō, along with [[Hiromu Nonaka]], was among the LDP's chief candidates to succeed [[Yoshirō Mori]] as prime minister of Japan. During a meeting of LDP leaders at which Nonaka was not present, Asō reportedly told the assembled group, "We are not going to let someone from the buraku become the prime minister, are we?" Asō's remark was apparently a reference to Nonaka's [[burakumin]], a social [[minority group]] in Japan, heritage.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"&gt;Yamaguchi, Mari, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090125a2.html Discrimination claims die hard in Japan]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 25 January 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonaka subsequently withdrew as a candidate. Asō eventually lost the appointment to [[Jun'ichirō Koizumi]]. Asō's comment about Nonaka's heritage was revealed in 2005. Asō denied that he had made the statement, but [[Hisaoki Kamei]], who was present at the 2001 meeting, stated in January 2009 that he had heard Asō say something, "to that effect". Nonaka said that he would "never forgive" Asō for the comment and went on to state that Asō was a "misery" to Japan.&lt;ref name="search.japantimes.co.jp"/&gt;

==Personal life==

===Fondness for fine dining===
In October 2008, the Japanese media reported that Asō dined-out or drank in restaurants and bars in luxury hotels almost nightly. When asked about it, Asō stated, "I won't change my style. Luckily I have my money and can afford it." Asō added that if he went anywhere else, he would have to be accompanied by security guards which would cause trouble.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "Aso gets riled when quizzed over swanky wining, dining", reported in the ''[[Japan Times]]'', 23 October 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', Asō dined-out or drank at bars 32 times in September 2008, mainly at exclusive hotels. Asō's predecessor, Yasuo Fukuda, dined-out only seven times in his first month in office. Both of the LDP's opposition parties have called Asō's frequent outings inappropriate. Asō's [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]], [[Jun Matsumoto (politician)|Jun Matsumoto]], commented on the issue by saying that Asō's frequent trips to restaurants, "is his lifestyle and philosophy, and I am not in a position to express my opinion. If only there were more appropriate places when considering security issues and not causing trouble for other customers."&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Masami, "Aso defends his high-flying social life," ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 October 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manga fan===
Asō argues that embracing Japanese pop culture can be an important step to cultivating ties with other countries, hoping that manga will act as a bridge to the world.&lt;ref name="bbc2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6991720.stm|title=Manga shares gain on leader hopes|accessdate=22 December 2007|date=12 September 2007|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is referred to as an [[otaku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=「御宅族」行「漫畫外交」受年輕人追捧 ("Otaku"'s "Manga diplomacy" celebrated by youngsters)|newspaper=Wenweipo|date=23 September 2008|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2008/09/23/GJ0809230014.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asō has been a fan of [[manga]] since childhood. He had his family send manga magazines from Japan while he was studying at Stanford University.&lt;ref name="Taro Aso talks about comics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chikuhou.or.jp/aso-taro/newspaper/030702-1.html|title=麻生太郎　コミックを語る (Taro Aso talks about comics)|accessdate=22 December 2007|date=2 July 2003|work=Big Comic Original|publisher=Shogakukan (original publisher), ''Aso Taro Office'' (copy)|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211173718/http://www.chikuhou.or.jp/aso-taro/newspaper/030702-1.html|archivedate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he described reading about 10 or 20 manga magazines every week (making up only part of Asō's voracious reading) and talked about his impression of various manga extemporaneously.&lt;ref name="Taro Aso talks about comics"/&gt; In 2007, as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], he established the [[International Manga Award]] for non-Japanese [[mangaka|manga artists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Manga Award|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/culture/manga/index.html|accessdate=22 July 2007|publisher=The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219112004/http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/culture/manga/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=19 December 2007}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech by Minister for Foreign Affairs Taro Aso at Digital Hollywood University|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/fm/aso/speech0604-2.html|accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Launches International Manga Award|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/10648.html|accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that he was seen reading the manga ''[[Rozen Maiden]]'' in [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]], which earned him the [[sobriquet]] "His Excellency Rozen".&lt;ref&gt;Nakajima, Makoto. (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=MWLBMWGsWo0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=taro+aso&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a ''The Akiba: A Manga Guide to Akihabara,'' p. 25.]&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted in an interview that he had read the manga; however, he said he did not remember whether he had read it in an airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechabi Vol. 1|url=http://shop.kodansha.jp/bc2_bc/search_view.jsp?b=1795910|chapter=麻生太郎「直撃!　ローゼンメイデン疑惑?」 (Rozen Maiden suspicion: Interview with Aso Taro)|date=2 June 2006|publisher=Kodansha|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-06-179591-4}};{{cite book|script-title=ja:自由と繁栄の弧|pages=296–305|date=June 2007|author=Taro Aso|publisher=Gentosha|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-344-01333-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fan of ''[[Golgo 13]]'', a long-running manga about an assassin for hire.&lt;ref name="28 December 2012"/&gt;

Asō's candidacy for the position of Japanese Prime Minister actually caused share-value to rise among some manga publishers and companies related to the manga industry.&lt;ref name="bbc2007"/&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Chigai kuginuki.svg|thumb|right|160px|''([[Mon (crest)|Chigai Kuginuki]])'', The [[Mon (badge)|mon]] of the [[Asō clan]]]]
As a Roman Catholic, Asō belongs to the small minority of [[Christianity in Japan|Japanese Christians]], but he has not emphasized his religiosity. Asō is the seventh Christian prime minister of Japan, after [[Takashi Hara]], [[Korekiyo Takahashi]], [[Tetsu Katayama]], [[Ichirō Hatoyama]], [[Masayoshi Ōhira]], and his own grandfather [[Shigeru Yoshida]].&lt;ref name="carrer"&gt;{{it icon}} Carrcer, Stefano.

On occasion of his 2009 new year visit to the [[Shintoism|Shinto]] [[Ise Shrine]], Asō publicly performed the hand-clapping in front of the shrine, stating later that he had "prayed for the good of the Japanese people".&lt;ref&gt;NHK evening news, 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1248">The '''Temple of the Seven Rishis''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Храм Семи Риши, ''Chram Semi Rishi'') is a  [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple located near [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and consecrated to the [[Saptarishi]] ("Seven Sages"), the patriarchs of the Vedic religion, embodiments of the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] constellation. The temple is also dedicated to Lord [[Dattatreya]] (the [[Trimurti]]), other Vedic or Hindu gods, and on its ground there are also statues of [[Greek gods]].

The temple was built between 2009 and 2010 as part of the "Collection of Mysteries" (Russian: Собрание Тайн, ''Sobraniye Tayn'') monastery on the "Divya Loka" (Russian: Дивья Лока) compound. One of the few of its kind, it is built according to the styles of [[Russian architecture]] with [[Classical architecture|Classical]] elements, and shows traditional Hindu and Vedic religious themes and symbols in a European guise.

"'''The Orange and the Green'''" or "'''The Biggest Mix-Up'''" is a humorous [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] song about a man whose father was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ("Orange") and whose mother was a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] ("Green"). It describes the man's trials as the product of [[interfaith marriage in Christianity|religious intermarriage]] and how "mixed up" he became as a result of such an upbringing.

This song was written by Anthony Murphy of [[Liverpool]], and has been recorded by bands such as [[The Irish Rovers]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], [[Paddy Reilly]], and the [[Brobdingnagian Bards]], among others. It is sung to the same tune as "[[The Wearing of the Green]]", which is also used in "[[The Rising of the Moon]]", another Irish ballad.

==History==
Liverpool, home to a great many Irish immigrants, has a large number of Catholics. On the other hand, the Protestant [[Orange Order]] is also very strong. The Orange Lodge marches every year in July, with bands of [[fife (instrument)|fifes]], drums and [[bagpipes]], to celebrate the victory of Protestant [[William III of England|King William of Orange]] over Catholic [[James II of England|King James II]], on 12 July 1690.

[[Image:Visionvoice.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Vision and the Voice'' by [[Aleister Crowley]].]]
'''''The Vision and the Voice''''' (Liber 418) chronicles the mystical journey of [[Aleister Crowley]] (1875–1947) as he explored the 30 [[Enochian]] Æthyrs originally developed by Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] in the 16th century. These visions took place at two times: in 1900 during his stay in [[Mexico]], and later in 1909 in [[Algeria]] in the company of poet [[Victor Benjamin Neuburg]]. Of all his works, Crowley considered this book to be second in importance behind ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the text that established his religious and philosophical system of [[Thelema]] in 1904. 

''The Vision and the Voice'' is the source of many of the central spiritual doctrines of Thelema, especially in the visions of [[Babalon]] and her consort [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] (the "All-Father"), as well as an account of how an individual might cross the [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]], thereby assuming the title of [[A∴A∴|"Master of the Temple"]] and taking a place in the [[City of the Pyramids]] under the [[Night of Pan]].
