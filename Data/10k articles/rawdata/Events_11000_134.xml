      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2192">''The Allegany County Fairgrounds'' is located just west of [[Cumberland, Maryland]] along McMullen Highway.  Throughout the year the fairground holds musical concerts, car races, and private events.  Once a year the [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany County]] fair is held on the grounds, called the '''Allegany County Fair and AgExpo'''. As of 2006, the annual fair is an 8-day event customarily in the middle of July.  Another major event is '''[http://delfest.com/ DelFest]''', a 4-day [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] festival originated by [[Del McCoury]], and held annually since 2008 over the [[Memorial Day]] weekend.

==Criticism==
There has been criticism of the cost of the Allegany county Government ownership of the fairgrounds. Complaints result from lack of air conditioning below the grandstand during the summer. Other complaints result from lack of parking section signs.

==Ownership==
Since 1985 the fairgrounds have been under Allegany County Government ownership. Prior to 1985 the fairgrounds was owned by numerous private individuals and a horse racing company once owned the fairgrounds. Also in 2011 after the big 2010 Elections some individuals that gave the county commissioners budget suggestions including on the fairgrounds. Under the fairgrounds there has been suggestion of partially privatisation to full private ownership of the fairgrounds prior to 1985 to save Allegany County Government nearly $500,000 in the full long run that would not begin a search until after the 2011 Allegany county Fair. There has also been stories of a potential horse racing returning to the fairgrounds with full-fledged indoor gambling that would result in the fairgrounds ceasing as a fairgrounds altogether due to possible better revenue in gambling and horse racing all year long.

The '''Ardee Baroque Festival''' is a celebration of music from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which takes place each November in the historic market town of [[Ardee]], [[County Louth]], [[Republic Of Ireland]]. 
}}

The '''Ardee Baroque Festival''' is a celebration of music from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which takes place each November in the historic market town of [[Ardee]], [[County Louth]], [[Republic Of Ireland]].

The festival is an initiative of the Arts Service of Louth Local Authorities and first took place in 2004. Since its inception, Ardee Baroque has hosted the [[Irish Baroque Orchestra]] for the week preceding the performances, as they rehearse two new concert programmes, and deliver an outreach programme which sees the players perform in schools, day-care centres and other community venues. As well as the Irish Baroque Orchestra, Ardee Baroque has hosted performers such as Fionnuala Moynihan, [[New York Polyphony]], Opus Anglicanum, [[Dunedin Consort]] and Resurgam.

The Board of  Ardee Baroque is drawn from the local community and works in partnership with the Arts Service in programming, managing and marketing the festival. With financial support from the Arts Council/An Chomhairle Ealaíonn, the festival has grown and developed from small beginnings to become an established weekend on the cultural calendar of north east Ireland. Ardee Baroque has received positive reviews for many of its performances. It has been referred to by ''The Irish Times'' as "a music festival that could hold its head up anywhere", and described by ''The Sunday Times'' thus - "Of all the boutique music festivals staged around Ireland, the annual celebration of baroque music in the Co Louth town of Ardee is surely the most quaint."

The '''Argyllshire Gathering''' is a [[Highland games]] held in [[Oban]], [[Scotland]].

==History==
A meeting on 23 August 1871 held at the Argyll Arms Hotel led to a resolution to have an "Annual Gathering of the Gentry of the County of Argyll for social purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obangames.com/?page_id=200 |title=History |publisher=Oban Games |date= |accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pph&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://pipingpress.com/argyllshire-gathering-how-it-all-began/ |title=Argyllshire Gathering – How it All Began |publisher=piping press |date= |accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ot&gt;{{cite web |url=https://i0.wp.com/pipingpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Oban-Games-advert.gif |title=Argyllshire Gathering |publisher=pipingpress.com |accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be called the Argyllshire Gathering and was funded by member subscriptions.&lt;ref name=ot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deriv.nls.uk/dcn23/8183/81834616.23.pdf |title=Rules of the Argyllshire Gathering |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Gathering was held in 1873.&lt;ref name=hes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB47127 |title=Breadalblane Street.

The Highland Society of London donated a [[Gold Medal (piping)|Gold Medal]], which along with the Gold Medal also donated to the [[Northern Meeting]] is one of the most prestigious prizes in solo piping. [[Faye Henderson]] won the Gold Medal in 2010, becoming the first woman to win the Gold Medal at either Oban or Inverness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/squeezed-out-by-the-men-not-any-more-as-faye-18-wins-piping-prize-1-809533 |title=Squeezed out by the men?

The Argyllshire Gathering Halls are at a site on Breadalbane Street in Oban, and were built to accommodate the ball held after the gathering. The current building is a category C listed building built towards the end of the 19th century to replace a timber structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/233611/oban-breadalbane-street-the-argyllshire-gathering-halls |title=Oban, Breadalbane Street, The Argyllshire Gathering Halls |publisher=Canmore |date=2011-09-09 |accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/200394511-oban-breadalbane-street-the-argyllshire-gathering-halls-oban |title=Oban, Breadalbane Street, the Argyllshire Gathering Halls |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gathering is normally held in late August, one or two weeks before the [[Northern Meeting]] in [[Inverness]]. Many pipers come to Scotland to compete in both events.&lt;ref name=tw&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pipesdrums.com/article/2012-Northern-Meeting-moves-two-weeks-out-from-Oban/|date=31 October 2011|title=2012 Northern Meeting moves two weeks out from Oban|publisher=pipesdrums.com|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piping competition==

[[Image:Assembly2004-areena01.jpg|thumb|300px|Overview of the Assembly 2004 party hall.]]
The '''Assembly demoparty''' is a [[demoscene]] and gaming [[demoparty|event]] in [[Finland]]. The main organizers of the event are Pekka Aakko (''Pehu'' of [[Accession (demo group)|Accession]]) and Jussi Laakkonen (''Abyss'' of [[Future Crew]]). The Summer event takes place every year between late July and early August, and lasts three to four days, and the Winter event is held in January or February. The most recent Assembly was held from 3 to 6 August 2018 at [[Helsinki Exhibition and Convention Centre|Messukeskus]] in [[Helsinki]].

Assembly Winter was announced in early 2007. The winter party is a more gaming oriented [[LAN party]] type event where as the summer events continues the traditions of the original [[demoparty]] under the name Assembly Summer. Both parties are held once a year.

== History ==
The first Assembly was held from July 24 to July 26, 1992, in [[Kauniainen]]. It was organized by the [[Amiga]] [[demogroup|demo groups]] Complex and Rebels, and the [[IBM PC|PC]] demo group [[Future Crew]]. The staff grew into a large non-profit group of individuals known as Assembly Organizing. Through the 1990s, Assembly grew so large that even exposition halls no longer sufficed, and only the largest of sports arenas met the partygoers' needs. In 1999 they rented the largest sports arena in the country, [[Hartwall Areena]] in [[Helsinki]], with over 5000 visitors and 3500 computers on the [[ice rink]].

The 2004 edition of the party also set up a record: in July 2004, [[QuakeCon]] announced it was holding the world's first [[Doom 3]] competitions on the event starting on August 12–14, roughly a week after the game's release on August 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quakecon.org/forums/showthread.php?p=20891 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626072312/http://www.quakecon.org/forums/showthread.php?p=20891 |archivedate=2006-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assembly, however, managed to snatch the first place after acquiring copies of the game via [[FedEx]] with the help of some contacts in the [[United States]] and holding the competition during August 5–8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.assembly.org/press/assembly2004_doom3_eng.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719154204/http://media.assembly.org/press/assembly2004_doom3_eng.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |title=ASSEMBLY 2004 |website=Web.archive.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017 the party has been held for 25 consecutive years.

==Boozembly==
[[Image:Boozembly_2005.JPG|thumb|300px|Boozembly 2005]]
Since the year 1995 an event called Boozembly has been organized in a nearby forest. It is officially unrelated to Assembly but serves as a meeting point for Assembly attendees as well as for other computer hobbyists and their friends. In Boozembly it is possible to use intoxicants which is not allowed in Assembly. Later IT corporations started to sponsor free beer for Boozembly. Like Assembly, Boozembly itself has become an important part of Finnish demoscene culture.&lt;ref&gt;Assembly special number of Skrolli computer culture magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitions ==
[[Image:Assembly demo party 2002 panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Panorama view over the Assembly 2002 event.]]
The party includes multiple competitions, or [[compo (slang word)|compos]] including but not limited to:

* [[Demo (computer programming)|Demo]]

For the first eight years of Assembly, the demo and intro competitions were split into separate [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] and [[Commodore Amiga|Amiga]] categories. Starting in 2000, the [[platform (computing)|platform]]s have been combined, with PC (Windows or [[Linux]]), Amiga, [[Macintosh|Mac]] and even high-end [[video game console|console]]s competing in the same demo and intro competitions. Similarly, [[Commodore 64]] competitions were replaced with "oldskool" competitions that also allow entries for some other old platforms, such as various [[8-bit]] systems and older Amigas.

Entries are submitted by demogroups and individual artists and are rated by judges. All demos which are deemed to be of a high enough standard are then shown on a big screen. Entries which break the competition rules (e.g. use [[copyright]]ed material, or aren't suitable for the category to which they are entered) are disqualified. People who are present at the arena vote for the entries, and the results are published on the Assembly website. The entries are usually made available by the artists at [[scene.org]] or on the artists own website.

Assembly's demo competitions generally hold a very high level, especially for a party that is not specific to the demoscene. Notable winners include ''Lifeforce'' by ASD, ''Panic Room'' by Fairlight and ''Frameranger'' by Fairlight, CNCD and Orange.

==AssemblyTV==
In recent years, Assembly has broadcast content from its in-house media effort [[AssemblyTV]] to local and national TV networks, as well as producing web streams for people to watch live over the internet — spots for hundreds, if not thousands of viewers are catered for and these streams have been watched all over the world, not just in Finland. In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies, the competitions and party reports, the educational sessions that are being held during the party are broadcast via AssemblyTV as well.

==ARTtech seminars==
ARTtech seminars are free to attend educational seminar sessions that are being held during the party at the venue location. The sessions cover various subjects that are usually related to the main party theme and idea, including sessions about programming (coding), graphic design, music composition, game development, hardware hacks, scene history and more.

'''''Attack on Fear''''' is a 1984 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[Drama (genre)|drama film]] starring [[Paul Michael Glaser]], [[Linda Kelsey]], [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] and [[Barbara Babcock]] which premiered on [[CBS]] on October 10, 1984. The teleplay by [[T. S. Cook|T.S. Cook]] is based on the 1980 book ''The Light on Synanon: How a Country Weekly Exposed a Corporate Cult'' written by [[David V. Mitchell|Dave Mitchell]], Cathy Mitchell and [[Richard Ofshe]].

==Overview==
[[Paul Michael Glaser]] and [[Linda Kelsey]] portray Dave and Cathy Mitchell, the new owners of a small-circulation weekly newspaper called ''[[The Point Reyes Light]]'' in [[Marin County, California]]. Upon hearing of iniquities at the famed [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] drug rehabilitation center [[Synanon]], the Mitchells begin publishing their evidence. Despite legal pressure from Synanon and bizarre anonymously mailed threats, the Mitchells' story results in a major investigation of the revered institution.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/10/arts/cbs-s-attack-on-fear.html|title=CBS's Attack-on-Fear - NYTimes.com|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Attack on Fear'' was completed in 1982, it was not telecast until October 1984 and then only after being reshaped to satisfy Synanon's battery of attorneys.

When Zengi became ruler of Mosul in 1127 and Aleppo in 1128, the Crusaders were faced with a dangerous opponent. For several years afterward, Zengi gained power at the expense of neighboring Muslim states. By occasionally allying itself with the Latin [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the Muslim emirate of [[Damascus]] successfully resisted Zengi's efforts to conquer that city. 

==Battle==
In early 1137, Zengi invested the castle of Ba'rin, about 10 miles northwest of [[Homs]]. When King Fulk marched with his host to raise the siege, his army was attacked and scattered by Zengi's forces. Nothing is known about the battle. The Christian chronicler [[William of Tyre]] "gave no tactical information, and neither did the Arab historians."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 182&lt;/ref&gt; 

After their defeat, Fulk and some of the survivors took refuge in Ba'rin castle, which Zengi surrounded again. "When they ran out of food they ate their horses, and then they were forced to ask for terms."&lt;ref name="Gabrieli, p 43"&gt;Gabrieli, p 43&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, large numbers of Christian pilgrims had rallied to the army of [[Byzantine]] Emperor [[John II Comnenus]], [[Raymond of Antioch]] and [[Joscelin II of Edessa]]. 

With this host approaching the castle, Zengi suddenly granted Fulk and the other besieged Franks terms. In return for their freedom and evacuation of the castle, a ransom was set at 50000 dinar. The Franks, unaware of the imminent arrival of the large relieving army, accepted Zengi's offer.&lt;ref name="Gabrieli, p 43" /&gt; 

==Aftermath==

In April 1137, John Comnenus laid siege to [[Shaizar]] but his efforts came to nothing when Zengi relieved the city in May. Ba'rin was never recovered by the Franks.

The '''Battle of the Beanfield''' took place over several hours on 1 June 1985, when [[Wiltshire Police]] prevented [[New Age Travellers#Peace Convoy|The Peace Convoy]], a [[convoy]] of several hundred [[New Age travellers]], from setting up the 1985 [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] in [[Wiltshire]], England. The police were enforcing a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] injunction obtained by the authorities prohibiting the 1985 festival from taking place.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; Around 1,300 police officers took part in the operation against approximately 600 travellers.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;

The convoy of travellers heading for [[Stonehenge]] encountered resistance at a police road block seven miles from the landmark. Police claim that some traveller vehicles then rammed police vehicles in an attempt to push through the roadblock.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; Around the same time police smashed the windows of the convoy's vehicles and some travellers were arrested. The rest broke into an adjacent field and a stand-off consequently developed that persisted for several hours.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; According to the BBC "Police said they came under attack, being pelted with lumps of wood, stones and even petrol bombs".&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBChippies /&gt; Conversely, ''[[The Guardian]]'' states the travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting so "was false".&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;

Eventually the police launched another attack during which the worst of the violence is purported to have taken place. According to ''The Observer'', during this period pregnant women and those holding babies were clubbed by police with truncheons and the police were hitting "anybody they could reach". When some of the travellers tried to escape by driving away through the fields, ''The Observer'' states that the police threw truncheons, shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them in an attempt to stop them.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;

Dozens of travellers were injured,&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; 8 police officers and 16 travellers were hospitalised.&lt;ref name="hippyturbines" /&gt; 537 travellers were eventually arrested.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; This represents one of the largest mass arrest of civilians since at least the [[Second World War]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; possibly one of the biggest in English legal history.&lt;ref name="peoples-songs" /&gt;

Two years after the event, a Wiltshire police sergeant was found guilty of [[Actual Bodily Harm]] as a consequence of injuries incurred by a member of the convoy during the Battle of the Beanfield.&lt;ref name=BBChippies&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2493000/2493267.stm Hippies clash with police at Stonehenge] (1985), ''BBC News archive'' Accessed 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1991 a civil court judgement awarded 21 of the travellers £24,000 in damages for false imprisonment, damage to property and wrongful arrest.&lt;ref name=BBChippies /&gt; The award was swallowed by their legal bill as the judge did not award them legal costs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Background==

The British [[New Age Travellers]] movement developed in the 1970s with the intended purpose of attempting to create an alternative way of life. Travellers maintained themselves partly by travelling between, organising and trading at [[free festival]]s.&lt;ref name=newold&gt;{{cite web|title=New Travellers, Old Story | url=http://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/tcs/research_docs/Heritage%20pack_v5.pdf|publisher=The Children's Society|accessdate= 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stay with [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|CND]] demonstrators, one group of travellers came to be known as ''The Peace Convoy''.&lt;ref name=newold /&gt;
[[Image:Stonehenge84.jpg|thumb|right|Festival goers inside the [[stone circle]] at the 1984 [[Stonehenge Free Festival]].]] The free festival scene thus also emerged in the 1970s. The [[Windsor Free Festival|People's Free Festival]] at [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor]] ran from 1972 until 1974 when it was violently aborted by the authorities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] began in 1974. In 1975 the Windsor festival switched to [[Watchfield#Watchfield Festival 1975|Watchfield]] but did not prove successful at the abandoned military site. Consequently, The People's Free Festival at [[Stonehenge]], became the focal point of the movement. In 1980, the Festival was marred by significant violence, largely by biker groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/henge-history-80.html | title= Stonehenge free festival history 80s| work=UK Rock Festivals| accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] passed management of Stonehenge and the surrounding land to [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref name="Chippindale, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chippindale|first=Christopher|title=Stoned Henge: Events and Issues at the Summer Solstice, 1985|journal=World Archaeology|date=June 1986|issue = 18, 1|series=Perspectives in World Archaeology|pages=38–58|jstor=124661|doi=10.1080/00438243.1986.9979988}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time the festival had grown in size, the attendance figure for the 1984 festival was estimated at 100,000.&lt;ref name="newold"/&gt; Due to the high attendance figures there was little authority present at Stonehenge festivals and the police were unable to shut them down or implement the law. Consequently, most illegal drugs were unrestrictedly available and advertised for purchase. Traders at the festival were neglecting to obtain licences or pay taxes.&lt;ref name="newold"/&gt;

Critics claimed that the 1984 festival had resulted in the destruction of archaeological information and on the site itself, "holes had been dug in [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|barrows]] for [[latrines]] and as [[earth oven|bread ovens]], motorcycles had been ridden over them, churning the surface. Fences had been torn down, and a thousand young trees cut down for firewood".&lt;ref name="Chippindale, 1986"/&gt; The clean-up cost upwards of £20,000, besides the archaeological information that was lost.&lt;ref name="Chippindale, 1986"/&gt; Landowners also claimed that damage to Stonehenge, other property damage, trespassing, recreational drug use and bathing naked in rivers had occurred during the festival.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt;

A civil high court injunction was consequently imposed prohibiting the proposed 1985 festival from taking place.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt;

==Main events==
After staying the previous night in [[Savernake Forest]], the Convoy on the morning of 1 June numbered up to 140 vehicles, most of them buses and vans converted into living spaces; it is estimated they contained 600 people.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Tony |title=Twenty years after, mystery still clouds Battle of the Beanfield |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/12/ukcrime.tonythompson |accessdate=19 January 2015 |work=The Observer |location=London |date=12 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-faded"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hallett |first=Emma |title=Summer solstice: How the Stonehenge battles faded |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-27405147 |accessdate=19 January 2015 |work=BBC News |date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police had laid down an exclusion zone 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) around the perimeter of [[Stonehenge]], which the convoy hoped to breach. The Convoy met resistance when the police set up a [[roadblock]] near [[Shipton Bellinger]] about 7 miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) from Stonehenge. This was achieved by tipping three lorry loads of gravel across the road. According to ''The Observer'', the convoy evaded the main roadblock on the A303 by slipping down a side road but were then met with a second roadblock.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; At this juncture the police claim that some traveller vehicles rammed police vehicles in an attempt to escape the roadblock.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Worthington&gt;Ed. Andy Worthington, 2005, ''The Battle of the Beanfield'', Enabler Publications, {{ISBN|0-9523316-6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time the police smashed the windscreens of traveller vehicles and arrested occupants.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Worthington/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/henge-85.html | title= Stonehenge free festival - 1985 - The Battle of the Beanfield| work=UK Rock Festivals| accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traveller vehicles broke into an adjacent field,&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; by driving through a hedgerow according to one source.&lt;ref name=Worthington/&gt; A stand-off consequently ensued.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; Travellers made attempts to negotiate with police&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; but the officer in charge, [[Assistant Chief Constable]] Lionel Grundy, ordered that all travellers be arrested.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; There were outbreaks of violence during which several members of the Convoy received head injuries. An ambulance was allowed through to take them to hospital.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |last=Templeton |first=Tom |title=What happened next? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/feb/22/features.magazine27 |accessdate=19 January 2015 |work=The Observer |location=London |date=22 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police Officer Bernie Lund, who was on scene, claimed that during the stand-off, petrol bombs and sticks were thrown at officers.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; However ''[[The Guardian]]'' states that travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting that they were "was false".&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;

At 7pm officers in riot gear entered the field and launched a final attack.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Pregnant women and those holding babies were hit by police with truncheons according to ''The Observer'',&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; who also noted journalist Nick Davies stating that police were hitting "anybody (that) they could reach".&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; When some travellers tried to escape by driving away through the field police allegedly threw truncheons, shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them to stop them.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; ''The Observer'' and ''The Independent'' report that travellers' vehicles were smashed and set on fire.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;&lt;ref name=scars&gt;{{cite news |last=Akbar |first=Arifa |title=Twenty years on, the peace-loving festival fans still bear the scars of the Battle of the Beanfield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/twenty-years-on-the-peaceloving-festival-fans-still-bear-the-scars-of-the-battle-of-the-beanfield-495981.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=21 June 2005 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight police officers and sixteen travellers were hospitalised.&lt;ref name=hippyturbines /&gt; One traveller was taken away with a suspected fractured skull.&lt;ref name=operationsolstice /&gt;

The large majority of the travellers, over 500, were arrested&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; on suspicion of [[obstructing police]] and obstructing the [[highway]].&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; One source states that this represented the largest mass arrest of civilians in English legal history,&lt;ref name="peoples-songs" /&gt; another that it was the biggest figure since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; There were insufficient holding cells in local jails to hold all those arrested. Convoy members were transported throughout the Midlands and even to northern England. Not all children and parents ended up in the same region.&lt;ref name="peoples-songs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Worthington/&gt; Most of the arrests did not result in successful prosecutions.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;

Traveller Alan Lodge, speaking to the BBC, described it as "an ambush that happened on a small, mild mannered bunch of people".&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt;

The [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|UK miners' strike]] had ended earlier in the same year, and police compared this event with tactics used at the Battle of the Beanfield, stating: "The Police operation had been planned for several months and lessons in rapid deployment learned from the miners' strike were implemented."&lt;ref name="peoples-songs" /&gt;

==Witnesses==
Most independent eyewitness accounts of the events relate that the police used violent tactics against men, women and children, including pregnant women; and purposely damaged the vehicles used by the convoy.&lt;ref name="brutality"&gt;[http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/?page_id=4 The Battle of the Beanfield], ''Edited by Andy Worthington'' Accessed 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Solstice dawns over Stonehenge |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1398810.stm |accessdate=21 January 2015 |work=BBC News |date=21 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earl of Cardigan===
The travellers had departed from [[Savernake Forest]], which is owned by the [[David Brudenell-Bruce, Earl of Cardigan|Earl of Cardigan]]'s family.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; The Earl of Cardigan decided to follow the convoy on his motorbike.&lt;ref name=scars /&gt; The Earl describes that during the initial confrontation there were negotiations with police who insisted that the travellers would not be allowed to pass. The travellers subsequently began entering into a field. Then "Police rushed out on foot, from behind their barricades. Clutching drawn truncheons and riot shields, they ran round to the driver's door of each vehicle, slamming their truncheons into the bodywork to make a deafening noise, and shouting at every driver, 'get out, get out, hand over your keys, get out'".&lt;ref name=scars /&gt; He states that police "smashing up vehicles" and instructions to "Get out!" often happened simultaneously, giving travellers no time to react before police used riot sticks to break the vehicles' windscreens.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt; Cardigan described seeing a very pregnant woman being "repeatedly clubbed on the head" by police, many of whom had their ID numbers covered up.&lt;ref name="independent-cardigan" /&gt; He also saw Police with hammers smashing up the dashboards of several of the now-abandoned motor-coach homes.

Cardigan also described how he was approached by the police the following day, who wanted permission to remove travellers who were still at Savernake: "They said they wanted to go into the campsite 'suitably equipped' and 'finish unfinished business'. Make of that phrase what you will. I said to them, that if it was my permission they were after, they did not have it. I did not want a repeat of the grotesque events that I'd seen the day before."&lt;ref name="celebration-worthington" /&gt;

===Journalists===
[[ITN]] Reporter Kim Sabido was at the scene and recorded a piece-to-camera in which he claimed that he had witnessed "some of the most brutal police treatment of people" that he had seen in his entire career as a journalist. He also remarked on the number of people that had been "clubbed" by police including those "holding babies in their arms". He felt that an inquiry should be held into what had happened. Sabido later claimed that when he went back to the ITN library to look at the [[dailies|rushes]], most of the footage had "disappeared, particularly some of the nastier shots."&lt;ref name=operationsolstice&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7b7b6f38 Operation Solstice (1991)]], documentary first broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in Nov 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this missing footage was later rediscovered and incorporated into ''Operation Solstice'' a documentary shown on [[Channel 4]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="operationsolstice"/&gt;

[[Nick Davies]] reported for the ''Observer'' that "There was glass breaking, people screaming, black smoke towering out of burning caravans and everywhere there seemed to be people being bashed and flattened and pulled by the hair. Men, women and children were led away, shivering, swearing, crying, bleeding, leaving their homes in pieces."&lt;ref name="peoples-songs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maconie|first1=Stuart|title=The People's Songs|date=2013|publisher=Ebury Press (Random House Group)|isbn=9780091933807|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_q4rAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=There+was+glass+breaking,+people+screaming,+black+smoke+towering+out+of+burning+caravans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jmp6VOnDKcqR7AbBzIDwCQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=There%20was%20glass%20breaking%2C%20people%20screaming%2C%20black%20smoke%20towering%20out%20of%20burning%20caravans&amp;f=false|accessdate= 11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freelance photographer Ben Gibson, engaged by ''[[The Observer]]'' that day, was arrested and charged with obstructing a police officer. He was later acquitted.&lt;ref name="british-journal-photo"&gt;{{cite journal|title=British Journal of Photography|date=1985|volume=132|issue=40-52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1EiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=ben+gibson+arrested&amp;dq=ben+gibson+arrested&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=unV6VPPlI8bD7gb1oID4CQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ|publisher=Henry Greenwood &amp; Company Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another freelance photographer, Tim Malyon, had to flee at one point.&lt;ref name="celebration-worthington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worthington|first1=Andy|title=Stonehenge: Celebration and Subversion|date=June 2004|publisher=Alternative Albion (Heart of Albion Press)|isbn=1872883761|pages=129, 137|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=zU18VKqxJ4Xa7gaRtoDYAg&amp;id=p_hVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=tim+malyon+beanfield&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=tim+malyon|accessdate= 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
Twenty-four of the travellers sued Wiltshire Police for wrongful arrest, assault and criminal damage to themselves and their property.&lt;ref name=BBChippies /&gt; Six years after the event a verdict was reached. Twenty-one of the travellers were successful in their case and were awarded £24,000 in damages towards their false imprisonment, damage to property and wrongful arrest.&lt;ref name=BBChippies /&gt; The judge declined to award their legal costs and their compensation consequently went towards paying for this.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Their [[barrister]], [[Anthony Maurice Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford QC]], stated ''"It left a very sour taste in the mouth."''&lt;ref name=operationsolstice /&gt;

In court, individual police officers were difficult to identify, as they had hidden their identification numbers on the day.&lt;ref name=remember /&gt; Despite this, one police sergeant was convicted of an [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] on a member of the Convoy.&lt;ref name=BBChippies /&gt;

Police radio and video was used as evidence during the court case, however there was a recording gap in both the radio and video recordings. The recording gap in the video footage was allegedly due to the video tape breaking when the convoy was initially halted at the roadblock.&lt;ref name=operationsolstice /&gt; There was also evidence that radio logs of conversations between officers on the day of the battle had been altered.&lt;ref name="observer-mystery" /&gt;

The Earl of Cardigan testified in court against Wiltshire Police. His testimony proved vital in supporting the allegation that Police violence had been excessive. He was criticised by several national newspapers for acting as a witness against Wiltshire Police; [[Bill Deedes|Bill Deedes']] editorial in [[The Daily Telegraph]] claimed he was a [[class traitor]]. Consequently, the Earl successfully sued for [[defamation]].&lt;ref name="independent-cardigan"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bell |first=Mathew |title=Earl of Cardigan: 'Seeing police beat a pregnant woman does poison your view' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/earl-of-cardigan-seeing-police-beat-a-pregnant-woman-does-poison-your-view-8478415.html |work=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
Legislation was introduced in the form of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] and later the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Act 1994]] that made the travellers' way of life increasingly difficult to sustain.&lt;ref name=remember&gt;{{cite news |last=Worthington |first=Andy |title=Remember the Battle of the Beanfield |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jun/01/remembering-the-battle-of-the-beanfield |accessdate= 11 December 2014 |work=The Guardian |date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of 1985, the four-mile blockade of Stonehenge was maintained for future summer solstices.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; Consequently, conflict between police and those trying to reach Stonehenge continued to take place every year.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; [[Neo-druid]] leader [[Arthur Uther Pendragon]] was arrested on each and every summer solstice between 1985 and 1999 whilst trying to access Stonehenge.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt; In the summer of 1988 around 130 people were arrested and in 1989 that figure rose to 260.&lt;ref name="bbc-faded" /&gt;

For the 1999 summer solstice English Heritage granted "limited access" to Stonehenge to [[neo-druid]]s. This access permission was later rescinded when 200 [[New Age traveller]]s broke on to the site. Twenty people were arrested.&lt;ref name="bbc-1999"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stonehenge visits cancelled |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/374240.stm |accessdate=21 January 2015 |work=BBC News |date=21 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s song "Back to the Stones" refers to the Battle of the Beanfield. It was recorded in 1989 and appears on his 1993 live album ''[[Unhinged (album)|Unhinged]].

The [[Hawkwind]] song "Confrontation" from the album [[Out &amp; Intake]] includes a description of the day's events and includes a dramatisation of some events including the repeated phrase "I am not interested in anything you have to say".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/1267195/Hawkwind|title=Confrontation - Hawkwind Lyrics|work=Lyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Levellers (band)|Levellers]]' song "Battle of the Beanfield", from their 1991 album ''[[Levelling the Land]]'', was inspired by the Battle of the Beanfield.&lt;ref name="peoples-songs" /&gt;

British progressive-rock band [[Solstice (UK progressive rock band)|Solstice]] wrote a song which comments on the Battle.  "Circles" is found on their 1997 album of the same name, and includes what sounds like reporting from the battle, with Kim Sabido's voice-over.

The song "Itinerant Child", by [[Ian Dury]] and [[Chaz Jankel]], which appears on the 1998 album ''[[Mr. Love Pants]]'', by [[The Blockheads|Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads]], was inspired by Dury's experiences during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, W.

'''William Leonard Moore''' (born October 31, 1943) is an author and former [[UFO]] researcher, prominent from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. He co-authored two books with [[Charles Berlitz]], including ''The Roswell Incident''.

==Career==
Interested in UFOs since he was a teenager, Moore attended [[Thiel College]], located in Greenville, Pennsylvania graduating in 1965. He taught language and humanities at various high schools. He became [[Arizona]] state section director of the [[Mutual UFO Network]] and left teaching to pursue a career as a freelance writer.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008" /&gt;

Moore wrote ''The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility'' with Charles Berlitz in 1979, about an alleged naval military experiment popularly known as the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] aboard the [[USS Eldridge (DE-173)|USS Eldridge]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2008"&gt;{{citation|author=Robert Alan Goldberg|title=Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8e5YELGGFAC&amp;pg=PA195|date=1 October 2008|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-13294-6|pages=195–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Moore wrote ''The Roswell Incident''  with writing partner Charles Berlitz, which alleged the [[Roswell UFO incident]] had involved the crash of an extraterrestrial space ship.&lt;ref name="Frazier"&gt;{{citation|author=Kendrick Frazier|title=The Hundredth Monkey: And Other Paradigms of the Paranormal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJ1v3bggyr8C&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=%22Charles+Berlitz+and+William+L.+Moore+in+their+book%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z1QgVOewL42iyASvkIHQDQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Berlitz%20and%20William%20L.%20Moore%20in%20their%20book%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-401-1|pages=338–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1987, Moore along with ufologists Jaime Shandera and [[Stanton Friedman]] circulated the [[Majestic 12]] documents that purported the existence of a high-level policy making group overseeing UFOs and extraterrestrials.&lt;ref name="Frazier" /&gt;

At a 1989 MUFON conference, Moore claimed that he had been engaged in "disinformation" activities against [[Paul Bennewitz]] on behalf of the [[Air Force Office of Special Investigations]].&lt;ref name="Donovan2011"&gt;{{citation|author=Barna William Donovan|title=Conspiracy Films: A Tour of Dark Places in the American Conscious|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkhqU1IXHAC&amp;pg=PA104|date=20 July 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8615-1|pages=104–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
According to author Barna William Donovan, ''The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility'' was "largely dismissed even by the most committed conspiracy and supernatural buffs as nothing more than a shoddy, uncritical repeat of a lingering and completely unsubstantiated urban myth." Donovan wrote that critics have deemed ''The Roswell Incident'' "a collection of wild hearsay" offering "second - and third-hand accounts Berlitz and Moore then use for fantastic speculation and to jump to a lot of unwarranted conclusions", and that when critics and skeptics characterized the Majestic 12 documents as fraudulent, "The accusing fingers were pointing at Moore."&lt;ref name="Donovan2011" /&gt;

All International Gran Prix tournaments have been a one-night tournament, always as part of CMLL's Friday night [[CMLL Super Viernes]] shows.

For the 2018 tournament CMLL brought in representatives of [[Ring of Honor]] ([[Matt Taven]], [[The Briscoe Brothers]]: Jay and Mark, and [[Flip Gordon]]), representatives of [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] ([[Michael Elgin]] and [[David Finlay]]), both promotions that CMLL has a close working relationship with. Team International also includes CMLL regular [[Shigeo Okumura|Okumura]] and independent wrestlers Dark Magic and [[Ricky Banderas|Gilbert el Boricua]].

[[File:Cas20141.jpg|thumb|Concert at Sea 2014 edition]]
'''Concert At Sea''' is a pop festival in the [[Netherlands]] held every summer (end of June) on the [[Brouwersdam]] in the province of Zeeland. It was initiated by the popular Dutch band [[BLØF]]. The name of the festival is a mistranslation of the Dutch phrase ''aan zee'' meaning by the sea / at the seaside. It is not actually held at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concertatsea.nl/info/wat-is-concert-at-sea/ Info page of festival website (Dutch)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was in 2006, after a free pilot concert at that location had proved to be very successful in 2003. The first few editions of the event were one day, but from 2008 on the festival is a two-day festival that attracts 40,000 people a day.&lt;br /&gt;
The 2011 edition started off fine, but the second day was cancelled due to heavy storm.

}}

The '''Corfu incident''' was a 1923 diplomatic and military crisis between [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]]. It was triggered when an [[Enrico Tellini|Italian general]] heading a commission to resolve a border dispute between Albania and Greece was murdered in Greek territory along with members of his staff. In response, [[Benito Mussolini]] issued a severe ultimatum to Greece and when it was not accepted in whole, dispatched forces to bombard and occupy [[Corfu]]. Mussolini defied the [[League of Nations]] and stated Italy would leave if it arbitrated in the crisis, and the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] instead eventually tendered an agreement favoring Italy. This was an early demonstration of the League's weakness when dealing with larger powers.

==Background==

There was a boundary dispute between Greece and [[Principality of Albania|Albania]].  The two nations took their dispute to the [[Conference of Ambassadors]], which  created a commission of British, French, and Italian officials&lt;ref name=NLA-65035758&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65035758 |title=THE ITALO-GREEK CRISIS. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=15 October 1923 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the boundary, which was authorized by the [[League of Nations]] to settle the dispute. The Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] became the chairman of the commission.
From the outset of the negotiations, the relations between Greece and the commission were bad. Eventually the Greek delegate openly accused Tellini of working in favour of Albania's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brecher|first1=Michael|last2=Wilkenfeld|first2=Jonathan|title=A study of crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&amp;pg=PA583|year=1997|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=0-472-10806-9|page=583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tellini's murder==

On August 27, 1923,  Tellini, two of his aides, their interpreter and a chauffeur fell into an ambush and were assassinated by unknown assailants at the border crossing of [[Kakavia (border crossing)|Kakavia]], which is near the town of [[Ioannina]], within Greek territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&amp;pg=PA583&amp;dq=Tellini+Greeks+Protocol&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=A Study of Crisis|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five victims were Tellini, Major Luigi Corti, Lieutenant Mario Bonacini, Albanian interpreter Thanas Gheziri and the chauffeur Remigio Farnetti. None of the victims were robbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Massock|first=Richard|title=Italy from Within|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxqHSvEfd_QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA39&amp;dq=enrico+tellini&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=enrico%20tellini&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=READ BOOKS|isbn=1-4067-2097-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, Greece appealed to the [[League of Nations]], but [[Antonio Salandra]], the Italian representative to the League, informed the Council that he had no permission to discuss the crisis.&lt;ref name=NLA-65035758/&gt;

Britain favored referring the Corfu matter to the League of Nations, but France opposed such a course of action fearing that it would provide a precedent for the League to become involved in [[Occupation of the Ruhr|the French occupation of the Ruhr]].&lt;ref name="Burgwyn 1997 23"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgwyn|first=James|publisher=Praeger|date=April 1997|title=Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period: 1918-1940|page=23|isbn=978-0275948771|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNHxISN-dmQC&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the threat of Mussolini to withdraw from the League and lack of French support the matter went to the Conference of Ambassadors.

In Italy the press widely reported satisfaction with the Conference's decision and praised Mussolini.&lt;ref name=NLA-66787211&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66787211 |title=Italy Triumphant |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Tasmania)|The Advocate]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=11 September 1923 |accessdate=18 March 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11 the Greek delegate, [[Nikolaos Politis]], informed the Council that Greece had deposited the 50,000,000 lire in a Swiss bank and on September 15, the Ambassadors Conference informed Mussolini that Italy must evacuate Corfu on the September 27, at the latest.&lt;ref name=NLA-65035758/&gt;&lt;ref name=NLA-65046802&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65046802 |title=EVACUATION OF CORFU. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=15 September 1923 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NLA-65035758/&gt;

On September 26, before the inquiry had finished, the Conference of Ambassadors awarded Italy an indemnity of 50,000,000 lire, on the alleged ground that "the Greek authorities had been guilty of a certain negligence before and after the crime."&lt;ref name=NLA-65035758/&gt;

In addition, Italy demanded from Greece 1,000,000 lire per day for the cost of the occupation of Corfu&lt;ref name=NLA-65035758/&gt; and Conference of the Ambassadors replied that Italy reserved the right of recourse to an International Court of Justice in connection with the occupation expenses.&lt;ref name=NLA-80945093&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article80945093 |title=EVACUATION OF CORFU. |newspaper=[[Singleton Argus]] |location=NSW |date=29 September 1923 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} "The award of the Ambassadors' Conference with respect to Janina has been confirmed, and the matter is declared to be settled, except that Italy reserves the right of recourse to an International Court of Justice in connection with the occupa- tion expenses."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece there was a general depression over the decision, because Italy obtained practically everything she demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20656808 |title=PRACTICALLY UNOBSERVED. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=29 September 1923 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} "The news of the evacuation at Corfu was almost unobserved owing to the general depression through Italy obtaining practically, everything she demanded."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Nicolson]], a first secretary in the central department of the [[Foreign Office]] said: "In response to the successive menaces of M. Mussolini we muzzled the League, we imposed the fine on Greece without evidence of her guilt and without reference to the Hague, and we disbanded the Commission of Enquiry. A settlement was thus achieved."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Yearwood, Peter J. "'Consistently with Honour': Great Britain, the League of Nations and the Corfu Crisis of 1923."

==Corfu Evacuation==

On September 27 the Italian flag was lowered and the Italian troops evacuated Corfu. The Italian fleet and a Greek destroyer saluted the Italian flag, and when the Greek flag hoisted, the Italian flagship saluted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20656807 |title=THE EVACUATION. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=29 September 1923 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} "The Italian flag was lowered and salutes from the Italian fleet and a Greek destroyer. The Italian flagship saluted the Greek flag when it was hoisted."&lt;/ref&gt;

40,000 residents of Corfu welcomed the prefect when he landed, and shouldered him to the prefecture. British and French flags were waved by the crowd which demonstrated enthusiastically in front of the Anglo-French consulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93297505 |title=EVACUATION OF CORFU. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]] |location=WA |date=29 September 1923 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] had been ordered to remain anchored till Italy received the 50 million lire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93297506 |title=FLEET WAITS FOR PAYMENT. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]] |location=WA |date=29 September 1923 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} "The Italians have not completed the evacuation of Corfu. Although the troops have left the Italian squadron has been ordered to remain till Italy actually receives the fifty million lire, payable by Greece."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 50,000,000 lire deposited in a Swiss bank were at the disposal of The Hague Tribunal and the bank refused to transfer the money to Rome without the authority of the [[National Bank of Greece|Greek National Bank]], which was given on  the evening of the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93301138 |title=EVACUATION OF CORFU. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]] |location=WA |date=1 October 1923 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} "The return of the Italian fleet to Corfu was due to the fact that the fifty million lire deposited in a Swiss bank were at the disposal of The Hague Tribunal and the bank refused to transfer the money to Rome without the authority of the Greek National Bank, which was given yesterday evening."&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, the Italian fleet, except one destroyer, departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article34263504 |title=EVACUATION OF CORFU. |newspaper=[[Western Argus]] |location=Kalgoorlie, WA |date=2 October 1923 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |page=21 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} "Corfu, Sept. 30.

In Corfu during the first quarter of the 20th century, many [[Italian opera]]s were performed at the [[Municipal Theatre of Corfu]]. This tradition came to a halt following the Corfu incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Elaine |last=Thomopoulos  |title=The History of Greece|page=109 |publisher=Greenwood|date=December 2011|isbn=978-0313375118 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jlKheq6g3r8C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=king+george+of+greece+1923+corfu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UcHvQF9pPO&amp;sig=H0KPve0U7Vj4XCxRyIpNTXo3KTU&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qVBjUfSZLqGx0AXk54CIDA&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=king%20george%20of%20greece%201923%20corfu&amp;f=false}} "Incensed by Italy's act of aggression, the Corfiots stopped playing Italian operas at their theater."&lt;/ref&gt; After the bombardment, the theatre featured Greek operas as well as Greek theater performances by distinguished Greek actors such as [[Marika Kotopouli]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Pelos Katselis|el|3=Πέλος Κατσέλης}}.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"&gt;Municipality of Corfu Official Website.

From that time on Greek operas were called under the direction of the maestros Dionisius Lavrangas, Alexandros Kiparissis, Stefanos Valtetsiotis and others. Since then, dramatic plays were also staged and artists like Marika Kotopouli and Pelos Katselis appeared in Corfu, as well as many operettas of the time"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==

The ulterior motive for the invasion was Corfu's strategic position at the entrance of the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20643600 |title=The Brisbane Courier. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=11 September 1923 |accessdate=31 January 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}"... because there is not the slightest doubt that the real cause of trouble is that old disturbing "Adriatic question " which has been the cause of many Balkan troubles, and is likely to be the cause of many more."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65033880 |title=The Register.

The crisis was also a failure for the policy of Great Britain, which had appeared as the greatest champion of the League during the crisis.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

In addition, it showed the purpose and tone of [[Fascist]] foreign policy.&lt;ref name="books.google.gr"/&gt;
Italy's invasion of Corfu was Mussolini's most aggressive move of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Burgwyn 1997 23"/&gt; 
The reputation of Mussolini in Italy was enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaques|first=Tony|title= of Battles and Sieges: A Guide to 8,500 Battles from Antiquity through the Twenty-first Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3amnMPTPP5MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=November 2006|publisher= Greenwood|isbn= 978-0313335372|page= 262}} "..., enhancing the reputation of Mussolini, who then annexed Fiume"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgwyn|first=James|publisher=Praeger|date=April 1997|title=Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period: 1918-1940|page=24|isbn=978-0275948771|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNHxISN-dmQC&amp;pg=PA24}} "Improvised and incoherent, Mussolini's gunboat diplomacy failed to add Corfu to Italy's possession, but it did successfully fulfill demagogic and propagandistic aims within the country."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neville 93"/&gt;

As a consequence Mussolini started in the 1930s to claim the [[Italian irredentism of Corfu|Italian irredentism of Corfu &amp; the Ionian islands]].

==Stamps==

An Italian Post Office opened on September 11, 1923 in Corfu, issuing a set of 8 Italian stamps overprinted "CORFÙ" which were placed on sale on the 20th. Three additional stamps overprinted in Greek currency arrived on 24th. The third stamp was 2.40 drachma on 1 lire. 
The Post Office closed at midday on 26 September 1923, only remaining open to dispatch the morning mail. The office had been open for 15 days.

Three further values arrived on the day the Post Office closed, and were never issued. They eventually became available for sale at the postal ministry in Rome. Many used copies of these stamps have forged postmarks, but it is known that the Corfu cancel was applied to hundreds of stamps before the Post Office closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcstamps.com/?p=1822|title=Corfu, Italian Occupation  (1923)|work=Dead Country Stamps and Banknotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italianstamps.co.uk/po/corfu/index.html|title=Italian Post Offices - Corfu|author=Tony Clayton|work=italianstamps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Eisenhower series}}
'''Eisenhower's farewell address''' (sometimes referred to as "Eisenhower's farewell address to the nation"&lt;ref name = "text"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ike.htm|title=Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the Nation|last=McAdams|first=John|publisher=The Kennedy Assassination|access-date=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- to distinguish it from his farewell address to his troops--&gt;) was the [[s:Eisenhower's farewell address|final public speech]] of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as the 34th President of the United States, delivered in a television broadcast on January 17, 1961. Perhaps best known for advocating that the nation guard against the potential influence of the [[military–industrial complex]], a term he is credited with coining, the speech also expressed concerns about planning for the future and the dangers of massive spending, especially [[deficit spending]], the prospect of the domination of science through Federal funding and, conversely, the domination of science-based public policy by what he called a "scientific-technological elite".&lt;ref name=Avalon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/eisenhower001.asp|publisher=Avalon Project|title=Military-Industrial Complex Speech, Dwight D.

==Background==
{{main|Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower}}
On January 20, 1961, Eisenhower served as a president for two full terms, making a total of eight years, and was the first U.S. president to be [[Term limits in the United States#President|term-limited]] from seeking re-election again. He had overseen a period of considerable economic expansion, even as the [[Cold War]] deepened. Three of his [[United States federal budget|national budgets]] had been balanced, but spending pressures mounted. The recent [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential election]] had resulted in the election of [[John F. Kennedy]], and the oldest American president in a century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= [[Basic Books]]|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 7|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was about to hand the reins of power to the youngest elected president.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Gibbs, "[http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1857862,00.html When New President Meets Old, It's Not Always Pretty]".

{{wikisource|Eisenhower's farewell address}}
As early as 1959, Eisenhower began working with his brother [[Milton Eisenhower|Milton]] and his speechwriters, including his chief speechwriter [[Malcolm Moos]], to develop his final statement as he left public life. It went through at least 21 drafts.&lt;ref name = "Milburn"&gt;John Milburn, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/10/eisenhower-speech-papers-military_n_795309.html "Papers shed light on Eisenhower's farewell address"]. Associated Press, December 10, 2010. The Huffington Post. Retrieved 2010.12.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was "a solemn moment in a decidedly unsolemn time", warning a nation "giddy with prosperity, infatuated with youth and glamour, and aiming increasingly for the easy life."&lt;ref name = "WaPoOpEd" /&gt;

{{quote|As we peer into society's future, we – you and I, and our government – must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.&lt;ref name = Avalon /&gt;}}

[[File:Mil-ind complex.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A draft of the farewell address, showing handwritten edits.]]

Despite being a politician with a military background and the only general to be elected president in the 20th century, he famously warned the nation with regards to the corrupting influence of what he describes as the "[[military-industrial complex]]".&lt;ref name="Military–industrial complex"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-07|title=Military–industrial complex|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex&amp;oldid=764261564|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{quote|Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations.

Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society.

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.&lt;ref name = "text" /&gt;}}

He also expressed his concomitant concern for corruption of the scientific process as part of this centralization of funding in the Federal government:

{{Quote|Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.

In this revolution, research has become central, it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.

...

The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocation, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.

Yet in holding scientific discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.&lt;ref name = "text" /&gt;}}&lt;!--

It has been suggested that he had written the speech to say "military-industrial-congressional complex" but deleted "congressional", apparently to avoid offending legislators.&lt;ref name = "Milburn"&gt;John Milburn,

==Legacy==
Although it was much broader, Eisenhower's speech is remembered primarily for its reference to the military-industrial complex.&lt;ref name = "Milburn" /&gt; The phrase gained acceptance during the [[Vietnam War]] era and 21st-century commentators have expressed the opinion that a number of the fears raised in his speech have come true.&lt;ref&gt;Hanft, Adam (January 18, 2011).

In Scottish and Northern English folklore, the '''first-foot''', also known in [[Manx Gaelic]] as '''''quaaltagh''''' or '''''qualtagh''''', is the first person to enter the home of a household on [[New Year's Day]] and is seen as a bringer of good fortune for the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Jacqueline |author2=Steve Roud |title=A dictionary of English Folklore |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-210019-X |chapter=New Year |url=http://blog.oup.com/2009/12/nye-folklore/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EOTTNW"&gt;{{cite book |last=Page |first=Michael |author2=Robert Ingpen |title=Encyclopedia of Things that Never Were |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York, New York|New York]] |year=1987 |ISBN=0-670-81607-8 |page=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is acceptable in many places for the first-foot to be a resident of the house, they must not be in the house at the stroke of midnight in order to be the first-foot. Thus, going out of the house after midnight and then coming back into the same house is not considered to be first-footing. It is said to be desirable for the first-foot to be a tall, dark-haired male; a female or fair-haired male are in some places regarded as unlucky. In [[Worcestershire]], luck is ensured by stopping the first [[carol singer]] who appears and leading him through the house [ref]. In [[Yorkshire]], it must always be a male who enters the house first, but his fairness is no objection.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The first-foot usually brings several gifts, including perhaps a coin (silver is considered good luck), bread, salt, coal, evergreen, and/or a drink (usually [[whisky]]), which represent financial prosperity, food, flavour, warmth, long-life, and good cheer respectively.&lt;ref name="EOTTNW"/&gt; In Scotland, first-footing has traditionally been more elaborate than in England, involving subsequent entertainment.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=First-foot|inline=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are practices similar to first-footing outside the British isles. For example, it exists in Sweden, where having a fair skinned, blond(e) first-foot is considered the highest blessing whereas darker persons are considered bad luck. In a similar [[Greece|Greek]] tradition called pothariko, also called "podariko" (from the root ''pod-'', or foot), it is believed that the first person to enter the house on [[New Year's Eve]] brings either good or bad luck.  Many households to this day keep this tradition and specially select who first enters the house. After the first-foot, the lady of the house serves the guests with [[Christmas]] treats or gives them an amount of money to ensure that good luck will come in the new year.

A similar tradition exists in the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], where the person is called "mekvle" (from "kvali" – footstep, footprint, trace).

'''Forced displacement''' or '''forced immigration''' is the coerced movement of a person or people away from their [[home]] or home [[region]] and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced forced displacement is a '''"forced immigrant"''', a '''"displaced person" (DP)''', rarely also a '''"displacee"''', or if it is within the same country, an [[internally displaced person]] (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a [[refugee]], as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of forced displacement is [[population transfer]], which is a coherent policy to move unwanted groups, for example, as an attempt at [[ethnic cleansing]]. Another form is [[deportation]].

Forced displacement has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced people to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], south and central [[Asia]], ripple out well beyond the immediate region.

== Definition ==
The concept of forced displacement envelopes demographic movements like flight, evacuation, displacement, and resettlement. The [[International Organization for Migration]] defines a forced migrant as any person who migrates to "escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/publication/wcms_160632.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821023804/http://www.iom.int/jahia/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association for the Study of Forced Migration]] (IASFM) defines it as "the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (those displaced by conflicts) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects."&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forcedmigration.org/about/whatisfm/what-is-forced-migration|title=What is forced migration? — Forced Migration Online|website=www.forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alden Speare, "in the strictest sense migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him." Movement under threat, even the immediate threat to life, contains a voluntary element, as long as there is an option to escape to another part of the country, go into hiding or to remain and hope to avoid persecution."&lt;ref name=conflict/&gt; However this thought has been questioned, especially by Marxians, who argue that in most cases migrants have little or no choice.&lt;ref name=conflict&gt;{{cite web |title=FORCED MIGRATION IN INDONESIA : HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES |url=http://www.conflictrecovery.org/bin/Graeme_Hugo-Forced_Migration_in_Indonesia-Historical_Perspectives.doc |work=graeme hugo |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Causes for forced displacement can include:
* [[Natural disaster]]: Occurrence of a disaster – such as floods, tsunamis, landslides, earthquakes or volcanoes – leads to temporary or permanent displacement of population from that area. In such a scenario, migration becomes more of a survival strategy, as natural disasters often cause the loss of money, homes, and jobs. For example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] resulted in displacement of almost the entire population of New Orleans, leaving the community and government with several economic and social challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://understandingkatrina.ssrc.org/Oliver-Smith/ |title=Disasters and Forced Migration in the 21st Century |work=ssrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Environmental problems]]: The term [[environmental refugee]] has been in use recently representing people who are forced to leave their traditional habitat because of environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood, or even environmental disruption i.e. biological, physical or chemical change in ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, University de Liege, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]], of deforestation or [[land degradation]]. Man-made disasters can also cause forced migration: examples are industrial accidents and especially accidents that involve radioactivity, such as in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]]. An elaboration of such migrants is given by Essam El-Hinnawi:
# Migrants who are able to return to their original habitat once the disruption is over, as in the case of the [[Bhopal disaster]].
# Migrants  who remain permanently displaced.
# Migrants  who seek better living conditions due to deterioration of environmental conditions in their present habitat, such as soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/show_metadata.jsp?pid=fmo:1158 |title=Environment and forced migration : a review   Paper for 4th IRAP conference 5–9 January 1994, Oxford |author=Forced Migration Online, Refugee Studies Centre, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford |work=forcedmigration.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 19th century, for example, Ireland experienced a famine never before seen in the country’s history.
* [[War]], [[civil war]], [[political repression]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious conflict]]s: Some migrants are impelled to cross national borders by war or persecution, due to political, social, ethnic, religious reasons. These immigrants may be considered [[refugees]] if they apply for [[asylum seekers|asylum]] in the receiving country.&lt;ref&gt;Conventions No. 29, 105, 138 and 182; Convention No. 97 (Art. 3, Annex I; Art. 8 and Annex II, Art. 13); Convention No. 143, Part I; 1990 International Convention (Art. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Development-induced displacement]]: Such displacement or [[population transfer]] is the forcing of communities and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of [[economic development]]. It has been historically associated with the construction of dams for [[hydroelectric power]] and [[irrigation]] purposes but also appears due to many other activities, such as [[mining]] and transport (roads, ports, airports). The best-known recent example of such development-induced displacement may be that resulting from the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[China]]. This type of forced migration disproportionately affects low income earners and ethnic minorities. According to estimates, between 90 and 100 million people were forced to leave their homes due to development projects in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="forcedmigration.org"/&gt;
* [[Human trafficking]] and [[human smuggling]]: Migrants displaced through deception or coercion with purpose of their exploitation fall under this category. The data on such forced migration are limited since the activities involved are clandestine in nature. While migration of this nature is well covered for male migrants (working in agriculture, construction etc.), same cannot be said for their female counterparts as the market situation for them might be unscrupulous (sex work or domestic service). The [[International Labour Organization]] considers trafficking an offence against labor protection and denies them the opportunity of utilizing their resources for their country. ILO’s Multilateral Framework includes principle no. 11 that recommends, "Governments should formulate and implement, in consultation with the social partners, measures to prevent abusive practices, migrant smuggling and people trafficking; they should also work towards preventing irregular labor migration.
* [[Slavery]]: History's greatest forced migration was the [[Middle Passage]] of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] during the 15th through the 19th centuries.  Of the 20 million Africans captured for the trade, half died in their forced march to the African coast, and another ten to twenty percent died on slave ships carrying them from Africa to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html |author=PBS-WGBH |title=The Middle Passage |work=Africans in America |date=1999 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethnic cleansing]]: The systematic forced removal of ethnic or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically homogeneous.

==Conditions==

In the majority of cases forced migration across borders takes place without the required documentation. It may even involve human smugglers and traffickers. Displaced people often place their lives at risk, are obliged to travel in inhumane conditions and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. And on top of that the states where they seek protection may regard them as a threat to their security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/46f7c0ee2.pdf | page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and distinctions between the terms==
{{see|Refugee law|Refugee}}
* The term 'Refugee Studies' denotes an academic discipline or field of study which covers the study of refugees, often their experiences in seeking refuge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Bobby Thomas|date=2014|title=Reflections on Refugee Studies and the Study of Refugees: Implications for Policy Analysts|url=https://bobbycameron.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/final_bobby-thomas-cameron_refugee-studies.pdf|journal=Journal of Management &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|pages=4–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several categories of individuals who are included in this study, with labels that include: 'Refugee’; ‘expellees’; ‘exile’; ‘displaced person’; ‘internally displaced person (IDP)’; ‘economic refugees’; ‘humanitarian refugee’; ‘stateless person’; ‘tsunami refugee’; ‘development refugee’; ‘environmental refugee’; ‘government assisted refugee (GAR)’ etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The term displaced person (DP) was first widely used during [[World War II]] and the resulting refugee outflows from [[Eastern Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wyman: ''Dps: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951''. Cornell University Press 1998 (reprint). {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was used to specifically refer to one removed from his or her native country as a [[refugee]], [[prison]]er or a [[unfree labour|slave laborer]]. Most of the victims of war, political refugees and DPs of the immediate post-Second World War period were Ukrainians, Poles, other Slavs, as well as citizens of the Baltic states – Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians, who refused to return to Soviet-dominated eastern Europe. A.J. Jaffe claimed that the term was originally coined by [[Eugene M. Kulischer]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Jaffe: Notes on the Population Theory of Eugene M. Kulischer. In: ''The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly'', Vol. 40, No. 2. (April 1962). Pp. 187–206.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3348648 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning has significantly broadened in the past half-century.

* If the displaced person has crossed an international border and falls under one of the [[Refugee Law|relevant international legal instruments]], they may become a [[refugee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm U.N. Convention relating to status of Refugees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309151637/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "refugee" is also commonly used as a synonym for displaced person, causing confusion between the general descriptive class of anyone who has left their home and the subgroup of legally defined [[refugee]]s who enjoy specified international legal protection. However, forced migrants may not apply for asylum in the country they fled to, so they may not be classed as [[asylum seeker]]s or – if application would be successful – [[refugee]]s. The terms refugee and asylum seeker always have a legal framework or system as context. If forced migrants do not access this legal system or it does not exist in the country they have fled to, they cannot be categorised as such.

* Forced migrants are always either IDPs or displaced people, as both of these terms do not require a legal framework and the fact that they left their homes is sufficient. The distinction between the terms displaced person and forced migrant is minor, however, the term displaced person has an important historic context (e.g. [[World War II]]).

* A displaced person who crosses an international border without permission from the country they are entering, and without applying for asylum, may be considered an [[illegal immigrant]].

* A displaced person who left his or her home because of political persecution or violence, but did not cross an international border, is commonly considered to be the less well-defined category of [[internally displaced person]] (IDP), and is subject to more tenuous international protection. Bogumil Terminski distinguishes two general categories of internal displacement: displacement of risk (mostly conflict-induced displacement, deportations and disaster-induced displacement) and displacement of adaptation (associated with voluntary resettlement, development-induced displacement and environmentally-induced displacement).

* If the displaced person was forced out their home because of economically driven projects like that of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China and various [[India]]n dams, it is called [[development-induced displacement]]. People are also often displaced due to [[natural disaster|natural]] or man-made disasters. Displacement can also occur as a result of slow-onset [[climate change]], such as [[desertification]] or [[sea-level rise]]. A person who is displaced due to environmental factors which negatively impact his or her livelihood is generally known as an [[environmental migrant]]. Such displacement can be cross-border in nature but is frequently internal. No specific international legal instrument applies to such individuals. Foreign nations often offer disaster relief to mitigate the effects of such disaster displacement.

* Displaced person generally refers to one who is forced to migrate for reasons other than economic conditions, such as war or persecution. A migrant who fled because of economic hardship is an [[economic migrant]].

==Criminal prosecution==
Forced displacement has been subjected to several trials before local and international courts. One of the requirements that need to be met for an offence as a [[war crime]] is that the victim is a "protected person" under [[international humanitarian law]]. The expression "protected person" originally referred only to the categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four [[Geneva Conventions of 1949]], but was later accepted as defining a [[civilian]] or police force who do not participate directly in a conflict.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e0344b344.pdf | title=Legal and Protection Policy Research Series: Forced Displacement and International Crimes |publisher=UNHCR| author=Guido Acquaviva |date=June 2011|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], the [[Krupp trial]] was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of civilian populations for the purpose of forced labour. The US Military Tribunal concluded that "
[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power".&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; At the [[Nuremberg trials]], [[Hans Frank]], chief jurist in [[occupied Poland]], was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nuremberg-trial-judgements-hans-frank|title=Nuremberg Trial Judgements: Hans Frank|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Article 49, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]], adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbids forced displacement:

{{quote3|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected people from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600056 |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] |title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949 – DEPORTATIONS, TRANSFERS, EVACUATIONS |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:
{{quote3|"Deportation or forcible transfer of population" means forced displacement of the people concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf |publisher=International Criminal Court |title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |year=2011 |p=7|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several people were tried and convicted by the [[ICTY]] for connection to forced displacement during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced [[Vojislav Šešelj]] 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating [[deportation]], [[persecution]] (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as [[crimes against humanity]] due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the [[expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmict.org/en/news/appeals-chamber-reverses-%C5%A1e%C5%A1elj%E2%80%99s-acquittal-part-and-convicts-him-crimes-against-humanity|title=APPEALS CHAMBER REVERSES ŠEŠELJ’S ACQUITTAL, IN PART, AND CONVICTS HIM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY| date=11 April 2018| publisher=United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/europe/un-court-sentences-ultranationalist-serb-leader-to-10-years-16638|title=UN court sentences ultranationalist Serb leader to 10 years |publisher=[[TRT World]] |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/04/serbia-conviction-of-war-criminal-delivers-long-overdue-justice-to-victims/|title=Serbia: Conviction of war criminal delivers long overdue justice to victims| publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician [[Momčilo Krajišnik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal transfers former Bosnian Serb leader to UK prison |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/09/311692-un-tribunal-transfers-former-bosnian-serb-leader-uk-prison| date=8 September 2009|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ex-Croatian Serb leader [[Milan Martić]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UN tribunal upholds 35-year jail term for leader of breakaway Croatian Serb state|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/10/277112-un-tribunal-upholds-35-year-jail-term-leader-breakaway-croatian-serb-state|date=8 October 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander [[Mladen Naletilić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Croat commander convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Italy |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/04/257282-bosnian-croat-commander-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-italy| date=25 April 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bosnian Serb politician [[Radoslav Brđanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bosnian Serb politician convicted by UN tribunal to serve jail term in Denmark |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/03/251232-bosnian-serb-politician-convicted-un-tribunal-serve-jail-term-denmark |date=4 March 2008|publisher=UN News |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Francesca da Rimini''''' ({{lang-ru|Франческа да Римини|italic=yes}}), [[Opus number|Op]]. 25, is an opera in a prologue, two tableaux and an epilogue by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] to a Russian [[libretto]] by [[Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. It is based on the story of [[Francesca da Rimini]] in the fifth [[Long poem|canto]] of [[Dante]]'s epic poem ''[[Inferno (Dante)|The Inferno]]'' (the first part of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''). The fifth canto is the part about the [[Inferno (Dante)#Second Circle (Lust)|Second Circle of Hell (Lust)]]. Rachmaninoff had composed the love duet for Francesca and Paolo in 1900, but did not resume work on the opera until 1904. The first performance was on 24 January (O.S. 11 January) 1906 at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]], Moscow, with the composer himself conducting, in a double-bill performance with another Rachmaninoff opera written contemporaneously, ''[[The Miserly Knight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Griffiths, "Review of vocal scores of Rachmaninoff's ''Francesca da Rimini'' and ''The Miserly Knight''", ''[[Musical Times]]'', '''136 (1825)''', 148 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''The setting is the Malatesta castle around the end of the 13th century''

=== Prologue ===
The ghost of Virgil leads the poet Dante to the edge of the first circle of the Inferno. They descend into the second, where the wordless chorus of the damned souls is heard. Virgil tells Dante that this is the realms where sinners given over to lust are punished, buffeted by an eternal whirlwind. Dante asks two such souls, Francesca and Paolo, to tell their story.

=== Tableau 1 ===
In the castle courtyard, Lanceotto Malatesta is about to go off to war, but he admits that he no longer takes pleasure in war. Lanceotto is deformed, and knows that his wife, Francesca, does not love him. She had been tricked into marrying Lanceotto by being led to think that she would marry Paolo Malatesta, Lanceotto's handsome younger brother. Lanceotto is suspicious of Francesca and envious of Paolo. He plans to set a trap to catch them in adultery. Francesca then enters, affirming obedience to Lanceotto, but saying that she cannot love him. She asks when he will return, and Lanceotto says that he will not return until after the end of battle. When Francesca leaves, Lanceotto laughs.  

=== Tableau 2 ===
Paolo and Francesca are together, alone, in a room in the castle. Paolo tells the story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere, which parallels their own feelings. While doing so, Paolo declares his love for Francesca. Francesca resists initially, trying to remain faithful to Lanciotto. However, her own resistance erodes at Paolo's continued expressions of love, and her own desire for him. They sing of their secret love, and embrace. Lanciotto has returned, and sees the lovers together. He fatally stabs Paolo and Francesca.

=== Epilogue ===
Paolo and Francesca recede into the whirlwind of the second circle. Dante is overcome with pity and terror, and he and Virgil remain with the thought:  ‘There is no greater sadness in the world than to remember a time of joy in a time of grief’.

'''Gorsedd Stones''' ({{lang-cy| Cerrig yr Orsedd}}) are groups of [[standing stone]]s constructed for the [[National Eisteddfod]] of [[Wales]]. They form an integral part of the druidic [[Gorsedd]] ceremonies of the Eisteddfod. The stones can be found as commemorative structures throughout Wales and are the hallmark of the National Eisteddfod having visited a community.

Each stone structure is arranged in a circular formation typically consisting of twelve stone pillars, sometimes from the local area and sometimes, the stones have been brought in to represent the Welsh counties, such as at Aberystwyth. A large, flat-topped stone, known as the Logan Stone, lies at the centre of the circle and serves as a platform.

[[Image:Gorsedd-Stones-Aberdare-Park-by-AberdareBlog.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|Gorsedd Circle at [[Aberdare Park]] showing typical layout.  The National Eisteddfod has been held in [[Aberdare]] three times, including the first in 1861]]

As well as commemorating the National Eisteddfod, the Gorsedd Stones continue to provide an important ceremonial venue for the proclamation of future National Eisteddfodau which according to tradition must be completed one year and one day prior to its official opening. The ceremony is conducted by the [[Archdruid]] of the Gorsedd of Bards who formally announces the particulars of the proposed venue.
During the proceedings the Archdruid stands upon the Logan Stone, facing him, to the east cardinal point, is the Stone of the Covenant where the [[Herald Bard]] stands, and behind this are the Portal Stones that are guarded by Eisteddfod officials. The portal stone to the right of the entrance points to midsummer sunrise, while that to the left indicates the midwinter sunrise.

==Trivia==

A Gorsedd Circle is about to set up in [[Hungary]] as a symbol of strengthening relationships between Wales and Hungary, and as commemoration of [[The Bards of Wales]]. The circle will consist of 13 stones, each representing one martyr [[bard]].&lt;ref name=waleson&gt;{{cite news|last=Crump|first=Eryl|title=Strengthening the link between Wales and Hungary|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/aberystwyth/2012/08/07/strengthening-the-link-between-wales-and-hungary-91466-31564291/|accessdate=2012-08-07|newspaper=WalesOnline|date=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goyang International Flower Festival''' ({{Korean|hangul=고양 국제 꽃박람회|rr=Goyang Gukje Kkotbangamhoe}}) is one of the largest [[flower festival]]s in [[South Korea]] and takes place in the city of [[Goyang]]. It attracts many visitors annually. The festival is held in a metropolitan area and serves as a model for local culture festivals, in which some foreign flower farmers participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citytourkorea.com|title=Goyang International Flower Exhibition|last=|first=|date=|website=KFFCS SERVICE CLUB|publisher=International cultural service club|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801072847/http://citytourkorea.com/|archivedate=1 August 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=|df=dmy-all}}[http://www.hartfloraldesign.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sisainlive.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=23055|title = 이번 황금연휴에 '컬처 도넛'은 어떠세요?(What about 'Culture doughnut' in this golden holiday?)|last = |first = |date = 2015-05-01|work = 시사인(Sisain)|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the festival, flower events and cultural performances are held, and visitors can buy flowers from all over the world, which helps promote the domestic [[Floristry|flower industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnbnews.com/news/article.html?no=289927 CNBNEWS 고양국제꽃박람회, 어린이날 황금연휴 맞아 가족관람객에 인기] 2015.05.01 (Goyang International flower festival gain popularity from family visitors CNBNEWS)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Great Recession sidebar}}
The European recession is part of the [[Great Recession]], which began inside the United States. The crisis spread to '''Europe''' rapidly and affected much of the region with several countries already in [[recession]] as of February 2009, and most others suffering marked economic setbacks. The global recession was first seen in Europe, as [[Ireland]] was the first country to fall in a recession from Q2-Q3 2007 – followed by temporary growth in Q4 2007 – and then a two-year-long recession.&lt;ref name="CSO Quarterly National Accounts: Q4-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/latestheadlinefigures/qna_q42012.pdf |title=Quarterly National Accounts -Quarter 4 2012|format=PDF|publisher=CSO |date=21 March 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Timeline of the Great Recession}}

==Eurozone==
The Eurozone recession has been dated from the first quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.org/data/dating/ |title=Euro Area Business Cycle Dating Committee |publisher=Cepr.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eurozone as a whole, industrial production fell 1.9 percent in May 2008, the sharpest one-month decline for the region since the exchange rate crisis in 1992.

Ireland's GDP saw a contraction in the second quarter by 0.5 percent, making Ireland the first member of the eurozone to enter a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7635426.stm|title=Irish economy goes into recession|publisher=BBC News|date=25 September 2008|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is being advised by Merrill Lynch, the American broker that ran out of capital in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Independent, 28 January 2009, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 it was [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy|forced to nationalise]] its third largest bank, [[Anglo Irish Bank]] and to announce recapitalisation of its top two banks, [[Allied Irish Bank|AIB]] and [[Bank of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0121/angloirish.html|title=McAleese signs Anglo Irish Bank Bill|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-21|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, the government announced record unemployment levels in the country, with its highest monthly increase in 40 years and 1,500 people being laid off daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0204/employment.html|title=Jobless rate could hit 400,000 – Cowen|date=4 February 2009|accessdate=2009-02-04|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ireland exited the recession in the 3rd quarter of 2009, posting a 0.3% growth in its economy, due to recent heavy budget cuts by the Irish government. However, although they technically exited recession, the Irish economy still has a lot of hurdles to overcome if it is to return to normality.

===Spain===
{{Further|2008–13 Spanish financial crisis}}
Spain's [[Martinsa-Fadesa]], a construction company, declared bankruptcy after failing to refinance a debt of €5.1 billion. The two banks with most exposure to Martinsa-Fadesa were reportedly [[Caja Madrid]], at €900m, and [[Banco Popular Español]], at €400m. Spain's finance minister [[Pedro Solbes]] said it would not bail out the company. In the second quarter, house prices in Spain fell 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/07/17/cnspain117.xml|title= Spain drops reassuring gloss as crisis deepens|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=2008-07-19 | location=London | first=Ambrose | last=Evans-Pritchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Castilla-La Mancha some 69 percent of all houses built over the past three years are still unsold. [[Deutsche Bank]] said it expects a 35 percent fall in real house prices by 2011. Spain's premier, Jose Luis Zapatero, blamed the European Central Bank for making matters worse by raising interest rates. More than 98 percent of home loans in Spain are priced off floating rates linked to [[Euribor]], which has risen 145 basis points since August. Housing accounts for over 10 percent of Spain's economy. The [[Bank of Spain]] is concerned about the health of smaller regional lenders with heavy exposure to the mortgage market.

Although Spain has avoided recession in the first half of 2008, unemployment in the country has risen by 425,000 over 2007-2008, reaching 9.9 percent. Car sales in Spain fell 31 percent in May.&lt;ref name=Europeanrecession /&gt; Spain's factory output slumped 5.5 percent in May 2008.

[[Morgan Stanley]] issued a major alert on the health of Spanish banks and the Spanish economy in a report, saying, "A momentous economic slowdown is now under way. We believe the deterioration in Spain is just in the beginning stages. The bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009." Morgan Stanley also warned there was 40 percent chance of a 0.5 percent contraction of the Spanish economy in 2009, with a risk of an even more extreme 1.4 percent contraction in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/08/05/ccspain105.xml|title=Morgan Stanley issues alert on Spanish banks|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-11 | location=London | first=Ambrose | last=Evans-Pritchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spanish automobile manufacturers' association ANFAC new car sales fell 27.5 percent in July from the same time in 2007, the third consecutive monthly drop of over 20 percent.

===Germany===
In Germany officials had warned the economy could contract by as much as 1.5 percent in the second quarter because of declining export orders. The economy of Germany indeed contracted in both the second and third quarters putting Germany now in a technical recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/14/oecd-recession-germany-inflation-deflation | title= Germany officially in recession as OECD expects US to lead recovery|work=The Guardian |date=14 November 2008 | location=London | first=Kathryn | last=Hopkins | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the idea was fought for a moment Angela Merkel and the German government approved a €50 billion strong rescue plan to protect the German economy of the crisis, making of it Western Europe's biggest rescue plan for now in this crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090106-germany-agrees-new-50-billion-euro-stimulus-plan |title=Germany agrees on 50-billion-euro stimulus plan |publisher=France 24 |date=6 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513022443/http://www.france24.com/en/20090106-germany-agrees-new-50-billion-euro-stimulus-plan |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In Italy, [[Fiat]] announced plant closures and temporary layoffs at factories in Turin, Melfi and Sicily. Car sales in Italy have fallen by almost 20 percent over each of the past two months. Italy's car workers' union said; "The situation is evidently more serious than had been understood."&lt;ref name=Recessionwarnings /&gt; On 10 July 2008 economic think tank ISAE lowered its growth forecast for Italy to 0.4 percent from 0.5 percent and cut the 2009 outlook to 0.7 percent from 1.2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/7666684|title=German finance ministry writes off Q2 GDP| work= The Guardian|date= 21 July 2008|accessdate=2008-07-22 |location=London}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts have predicted Italy had entered a recession in the second quarter or would enter one by the end of the year with business confidence at its lowest levels since the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/7674835|title=Italy business morale hits 7-year low, recession seen|work=The Guardian|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=2008-07-25 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&amp;sid=a4eQgSi4DaSU&amp;refer=home|title=Italy's Economy Unexpectedly Shrinks; Nears Recession|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=8 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unemployment rate rose from 5.7% in April 2007 to 8.6% in April 2010. Italy was mostly isolated from the effects of the Great Recession of 2008-2009 as their banking system did not engage in risky investment behavior and was sound. However, the effects of the recession wiped out the strict budget discipline that Italy had painstakingly kept since the Debt Crisis of 1992, and lead to another Italian sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Italy briefly saw growth from 2009-2011, but from 2011 to 2013 suffered a recession that, while shallower than the 2008-2009 downturn, was longer and in many ways far worse, as unemployment skyrocketed 7.9% in April 2011 to 13.0% in November 2014.

===France, Benelux countries===
Other eurozone members saw a decline in their economies in the second quarter as well; France by 0.3 percent, [[Finland]] by 0.2 percent while the [[Netherlands]] showed zero growth in the second quarter.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; However the final estimates released by the [[INSEE]], France's statistical agency, showed the French economy grew by 0.14 percent during the third quarter thus barely avoiding a technical recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pdfinvest.com/france-avoids-recession-and-defies-economists.html|title=France Avoids Recession And Defies Economists|publisher=PDFinvest.com|date = 2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first quarter of 2009, France fell into recession, the last developed nation in Europe to do so.

In order to fight the economic crisis, French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] announced a €26 billion rescue plan which will amount to an additional €15.5 billion in addition to the normal budget for 2009 and will increase France's public deficit to 4%. It is similar, to an extent, to Barack Obama's proposal to stimulate the U.S. economy by investing in the nation's vital infrastructure. Further proposals include tax rebates for small businesses as well as easing restrictions on building permits and government contracts particularly with construction and civil engineering.

This is due to the "prime à la casse" program where buyers received a rebate of up to €1,000 for scrapping their polluting old vehicles and purchasing new environmentally friendly/ fuel efficient cars. As a consequence, car sales in France in December 2008 were 30% higher than in December 2007 although on the total 2008 year the sales was down 0.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises/industrie/automobile/20090106trib000328250/la-prime-a-la-casse-dope-les-commandes-dautomobiles-.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130213110528/http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises/industrie/automobile/20090106trib000328250/la-prime-a-la-casse-dope-les-commandes-dautomobiles-.html |archive-date=13 February 2013 |title=La prime à la casse dope les commandes d'automobiles |language=French |work=La Tribune |date=6 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-01-11 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; Because the French new cars market fared better than most as well as increased sales in South America, French brands, particularly Renault, now have bigger shares of the world's market despite selling fewer cars in 2008 than in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises/industrie/automobile/20090109trib000329530/renault-ventes-mondiales-en-baisse-en-2008-mais-part-de-marche-en-hausse-.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090122055141/http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises/industrie/automobile/20090109trib000329530/renault-ventes-mondiales-en-baisse-en-2008-mais-part-de-marche-en-hausse-.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 January 2009 |title=Renault : ventes mondiales en baisse en 2008 mais part de marché en hausse |language=French |work=La Tribune |date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly exposed industry is naval construction, an order concerning a packet boat for [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]] was already cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/actualite/depeche/reuters/317/600870/ncl_annule_la_commande_d_un_paquebot_a_stx_europe.shtml |title=NCL annule la commande d'un paquebot à STX Europe |language=French |publisher=Journaldunetv.com |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fill the blank in the construction planning the French government is expected to order soon a third [[Mistral class amphibious assault ship|Mistral BPC]], as well as smaller ships, for the French navy to [[DCNS (company)|DCNS]]. This is part of the Sarkozy's rescue plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.meretmarine.com/article.cfm?id=109092 |title=L'Etat va commander un BPC, des engins de débarquement et des navires d'instruction |language=French |publisher=Meretmarine.com |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCNS also won its biggest export contract ever when the Brazilian government placed a €7 billion large order to the company.

Most importantly [[Natixis]], an investment bank, potentially lost €450 million in the process and [[BNP Paribas]] could lose €350 million. Neither Natixis or BNP Paribas directly invested in Madoff's but through bonds issued by the US treasury they could face such loses. It is to be determined if all of these are effectively lost, which ones can be recovered and what can be saved by legal procedures. Other groups like [[AXA]], [[Société Générale]], [[Crédit Agricole]] and [[Groupama]] could also face loses to some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lesechos.fr/info/finance/300316963-affaire-madoff-natixis-bnp-paribas-societe-generale-casa-axa-devoilent-leur-exposition.htm |title=Affaire Madoff : Natixis, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Casa, AXA... dévoilent leur exposition |language=French |work=Les Échos|location=France |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2008, Dutch-[[Belgium|Belgian]] bank [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] was partially [[nationalized]] with a cash infusion from the [[Benelux]] countries amounting to €11.2 billion. Fortis' troubles started in the beginning of the year with an announcement that it faced around $1.5bn of losses in the American sub-prime catastrophe. In June, the company announced a selloff of assets to raise €5 bn to improve the liquidity of the organisation. This, however, proved insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7640247.stm |title=Fortis is 'keystone' European bank |publisher=BBC |author=Ben Shore |date=28 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 2008, it was announced the French bank BNP Paribas would take over 75 percent of Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66 percent in [[Luxembourg]], in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/la-crise-financiere/article/2008/10/06/bnp-paribas-prend-le-controle-de-fortis-en-belgique-et-au-luxembourg_1103272_1101386.html |title=BNP-Paribas rachète Fortis en Belgique et au Luxembourg |agency=Reuters |language=French |work=Le Monde |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the Belgian government was accused of pressuring shareholders and collapsed over the controversy thus delaying the operation. A new proposition was made on 30 January 2009 with slightly different terms. BNP Paribas would take over 75% of Fortis' banking activities in Belgium and only 10% of the insurance activities in return of what the Belgian government would take 11.7% of BNP Paribas.

===Portugal===
{{main|Economic history of Portugal}}
In the summer of 2010, [[Moody's]] Investors Service cut Portugal's [[sovereign bond]] rating down two notches from an Aa2 to an A1.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bond credit rating]]s&lt;/ref&gt; Due to spending on economic stimuli, Portugal's [[debt]] had increased sharply compared to the gross domestic product. Moody noted that the rising debt would weigh heavily on the government's short-term finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10610673.stm |title=Moody's downgrades Portugal debt |publisher=BBC News |date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year, Portugal was one of the countries identified in the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] as concern spread over increasing government [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] and debt levels in certain countries.

Also in 2010, the country reached a record high unemployment rate of nearly 11%, a figure not seen for over two decades, while the number of [[public servant]]s remained very high.

International [[financial market]]s compelled the Portuguese Government led by Prime Minister [[José Sócrates]], to make radical changes in economic policy, like other European governments had done before. Thus, in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other [[Eurozone]] partners, through a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for [[public servant]]s. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4 percent, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the [[European Union]]'s [[Stability and Growth Pact]] three percent limit.

In November 2010, [[risk premium]]s on Portuguese [[bond (finance)|bond]]s hit euro lifetime highs as investors and creditors worried that the country would fail to reign in its budget deficit and debt. The yield on the country's 10-year government bonds reached 7 percent&amp;nbsp;– a level the Portuguese Finance Minister [[Fernando Teixeira dos Santos]] had previously said would require the country to seek financial help from international institutions.

A report published in January 2011 by the [[Diário de Notícias]], a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974 and 2010, the democratic [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese Republic government]]s had encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This had funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]], inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[public debt]] creation and mismanaged European [[structural and cohesion funds]] for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110108021723/http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1750097&amp;seccao=Media Grande investigação DN Conheça o verdadeiro peso do Estado], [[Diário de Notícias]] (7 January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2011, José Sócrates resigned following passage of a [[no confidence]] motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110323-portuguese-parliament-votes-against-austerity-plan-jose-socrates-eurozone |title=Portuguese parliament votes against austerity plan |date=23 March 2011 |publisher=[[France 24]] |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2011, the resigning Prime Minister announced on the television that the country, facing a status of bankruptcy, would request financial assistance to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] (at the time managed by [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]], like Greece and the Republic of Ireland had done before.

In order to accomplish the [[European Union]]/IMF-led rescue plan for Portugal's [[sovereign debt]] crisis, in July and August 2011, the new government led by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] announced it was going to cut on state spending and increase austerity measures, including public servant wage cuts and additional tax increases.

On 29 September 2008 Iceland's [[Glitnir (bank)|Glitnir]] was effectively nationalized after the Icelandic government acquired 75% of the bank's stock.

===Hungary===
On 10 October 2008, the [[Forint]] dropped by 10%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090112094604/http://www.boursorama.com/international/detail_actu_intern.phtml?news=5958539]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) announced on 16 October that it was bailing out [[Hungary]] with a 5 billion euro (US$6.7 billion) loan facility, just days after the [[Hungarian Finance Ministry]] said it was seeking consultations with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) about a possible support package. The ECB's unprecedented move in bailing out a non-euro state underlines the crisis unraveling in Hungary and its possible impact on the rest of Central Europe. Several players will be affected, but at particular risk are the [[Austria]]n banks which invested so heavily in the region. A potential serious hiccup of the Austrian banks could mark a significant blow to Europe's already troubled banking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20081020_hungary_hungarian_financial_crisis_impact_austrian_banks |title=Hungary: The Hungarian Financial Crisis’ Impact On Austrian Banks |publisher=Stratfor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard &amp; Poor's said on 30 July 2008 that 70,000 homeowners were in [[negative equity]] and it could rise to 1.7 million or about one in six homeowners in the UK based on an expected 17 percent decline into 2009. The Bank of England reported that mortgage approvals fell by a record of nearly 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/property_and_mortgages/article4433925.ece|title=Nationwide warns of recession as house price drop doubles|work=The Times|date=31 July 2008|accessdate=2008-08-11 | location=London|first=Deirdre|last=Hipwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Ireland]], house sales saw a fall of some 50 per cent according to a survey by the University of Ulster/Bank of Ireland and housing prices fell on average by 4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0806/1217923985168.html|title=House sales in North decline by about half|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=6 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; British manufacturing activity declined by the most in almost a decade in July, the third consecutive month of declines.

The number of companies that went into administration in May–July 2008 was 938, an increase of 60 percent compared with the same period in 2007. The number of company liquidations in the second quarter of 2008 rose to 3,689, a 16 percent increase and the highest quarterly figure in five years. House builders expected the number of houses built in 2008 in England and Wales to be the lowest since 1924. The declines were seen as an indication the United Kingdom had a high chance of entering a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/01/business/EU-Britain-Economy.php|title=UK economic data points to recession|work=International Herald Tribune|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factory production in the UK dropped 0.5 percent in June 2008 when twelve out of 13 categories of factory production fell.

The value of sterling relative to other currencies dropped by around 30%.

The [[Office for National Statistics]] later gave a revised number saying growth in the British economy was at zero, the worst since the second quarter of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Data confirms economy shrinking | date = 26 November 2008 | publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7749729.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current slowdown has ended 16 years of continuous economic growth, the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/business/news/display.var.2432004.0.Recession_fears_are_stoked_as_UK_economy_grinds_to_a_halt.php|title=Recession fears are stoked as UK economy grinds to a halt|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=23 August 2008|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the economy contracted by 0.1 percent in the period from May to July 2008 and 0.2 percent from June to August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=alCAr4RDjjUc&amp;refer=uk|title=U.K. Economy Contracts, Edges Toward a Recession|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter backlash due to the personal financial effects of the global credit crunch was widely attributed by politicians of the [[Labour Party (UK)|United Kingdom Labour Party]], which had been in power since 1997, as the reason their political fortunes took a dramatic downturn through May 2008, with a succession of defeats in by-elections and the London Mayoral election, and the worst opinion poll result in their history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Political opponents countered this apparent excuse by pointing to the fact that the incumbent Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], who had taken office in June 2007 just before the crisis broke, had been the country's '[[Chancellorship of Gordon Brown|Iron Chancellor]]', and had allegedly not ensured the country had sufficient monetary reserves to be able to lower taxes and ease the burden on voters, despite overseeing one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in the country's history. In August 2008 the party also faced calls to impose a [[Windfall Tax (United Kingdom)|windfall tax]] on the utility companies, who were reaping record profits due to the fuel crisis, perceived as in bad taste given rising food and fuel prices.

On 17 September 2008, news emerged that the banking and insurance group [[HBOS]] (Halifax Bank of Scotland) was in merger talks with [[Lloyds TSB]] about creating a UK retail banking giant worth £30bn. The move received the backing of the British government which stated that it will over-rule any claims from the competition authorities.

According to the [[Office for National Statistics]] unemployment claims in August 2008 increased by 32,500 to reach 904,900. The wider Labour Force Survey measure found joblessness rose by 81,000 to 1.72 million between May and July, the largest increase since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/unemploymentdata.recession|title=Sharp rise in unemployment claimants|last=Hopkins|first=Kathryn|work=The Guardian|date=17 September 2008|accessdate=2008-09-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, British bank [[Bradford &amp; Bingley]]'s £20 billion savings business was acquired by Spanish bank [[Grupo Santander]]. While its retail deposit business along with its branch network will be sold to Santander. The mortgage book, personal loan book, headquarters, treasury assets and its wholesale liabilities will be taken into public ownership.

From 1 December 2008, the UK Government made the decision to cut [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Value added tax|VAT]] from 17.5% to 15% for 13 months in an attempt to encourage a big spend from UK shoppers before Christmas, and again in the run-up to Christmas 2009.

On 4 December 2008, the [[Bank of England]] cut interest rates from 3% to 2%, which amounted to the lowest level since 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7764741.stm|title=Bank cuts UK rates to 57-year low |publisher=BBC|date=4 December 2008|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2009, the Bank of England reduced rates even further, from 2% to 1.5%, the lowest level in the its 315-year history.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

On 23 January 2009, Government figures from the [[Office for National Statistics]] showed that the UK was officially in recession for the first time since 1991; with a 1.5% fall in gross domestic product during the final quarter of 2008 being the sharpest for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7846266.stm|title=UK in recession as economy slides |publisher=BBC|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 February 2009 interest rates were cut further from 1.5% to 1%.

A February 2009 research on the main British [[insurers]] showed that most of them are not considering officially raising [[insurance premium]]s for the year 2009, in spite of the 20% raise predictions made by [[The Daily Telegraph]] or [[The Daily Mirror]]. However, it is expected that the capital liquidity will become an issue and determine increases, having their capital tied up in investments yielding smaller dividends, corroborated with the £644 million underwriting losses suffered in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abi.org.uk/BookShop/ResearchReports/Key%20facts%202008.pdf |accessdate=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407065610/http://www.abi.org.uk/BookShop/ResearchReports/Key%20facts%202008.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2009, the Bank of England cut interest rates yet again, from 1% to 0.5%. The same week, it announced that it would begin a policy of [[quantitative easing]], printing up to £150 billion of new money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/4950466/Retirement-plans-of-millions-of-Britons-at-risk-after-Bank-of-England-prints-money.html|title=Retirement plans of millions of Britons at risk after Bank of England prints money|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=2009-06-03 | location=London | first=Edmund | last=Conway | date=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures published in March 2009 by the Bank of England revealed that over $1 trillion in foreign holdings had been withdrawn from UK banks between spring and the end of 2008, representing a huge loss of confidence in UK financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/run-on-uk-sees-foreign-investors-pull-1-trillion-out-of-the-city-1639413.html|title=Run on UK sees foreign investors pull $1 trillion out of the City|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-06-03 | location=London | first=Sean | last=O'grady | date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2008, unemployment had risen to over 1.8 million (compared to less than 1.7 million at the start of the year and less than 1.5 million as recently as 2005) and by early 2009 had exceeded 2 million, the highest since 1996. It was feared that unemployment could reach 3 million during 2010 – a level not seen since the 1980s. However, the end of the recession in the United Kingdom was declared on 26 January 2010, by which time unemployment stood at nearly 2.5 million. A peak of almost 2.7 million was reached in late 2011.

A report by the [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] produced in March 2009 stated that the UK economy shrank by 1.6 percent during the last quarter of 2008, with a 1% drop in household spending. A further decline of up to 4% GDP during 2009 was predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1165160/British-economy-shrinking-faster-expected-Alistair-Darling-admits-Were-guilty.html?ITO=1490|title=British economy shrinking faster than expected as Alistair Darling admits: We're all guilty|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=2009-03-27 | location=London | first=Benedict | last=Brogan | date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, it was reported that first quarter GDP had shrunk by 1.9 percent, with a prediction of a 4.1 percent drop for the year. The largest contributor to this figure was manufacturing output, which fell by 6.9 percent over the quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=192 |title=ONS Home |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] cut its rating outlook for the UK to negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE54K2A320090521 | agency=Reuters | title=S&amp;P cuts UK's rating outlook to negative | date=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official figures also showed that British public borrowing hit a record high for the month of April, the first month of the new tax year – net public borrowing came in at £8.5bn in April 2009, compared to April 2008's figure of £1.8bn

In June 2009, the figure for the first quarter GDP drop was revised downwards from 1.9 to 2.4 percent, with economic output falling 4.1% from the previous year. Revised figures also showed that the recession began in Q2 of 2008, rather than Q3 of 2008 as previously reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8125898.stm|title=Sharp contraction for UK economy|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-30 | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3 months to May 2009, the unemployment rate showed a record quarterly rise of 281,000 to stand at 2.38 million – which represented 7.6% of the working population. In the three months to June, the number of job vacancies fell to a record low of 429,000, down by 35,000 from the previous quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8151017.stm|title=Record rise in UK jobless total |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-07-15 | date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of June 2009, the public sector debt stood at £798.8 billion, equivalent to 56.6% of GDP, the highest percentage since records began in 1974.

By August 2009, UK unemployment stood at more than 2.4 million, the highest since 1995. The Bank of England announced that due to the deepening recession in the UK, it would be extending its quantitative easing program to a new total of £175 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a4aYFAQngM6w|title=BOE Extends Bond Purchases After Recession Deepened|publisher=Bloomberg | date=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, The Bank of England announced it would be adding a further £25 billion in continuation of quantitative easing in assisting the UK economy through the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8344189.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Extra £25bn to stimulate economy | date=5 November 2009 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, it was revealed that the UK's unemployment total stood at almost 2.5 million – another monthly rise and the highest level for 15 years – but the number of people claiming unemployment benefit had actually fallen by more than 6,000. By this stage, the UK was one of the last major economies still in recession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8427237.stm BBC News: UK out of Recession] Access Date 26 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 26 February 2010 it was revealed that the UK economy had grown by 0.3% within the last quarter of 2009 and the UK was out of recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8538293.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=UK economic growth revised upward | date=26 February 2010 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many economists were still unsure of the situation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway |first=Edmund |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/edmundconway/100003306/bad-good-news-on-the-economy/ |title=The Telegraph: Bad Good News on the Economy |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=26 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the relatively small drop in unemployment benefit claimants could be attributed to seasonal jobs, and with a general election imminent, the government had every reason to present the best economic picture possible. Other factors which could have produced an artificially high growth rate included the end of the "cash-for-clunkers" car replacement scheme, and the ending of a VAT cut from 15% to 17.5% in January causing many consumers to push forward their purchases. In addition, £200 billion had been pumped into the economy via QE, and the central bank rate had been held at almost 0% for most of the year. Thus although official figures showed that the UK had indeed exited recession fears of a double-dip recession remained. According to the IMF, the UK economy had grown slower than that of Portugal or Italy in 2010.

The popularity of Britain's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government, led by prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] since June 2007, slumped dramatically during 2008 and 2009, with low rankings in opinion polls, dismal performances in local and European elections, and losing several seats in parliamentary by-elections. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] opposition, led by [[David Cameron]], won the most votes and seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], but fell short of an overall majority, and agreed a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to form a new government. The new government faced numerous economic challenges, namely re-establishing economic growth, reducing the national deficit and reducing unemployment, not to mention a host of social problems, many of which had been intensified as a result of the recession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/default.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===

Despite high economic growth in 2008 (8.7%), [[Romania]] was affected very hard by the crisis, analysts forecasting a contraction of 8–9% for 2009, as the new government established in the late 2008 was unable to take any anti-crisis measures.

[[Economy of Romania|Romania's economy]] has been one of the hardest hit in Europe. The country's trade deficit fell by more than 60 percent during the first half of 2009, but not because of exports taking off, but due to business bankruptcies and unemployment decreasing consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/artikel.asp?Artikel=3022205 |archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100312164356/http%3A//www.sr.se/cgi%2Dbin/ekot/artikel.asp?Artikel%3D3022205 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-03-12 |title=Svårt ekonomiskt läge för Rumänien – Ekot |publisher=Sr.se }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===

[[Sweden]] has not been severely affected, and no banks or financial institutions have had real trouble. However, some effects have been visible, mostly based on distrust and similar psychological mechanisms. The stockmarket has declined heavily, because of influence from New York and other markets. Some banks, especially [[Swedbank]] had invested heavily in US housing bonds.

The banks did not trust each other well and the difference between the [[Interbank lending market|interbank interest rate]] and the state interest rate has gone up at least 1%. The housing loan interest rates have gone up even further. The global sales especially of cars has gone down, forcing the Swedish car industry to lay off staff and contractors. The increased fear of enduring recession and the increased financing costs have lowered company investments and private consumption.

Sweden entered recession after a two consecutive quarter of economic contraction.

===Ukraine===
{{Further|2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis}}

Ratings agency [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch]] warned [[Ukraine]] could be headed for a [[currency crisis]] as economic fundamentals deteriorate and the country enters [[2008 Ukrainian political crisis|another period of political uncertainty]]. Fitch said the current account deficit was likely to widen further as prices of gas imports rise and prices of its steel exports fall and said Ukraine was likely to need to borrow more at a time when global debt markets have ground to a virtual standstill. Ukraine's central bank chief, [[Petro Poroshenko]], said he saw no need to intervene to protect the currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/7826958 |title=Fitch cuts Ukraine outlook on risk of currency crisis |work=The Guardian |date=25 September 2008 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929053021/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7826958 |archivedate=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ukraine]] was hit heavy by the economic crisis of 2008, analysts say the plights of Ukraine are slumping steel prices, local banking problems and the [[Russia–Ukraine gas disputes#Disputes of 2007-2008|cutting of Russian gas supply in January 2009]].&lt;ref name="Unian"&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-291102.html Trade in Ukraine hrvynia drying up amid crisis], [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]] (19 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Key industries such as metallurgy and machine building are laying off workers, and real wages have started to fall for the first time in a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[swords&amp;#93;=8fd5893941d69d0be3f378576261ae3e&amp;tx_ttnews[any_of_the_words&amp;#93;=Ukraine&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news&amp;#93;=34278&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid&amp;#93;=7&amp;cHash=0b4d5d9e67 Hard Times for Ukrainian Banks, Central Bank Chairman Under Fire], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (17 December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The Norwegian government pension fund suffered an investment loss of $92 billion during 2008. However, the overall value of the fund rose due to oil sales and currency movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7937360.stm|title=Norway pension fund loses $92bn|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-11-03 | date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
With economic growth ceasing by the end in 2008, the [[Croatia]]n economy entered a crisis that exposed numerous structural issues and unsustainable growth mechanisms, causing the period of instability to fester until as late as 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/sanaderu-je-trebalo-vise-od-godinu-dana-da-prizna-kako-je-hrvatska-u-banani/6448993/ | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Jutarnji list]] | date = 10 August 2017 | accessdate = 1 November 2018 | title = Deset godina krize - Sanaderu je trebalo više od godinu dana da prizna kako je Hrvatska ‘u banani’ | first = Andrea | last = Koščec | trans-title = Ten years of crisis - Sanader took more than a year to admit Croatia is 'screwed'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country was still in the midst of what was effectively a six-year long recession when it [[2013 enlargement of the European Union|became a member of the European Union]] in July 2013.

The recession had contributed to the fall of the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II]] and its replacement with the [[Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor]]. It was interrupted by a period of stagnation in 2011, that nevertheless led to the election of the [[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović]], yet the economy soon returned to recession, in which it remained until the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ovako-je-pocela-recesija-u-hrvatskoj-drzava-je-u-banani---374438.html | language = Croatian | work = Dnevnik.hr | publisher = [[Nova TV (Croatia)]] | date = 28 February 2015 | accessdate = 1 November 2018 | title = Hrvatska 'Davne' 2008. godine - Recesija u Hrvatskoj od prvog dana - 'Bez dramatike, visimo o niti' | trans-title = Croatia of 'ancient' 2008 - Recession in Croatia from day one - 'Without being dramatic, we are hanging by a thread'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Economic Recovery Plan==
{{Main|2008 European Union stimulus plan}}
In November 2008, the [[European Commission]] presented the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|European Economic Recovery Plan]],&lt;ref&gt;Communication from the Commission and the European Council, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2008:0800:FIN:EN:HTML A European Economic Recovery Plan], 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708050823/http://ec.europa.eu/research/transport/info/article_9086_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a plan of 200 billion euros (1.2% of GDP) to fight against the consequences of the economic crisis in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[[European Commission]], [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1771 The Commission launches a major Recovery Plan for growth and jobs, to boost demand and restore confidence in the European economy], 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the plan is a series of national measures to be implemented by each government, without much coherency between the policies. The measures included incentives to investment, tax cuts and social measures.

===Electromobility===
[[Electrification of transport]] ([[electromobility]]) figures prominently in the Green Car Initiative (GCI), included in the European Economic Recovery Plan. [[Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (European Commission)|DG TREN]] is supporting a large European "electromobility" project on [[electric vehicle]]s and related infrastructure with a total budget of around €50million as part of the Green Car Initiative.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/vehicles/road/electric_en.htm |title=Electric vehicles – Transport |publisher=European Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319033116/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/vehicles/road/electric_en.htm |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Highland Games-Opening ceremonies in Canmore.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremonies of 2004 [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]] Highland games]]

'''Highland games''' are events held in spring and summer in [[Scotland]], United Kingdom and other countries as a way of celebrating Scottish and [[Celt]]ic culture, especially that of the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Certain aspects of the games are so well known as to have become emblematic of Scotland, such as the [[bagpipes]], the [[kilt]], and the heavy events, especially the [[caber toss]]. While centred on competitions in piping and drumming, dancing, and Scottish heavy athletics, the games also include entertainment and exhibits related to other aspects of Scottish and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture.

The [[Cowal Highland Gathering]], better known as the ''Cowal Games'', held in [[Dunoon]], [[Scotland]], every August, is the largest Highland games in the world,{{NoteTag|name="Cowal"}} attracting around 3,500 competitors and somewhere in the region of 23,000 spectators&lt;ref name="CHG1"&gt;{{cite web |title = Cowal Highland Gatcitationhering |url = http://www.cowalgathering.com/spectators.php |accessdate=10 July 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120809091943/http://www.cowalgathering.com/spectators.php |archive-date=9 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from around the globe. Worldwide, however, it is exceeded in terms of spectators by two gatherings in the United States: the estimated 30,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =  Grandfather Mountain Highland Games Fast Facts |url = http://www.grandfather.com/about-grandfather-mountain/media/highland-games-press-room/gmhg-fast-facts }}&lt;/ref&gt; that attend [[Grandfather Mountain]] in [[North Carolina]] and the even larger gathering—the largest in the Northern Hemisphere&lt;ref name="Scottish Games Draw Record Crowds"&gt;{{cite web |title = Scottish Games Draw Record Crowds |url = http://www.independentnews.com/scottish-games-draw-record-crowds/collection_bd18c91c-5751-11e5-9720-afdde78f41b4.html |website = The Independent |accessdate = 2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that has taken place every year since 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 150th Scottish Highland Gathering &amp; Games |url = http://thescottishgames.com |website = thescottishgames.com |accessdate = 2015-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event is currently held on Labor Day weekend in [[Pleasanton, California]], and their Sesquicentennial Games held on September 5–6, 2015, attracted record crowds close to 50,000.&lt;ref name="Scottish Games Draw Record Crowds" /&gt;

The games are claimed to have influenced [[Baron Pierre de Coubertin]] when he was planning the [[1896 Summer Olympics#Reviving the Games|revival of the Olympic Games]]. De Coubertin saw a display of Highland games at the [[Paris Exhibition of 1889]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7107301.ece |title = Highland games were the model for modern Olympics |date = 25 April 2010 |publisher = The Times |accessdate = 3 May 2010 |location = London, England |first = Marc |last = Horne }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{NoteTag|name="Olympics"}}

== History ==
The origin of human games and sports predates recorded history. An example of a possible early games venue is at [[Fetteresso Castle|Fetteresso]], although that location is technically a few miles south of the Scotland Highlands.

It is reported in numerous Highland games programs, that King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], in the 11th century, summoned contestants to a foot race to the summit of Craig Choinnich (overlooking [[Braemar]]).{{NoteTag|name="Canmore"}} King Malcolm created this foot race in order to find the fastest runner in the land to be his royal messenger. Some have seen this apocryphal event to be the origin of today's modern Highland games.{{NoteTag|name="origins"}}

There is a document from 1703 summoning the [[Scottish clan|clan]] of the Laird of Grant, [[Clan Grant]]. They were to arrive wearing Highland coats and "also with [[long gun|gun]], [[sword]], [[pistol]] and [[dirk]]".{{NoteTag|name="Grant"}} From this letter, it is believed that the competitions would have included feats of arms.

However, the modern Highland games are largely a Victorian invention, developed after the Highland Clearances.

== Events ==

=== Heavy events ===
[[File:Caber 2.jpg|thumb|A caber being thrown at the 2000 [[New Hampshire]] Highland Games]]

In their original form many centuries ago, Highland games revolved around athletic and sports competitions. Though other activities were always a part of the festivities, many today still consider Highland athletics to be what the games are all about—in short, that the athletics are the Games, and all the other activities are just entertainment. Regardless, it remains true today that the athletic competitions are at least an integral part of the events and one—the caber toss—has come to almost symbolize the Highland games.

Although quite a range of events can be a part of the Highland athletics competition, a few have become standard.

* [[Caber toss]]: A long log is stood upright and hoisted by the competitor who balances it vertically holding the smaller end in his hands (see photo). Then the competitor runs forward attempting to toss it in such a way that it turns end over end with the upper (larger) end striking the ground first. The smaller end that was originally held by the athlete then hits the ground in the 12 o'clock position measured relative to the direction of the run. If successful, the athlete is said to have turned the caber. Cabers vary greatly in length, weight, taper, and balance, all of which affect the [[degree of difficulty]] in making a successful toss. Competitors are judged on how closely their throws approximate the ideal 12 o'clock toss on an imaginary clock.
* [[Stone put]]: This event is similar to the modern-day [[shot put]] as seen in the Olympic Games. Instead of a steel shot, a large stone of variable weight is often used. There are also some differences from the Olympic shot put in allowable techniques. There are two versions of the stone toss events, differing in allowable technique. The "Braemar Stone" uses a 20–26&amp;nbsp;lb stone for men (13–18&amp;nbsp;lb for women) and does not allow any run up to the toeboard or "trig" to deliver the stone, i.e., it is a standing put. In the "Open Stone" using a 16–22&amp;nbsp;lb stone for men (or 8–12&amp;nbsp;lb for women), the thrower is allowed to use any throwing style so long as the stone is put with one hand with the stone resting cradled in the neck until the moment of release. Most athletes in the open stone event use either the "glide" or the "spin" techniques.
* [[Scottish hammer throw]]: This event is similar to the [[hammer throw]] as seen in modern-day track and field competitions, though with some differences. In the Scottish event, a round metal ball (weighing 16 or 22&amp;nbsp;lb for men or 12 or 16&amp;nbsp;lb for women) is attached to the end of a shaft about 4 feet in length and made out of wood, bamboo, rattan, or plastic. With the feet in a fixed position, the hammer is whirled about one's head and thrown for distance over the shoulder. Hammer throwers sometimes employ specially designed footwear with flat blades to dig into the turf to maintain their balance and resist the centrifugal forces of the implement as it is whirled about the head. This substantially increases the distance attainable in the throw.

[[File:Weight throw, 2002 Celtic Festival.jpg|thumb|Weight throw]]
* [[Weight throw]], also known as the weight for distance event. There are actually two separate events, one using a light (28&amp;nbsp;lb for men and 14&amp;nbsp;lb for women) and the other a heavy (56&amp;nbsp;lb for men, 42&amp;nbsp;lb for masters men, and 28&amp;nbsp;lb for women) weight. The weights are made of metal and have a handle attached either directly or by means of a chain. The implement is thrown using one hand only, but otherwise using any technique. Usually a spinning technique is employed. The longest throw wins.
* [[Weight over the bar]], also known as weight for height. The athletes attempt to toss a 56-pound (4-[[stone (unit)|stone]]) weight with an attached handle over a horizontal bar using only one hand. Each athlete is allowed three attempts at each height. Successful clearance of the height allows the athlete to advance into the next round at a greater height. The competition is determined by the highest successful toss with fewest misses being used to break tie scores.
* [[Sheaf toss]]: A bundle of straw (the sheaf) weighing {{convert|20|lb|kg}} for the men and {{convert|10|lb|kg}} for the women and wrapped in a burlap bag is tossed vertically with a pitchfork over a raised bar much like that used in pole vaulting. The progression and scoring of this event is similar to the Weight Over The Bar. There is significant debate among athletes as to whether the sheaf toss is in fact an authentic Highland event. Some argue it is actually a country fair event, but all agree that it is a great crowd pleaser.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
* '''Maide-leisg''' (Scots Gaelic meaning 'Lazy Stick', {{IPA-gd|matʲəˈʎeʃkʲ|pron}}): Trial of strength performed by two men sitting on the ground with the soles of their feet pressing against each other. Thus seated, they held a stick between their hands which they pulled against each other until one of them was raised from the ground. The oldest 'Maide Leisg' competition in the world takes place at the Carloway show and Highland Games on the Isle of Lewis.

Many of the Heavy Events competitors in Scottish highland athletics are former high school and college track and field athletes who find the Scottish games are a good way to continue their competitive careers.

Increasingly in the USA, the Heavy Events are attracting women and master class athletes which has led to a proliferation of additional classes in Heavy Events competitions. Lighter implements are used in the classes.

=== Music ===
[[File:Massed Bands, 2005 Pacific Northwest Highland Games.jpg|thumb|Massed bands at the 2005 [http://www.sshga.org Pacific Northwest Highland Games]]]

[[File:Pipeband circle.JPG|thumb|Highland Pipeband Competition Circle [Prince Charles Pipe Band 2008]]

For many Highland games festival attendees, the most memorable of all the events at the games is the massing of the pipe bands. Normally held in conjunction with the opening and closing ceremonies of the games, as many as 20 or more pipe bands will march and play together. The result is a thunderous rendition of ''[[Scotland the Brave]]'' or ''[[Amazing Grace]]'', and other crowd-pleasing favourites.

It is, in fact, the music of the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|bagpipe]] which has come to symbolize music at the Games and, indeed, in [[Scotland]] itself. In addition to the massed bands, nearly all Highland games gatherings feature a wide range of piping and drumming competition, including solo piping and drumming, small group ensembles and, of course, the pipe bands themselves.

Music at Highland games gatherings also includes other forms, such as [[fiddle|fiddling]], [[harp]] circles and [[Celt]]ic bands, usually spiced with a large amount of bagpipe music.

=== Dance ===
The [[Cowal Highland Gathering]] hosts the annual World Highland Dancing Championship. This event gathers the best competitive dancers from around the world who compete for the [[Highland dancing#Organization|SOBHD]] sanctioned World Championship title.

=== Secondary events and attractions ===
[[File:2005 Tacoma Highland Games.jpg|thumb|Assembling for the parade of clans at the 2005 [http://www.tacomagames.org Tacoma Highland Games]]]

At modern-day Highland Games events, a wide variety of other activities and events are generally available. Foremost among these are the [[Scottish Clan|clan]] tents and vendors of Scottish related goods. The various clan societies make the Highland games one of the main focus of their seasonal activities, usually making an appearance at as many such events as possible. Visitors can find out information about the Scottish roots and can become active in their own clan society if they wish.

At modern games, armouries will display their collections of swords and armour, and often perform mock battles. Various vendors selling Scottish memorabilia are also present selling everything from [[Irn-Bru]] to the stuffed likeness of the [[Loch Ness Monster]].

[[Herding dog]] trials and exhibitions are often held, showcasing the breeder's and trainer's skills. In addition, there may be other types of Highland animals present, such as the [[Highland cattle]].

Various traditional and modern [[Celts|Celtic]] arts are often showcased. These could include harpers' circles, [[Scottish country dancing]], and one or more entertainment stages. In addition, most events usually feature a pre-event ceilidh (a type of social event with traditional music, dancing, song, and other forms of entertainment).

Various food vendors will also offer assorted types of traditional Scottish refreshment and sustenance.

{{Expand French|Horace (Corneille)|date=December 2009}}
:''For the 1972 television play, see [[Horace (television play)]].''
'''''Horace''''' is a play by the French dramatist [[Pierre Corneille]], drawing on [[Livy]]'s account of the [[Horatii|battle between the Horatii and the Curiatii]]. Written in reply to critics of his ''[[Le Cid]]'', it was dedicated to [[cardinal Richelieu]] and proved the author's second major success on its premiere in March 1640. Its protagonist Horatius is more daring than Rodrigue in ''Le Cid'', in that he sacrifices his best friend and kills his sister Camilla. It was the basis for the libretti for the operas ''[[Les Horaces]]'' and ''[[Gli Orazi e i Curiazi]]''.

== Plot summary ==

The play, which begins in [[Rome]], starts out in an atmosphere of peace and happiness. The Roman Horatii family is united to the Alban Curatii family.  The young Horace is married to Sabine, a young Alban woman whose brother, Curiace, is engaged to Camille, the sister of Horace.

But the fratricidal war which breaks out between the two cities destroys this harmony.  To finish it, each city designates three champions to fight in single combat to determine who will win.  Contrary to expectations, fate chooses the three Horatii brothers for Rome and the three Curiatii brothers for Alba Longa.  Horace, astonished, did not expect such a great honor.  The friends once again find themselves face to face, with their consciences resolved for different reasons.  While Horace is motivated by his patriotic duty, Curiace laments his cruel fate.

The people are likewise moved to see these six young men, nevertheless closely knit, fighting for the good of their country.  However, their fate has been decided. During combat, two Horatii are quickly killed, and the last, the hero of the play, must then confront the three injured Curiatii alone.  Filled with cunning and bravery, he first pretends to flee to avoid facing them all together.  Then, when he attacks, he kills them one by one and thus achieves victory.

After having received the congratulations of all of Rome, Horace kills his sister, who blames him for the murder of her beloved.  The trial which follows includes a scene of a rousing plea from the father Horatius, who defends honor (a [[Value (ethics)|value]] very dear to Corneille), and thus Horace, against the romanticism represented by Camille.  Horace is acquitted despite the indictment of Valère, a Roman gentleman who was also in love with Camille, much like Curiace.

== Detailed plot ==
&lt;!---
ACTE I

Scènes 1 et 2

Albe-La-Longue et Rome cités sœurs et voisines, sont en guerre. L'albaine Sabine est mariée à un Romain de noble famille, Horace ; Camille, sœur d'Horace, est, de son côté, fiancée à un noble albain, Curiace, frère de Sabine. Situation atroce, causée par la guerre, que viennent déplorer les deux femmes tour à tour à leur confidente commune, Julie, femme romaine.

Scène 3

Premier coup de théâtre : Curiace annonce que la mêlée générale n'aura pas lieu ; six guerriers, trois Albains et trois Romains décideront à eux seuls par les armes de l'issue de la guerre et du destin de leur pays respectif. A l'issue du combat, le pays des champions vaincus se soumettra au pays des vainqueurs du reste honorables. L'espoir semble renaître : Camille pourra enfin jouir de son amour avec Curiace ...

ACTE II

1

Horace et ses frères ont été choisis pour défendre Rome lors du combat qui décidera du sort des deux cités. Curiace est partagé entre son désir de voir Albe victorieuse, et sa peur de voir mourir son beau-frère et ami.

2

Flavian vient annoncer à Curiace que lui et ses frères ont été choisis pour défendre Albe. Curiace est étonné, mais accepte.

3

Horace et Curiace, malgré la crainte qu'ils ont de devoir s'affronter, sont fiers de défendre leurs cités respectives, et l'honneur qui les attend dépasse leur liens d'amitié et de famille.

4

Camille entre en scène, et pleure. Elle déplore le choix des chefs de guerre. Horace lui demande d'accepter le sort, et de ne pas maudire le vainqueur, quel qu'il soit.

5

Restée seule auprès de son amant Curiace, Camille pleure leur sort funeste. Curiace s'attendrit, puis, en renonçant à l'amour de son amante, décide d'accomplir son devoir.

6

Horace, Sabine, Curiace et Camille s'adressent des adieux mutuels. Sabine déplore leur situation, Curiace et Horace en sont ébranlés. Camille raille ironiquement leur attrendrissement, mais Horace s'en défend.

7

Le vieil Horace entre et reproche leur attendrissement aux deux guerriers. Sabine, éplorée, sort en compagnie de Camille.

8

Le vieil Horace demande à Horace et Curiace d'accomplir sans délai leur devoir. Horace lui enjoint d'empêcher les femmes d'assister au combat.

ACTE III

1

Sabine ne sait qu'espérer entre la victoire de Rome et celle d'Albe. Au désespoir, elle invoque les dieux et leur reproche leur cruauté.

2

Julie vient lui annoncer que la décision des chefs a été contestée, que les combattants ont été séparés, et qu'il a été décidé de consulter les dieux pour savoir si le combat doit avoir lieu ou non. Sabine y voit une réponse des dieux à ses prières.

3

Camille entre. Elle ne voit dans cet événement qu'un sursis. Selon elle, la volonté des dieux est aussi celle des princes, elle pense donc que le combat aura lieu. Julie part aux nouvelles.

4

Sabine et Julie soupirent toutes deux et prétendent chacune subir de plus grands maux que l'autre. Sabine dit que Camille peut changer d'amant si Curiace meurt, tandis qu'elle doit fidélité à son mari Horace. Camille lui rétorque qu'elle ne connaît pas l'amour, qui ne peut être estompé par la seule volonté.

5

Le vieil Horace vient annoncer la décision des dieux : le combat aura lieu. Sabine pleure. Le vieil Horace loue la grandeur de Rome et espère sa victoire.

6

Julie annonce la défaite de Rome. Seul Horace a survécu, et a pris la fuite. Le vieil Horace s'emporte contre la lâcheté de son fils.

ACTE IV

1

Le vieil Horace s'emporte toujours contre la lâcheté de son fils. Camille essaie en vain de tempérer les ardeurs du vieillard.

2

Valère entre en scène et raconte le véritable dénouement du combat : Horace, en prenant la fuite, a cherché à fatiguer ses adversaires pour les affronter un par un. Les ayant tous vaincus, il a donné la victoire à Rome. Le vieil Horace loue le courage de son fils. Valère se retire en annonçant la venue prochaine du roi.

3

Le vieil Horace reproche à sa fille Camille de pleurer et lui demande d'accepter le sort et de se montrer heureuse de la victoire de Rome en participant aux cérémonies en l'honneur d'Horace.

4

Camille, restée seule, se lamente du sort cruel qui s'acharne sur elle, et décide de se montrer indigne de son frère et de son père en ne respectant pas le vainqueur et en offensant sa victoire.

5

Horace entre et demande à sa soeur de se montrer respectueuse de sa victoire. Mais Camille ne lui rend que des pleurs. Horace, offensé et la jugeant traître à sa patrie puisqu'elle pleure un ennemi de Rome, la tue. 

6

Procule, soldat romain ayant assisté à la scène, s'indigne de ce crime. Horace prétend avoir fait là un acte de justice.

7

Sabine entre en scène et lui demande de la tuer à son tour. Horace ne répond pas à sa demande et lui demande au contraire de participer à sa gloire. Sabine lui reproche son insensibilité, et lui demande à nouveau la mort pour châtiment de ses pleurs, ou pour grâce, en mettant fin à ses souffrances. Horace déplore la capacité des femmes à émouvoir, et sort de scène de peur de prendre pitié. Sabine restée seule annonce sa volonté de se suicider.

ACTE V

1

Le vieil Horace désapprouve le crime d'Horace, mais également l'attitude de feue Camille qui s'est montrée traître à sa patrie en pleurant Curiace. Horace, honteux de son meurtre et ne souhaitant pas déshonorer sa famille, demande à être puni de mort par son père. Mais celui-ci ne veut pas se résoudre à un tel châtiment.

2

Le roi Tulle entre et vient honorer Horace, tout en plaignant le vieil Horace pour la mort de sa fille Camille. Valère, qui aimait Camille, demande au roi de punir Horace. Tulle écoute son plaidoyer, puis la défense d'Horace : celui-ci demande la mort en châtiment, de manière à ce que son crime ne souille pas sa gloire.

3

Sabine entre en scène et demande la mort pour expier le crime de son mari et apaiser la colère des dieux. Le vieil Horace prend la parole et dit à Sabine que ses frères défunts désavoueraient ses larmes. Puis il dit au Roi et à Valère que le meurtre de Camille ne concerne que leur famille, et qu'Horace est un appui dont Rome ne peut se priver. Tulle, convaincu par le discours du vieil Horace, considère la bravoure d'Horace plus grande que son crime (bien qu'il désapprouve ce dernier) et lui demande de ne pas haïr Valère. A Sabine, il demande de sécher ses pleurs, et veut que le lendemain soient inhumés en un même tombeau Camille et Curiace.

==Reception==
This play was criticized at the time of its creation for its failure to conform to notions of a [[tragic hero]]:  by killing Camille, Horace had lost the necessary innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Nurse, ''Classical Voices'' p 23 {{ISBN|0-245-50566-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corneille rejected the notion of changing the death and so the Academy's formulated doctrine, and so helped prevent neo-Classicism from stifling theater.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Nurse, ''Classical Voices'' p 24 {{ISBN|0-245-50566-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:eye catcing 1.JPG|thumb|right|A good example of an Interest Fair board.]]

An '''interest fair''' is an event somewhat like a [[science fair]] usually organized by a [[school]] that involves a group of corrugated [[Display board|cardboard]] boards on which students put information on their favorite topic or [[hobby]] Originally they also had to write a short [[paper]]. Unlike a science fair, it has both competitive and non-[[competitive]] elements.

==History of the Interest Fair==

===History of the Fair===

The interest fair originated in Columbus, Ohio at St. Joseph Montessori school. It was created as an [[alternative education|alternative]] to the science fair because they wanted more flexibility. They wanted to focus on the student. When they did it they invited 6- to 14-year-old students to do an [[interest]] fair, but required the older students to do it. The students were judged and had to tell visitors about their Interest Fair board.

===Evolution of the Fair===

Over time the idea caught on, and it has evolved between schools, so it has been seen in many variations. In some schools the competitive element is completely removed, so there are no judges. In others, only the upper grade levels get to participate. In some places the students do not have to [[discuss]] their topic with visitors. Sometimes the students have to write a paper. The project may be optional or required. The rubric is almost always used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4748">{{about|the form of bribery||Kickback (disambiguation)}}
A '''kickback''' is a form of negotiated [[bribery]] in which a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] is paid to the bribe-taker in exchange for services rendered. Generally speaking, the remuneration (money, goods, or services handed over) is negotiated ahead of time.  The kickback varies from other kinds of bribes in that there is implied [[collusion]] between agents of the two parties, rather than one party [[Extortion|extorting]] the bribe from the other.&lt;ref name="Wrage14"&gt;Wrage, Alexandra Addison. ''Bribery and Extortion: Undermining Business, Governments, and Security.'' Westport, Conn.: Praeger Security International, 2007. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the kickback is usually to encourage the other party to cooperate in the illegal scheme.&lt;ref name="Kran387"&gt;Kranacher, Riley, and Wells, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "kickback" comes from [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] [[English language]], and describes the way a recipient of illegal gain "kicks back" a portion of it to another person for that person's assistance in obtaining it.&lt;ref name="Campos"&gt;Campos, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and methods==
The most common form of kickback involves a vendor submitting a [[fraudulent]] or inflated invoice (often for goods or services which were not needed, of inferior quality, or both), with an employee of the victim company assisting in securing payment. For his or her assistance in securing payment, the individual receives some sort of payment (cash, goods, services) or favor (the hiring of a relative, employment, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Albrecht, Albrecht, and Zimbelman, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kickback brokers" are individuals who may not receive the kickback personally, but who help link the individual or company providing the goods or services with individuals capable of assisting with the illegal payments.  For helping to link the two colluding parties, either or both parties may make a payment to this "broker".&lt;ref&gt;Campos, p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In government==
Kickbacks are one of the most common forms of government corruption.&lt;ref name="Campos" /&gt; In some cases, the kickback takes the form of a "cut of the action," and can be so well known as to be common knowledge—and even become part of a nation's culture.  For example, in [[Indonesia]], [[President Suharto]] was publicly known as "Mr. Twenty-Five Percent" because he required that all major contracts throughout the nation provide him with 25 percent of the income before he would approve the contract. And, in [[Pakistan]], [[President Asif Ali Zardari]] was publicly known as "Mr. Ten Percent" for the same reason, which later became hundred percent. After coming into the government, he started taking 10% of all major contract investments before he would approve the contract.&lt;ref name="Wrage14" /&gt; However, kickbacks differ from other forms of corruption, such as diversion of assets, as in [[embezzlement]], because of the collusion between two parties.&lt;ref name="Kran387" /&gt;

Kickback schemes can be pervasive.  For example, in the [[United States]], companies providing medical services to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients were paying doctors to send patients to them, whether the patient needed the treatment, diagnosis, or test or not.  In 1987, the [[United States Congress]] passed the stringent [[Anti-Kickback Act]] to prevent such schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Buchbinder and Shanks, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the political scene was realigned dramatically by the ''[[Mani pulite|Tangentopoli]]'' scandals in the 1990s, which uncovered widespread use of kickbacks in the national and local governments.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|section|date=August 2018}}
In 1956 [[Paris, France]], a young girl named Madeline attends a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] boarding school, taught by the strict but loving [[nun]] Miss Clavel and fed by the passionate French chef Hélène. Madeline is an [[orphan]], coming from neither family nor [[money]], but maintains a positive attitude and is best friends with another girl, Aggie.

Early in the film, Madeline is stricken with [[appendicitis]] and taken to the [[hospital]], where Madeline undergoes an emergency [[appendectomy]]. During her stay there, Madeline meets Lady Covington, the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] wife of the school's board of [[trustee]]'s member, Lord  Covington. Unlike her husband, Lady Covington is a kind-hearted person who cares deeply for the school and the girls, having attended the school herself in her youth. Lady Covington asks a favor of Madeline; she carved her birth name, Marie Gilbert, into one of the dorm's bed frames and she would like for Madeline to find out if her name is still there. Unfortunately, a few days later, when Madeline is ready to leave the hospital, she learns from Miss Clavel that Lady Covington has passed away. But, true to her promise, Madeline searches for her name under the beds, finding it under her own.

After her hospital stay, Madeline finds that the Spanish ambassador has purchased the property next door to the school and that he also has a son, Pepito, who is around Madeline's age. While the other girls are smitten with Pepito, Madeline is far from impressed and irritated by the noise created by the boy riding around on his [[Vespa]]. Shortly after the ambassador's arrival, Lord Covington announces he plans on closing the school due to the death of his wife.

Miss Clavel, unnerved by Pepito's bothering her girls, attempts to make peace with the boy by giving his tutor, Leopold, a tool box for him, in hopes that it will distract him and help put an end to his obnoxious ways. However, her actions are less than successful as Pepito takes it upon himself to steal Madeline's drawing pad and write "Beware" with a vicious drawing in it before inviting the girls to his birthday party. During the party, Pepito tries to unnerve his guests by showing them a mouse but is unsuccessful in unnerving Madeline. Undeterred, Pepito threatens to kill the mouse, either by feeding him to his [[snake]] or [[execution|executing]] him using a [[guillotine]] he made using the tool box he'd received as a gift from Miss Clavel. Madeline, angered by Pepito's threats to harm the tiny animal, brutally attacks him and releases all of his mice, causing guests to flee in horror and Miss Clavel to faint, which results in the girls' visit getting cut short, much to Pepito's delight. On the way back to the school, Madeline takes Pepito's keys in an act of revenge, preventing him from riding his noisy scooter around the grounds.

While out on a daily walk, Madeline accidentally falls into the [[Seine]] while standing on the ledge of a bridge going over the river and is whisked away by the current. She is rescued by a [[stray dog]], whom she names Genevieve, and emerges from the ordeal relatively unscathed, save for a cold. While sick in bed, Madeline is displeased to watch Leopold teach Pepito, frustrated over the loss of his keys, how to start his scooter with a paper clip. However, her anger disperses when she discovers that Genevieve has followed her to the school and convinces Miss Clavel who has dog allergies to let her golden haired savior live in the shed. Wanting to save the school Madeline forms an alliance with Pepito, enlisting his help to sabotage Lord Covington's attempts to sell the property but her efforts are ultimately discovered by Lord Covington, who initially blames Miss Clavel. Madeline takes responsibility for her involvement, though Lord Covington is unmoved by her apology or the motivation behind her actions when she makes a [[Freudian slip]] and calls him "Cucuface" and, after leaving, he sets Genevieve loose into the night in an act of retaliation against her and the girls.

Upset over the loss of Genevieve, Miss Clavel takes the girls to a local [[circus]] in hopes of cheering them up and Madeline, fearing she'll have no place to go as an orphan once the school closes, makes the decision to join the circus, hoping to make friends and find a home within the community there. After telling Aggie of her plans and making her swear not to tell, Madeline leaves the group and unintentionally stumbles upon Leopold, with the help of a trio of [[clowns]] known as "The Idiots," kidnapping Pepito, hoping to hold him from ransom, and, due to her discovery, is abducted as well. Luckily, Leopold and the Idiots leave the two children alone with a motorcycle, which Madeline uses her hair clip to start and convinces Pepito to drive, though he is initially reluctant as he's never driven one, only a Vespa. The two are pursued by Leopold and the Idiots but Miss Clavel, having learned of Madeline's running away from Aggie, goes driving in search of her and, narrowly avoiding a collision with the two children on the bike, is able to cause the Idiots to crash into a lake. The police arrive and arrest the kidnappers.

Back at the school, Lord Covington appears and happily shares that he's sold the property to the ambassador of [[Uzbekistan]]. Madeline realises that Lord Covington is merely trying to sell the school due to his grief over his wife. He at first dismisses her sympathy but Madeleine speaks earnestly to Lord Covington about her own family being gone and says that Lady Covington is still with him and with the school and Miss Clavel, knowing Madeline is fearful of having no one if the school were to shut down, assures her that they'll be together, regardless of what happens. While Lord Covington is moved by Madeline's words and sincerity, he regretfully tells her and the girls that there's nothing he can do as he's already sold the property but, in a happy twist, the ambassador, also moved by Madeline, decides to back out of the sale. Hélène decides to celebrate by fixing a vegetarian feast, to which Madeline responds and that she wants Chicken Hélène, with the girls squawking in agreement. The film then concludes with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]], accompanied by "[[What a Wonderful World]]", and then changes back to a book setting, as the French word, "fin" (meaning "the end") appears.

==Development==
Filming took place in [[Paris]], where the story is set, from September 1997 to January 1998, with English actress Hatty Jones, then 8 or 9 years, cast as the main character. Unlike the books, the film takes place in 1956, not 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/madeline/movie/behind.html |title=Madeline movie site |accessdate=2017-05-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020816191900/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/madeline/movie/behind.html |archivedate=August 16, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the landmarks from the books appear in the film, although some were too crowded with modern traffic to be used.&lt;ref name="Hoheandel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/18/movies/film-in-an-old-house-in-paris.html|title=FILM; 'In an Old House In Paris . . . .'|last=Hoheandel|first=Kristin|date=18 January 1998|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's costume department went for some artistic licence in developing the costumes for ''Madeline''. Aside from moving the time period from the 1930s to 1950, the producers elected for saturated blues and reds in the students' uniforms while keeping them as believable as possible, ruling out the possibility of using grey as it was seen as depressing. Similar considerations were made for Frances McDormand's character, a [[Catholic novitiate|novice nun]] who, according to research, would have worn a short black habit; a softer blue habit similar to the one worn by Miss Clavel in the books was used instead.&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/16/news/ls-4270|title='Madeline's' Little Leaps of Faith|last=Goodwin|first=Betty|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While largely based on the original series, with storylines from three of the picture books weaved into the plot, several liberties were taken with the characters' backstories. Notably, Madeline is depicted as an orphan in the film, while in the books, she receives a dollhouse from her father and is known not only to have both her parents but siblings as well.&lt;ref name="Conradt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/24477/quick-10-madeline|title=The Quick 10: Madeline|last=Conradt|first=Stacy|date=16 April 2010|work=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bemelmans1939"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bemelmans|first=Ludwig|title=Madeline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0h8HPwAACAAJ|accessdate=2015-10-12|date=2000-05-01|publisher=Perfection Learning Corporation|isbn=9780812422542|quote=...in they walked and then said, "Ahh," when they saw the toys and candy and the dollhouse from Papa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bemelmans1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bemelmans|first=Ludwig|title=Madeline's Christmas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPgNAAAACAAJ|accessdate=2015-10-12|date=2000-09-01|publisher=Puffin Books|isbn=9780613300148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nell Minow]] of [[Common Sense Media]] said that the movie was "great for young kids and fans of the books."&lt;ref name="Minow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/madeline-0|title=Madeline Movie Review|last=Minow|first=Nell|work=[[Common Sense Media]]|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AOL]] movie critic Brandon Judell said of it, "No horribly arch double entendres to draw in audiences who can't spend two hours in a theater without having their libido massaged." Jeffery Huston called it "a disarming, charming fable so artfully crafted that adults will fall under its spell." Conversely, John R. McEwen gave a negative review, stating that the movie was: "...Adequately simple for children, though perhaps a bit pedestrian for adults." A similarly negative review was given by Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', stating that "their 8-year-old daughters will less likely be impressed by the meandering story, dull visuals and flat characterizations."&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/madelineosullivan.htm|title=A 'Madeline' Best Forgotten|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=10 July 1998|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrepancies==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
For reasons not entirely clear, the movie has a lot of significant discrepancies from both the books and TV series as follows:
* Madeline is depicted as a redhead in the series, whereas in the film she has light brown/strawberry blonde hair.
* In the dining room where the breaking bread routine takes place, the girls are shown eating full dinners consisting of lamb and vegetables, but in the series, they are shown to eat [[croissants]] or [[bread rolls]] on a regular basis while breaking their bread.
* In the series, it is very clear that the girls are from various ethnic backgrounds, while in the film, the girls all appear to be British in origin. There are also several name changes, with names sounding more British in origin, compared to more French in the TV series, not to mention [[British accents]] instead of [[French accents]] in the TV series. 
* Lord Cucuface is renamed Lord Covington and his role is expanded. In the series, he appears to be merely a superintendent of sorts, while in the film, his grandmother-in-law opened the school and his late wife was a student and benefactress. Madeline still calls him Lord Cucuface both behind his back and on one occasion, directly to his face. He is not as naïve as he appears to be in the TV series either (example: believing that the girls could play instruments, but in reality they had only just recently discovered them in the [[attic]]).
* Lord Covington is depicted as having a wife, but in the TV series, it is unclear if Lord Cucuface is [[married]], [[divorced]], a [[widower]] or a [[bachelor]], let alone a father of children.
* In the series, Lord Cucuface intended to sell the old house after it was deemed too old and too dangerous, although they soon had it repaired, whereas in the film, Lord Covington sells the old house after his wife's death.
* In the movie, the girls and Pepito pull numerous pranks on the old house by unhinging doors, igniting firecrackers, leaving out stinky cheese and other things to dissuade Lord Covington from selling the school, but in the TV series, Lord Cucuface visited on a rainy day along with Madame Baguette and Madame Fromage; however, the old house was falling apart due to broken planks, a broken shutter, leaky roof, leaky taps and squeaky doors and after Madame Baguette had an accident when she slid down the banister and thus causing a large crash, Lord Cucuface announced that he was selling the old house because in his own words, it was "too old and too dangerous", despite the objections of the girls and Miss Clavel's suggestions of fixing it.
* Pepito uses a [[guillotine]] to execute a [[mouse]] and proceeds to feed it to a [[snake]] for lunch, but in the TV series, he used the guillotine to decapitate [[poultry]] for eating in "Madeline and the Bad Hat".
* Miss Clavel is portrayed as [[allergy to dogs|allergic to dogs]], hence her sneezing, but in the TV series, she has nothing of the sort.
* In the famous scene where Madeline accidentally falls into the [[Seine]], she stands on the bridge to justify her actions towards Pepito at his birthday party to the girls when they are angry at her, but in "Madeline's Rescue", there was no animosity and in fact, she fell into the Seine out of careless tomfoolery.
* The girls are portrayed as eating [[chicken]] and soon turning into [[vegetarians]], but in the TV series, it was Pepito who ate chicken and subsequently became a vegetarian.
* Pepito appears to be somewhat older than the girls and in place of a "[[hat]]" he drives a [[Vespa|Vespa motorcycle]]. Unlike the TV series, where he reforms after one of his mischievous pranks goes wrong (involving a group of dogs and a cat), he appears to reform sometime during/after the scene where the girls pull various pranks at the old house. He also has a "[[tutor]]" in the film, who is absent in the series.
* A lot of Pepito's mischief has been exaggerated, compared to the TV series. For instance, in the scene when the girls are in the kitchen and attempting to cook themselves, he wears a hideous red [[demon]] mask and frightens all of the girls, making some of them scream, but in "Madeline at Cooking School", he helped the girls to cook lunch for Lord Cucuface, because Mrs. Murphy, the usual cook/housekeeper, had fallen ill due to the [[flu]].
* Pepito frightened the girls in the form of a white ghost on a hot summer night when they were toasting [[marshmallows]] around a [[campfire]] in "Madeline and the Bad Hat".
* In the scene of Pepito's birthday party, the girls' visit is cut short when Madeline releases the [[mice]] from a cage in Pepito's [[menagerie]] and everything erupts into chaos, including a physical fight between Madeline and Pepito, forcing Miss Clavel to make them leave without having any [[cake|birthday cake]] and write out "I will control my temper" a number of times as punishment, but that never happened in the TV series at all: in the episode ''Madeline in London'', Madeline, Miss Clavel and the girls visited Pepito in [[London]] after he had moved there with his parents and they celebrated his birthday in a celebratory way, had a large party consisting of a large cake and many treats and they gave him a retired [[horse]] as a birthday present, whom he named Piccadilly, perhaps after the [[Piccadilly|London street of the same name]].
* In the film, Madeline is a lot more outgoing, confident and somewhat of a leader, compared to her slightly more demure character in the series. She is also given a different backstory, where she is made an orphan, while the original books and TV series provides her with parents, notably in the eponymous pilot episode and ''Madeline's Christmas''.&lt;ref name="Conradt"/&gt; The scene with the girls in the hospital room visiting Madeline makes this clear: in the book and aforementioned pilot episode, she has a dollhouse from "Papa", but in the film, Vicki explains that the toys are for "charity cases". ''[[Madeline: Lost in Paris]]'' re-establishes her as an orphan in the series.
* Genevieve in the book/TV series is depicted as a chocolate-brown mixed-breed dog, while the film appears to have her as a somewhat bulky [[Labrador]]/[[Golden Retriever]] with a blonde colouring.
* While the TV series is somewhat unclear on whether Miss Clavel is a [[Catholic nun|nun]], nurse, boarding house "mother" or similar (she is neither called [[Sister (Catholic)|Sister]] nor Mother Clavel), the movie does make it quite clear that she is a nun. She also appears to have a soft spot for Madeline, treating her like her own daughter. Unlike her wholly optimistic TV counterpart, the film version does display signs of realism (and allows Madeline some leverage).
* The cook is Mrs. Murphy in the series, but renamed Helene in the film.
* The movie was banned in Russia until 2008 because Leopold, Pepito's tutor, was a [[Soviet Spy]] trying to [[kidnap]] Pepito to get money and to make [[Spain]] a [[Communist state|Communist country]].
* The pilot episode of the TV series does not specify if or when Madeline was released from the hospital, but the movie depicts her as being released from the hospital and taken home to the vine-covered old house by Miss Clavel and Helene, just as the Spanish Ambassador moves in next door, an event that did not occur until "Madeline and the Bad Hat".
* Dr. Cohn, the physician in the TV series, was replaced by a pair of orderlies and a stretcher to pick up Madeline when she had [[appendicitis]].
* When Miss Clavel and the girls go to the [[funfair]], which ends with in a thunderstorm and thus forcing them to go back to the old house, Madeline runs away to join the circus, only to get kidnapped along with Pepito by two clowns and Leopold, but in the TV series, Madeline and Pepito were unintentionally left behind on the [[ferris wheel]] in the rain and they were well looked after by the gypsies and the circus performers.
* Miss Clavel is more confident in driving a car, whereas in the episode ''Madeline and the Big Cheese'', she is not a confident driver.
* When the girls are visiting the famous [[Louvre]], they are seen with sketch pads and Madeline retrieves her pad from Pepito, only to see hideous drawings and a threatening message "BEWARE!", but in the TV series, they visited the Louvre after Madeline had painted a picture of the old house and the workers at the gallery claimed it as their own after she accidentally left it behind - Pepito was not even present in that episode.
* Detective Moreau was replaced by some policemen when they came to arrest Leopold and the other culprits who abducted Pepito and Madeline from the circus.

'''Nintendo Campus Challenge 1992''' was a video game competition sponsored by [[Nintendo]] and held at nearly 60 college campuses throughout the United States.

== Games and cartridge ==
[[File:Campus-challenge-1992.jpg|thumb|right|''Nintendo Campus Challenge 1992'' Cartridge]]
The rules are the same as the 1991 version except with three Super NES minigames. The first minigame of the competition is ''[[Super Mario World]]'', where players must collect 50 coins (very similar to ''[[Nintendo World Championships]]'' 1990's first minigame, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''). The second game is a version of ''[[F-Zero]]'' where players must complete two laps. The final minigame is ''[[Pilotwings]]'' where players must land on two targets successfully. Once time does expire, a player's score was totaled using the following formula:

*''Super Mario World'' score
*+ ''F-Zero'' score times 100
*+ ''Pilotwings'' score times 10,000

There are only two known "1992 Campus Challenge" cartridges. One was found at the same [[New York City]] garage sale by Rob Walters as the 1991 cartridge. The cartridge is owned by a video game collector named Rick Bruns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nintendo 1992 Campus Challenge | publisher = SNESMaps.com | url = http://snesmaps.com/maps/1992Challenge/1992Challenge.html | accessdate = 2009-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second one was found in an attic of a former employee of a company who did projects for Nintendo.  Nintendo sent the cartridge to the company along with systems and other games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A 2nd Campus Challenge 92 Cartridge Found in Attic | publisher = PriceCharting.com | url = http://blog.pricecharting.com/2012/10/the-2nd-campus-challenge-92-cartridge.html | accessdate = 2012-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event structure ==
The 1992 "Nintendo Campus Challenge" competition was held at 35 college campuses throughout the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nintendo Campus Challenge | publisher = SNESCentral.com | url = http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0790 | accessdate = 2009-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winner at each location won a [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] Control Set with ''Super Mario World'', ''F-Zero'', and ''Pilot Wings''. Consolation prizes of $100, $75, and $50 were awarded to second, third, and fourth place contestants. The winner of the whole US competition won $10,000.

Similar competitions were held in Europe and Japan in 1992. The winner of the US competition, Jeff Hanson, won against the winner of the Japanese competition, Yuichi Suyama, and became the World Champion at the 1993 [[Consumer Electronics Show]].

'''The Old Globe Theatre''' is a professional theatre company located in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. It produces about 15 plays and musicals annually in summer and winter seasons. Plays are performed in three separate theatres in the complex, which is collectively called the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts:
* ''Old Globe Theatre'' – 600-seat flagship theatre, fully enclosed, featuring the Donald and Darlene Shiley Stage
* ''Sheryl and Harvey White Theatre'' – 250-seat intimate [[theatre in the round]] (completed 2009)
* ''Lowell Davies Festival Theatre'' – 615-seat outdoor theatre
The Old Globe Theatre and the Sheryl and Harvey White Theatre are part of the Conrad Prebys Theatre Center. The White Theatre also houses the Karen and Donald Cohn Education Center.

==History==
The Old Globe Theatre was built in 1935, designed by [[Richard Requa]] as part of the [[California Pacific International Exposition (1935)|California Pacific International Exposition]]. The theatre was based on a copy of one built for the Chicago [[Century of Progress]], which in turn was a copy of the [[Globe Theatre]] in [[London]], [[England]], where many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays were performed during his lifetime. Like the original Globe, the theatre was open in the center with a roof over the seating on the sides.

During the exposition, it hosted 50-minute versions of Shakespeare plays. At the end of the exposition, the Globe had been received so well that a nonprofit organization called the San Diego Community Theatre was formed to save the temporary structure from demolition. The committee leased the structure from the city, produced full-length plays, and created a more permanent structure by roofing over the theatre and bringing it up to code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theoldglobe.org/about-the-globe/history/ | publisher=Old Globe Theatre| title=History| accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, a young actor and director named [[Craig Noel]] was hired as general director. During [[World War II]] the U.S. Navy took over all buildings in Balboa Park, including the Globe. The Community Theatre group stayed together, producing one-act plays in various venues around San Diego. When the Globe was returned to civilian use in 1947, Noel returned as general director, and he remained in a leadership position until his death in 2010. In 1949 he launched the Globe's summer Shakespeare Festival in partnership with the drama department at [[University of San Diego]]. Since then the Shakespeare festival has been presented every summer except 1953, when Noel broke with tradition by producing the smash hit play ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'' instead.  The Globe continued to produce a combination of modern plays along with Shakespeare and other classics. In 1981 [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]] was hired as artistic director, while Noel became executive producer.&lt;ref name="Moir"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mohr |first=Beth |title=The Old Globe Theatre: Highlights From Fifty Years |journal=The Journal of San Diego History |volume=31 |issue=2 |date=Spring 1985 |url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/85spring/globe.htm |accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cassius Carter Centre Stage, a theater in the round, was added in 1969 in what had been the Falstaff Tavern restaurant. It was rebuilt in 2009 as the Sheryl and Harvey White Theatre.

In March 1978, the Globe Theatre was destroyed in an arson fire, and an outdoor festival stage was hastily constructed so that the 1978 season could still be produced. The Globe Theatre was rebuilt and reopened in 1981. In 1984, the festival stage in turn succumbed to arson. It was rebuilt and is now named the Lowell Davies Festival Theatre. The entire three-theatre complex is called the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts.

The Globe has grown into an internationally known theatre complex, an "influential powerhouse among regional theatres."&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite news| title=Craig Noel, a Force in Regional Theater, Dies at 94| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/theater/12noel.html| last=Weber| first=Bruce| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=April 12, 2010| accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 it received the [[Regional Theatre Tony Award|Tony Award]] for best regional theatre.  Shows which originated at the Old Globe have gone on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to win nine [[Tony Award]]s and nearly 60 nominations.&lt;ref name="SDNN 4-4-10"&gt;[http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2010-04-04/local-county-news/old-globe-theater-founding-director-craig-noel-dies San Diego News Network, April 4, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224174837/http://www.sdnn.com/sandiego/2010-04-04/local-county-news/old-globe-theater-founding-director-craig-noel-dies |date=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orbiting Binary Black Hole Investigation Satellite''' ('''ORBIS''') is a small [[space telescope]] still in development by Japan that will study [[binary black hole]]s in the [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray region]].

The ORBIS concept won the first prize at the 18th Satellite Design Contest in 2010,&lt;ref name='Tokyo MU 2013'/&gt; and of 2015 it was on preliminary design and undergoing thermal simulations by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan University]]&lt;ref name='Tokyo MU 2013'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comp.sd.tmu.ac.jp/ssl/index_en.html Tokyo Metropolitan University - ORBIS]. 2017&lt;/ref&gt; with support from [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) and the [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] (ISAS).&lt;ref name='Tokyo MU 2013'&gt; [http://www.nanosat.jp/images/report/pdf/NSS-05-0401.pdf Development of Binary Black Hole Observation Satellite "ORBIS"].

==Scientific objectives==
Binary black holes (BBHs) are believed to be formed during the merger and growth of galaxies. Although several binary blackhole candidates have been identified, they have yet to be verified by long-term observations.&lt;ref name='Tokyo MU 2013'/&gt;&lt;ref name="satconprize18"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://satcon.jp/history/prize18/pdf/18_01.pdf |title=第18回衛星設計コンテスト 設計の部 バイナリブラックホール探査衛星 ORBIS 衛星設計解析書 |last1=Hanada |first1=Yukiya |last2=Asanuma |first2=Tasuku |last3=Okano |first3=Yoshinobu |format=PDF |publisher=The 18th Satelite Design Contest |date= |access-date=2018-02-04 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ascertain that an object is a BBH, periodical luminosity change in X-ray wavelength must be detected. However, continuous observation of BBHs by large X-ray telescopes is difficult as such spacecraft are used by many groups and have numerous observation targets.&lt;ref name="satconprize18"/&gt; Since microsatellites have comparatively low-cost, flexibility, and can fly more often than large spacecrafts, they can conduct unique studies where risks are associated.&lt;ref name="satconprize18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isobeposter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/~n-isobe/conference/ORBIS.pdf |title=巨大バイナリブラックホール探査小型衛星 ORBIS |last1=Hanada |first1=Yukiya |last2=Asanuma |first2=Tasuku |last3=Okano |first3=Yoshinobu |format=PDF |publisher=[[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] Laboratory of Infrared Astrophysics |date= |access-date=2018-02-04 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ORBIS is dedicated to study BBHs, it can conduct continuous observation of such bodies. The scientific goals of the microsatellite is to uncover the growth process of black holes and galaxies, and to and contribute to [[gravitational-wave astronomy]].&lt;ref name='poster'/&gt;

Some simulations have concluded that after crossing a certain distance, the energy dissipation of two approaching black holes ceases, result in them not getting closer any further.&lt;ref name="satconprize18"/&gt;  However, the merger of black holes is expected to occur during the collision of galaxies.&lt;ref name="satconprize18"/&gt; This unsolved problem is known as the [[Binary black hole#Final parsec problem|final parsec problem]]. By finding and studying black holes less than 1&amp;nbsp;pc apart, ORBIS aims to resolve this issue.&lt;ref name="satconprize18"/&gt;

The '''Pangboche Hand''' is an artifact from a [[Buddhist]] [[monastery]] in [[Pangboche]], [[Nepal]]. Supporters contend that the hand is from a [[Yeti]], a [[Cryptid|scientifically unrecognized animal]] purported to live in the Himalayan mountains. A finger bone from the hand was tested and the DNA shown to be human.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-online-yeti&gt;{{cite news

==Story==
Oil businessman and adventurer [[Tom Slick]] first heard accounts of the possible existence of a "Yeti hand" held as a ritual artifact in the monastery at Pangboche during one of his first "Abominable Snowman" treks in 1957. The Slick expeditions were the first to bring photographs of the hand back to the West.

During later Tom Slick-sponsored expeditions in and around the [[Himalayas]], his associates gathered more information on the "Pangboche hand," and an effort to further examine it was planned. In 1959 Peter Byrne, a member of Slick's expedition that year, reportedly stole pieces of the artifact after the monks who owned it refused to allow its removal for study.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-online-yeti/&gt; Byrne claimed to have replaced the stolen bone fragments with human bones, rewrapping the hand to disguise his theft.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-online-yeti/&gt;

Byrne smuggled the bones from Nepal into India, after which actor [[James Stewart]] allegedly smuggled the hand out of the country in his luggage.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-online-yeti/&gt; Cryptozoologist [[Loren Coleman]] rediscovered this story while writing Tom Slick's biography in the 1980s. Coleman confirmed details of the incidents with written materials in the Slick archives, interviews with Byrne, and correspondence with Stewart. Byrne later confirmed the Pangboche hand story via a letter from Stewart that Byrne published in a general book on Nepalese wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;see Coleman's books ''Tom Slick and the Search for Yeti'' (Boston/London: Faber and Faber, 1989) and  ''Tom Slick: True Life Encounters in Cryptozoology'' (Fresno, CA: Linden Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the highly publicized 1960 World Book expedition, which had many goals including gathering intelligence on Chinese rocket launchings, [[Sir Edmund Hillary]] and [[Marlin Perkins]] took a sidetrip in Nepal to investigate the hand. Hillary was unaware of the possibility that he was looking at a combination of the original material and the human bones placed there by Byrne. Hillary determined the artifact was a hoax.

According to monks at Pangboche monastery, many years ago, a monk walked into a cave to [[meditate]]. There, he saw a [[Yeti]]. Many years later, he came back, and the yeti was dead. He collected the hand and [[Yeti|scalp]] and took it back to the monastery where it remained until it was discovered in the modern age.

London University primatologist [[William Charles Osman Hill]] conducted a physical examination of the pieces that Byrne supplied. His first findings were that it was [[hominid]], and later in 1960 he decided that the Pangboche fragments were a closer match with a [[Neanderthal]].

In 1991, in conjunction with Coleman's research, it was discovered that the Slick expedition consultant, an American anthropologist by the name of George Agogino, had retained samples of the alleged Yeti hand. The NBC program ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' obtained samples and determined they were similar to human tissue, but were not human, and could only verify they were "near human."  After the broadcast of the program, the entire hand was stolen from the Pangboche monastery, and reportedly disappeared into a private collection via the illegal underground in the sale of antiquities. George Agogino, before his death on September 11, 2000, transferred his important files on the Pangboche Yeti hand to Loren Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090426004835/http://best.me.berkeley.edu/~aagogino/g_agogino/index.html George Allen Agogino&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Weta Workshops produced a replica skull and hand based on photos of the missing hand and skull. Mike Allsop handed over the replica skull and hand to monks at Pangboche in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==DNA testing==

On 27 December 2011 it was announced that a finger belonging to the hand contained human DNA, following tests carried out in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-online-yeti/&gt; Dr. Rob Ogden commented that "We have got a very, very strong match to a number of existing reference sequences on human DNA databases... Human was what we were expecting and human is what we got."&lt;ref name=bbc-news-online-yeti/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-16316397|title=Yeti finger mystery solved by Edinburgh scientists|date=27 December 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 July 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pavithrotsavam.jpg|thumb|200px|Lord [[Malayappa swami]] with consorts as seen during the Pavitrotsavam festival. Prominently seen on the Lord and his consorts are the ''Pavitra'' garlands]]
'''Pavitrotsavam'''  is an annual ritual in the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]], [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srivenkatesa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=493:history-of-pavitrotsavam&amp;catid=34:temple-history&amp;Itemid=117| title=Pavitrotsavam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='hindu'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/22/stories/2004082204370300.htm| title=`Pavitrotsavam' at Tirumala from August 28  |publisher=[[The Hindu]] | date=2004-08-22 | accessdate=2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavitrotsava is derived from the combination of two words ''Pavitra'' (holy) and ''utsava'' (festival). This utsava is penitential as well as propitiatory and its main objective is to get rid of the evil that might have been caused due to omissions and commissions in the performance of various rituals throughout the year. The festival is also known as ''Dosha Nivaarana'' (error correction),''Sarva Yajna Phalapradha'' (The One ritual that equals the holiness of rites all year long),''Sarva Doshopasamana'' (Removal of all errors), ''Sarva Tushtikara'', ''Sarvakaamapradha'', ''Sarvalokasantida''.&lt;ref name='srivenkatesa.org'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srivenkatesa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=493:history-of-pavitrotsavam&amp;catid=34:temple-history&amp;Itemid=117|title=Srivenkatesa.org|work=srivenkatesa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reference to holy scripts==
The Jayakhya Samhita explains that pavitra protects one from evil. The puranas prescribe ''Pavitra Aaropana'' (adorning the deity with ''pavitra'' - sanctified garlands of thread), as an integral part of the rituals during the worship of Lord Vishnu. The ''Agni Purana'' specifies that the first day of a lunar fortnight either in the beginning of the month of Aashada or the end of the Krithika should be chosen for performing pavitrotsava. The ''Garuda Purana'' says that this rite should be done on the 12th day of the dark or bright fortnight.

==Rituals==
[[File:Pavithrotsavam ritual.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Priests carrying ''Pavitra'' garlands during the Pavitrotsavam festival]]
In Tirumala, the Pavitrotsavam ritual is conducted on  ''Sravana shuddha [[dashami]]'' day.&lt;ref name = 'Tirumalatemple'&gt;{{cite book |first=Dr N Ramesan|title=The Tirumala Temple |year=1981 |publisher=[[Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams]]|location=[[Tirumala]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

`Ankurarpanam' or the sowing of nine type of holy seeds in earthen containers is undertaken on the day preceding the festival. This ritual signifies the beginning of festival in the temple. This is followed by recital of vedas in a ritual called ''Mritsangrahana''. The Ankurarpana and Mritsangrahana rituals are identical to those performed during Brahmotsava. Veda recitation is started after the Mritsangrahana ritual and this recitation of the Vedas concludes on the third day. Through the chanting of the vedas, ''Aavahana'' (Invoking) is done for Lord Vishnu in the Pradhana Kumbha (first of the holy container). There are 16 other Kumbhas surrounding this Pradhana Kumbha and it is believed that the various mantras which are recited infuse voice vibrations that have great religious and spiritual force. The ''Pradhana khumba'' is taken to the [[Tirumala Dhruva Bera|main deity]] on the concluding day and the augmented spiritual power is believed to be transmitted to the Moola Vigraha (Kumbha Aavaahanam).&lt;ref name='hindu'/&gt; The rituals on the three days include ''Thirumanjanam'' and ''Homam'' (prayer to sacrificial fire) to the main deity as well as primary idols of Lord Venkateswara.

''Pavitra''s, the garlands made from special thread are taken in a procession and used to decorate Lord [[Malayappa swami]] and his consorts on the second day. In the evening of the second day, the idols are taken on a procession around the four mada streets.

During the three-day festival, [[Arjitha Seva]]s like ''Kalyanotsavam'', ''Arjitha Brahmotsavam'', ''Arjitha Vasanothsavam'', ''Sahasara Deepalankarana Seva'', ''Dolotsavam'' are cancelled while the morning rituals are held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srivenkatesa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=493:history-of-pavitrotsavam&amp;catid=34:temple-history&amp;Itemid=117| title=The `Pavitrotsavam' at Tirumala }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of festival==
The origin of Pavitrotsavam in Tirumala dates back to 1463 A.D. The stone inscription found on the northern wall of the Vagapadi verandah in the first ''Prakaara'' of the Tirumala temple gives a very detailed account.&lt;ref name='hindu'/&gt; The festival was instituted by Saluva Malliah deva Raja during the time of Saluva Narasimha.&lt;ref name='Tirumalatemple'/&gt; The inscription refers even to the items of expenditure to be incurred in connection with the celebration of ''Pavitra Tirunal''.&lt;ref name='hindu'/&gt;

The festival is believed to have been conducted till 1562 A.D. after which the ritual was stopped. The reason for discontinuing such an important festival is not recorded and remains unknown. [[Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams|TTD]] decided to revive the ritual that is followed in all Vishnu temples and the festival has been on the annual calendar from 1962 onwards.

==Devotee Participation==
Pavitrotsavam is an ''Arjita Seva'' - participation by payment to the Lord. TTD sells tickets to this service on the second and third days. Each ticket allows two persons and the primary ticket holder is given 10 dosas and Pongal on the second day and 10 dosas and Pongal, 6 vadas and ''vastram'' (one silk angavastram and one cotton blouse) on the third day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_per.htm|title=TTD Periodic Sevas|accessdate=2007-05-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514214720/http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_per.htm|archivedate=2007-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Public opinion brigades''' ({{lang-vi|Dư luận viên}}), is a state-sponsored [[web brigade]] of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] or linked to the Communist Government of [[Vietnam]].

Similar to [[Russia]]'s [[Web brigades]] and [[China]]'s [[50 Cent Army]], participants report that they are organized into teams and groups of commentators that participate in Vietnamese and international [[political blog]]s and [[Internet forums]] using [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]] and large-scale orchestrated trolling and disinformation campaigns to promote pro-Vietnamese communist propaganda. It has also been found that Wikipedia articles were targeted by Vietnamese communist internet propaganda activities.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Background==
It is unclear how the brigades started since the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPVN) often controls political information. However, the earliest form of Internet propaganda supporting CPVN seems to have begun in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reed|first1=John|title=Vietnam army reveals 10,000-strong cyber warfare unit|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ef924a6e-ea14-11e7-bd17-521324c81e23|work=Financial Times|date=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Government announced to "eliminate any wrong news that threaten the Party's rule". As the Communist Party is the only party allowed by Vietnamese constitution, it was the beginning of the brigades.
In 2017, Lieutenant-General Nguyen Trong Nghia, deputy head of the Vietnamese military’s political department, confirmed that Vietnam has a new, 10,000-strong military cyber warfare unit to counter criticisms of the government on the Internet.The cyber unit named Force 47 is active in several sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnam unveils 10,000-strong cyber unit to combat 'wrong views'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-security-cyber/vietnam-unveils-10000-strong-cyber-unit-to-combat-wrong-views-idUSKBN1EK0XN|work=Reuters|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnam censors to fight 'internet chaos'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42494113|work=BBC News|date=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The methods used are not always clear, but includes criticism of opposing views to those of the Communist Party.  Vietnamese nationalists, dissidents and anti-communists claim that the CPVN has been doing this for a long time, to brainwash people's minds and distort and truth, branding who disagree with the Communist Party as "traitors of the nation".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[BBC]] and [[Deutsche Welle]] correspondents have also reported about the brigades' activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Vietnam admits deploying bloggers to support government|author=Nga Pham|date=12 January 2013|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20982985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Governments also accused Vietnamese Communist Party's troll army for attacking and hacking websites that criticize the CPVN.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Distortion of History? ===
There are claims that the CPVN has attempted to rewrite history, including war crimes by [[North Vietnam]] during [[Vietnam War]] having been completely erased to serve the Party's agenda, promoting only themselves as the "heros" of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Vietnam: Challenges and Opportunities for Freedom of Expression|date=2016|publisher=Internet Freedom Festival|url=https://internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/Vietnam:_Challenges_and_Opportunities_for_Freedom_of_Expression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2463">The '''Rebellion of Arbanon''' in 1257–1259 was a revolt of the [[Principality of Arbanon]] (in modern central [[Albania]]) against the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and in favour of the rival [[Despotate of Epirus]].

Arbanon had long been an autonomous principality within Epirus, and the Nicaean conquest around 1255 was resented. The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor [[Constantine Chabaron]]. The rebels were active in [[Durrë]], [[Ohrid]], [[Debar]] and [[Mat District|Mat]]. The Nicaean forces were under the command of [[George Akropolites]], who described the events himself in his history. 

In the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left [[Thessaloniki]] and by way of [[Kastoria]] entered [[Kounavia]], Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, [[Michael II of Epirus|Michael II]], and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in [[Kaninë Castle|Kanina]]. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to [[Prilep]] and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos. The most decisive battle was fought in the city of [[Devol (Albania)|Devol]]. After suffering heavy losses, the Byzantines were finally able to control the situation, but in the years 1260–1270 the Albanian rulers revolted again in the region of [[Durrës]].&lt;ref&gt;Setton, Kenneth Meyer: The Papacy and the Levant, 1204–1571: The Thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Volume 1.

'''Spec RX-7''' is one of many production-based spec classes, originating in the mid-90's with the [[Sports Car Club of America]]. The class was created by Dave Turner and Mark Holland. The main fault of the class is a lack of nationwide compatibility, with each division having slightly different rulesets from one another. Some allow for vast modification, some allow very little, but they all are based on the premise of equality, with the skill being placed solely on the driver and reducing the need for costly development and "part of the week". Specs range from relatively stock including exhaust and intake, to mildly modified, to [[Improved Touring]]  specs. All are based on the 79-85 year model [[RX-7]], with some excluding the 79-80 year models.

==Class rules==
Since each division has a different set of specs, it is important to locate rules for your area. Below is a small listing of websites to help you locate these rules.

Most divisions (excluding the Improved Touring-based IT7 class) spec suspension, tires, engine modification, and in some cases rollcages and wheels.

Following the August [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]], the '''State Council of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)''' ({{lang-ru|Государственный Совет СССР}}), but also known as the '''State Soviet''', was formed on 5 September 1991 and was designed to be one of the most important government offices in [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Soviet Union]]. The members of the council consisted of the [[President of the Soviet Union]], and [[Head of state|highest officials]] (which typically was [[president]]s of their republics) from the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union Republics]]. During the period of transition it was the highest organ of state power, having the power to elect a [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|premier]], or a person who would take Gorbachev's place if absent; the office of [[Vice President of the Soviet Union]] had been abolished following the failed August Coup that very same year.&lt;ref name="pravojustice"&gt;{{Cite web| author= [[Government of the USSR]]: [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev, Mikhail]] |script-title=ru:ЗАКОН СССР: Об органах государственной власти и управления Союза ССР в переходный период |trans-title=Law: About state governing bodies of USSR in a transition period On the bodies of state authority and administration of the USSR in Transition | url = http://www.sssr.su/zopp.html | accessdate=15 November 1991 |date=5 September 1991 |publisher=sssr.su|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interstate Economic Committee==
With the central government's authority greatly weakened by the failed coup, Gorbachev&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Garcelon, Marc | page = 167 | title = Revolutionary Passage: From Soviet to Post-Soviet Russia, 1985–2000 | location =Philadelphia | publisher = [[Temple University Press]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-59213-362-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; established a four-man committee, led by Russian SFSR Premier [[Ivan Silayev]], that included [[Grigory Yavlinsky]], [[Arkadi Volsky]], and [[Yuri Luzhkov]], to elect a new [[Cabinet of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Cabinet of Ministers]]. This committee was later transformed into the '''Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy''' (COMSE), also chaired by Silayev, to manage the [[Soviet economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jeffries, Ian | page = 100 | title = Socialist Economies and the Transition to the Market: A Guide | location =London; New York  | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-415-07580-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; COMSE was quickly surpassed in authority by the '''Interstate Economic Committee of the Soviet Union''' ('''IEC'''), also officially known as the ''Economic Community'', which was established on 20 September under the name Inter-Republican Economic Committee. Its function was to coordinate economic policy across the Soviet Union. As Chairman of both COMSE and the IEC, Silayev presided over a quickly disintegrating Soviet Union.{{sfn|Shevchenko|2004|p=66}} On 6 September 1991 a [[presidential decree]] temporarily gave the IEC the same authority as the Cabinet of Ministers, and Silayev became the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's ''de facto'' Premier]].&lt;ref name="praviteli"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Staff writer]] | url = http://www.praviteli.org/ussr/ussr2/silayev.php | title = Silaev, Ivan Stepanovich | trans-title = Силаев, Иван Степанович | publisher = praviteli.org | accessdate = 4 April 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110507084311/http://www.praviteli.org/ussr/ussr2/silayev.php | archivedate = 7 May 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he first took office, Silayev wanted to reduce the powers of the central government and give more powers to the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]]. This view changed;{{sfn|Shevchenko|2004|p=66}} he demanded that Yeltsin give back much of the authority of the central government which he had usurped following the August Coup. In this he failed, and his position as Russian SFSR Premier was severely weakened as a result. Oleg Lobov, Silayev's [[First Deputy Premier of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|First Deputy Premier]], led the anti-Silayev faction in the Russian SFSR Council of Ministers and managed to oust him on 26 September 1991; Lobov succeeded Silayev as acting Premier of the Russian SFSR.{{sfn|Shevchenko|2004|p=66}} Silayev, as overseer of the economy, was given the task of initiating economic reforms in the Soviet Union in a way that suited both the central government and the Soviet republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Sakwa, Richard | title = Russian Politics and Society | location =London; New York | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-415-41527-6 | page = 33 | authorlink = Richard Sakwa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silayev tried to maintain an integrated economy while initiating the marketisation of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Sakwa, Richard | title = Russian Politics and Society | location =London;New York | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-415-41527-6 | page = 228 | authorlink = Richard Sakwa }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEC showed its international intent by signing the [[European Energy Charter]] on 16/17 December 1991 with 35 other countries, but this was undermined by the charter also being signed by nine of the twelve remaining republics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1991/dec/19/european-energy-charter Hansard 19 December 1991 c242W]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution of the Soviet Union==
On 19 December COMSE was dissolved by a presidential decree,&lt;ref name="praviteli"/&gt; and Gorbachev resigned as Soviet President on 25 December. The next day, 26 December 1991, Silayev resigned from his post as IEC Chairman.&lt;ref name="warheroes"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Staff writer]] | script-title=ru:Силаев, Иван Степанович |trans-title=Silayev, Ivan Stepanovich | language = Russian | publisher = warheroes.ru | url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=10962 | accessdate = 4 April 2010 | date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was formally dissolved]] by the [[Soviet of Nationalities|Council of Republics]].

In addition to the stripping of the altar at the conclusion of the Maundy Thursday liturgy in Lutheran Churches, the "lectern and pulpit are [also] left bare until Easter to symbolize the humiliation and barrenness of the cross."&lt;ref name="Fakes1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fakes|first=Dennis R.|title=Exploring Our Lutheran Liturgy|year=1994|publisher=CSS Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781556735967|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Anglican Churches, this ceremony is also performed at the conclusion of Maundy Thursday services, "in which all appointments, linens, and paraments are removed from the altar and chancel in preparation for Good Friday."&lt;ref name="CP2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Publishing|first=Morehouse|title=The Episcopal Handbook, Revised Edition|year=2015|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|language=English |isbn=9780819229564|page=218|quote=stripping of the altar: Ceremony at the conclusion of the Maundy Thursday liturgy, in which all appointments, linens, and paraments are removed from the altar and chancel in preparation for Good Friday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Good Friday at St Andrew's - geograph.org.uk - 151729.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A stripped altar in an [[Anglican]] church on [[Good Friday]]]]
In the earlier form of the [[Roman Rite]], the stripping of the altar was done at the end of [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]]. It is still carried out  All altars in the church, except for the [[altar of repose]], are stripped. In the present form of the Roman Rite, as revised in 1955, there is no ceremony of stripping the altar. At a suitable time after the Mass the altar is stripped, usually by the [[sacristan]], and crosses are removed from the church, if possible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Missal]]. Thursday of the Lord's Supper, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no Mass on [[Good Friday]] or [[Holy Saturday]], the next one being that of the [[Easter Vigil]]. On Good Friday, a white cloth is placed on the altar for the last part of the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Missal]]. Friday of the Passion of the Lord (Good Friday), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; after the conclusion of which the altar is stripped, again privately, except that the [[Christian cross|cross]] remains on the altar with two or four candlesticks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Missal]], Friday of the Passion of the Lord (Good Friday), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the Roman Rite in use immediately before the reform of the [[Easter Triduum]] ceremonies by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955 had a formal ceremony of stripping the altar as a conclusion of the Holy Thursday Mass, which was then celebrated in the morning. After removing the [[ciborium (container)|ciborium]] from the [[high altar]] to the altar of repose, the priest, accompanied by the other ministers, went to the [[sacristy]], where he took off his white Mass vestments and donned a violet [[stole (vestment)|stole]]. Then, with the other ministers, he removed the altarcloths, vases of flowers, [[antependium]] and all other ornaments then customarily placed on the altar. Unlike present usage, the [[altar cross]] and candlesticks were left on the altar. This was done to the accompaniment of [[Psalm 22|Psalm 21 (Vulgate)]] (''[[Deus, Deus meus]]'') preceded and followed by the [[antiphon]] "Diviserunt sibi vestimenta mea: et super vestem meam miserunt sortem" ("They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment").&lt;ref name=Schulte&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Stripping of an Altar}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier centuries, the altars were in some churches washed with a bunch of [[hyssop]] dipped in wine and water. [[Augustine Schulte|Augustine Joseph Schulte]] says that this was done "to render them in some manner worthy of the Lamb without stain who is immolated on them, and to recall to the minds of the faithful with how great purity they should assist at the Holy Sacrifice and receive Holy Communion." He adds that the ceremony was intended as homage offered to Jesus in return for his humbly washing the feet of his disciples,&lt;ref name=Schulte/&gt; the ceremonial commemoration of which was, before 1955, carried out separately from the Mass and stripping of the altar.

[[Eamonn Duffy]] alludes to this ceremony in his book ''[[The Stripping of the Altars|The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, 1400–1580]]'', a history of popular religion in pre-[[Reformation]] England.

The story was used as the basis for the [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Escape from Taliban]]''.

At the age of 49, she was killed by suspected Taliban militants during the evening of 4 September or in the early morning hours of 5 September 2013, outside her home in [[Paktika Province|Paktika Province, Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="cnn deathnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/05/world/asia/afghanistan-indian-author-killed/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Afghan militants target, kill female author, police say| last1= Narayan|first1=Chandrika|last2=Popalzai|first2=Masoud|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=5 September 2013| accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Sushmita Banerjee was born in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] [[West Bengal]] (present-day [[Kolkata, India]]) to a middle-class [[Bengali Brahmin]] family. Her father worked in the civil defence department and her mother, a homemaker. She was the only sister to her three brothers. She first met her future husband Janbaz Khan, an Afghan businessman, at a theatre rehearsal in Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |title=Indian diarist Sushmita Banerjee 'had no fear'|journal=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-23984518|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=7 September 2013|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married him on 2 July 1988.&lt;ref name="rediff intv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/interview/exclusive-just-who-is-susmita-banerjee/20130905.htm|title=Exclusive: Knowing Sushmita Banerjee|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=5 September 2013| publisher=[[Rediff.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage took place secretly in Kolkata, as she feared her parents would object to the inter-religious marriage. When her parents tried to get them divorced, she fled to Afghanistan with Khan.&lt;ref name="rediff intv"/&gt; She discovered that her husband already had a first wife, Gulguti, when she found them in bed together.&lt;ref name="toi deathnews"/&gt; Although shocked, she continued to live in Khan's ancestral house in Patiya village, with her three brothers-in-law, their wives, and with Gulguti and Gulguti's children.&lt;ref name="toi deathnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff intv"/&gt; Later, Khan returned to Kolkata to continue his business, but Banerjee could not return.&lt;ref name="rediff intv"/&gt; Sayeda, a trained nurse in [[gynaecology]], opened a clinic to help the women of the village.

With the burgeoning Taliban power in Afghanistan, Banerjee witnessed fundamentalist changes occurring in the country. In a 2003 interview, she said that the plight of women in particular got worse. Women were banned from talking with men other than family members, they were not allowed outside home. Schools, colleges, and hospitals were shut down. Taliban men discovered her clinic and beat her severely in May 1995.&lt;ref name="rediff intv"/&gt;

Banerjee made two abortive attempts to flee Afghanistan. She was caught and kept in house arrest in the village. A [[fatwa]] was issued against her and she was scheduled to die on 22 July 1995.&lt;ref name="rediff intv"/&gt; With the help of the village headman, she finally fled from the village, in the process killing three Taliban men with an [[AK-47]] rifle.&lt;ref name="rediff intv"/&gt; She reached Kabul, and took a flight back to Kolkata on 12 August 1995.&lt;ref name="rediff intv"/&gt;

She lived in India until 2013, and published several books. After returning to Afghanistan, she worked as a health worker in [[Paktika Province]] in southeastern Afghanistan, and began filming the lives of local women.&lt;ref name="toi deathnews"/&gt;

==Death==
According to Afghan police, suspected Taliban terrorists forced entry into her house in Paktika on the night of 4 September 2013. They bound her husband and absconded with her. Her corpse was found early the next day beside a ''[[madrasa]]'' in the outskirts of the provincial capital [[Sharana, Afghanistan|Sharana]]. The body had 20 bullet hole marks. Police surmised she might have been targeted for murder for various reasons, including her book, her social work in the region, or merely the fact that she was an Indian woman,&lt;ref name="cnn deathnews"/&gt; or according to others for not wearing a [[burqa]], for which she was sentenced to death almost two decades earlier, under the Taliban regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/sushmita-banerjee-was-shot-25-times-taliban-deny-responsibility_874583.html|title=Sushmita Banerjee was killed for not wearing burqa?|work=Zee News|date=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban denied involvement in this attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian diarist Sushmita Banerjee shot dead in Afghanistan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-23968427|newspaper=BBC News|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a spokesman for renegade Taliban militia known as The Suicide Group of the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan announced it had killed Banerjee. The group, led by Mullah Najibullah, explained that they had kidnapped, interrogated and then murdered Banerjee because they believed she was "an Indian spy". Although some of her neighbours reflected that her death may have been partly caused by her not following local Afghan traditions, especially regarding the wearing of a burqa outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;Yousafzai, Sami and Moreau, Ron (14 September 2013) [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/14/we-killed-sushmita-banerjee-says-renegade-taliban-militia.html ‘We Killed Sushmita Banerjee’ Says Renegade Taliban Militia] thedailybeast.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Sushmita Banerjee wrote ''Kabuliwalar Bangali Bou'' ("A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife") in 1995. It recounted the tale of her love marriage to an Afghan businessman, Jaanbaz Khan, her moving to Afghanistan in 1989, the adversities she faced in Talibani Afghanistan, and her eventual escape back to Kolkata.&lt;ref name="cnn deathnews"/&gt; In 2003, ''[[Escape from Taliban]]'', a [[Bollywood]] film, starring Manisha Koirala was made based on the book.

She authored ''Talibani Atyachar—Deshe o Bideshe'' (Taliban atrocities in Afghanistan and Abroad), ''Mullah Omar, Taliban O Ami'' (Mullah Omar, Taliban and I) (2000), ''Ek Borno Mithya Noi'' (''Not a Word is a Lie'') (2001) and ''Sabhyatar Sesh Punyabani'' (The Swansong of Civilisation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitra|first=Sumit|title=On hostile tract : Tales of Taliban barbarism by Afghan's Bengali wife become a bestseller, being filmed|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/tales-of-taliban-barbarism-by-afghans-bengali-wife-become-a-bestseller-being-filmed/1/231484.html|newspaper=India Today|date=22 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toi director"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-05-15/kolkata/27135718_1_omar-s-taliban-taliban-leader-mullah-omar|title=Kabuliwala's wife turns director|newspaper=The Times of India|date=15 May 2002|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fire on the Snow''''' is a verse play by [[Douglas Stewart (poet)|Douglas Stewart]] about the [[Terra Nova Expedition]] to [[Antarctica]] by [[Robert Falcon Scott]]. It premiered on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio on 6 June 1941 to great acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/leslierees1.html Leslie Rees biography at Live Performance Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146694348 |title="THE FIRE ON THE SNOW.". |newspaper=[[The Narracoorte Herald]] |location=SA |date=3 June 1941 |accessdate=14 September 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original Production==
The original production was produced by [[Frank Clewlow]] and was to have starred [[Peter Finch]] as Scott, but he joined the army only four days before broadcast, so [[Frank Harvey (Australian screenwriter)|Frank Harvey]] replaced him. Clewlow decided to employ a female actor, [[Ida Elizabeth Osbourne|Ida Osbourne]], as narrator to contrast with the all-male cast. No copy of this original production exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/playingthe20thcentury/stories/2011/3087120.htm 'Playing the 20th century – episode three: The Fire On The Snow'], ''Radio National'', 2 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent Productions==
The play has been performed on radio several times since, including a later production starring Peter Finch for Frank Clelow and one directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]] for the BBC in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lane, ''The Golden Age of Australian Radio Drama'', Melbourne University Press, 1994 p 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141743976 |title=THE FIRE ON THE SNOW. |newspaper=[[Barrier Daily Truth]] |location=Broken Hill, NSW |date=15 August 1941 |accessdate=14 September 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Typhoon June''', also known in the Philippines as '''Typhoon Maring''', was the first of two [[tropical cyclone]]s to affect the Philippines in a one-week time span in August&amp;nbsp;1984. June originated from an area of [[atmospheric convection|convection]] that was first witnessed on August&amp;nbsp;15 in the [[Philippine Sea]]. Despite initial [[wind shear]], the area intensified into a tropical storm three days later as it tracked westward. After tracking over Luzon, June entered the [[South China Sea]] on August&amp;nbsp;30. Despite remaining poorly organized, June re-intensified over land, and it was estimated to have briefly attained typhoon intensity before striking China, just to the east of [[Hong Kong]], at maximum intensity, although its remnants were last noticed on September&amp;nbsp;3.

Affecting the country four days before [[Typhoon Ike]] would devastate the Philippines, June brought widespread damage to the nation. Throughout the Philippines, 470,962&amp;nbsp;people sought shelter. A total of 671&amp;nbsp;homes were destroyed, with 6,341&amp;nbsp;others damaged. A total of 121&amp;nbsp;people were killed, while 17&amp;nbsp;other individuals were reportedly missing, and 26 other people were wounded. Damage totaled $24.2&amp;nbsp;million (1984&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollars|USD]], including $15.24&amp;nbsp;million in agriculture and $8.82&amp;nbsp;million in infrastructure). Following June and Ike, several major countries provided cash and other goods. In all, $7.5&amp;nbsp;million worth of aid was donated to the nation in relief. In addition to effects on the Philippines, 1,500&amp;nbsp;homes were damaged and {{convert|66,000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of farmland were flooded in the [[Guangdong]] province.

{{storm path|June 1984 track.png}}
Typhoon June, the final of seven [[tropical cyclones]] to develop in the [[tropical cyclone basins|Western Pacific basin]] in August&amp;nbsp;1984, formed from the [[monsoon trough]]. A large area of convection was first detected on [[satellite imagery]], and at midday, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] determined that a [[low pressure area|closed area of low pressure]] developed between the [[135th meridian east]] and the [[140th meridian east]]. The associated thunderstorm activity initially failed to consolidate due to strong [[wind shear]] caused by a displaced [[anticyclone]].&lt;ref name="JTWC ATCR"&gt;{{cite report|title=Annual Tropical Cyclone Report: 1984|publisher=United States Navy, United States Air Force|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1984atcr.pdf|author2=Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center|author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=May 24, 2017|year=1987|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) started to track the system 06:00&amp;nbsp;UTC on August&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;ref name="JMA"&gt;{{cite report|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|date=October 10, 1992|title=RSMC Best Track Data – 1980–1989|accessdate=May 24, 2017|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst8089.txt|format=[[.TXT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the western Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|title=Annual Report on Activities of the RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center 2000|date=February 2001|accessdate=May 24, 2017|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/AnnualReport/2000/Text/Text2000.pdf|page=3|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} The next day, the wind shear began to relent, as an upper-level anticyclone became located over the system as the system tracked westward, although the [[atmospheric circulation|circulation]] remained tough to identify by [[weather satellite]]s.

Based on the above data and an increase in the system's organization, the JTWC issued a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]].

== Impact ==
Typhoon June hit the Philippines four days before [[Typhoon Ike]] would devastate the archipelago.&lt;ref name="UPI1" /&gt; The first storm to hit the Philippines in 1984, June brought rough seas from [[Luzon]] to [[Davao Region|Davao]]. [[Philippine Airlines]] suspended flights to eight cities and railway services to the northern portions of the island chain were also suspended.&lt;ref name="UPI2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical storm kills 7, injures 127|agency=United Press International|date=August 29, 1984}}  {{subscription required|via=Lexis Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power was knocked out for four days across much of the country due to both systems.&lt;ref name="UPI1" /&gt; Six people were killed in landslides that isolated the mountain resort city of [[Baguio]], where five others were missing and seven were injured. According to the [[Philippine News Agency]], a 22-year-old man picking seashells drowned after he was swept out to sea near [[Bacolod]], on [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros Island]]. In [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]], located in the northern province of [[La Union]], 200&amp;nbsp;houses were flattened and 120&amp;nbsp;people were injured. In [[Manila]], heavy winds and rough seas left streets flooded, resulting in traffic jams.&lt;ref name="UPI2" /&gt; The storm caused serious damage to the nation's rice fields, the country's  main export.&lt;ref name="UPI1" /&gt;

From the two storms combined, more than 1&amp;nbsp;million were displaced from their homes.&lt;ref name="UPI1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Typhoon death toll rises to 438, may go higher|agency=United Press International|date=September 4, 1984}} {{subscription required|via=Lexis Nexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Philippines, 470,962&amp;nbsp;people or 92,271&amp;nbsp;families sought shelter due to the typhoon,&lt;ref name="NDCC2" /&gt; of which 5,023&amp;nbsp;families or 30,138&amp;nbsp;people sought shelter in schools, churches and town halls in a total of 10&amp;nbsp;provinces.&lt;ref name="UPI2" /&gt; A total of 671&amp;nbsp;homes were destroyed while 6,341&amp;nbsp;others were damaged.

Prior to its second landfall, in Hong Kong, a [[Hong Kong tropical cyclone warning signals|No 1. hurricane signal]] was issued after June entered the South China Sea. The storm brought heavy rains and strong winds to the region. A minimum pressure of {{convert|990|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} was recorded at the [[Hong Kong Royal Observatory]] early on August&amp;nbsp;30. [[Tate's Cairn]] recorded a peak wind speed of {{convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and a peak wind gust of {{convert|78|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. [[Cheung Chau]] observed {{convert|187.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain over a five-day period. Although damage in Hong Kong was minimal, heavy rains in eastern [[Guangdong]] inundated {{convert|66,000|ha|acre|abbr=on|round=5}} of farmland, and damage to 1,500&amp;nbsp;dwellings.&lt;ref name="HKO" /&gt;

'''Vignette Corporation''' offered a suite of [[content management]], [[web portal]], [[collaboration]], [[document management]], and [[records management]] software. Targeted at the enterprise market, Vignette offered products under the name [[StoryServer]] that allowed non-technical users to create, edit and track content through workflows and publish it on the web. It provided integration for [[enterprise resource planning]], [[customer relationship management]] and legacy systems, supporting [[Java EE]] and [[Microsoft.NET]]. Vignette's [[integrated development environment]] and [[application programming interface]] offered an alternative to conventional [[Common Gateway Interface]]/[[vi]]/[[Perl]] web development. StoryServer was used on many large websites including those of [[CNET]], [[UnitedHealth Group]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Wachovia]], [[Martha Stewart]], [[Fox News]], [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]], [[MetLife]], [[BSkyB]], the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], and [[NASA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cio.com/article/2436135/enterprise-architecture/nasa-phoenix-mission-to-mars--an-out-of-this-world-content-management-challe.html | title=NASA Phoenix Mission to Mars: An Out-Of-This-World Content Management Challenge | first=Laurianne | last=McLaughlin | work=[[CIO magazine]] | date=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its V6 content suites was priced at $200,000-$400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://au.pcmag.com/internet-products/8479/review/vignette-v6-content-suite | title=Vignette V6 Content Suite | first=John | last=Clyman | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=February 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, the company was acquired by [[Open Text Corporation]].

==History==
In November 1995, Ross Garber and Neil Webber founded the company with the goal of making web publishing easier and more personalized.&lt;ref name=webgo&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2000-06-04/making-the-web-go | title=Making The Web Go | first=Spencer E. | last=Ante | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=June 5, 2000}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vision&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2002/08/05/story2.html | title=Big vision for Vignette | first=Stacey | last=Higginbotham | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=August 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the company developed StoryBuilder, its first product, which handled large-scale content management workflow. During the initial development, Vignette partnered with [[CNET]], which had developed its own technology called PRISM that allowed for the creation and delivery of large, database-driven websites. CNET transferred the technology and $500,000 in cash to Vignette for a 33% stake in the company.&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/1998/10/14/side1.html | title=Vignette is the story | first=Om | last=Malik | authorlink=Om Malik | work=[[Forbes]] | date=October 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/vignette-produces-web-site-tools/ | title=Vignette produces Web site tools | work=[[CNET]] | date=November 13, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1996/09/16/story7.html | title=CNET ups its Vignette stake | first=Neil | last=Orman | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=September 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1996, the company received $400,000 of [[seed money]] from [[Austin Ventures]] and Sigma Partners.&lt;ref name=vision/&gt;

In July 1996, the company raised $3 million.&lt;ref name=vision/&gt;

In January 1997, the company released [[StoryServer]], developed from technology acquired from CNET. It was updated in September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/vignette-updates-storyserver-platform/ | title=Vignette updates StoryServer platform | first=PAUL | last=FESTA | work=[[CNET]] | date=September 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1998, Vignette and [[Firefly (website)|Firefly Networks]] proposed the XML based [[Information and Content Exchange]] (ICE) protocol for content syndication and submitted the specification to the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] standards body on October 26, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.xml.com/pub/a/ws/SeyboldReport/ip020701.html | title=Vignette and Firefly propose the ICE protocol | first=Victor | last=Votsch | work=XML.com | date=March 10, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-ice-19981026 | title=The Information and Content Exchange (ICE) Protocol | publisher=W3 | date=October 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, the company acquired RandomNoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/vignette-to-buy-randomnoise/ | title=Vignette to buy RandomNoise | work=[[CNET]] | date=May 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1998, Garber hired [[Greg Peters (businessman)|Greg Peters]] to succeed him as CEO, and Garber became chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1129/6413220a.html | title=Automating the Web | first=Daniel | last=Fisher | work=[[Forbes]] | date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1998, the company launched StoryServer 4, which featured strong support of [[XML]] technology.

By December 1998, the company raised an additional $27.5 in [[venture capital]].&lt;ref name=vision/&gt;

The number of the company's customers rose from 130 in 1998&lt;ref name=story /&gt; to 700 in 2000.&lt;ref name=webgo/&gt; 

On February 19, 1999, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]].

It is held in [[Ontario, Canada]] on the [[Toronto Islands]], [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. The name Wakestock refers to the famous outdoor music festival [[Woodstock]].

==History==
Wakestock was born out of Bala, Ontario.

In 2005, the festival was moved to Toronto Islands from August 11–14. Each year the [[wakeboard]] competition is accompanied by a music festival. There are several stages with different bands playing throughout day.

There are also other attractions—in 2005 there was a [[skatepark]] set up for anyone with a [[skateboard]]. There was a Pro Freestyle [[motocross]] demonstration as well as a rail competition set up for wakeboarders. There are also separate designated alcohol serving areas because the entire festival is for all ages.

Wakestock 2015 was canceled and 2016 never got beyond planning stages.

==Move to Collingwood==
On August 9, 2009, Wakestock moved to Collingwood.
