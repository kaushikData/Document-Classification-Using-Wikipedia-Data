      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15551">'''Three-dimensional composites''' utilize fiber preforms constructed from [[yarn]]s or [[tow]]s arranged into complex three-dimensional structures. These can be created from a [[3D weaving]] process, a [[3D braided fabrics|3D braiding]] process, or a 3D lay of short fibers. A resin is applied to the 3D preform to create the composite material. Three-dimensional composites are utilized in highly engineered and highly technical applications in order to achieve complex mechanical properties. Three-dimensional composites are engineered to react to stresses and strains in ways that are not possible with traditional composite materials composed of single direction tows, or woven composites, or stacked laminate materials.

==3D Woven Composites==
Three dimensional woven fabrics are fabrics that could be formed to [[near net shape]] with considerable thickness. There is no need for layering to create a part, because a single fabric provides the full three-dimensional reinforcement. The 3-D woven fabric is a variant of the 2D [[weaving]] process, and it’s an extension of the very old technique of creating [[Double cloth|double]] and triple woven cloth. 3D weaving allows the production of fabrics up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm in thickness.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;P. Schwartz, “Structure and Mechanics of Textile Fibre Assemblies”, Woodhead publishing Ltd. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fibers placed in the thickness direction are called z-yarn, warp weaver, or binder yarn for 3D woven fabrics. More than one layer of fabric is woven at the same time, and z-yarn interlaces [[warp and woof]] yarns of different layers during the process. At the end of the weaving process, an integrated 3D woven structure, which has a considerable thickness, is produced.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;F. C. Campbell, Manufacturing Processes For Advanced Composites, Oxford, UK: Elsevier, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Three-dimensional woven structures can create composite materials with fiber volume fractions around 50% in both 3D unit cell and 3D orthogonal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bilisik|first=Kadir|date=2010|title=Multiaxis 3D Woven Preform and Properties of Multiaxis 3D Woven and 3D Orthogonal Woven Carbon/Epoxy Composites|url=|journal=Journal of Plastics and Reinforced Composites|volume=29.8|issue=1173–186|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angle-interlock three-dimensional woven structures are also common in order to create much thicker woven preforms. In the interlock structures yarns can be woven from one layer of yarns to another and then back to the original layer to lock adjacent layers to each other. In complex interlock structures yarns may be woven at specified points into several layers in order to join multiple layers. These structures have a great advantage over laminated materials because of their excellent resistance to layer delamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=De Luycker, E.|author2=Morestin, F.|author3=Boisse, P.|author4= Marsal, D.|date=2009|title=Simulation of 3D Interlock Composite Preforming|journal=Composite Structures|volume=88|issue=4|pages=615–23|doi=10.1016/j.compstruct.2008.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using jacquard woven techniques such as bifurcation, the 3D woven preforms can be created into nearly endless shapes ranging from a standard [[I-Beam]] to a complex Sine-Curve I-Beam, to [[Aircraft]] Airfoils, and many other shapes. 3D woven composites, finished with resin transfer molding have been produced larger than 26 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClain &amp; Goering|first=|date=2013|title=Overview of Recent Developments in 3D Structures|url=|journal=Albany Engineered Composites (AEC)|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D woven composites are used for various engineering applications, including engine rotors, rocket nose cones and nozzles, engine mounts, aircraft framework, T- and X-shape panels, leading edges for aircraft wings, and I-Beams for civil infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ballyribbon.com/3d-woven-ribbon|title=3D Woven Composite Structures|last=|first=|date=|website=Bally Ribbon Mills|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of 3D woven fabrics===

There are several types of 3D woven fabrics that are commercially available; they can be classified according to their weaving technique.&lt;ref&gt;N. Khokar, "3D Fabric-forming Processes: Distinguishing between 2D-weaving, 3Dweaving and an Unspecified Non-interlacing Process," Journal of the Textile Institute, vol. 87, no. 1, pp. 97-106, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''3D woven interlock fabrics'', are 3D woven fabrics produced on a traditional 2D [[loom|weaving loom]], using proper weave design and techniques, it could either have the weaver/z-yarn going through all the thickness of the fabric or from layer to layer.
# ''3D [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] woven fabrics'', are 3D woven fabrics produced on a special 3D weaving loom. The process to form such fabric was patented by Mohamed and Zhang.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Mohamed and Z.-H. Zhang, "Method of Forming Variable Cross-Sectional Shaped Three-Dimensional Fabrics". US Patent 5085252, 4th February 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of the 3D orthogonal woven fabric consists of three different sets of yarns; warp yarns (y-yarn), weft yarns (x-yarn), and (z-yarn). Z-yarn is placed in the through-thickness direction of the preform. In 3D orthogonal woven fabric there is no interlacing between warp and weft yarns and they are straight and perpendicular to each other. On the other hand, z-yarns combine the warp and the weft layers by interlacing (moving up and down) along the y-direction over the weft yarn. Interlacing occurs on the top and the bottom surface of the fabric.&lt;ref&gt;N. Khokar, "3D-weaving: Theory and Practice," Journal of the Textile Institute, vol. 92, no. 2, pp. 193-207, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Khokar, "Noobing: A Nonwoven 3D Fabric-forming process explained," Journal of the Textile Institute, vol. 93, no. 1, pp. 52-74, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===

*3D woven fabrics are very useful in applications where the composite structure is subjected to out-of-plane loading, thanks to the extra strength provided by the z-yarn in the through thickness dimension. Thus it can better resist [[delamination]], which is the separation of layers due to out-of-plane forces.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;
*3D woven fabrics have a high [[formability]], which means they can easily take the shape of the mold in case of complex composite designs.&lt;ref name=Mohamed&gt;M. H. Mohamed and K. K. Wetzel, "3D Woven Carbon/Glass Hybrid Spar Cap for Wind Turbine Rotor Blade," Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, vol. 128, no. November, pp. 562-573, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*3D woven fabrics have a highly [[Porosity|porous]] structure, which decreases [[resin]] infusion time.&lt;ref name=Mohamed/&gt;
*3D orthogonal woven fabrics have less or no yarn crimp (the difference in length of yarn, before and after weaving); therefore, mechanical properties of fibers are almost fully utilized in warp and weft directions. Thus, it could benefit from the maximum load carrying capacity of high performance fibers in these directions.&lt;ref name=Mohamed/&gt;
*The shape of 3D woven fabrics can be tapered in all three directions during the weaving process, producing near net shape fabrics such as [[I-beam]]s and stiffeners. This means that these preforms could be placed directly in the mold without any additional labor work.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;
*There is no need for layering to create a part, because the single fabric has a considerable thickness that provides the full three-dimensional reinforcement.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;
*The 3D woven fabric can be molded into different shapes and can be used in biological applications to create replacement tissues&lt;ref&gt;Moutos FT, Glass KA, Compton SA, Ross AK, Gersbach CA, Guilak F, Estes BT.

==3D Braided Composites==
“[[3D braided fabrics]] technology is an extension of the well-established 2-D braiding technology wherein the fabric is constructed by the intertwining of two or more yarn systems to form an integral structure.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Three-D Textile Reinforcements in Composite Materials|last=Miravete|first=Antonio|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in the late 1960s, in an effort to circumvent the problems related to 2D composite laminates yet at the same time retain the benefits of the braiding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bannister|first=M.|date=2001|title=Challengers for Composites Into the Next Millennium - A Reinforcement Perspective|url=|journal=Composite Part A|volume=32|issue=901–910|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braided structures, used as composite preforms, have a number of advantages over other competing processes, such as filament winding and weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Potluri, P.|author2=Rawal, A.|author3=Rivaldi, M.|author4=Porat, I.|date=2003|title=Geometrical Modelling and Control of a Triaxial Braiding Machine for Producing 3D Preforms|journal=Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing|volume=34|issue=6|pages=481–492|doi=10.1016/S1359-835X(03)00061-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braided composites have superior toughness and fatigue strength in comparison to filament wound composites. Woven fabrics have orthogonal interlacement while the braids can be constructed over a wide range of angles, from 10 to 858. An additional set of axial yarns can be introduced to the braiding process to produce triaxial braids (Fig. 1); triaxial braids are more stable and exhibit nearly isotropic properties.
                      
[[File:Braids.png|thumb|for 3d composites article]]
         
Braids can be produced either as seamless tubes or flat fabrics with a continuous selvedge. Composites produced with the braided preforms exhibit superior strength and crack resistance in comparison to broadcloth composites, due to fiber continuity; Composites with braided holes (Fig.2) exhibit about 1.8 times the strength in comparison to drilled holes, again due to fiber continuity.
   
[[File:Braids2.png|thumb|for 3d composites article]]

There are two main types of 3D braiders, [[horn gear]] and track and column types. Horn gear type 3D braiders use a large number of traditional horn gears for carrier propulsion. By arranging the horn gears in a square, 3D solid braids with a variety of cross-sections (e.g. H section) can be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of 6th International SAMPE Symposium|author1=Tada, M.|author2=Osada, T.|author3=Nakai, A.|author4=Hamada, H.|first=|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Laourine, E.|author2=Schneider, M.|author3=Wulfhorst, B.|first=|date=2000|title=Production and Analysis of 3D Braided Textile Preforms for Composites|url=|journal=Texcomp|volume=5|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==3D Stitched Composites==
The stitching of laminates in the through thickness direction with a high strength thread has proven a simple, low-cost method for producing 3-D composites. The stitching process basically involves sewing high tensile strength yarn (e.g. glass, carbon or Kevlar®), through an uncured prepreg laminate or dry fabric plies using an industrial sewing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouritz &amp; Bannister|first=|date=1999|title=Review of Applications for Advanced Three-Dimensional Fibre Textile Composites|url=|journal=Composites Part A: Applied Science and Manufacturing|volume=30 |issue=12|pages=1445–1461|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=3D Fibre Reinforced Polymer Composites|author1=Tong, L.|author2=Mouritz, A.P.|author3=Bannister, M.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2002|isbn=9780080439389}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Studies report an improvement to in-plane mechanical properties due to stitching, whereas others find unchanged or degraded properties.The data assembled for stitched laminates reveal that the tension, compression, flexure, shear and open-hole strengths are improved or degraded up to 20% by stitching relative to those of unstitched laminates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouritz &amp; Cox|first=|date=2000|title=A Mechanistic Approach to the Properties of Stitched Laminates|url=|journal=Composites 2000|volume=31A|issue=1–27|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applications of 3D Stitched Composites'''
*Lap joints
*Stiffened panels
*Aircraft wing-to-spar joints

==3D Z-Pinning==
This alternative method to the standard stitching process was first introduced in the late 1980s and was commercially developed by the company Aztex as [[Z-Fiber]]™ technology. “This technology consists of embedding previously cured reinforcement fibers into a thermoplastic foam that is then placed on top of a prepreg, or dry fabric, lay-up and vacuum bagged.” 12 The foam will collapse as temperature and pressure are increased, which allows the fibers to be slowly pushed into the lay-up. 3D reinforcement in regards to Z-pinning is necessary to introduce a mechanical link between the different plies of the composite lamina, this link being a stiff carbon fiber rod in Z-pinning. Z-pin (carbon fiber of small diameter embedded in the thickness direction-z) composites are a means to provide higher through-the-thickness stiffness and strength that 2D woven composites do not possess.

==Resin Application to Three-Dimensional Preforms==
Many Three-Dimensional preforms are transformed into complex composite materials when a resin is applied and cured within the preform to create a solid fiber reinforced matrix. The most common form of resin application for 3D preforms is the Resin Transfer Molding process where a mold is created in the shape of a preform and the preform is then placed inside. The mold is closed and then the resin of the matrix material is injected under particular temperature and pressure, then allowed to cure. the mold is then removed from the exterior of the 3D composite material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
  
==Mechanical Evaluation of 3D Composites vs. 2D Composites==

The microstructure of a 3D woven composite is mainly determined by the fiber architecture to the woven preform and weaving process, and to a lesser extent by the process of consolidation.Various types of defects are inadvertently created during the 3D weaving process that can possibly degrade the in-plane, through-thickness, and impact properties of the 3D composite. Research has found that testing various 3D composite materials that “ ...the strength is the same or slightly higher than an equivalent two-dimensional (2D) material.” When compared to a 2D composite, the impact resistance, compression after impact (CAI), and delamination control is significantly improved with a 3D composite without significantly reducing the mechanical properties along the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grey Systems - Theory and Application|last=Mahmood|first=A.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''banked turn''' (or '''banking turn'''&lt;!-- source: www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/turns.html --&gt;) is a turn or change of direction in which the vehicle banks or inclines, usually towards the inside of the turn.  For a road or railroad this is usually due to the roadbed having a transverse down-slope towards the inside of the curve.  The bank angle is the angle at which the vehicle is [[Grade (slope)|incline]]d about its longitudinal axis with respect to the horizontal.

== Turn on flat surfaces ==
If the bank angle is zero, the surface is flat and the [[normal force]] is vertically upward. The only force keeping the vehicle turning on its path is [[friction]], or [[traction (engineering)|traction]]. This must be large enough to provide the [[centripetal force]], a relationship which can be expressed as an inequality, assuming the car is driving in a circle of radius ''r'':

:&lt;math&gt;\mu mg &gt; {mv^2\over r}.&lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the right hand side is the centripetal acceleration multiplied by mass, the force required to turn the vehicle. The left hand side is the maximum frictional force, which equals the [[coefficient of friction]] ''μ'' multiplied by the normal force. Rearranging the maximum cornering speed is

:&lt;math&gt;v &lt; {\sqrt{r\mu g}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''μ'' can be the coefficient for static or dynamic friction. In the latter case, where the vehicle is skidding around a bend, the friction is at its limit and the inequalities becomes equations. This also ignores effects such as [[downforce]] which can increase the normal force and cornering speed.

== Frictionless banked turn ==
[[File:Banked turn.svg|thumb|250px|Upper panel: Ball on a banked circular track moving with constant speed ''v''; Lower panel: Forces on the ball. The resultant or [[net force]] on the ball found by [[vector addition]] of the [[normal force]] exerted by the road and vertical force due to [[gravity]] must equal the required force for centripetal acceleration dictated by the need to travel a circular path.]]
As opposed to a vehicle riding along a flat circle, inclined edges add an additional force that keeps the vehicle in its path and prevents a car from being "dragged into" or "pushed out of" the circle (or a railroad wheel from moving sideways so as to nearly rub on the wheel [[flange]]).  This force is the horizontal component of the vehicle's normal force. In the absence of friction, the normal force is the only one acting on the vehicle in the direction of the center of the circle. Therefore, as per Newton's second law, we can set the horizontal component of the normal force equal to mass multiplied by centripetal acceleration:&lt;ref name="Serway"&gt;Serway, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N\sin \theta ={mv^2\over r}&lt;/math&gt;

Because there is no motion in the vertical direction, the sum of all vertical forces acting on the system must be zero. Therefore, we can set the vertical component of the vehicles's normal force equal to its weight:&lt;ref name="Serway" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N\cos \theta =mg&lt;/math&gt;

Solving the above equation for the normal force and substituting this value into our previous equation, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;{mv^2\over r}= {mg\tan \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to:

:&lt;math&gt;{v^2\over r}= {g\tan \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for velocity we have:

:&lt;math&gt;v= {\sqrt{rg\tan \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

This provides the velocity that in the absence of friction and with a given angle of incline and [[Track transition curve|radius of curvature]], will ensure that the vehicle will remain in its designated path. The magnitude of this velocity is also known as the "rated speed" (or "balancing speed" for railroads) of a turn or curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notice that the rated speed of the curve is the same for all massive objects, and a curve that is not inclined will have a rated speed of 0.

== Banked turn with friction ==
When considering the effects of friction on the system, once again we need to note which way the friction force is pointing. When calculating a maximum velocity for our automobile, friction will point down the incline and towards the center of the circle. Therefore, we must add the horizontal component of friction to that of the normal force. The sum of these two forces is our new net force in the direction of the center of the turn (the centripetal force):

:&lt;math&gt;{mv^2\over r}= \mu_s N\cos \theta +N\sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;

Once again, there is no motion in the vertical direction, allowing us to set all opposing vertical forces equal to one another. These forces include the vertical component of the normal force pointing upwards and both the car's weight and the vertical component of friction pointing downwards:

:&lt;math&gt;N\cos \theta =\mu_s N\sin \theta +mg&lt;/math&gt;

By solving the above equation for mass and substituting this value into our previous equation we get:

:&lt;math&gt;{v^2\left(N\cos \theta -\mu_s N\sin \theta \right)\over rg}= \mu_s N\cos \theta +N\sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for v we get:

:&lt;math&gt;v= {\sqrt{rg\left(\sin \theta +\mu_s \cos \theta \right)\over \cos \theta -\mu_s \sin \theta }}
={\sqrt{rg\left(\tan\theta +\mu_s\right)\over 1 -\mu_s \tan\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation provides the maximum velocity for the automobile with the given angle of incline, [[coefficient of static friction]] and radius of curvature.  By a similar analysis of minimum velocity, the following equation is rendered:

:&lt;math&gt;v= {\sqrt{rg\left(\sin \theta -\mu_s \cos \theta \right)\over \cos \theta +\mu_s \sin \theta }}
={\sqrt{rg\left(\tan\theta -\mu_s\right)\over 1 +\mu_s \tan\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in the latter analysis comes when considering the direction of friction for the minimum velocity of the automobile (towards the outside of the circle).  Consequently, opposite operations are performed when inserting friction into equations for forces in the centripetal and vertical directions.

Improperly banked road curves increase the risk of run-off-road and head-on crashes. A 2% deficiency in superelevation (say, 4% superelevation on a curve that should have 6%) can be expected to increase crash frequency by 6%, and a 5% deficiency will increase it by 15%.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Harwood, et al., ''Prediction of the Expected Safety Performance of Rural Two-Lane Highways'', Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, McLean, Virginia, December 2000, page 39, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/99207/99207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Up until now, highway engineers have been without efficient tools to identify improperly banked curves and to design relevant mitigating road actions. A modern [[profilograph]] can provide data of both road [[curvature]] and [[cross slope]] (angle of incline). A practical demonstration of how to evaluate improperly banked turns was developed in the EU Roadex III project.  See the linked referenced document below.

When a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] is making a turn (changing its direction) the aircraft must roll to a banked position so that its [[wing]]s are angled towards the desired direction of the turn. When the turn has been completed the aircraft must roll back to the wings-level position in order to resume straight flight.&lt;ref name=FAA&gt;{{cite book |title=Pilot's Encyclopedia of Aeronautical Knowledge |author=Federal Aviation Administration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5V04SXE4zQC&amp;pg=PT33&amp;lpg=PT33&amp;dq=+%22angle+of+bank%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iYTi_mZAra&amp;sig=ytjcmr9RStdIdgZzaiBJJ-wxjts&amp;hl=en

When any moving vehicle is making a turn, it is necessary for the forces acting on the vehicle to add up to a net inward force, to cause [[centripetal acceleration]].  In the case of an aircraft making a turn, the force causing centripetal acceleration is the horizontal component of the [[lift (force)|lift]] acting on the aircraft.

In straight, level flight, the lift acting on the aircraft acts vertically upwards to counteract the weight of the aircraft which acts downwards.  During a balanced turn where the angle of bank is ''θ'' the lift acts at an angle ''θ'' away from the vertical.  It is useful to resolve the lift into a vertical component and a horizontal component.  If the aircraft is to continue in level flight (i.e. at constant [[Altitude#Altitude in Aviation|altitude]]), the vertical component must continue to equal the weight of the aircraft and so the pilot must pull back on the stick a little more.  The total (now angled) lift is greater than the weight of the aircraft so the vertical component can equal the weight.  The horizontal component is unbalanced, and is thus the [[net force]] causing the aircraft to accelerate inward and execute the turn.

[[File:Banked turn.png|thumb|300px|Vector diagram showing lift, weight and centripetal force acting on a fixed-wing aircraft during a banked turn.]]

Because centripetal acceleration is:
:&lt;math&gt;a = {v^2\over r}&lt;/math&gt;

Newton's second law in the horizontal direction can be expressed mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt;L\sin \theta = {mv^2\over r}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''L'' is the lift acting on the aircraft
:''θ'' is the angle of bank of the aircraft
:''m'' is the [[mass]] of the aircraft
:''v'' is the [[true airspeed]] of the aircraft
:''r'' is the radius of the turn

In straight level flight, lift is equal to the aircraft weight.  In turning flight the lift exceeds the aircraft weight, and is equal to the weight of the aircraft (''mg'') divided by the [[Trigonometric functions#Right-angled triangle definitions|cosine]] of the angle of bank:

:&lt;math&gt;L = {mg\over{\cos \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Earth's gravity|''g'']] is the gravitational field strength.

The radius of the turn can now be calculated:&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J, Equation 14.9&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = {v^2\over{g \tan \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

This formula shows that the radius of turn is proportional to the square of the aircraft’s [[true airspeed]].  With a higher airspeed the radius of turn is larger, and with a lower airspeed the radius is smaller.

This formula also shows that the radius of turn decreases with the angle of bank.  With a higher angle of bank the radius of turn is smaller, and with a lower angle of bank the radius is greater.

In a banked turn at constant altitude, the ''[[Load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]]'' is equal to 1/cosθ.  We can see that the load factor in straight and level flight is 1, since cos(0) = 1, and to generate sufficient lift to maintain constant altitude, the load factor must approach infinity as the bank angle approaches 90° and cosθ approaches zero.  This is physically impossible, because structural limitations  of the aircraft or physical endurance of the occupants will be exceeded well before then.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3158">A '''black hole bomb''' is the name given to a physical effect utilizing how a [[bosonic field]] impinging on a [[rotating black hole]] can be amplified through [[superradiance|superradiant scattering]]. An additional condition which must be met is that the field must have a [[rest mass]] different from zero. The scattered wave will then be reflected back and forth between the mass term and the black hole becoming amplified on each reflection. The growth of the field is asserted to be exponential and unstable. The mechanism by which the black hole bomb functions is called '''superradiant instability'''.

==History==
The idea that angular momentum and energy may be transferred from a rotating black hole to a particle being scattered by it was proposed by [[Roger Penrose]] in 1971. The first discussion of a runaway effect, the black hole bomb, was explored by W. H. Press and S. A. Teukolsky in 1972.&lt;ref name="Physics 10, 83 - Sam Dolan"&gt; {{cite news |url= https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/83 |title= Viewpoint: Spinning Black Holes May Grow Hair |author= Sam Dolan |date= 24 July 2017 |journal= Physical Review Letters |publisher= American Physical Society }} &lt;/ref&gt; If such an effect were to spontaneously occur, it may point to new physics beyond the Standard Model, and showing that black holes have "hair", as pointed out by a paper from 2017, by William E. East and Frans Pretorius.&lt;ref name=PhysicsWorld-2017-07-27&gt; {{cite news |url= https://physicsworld.com/a/spinning-black-holes-could-grow-long-hair/ |title= Spinning black holes could grow long hair |author= Hamish Johnston |date= 27 July 2017 |publisher= Physics World }} &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''complex oxide''' is a chemical compound that contains oxygen and at least two other elements (or oxygen and just one other element that's in at least two [[oxidation states]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ishihara|first1=Tatsumi|title=Perovskite Oxide for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells|date=2009|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-387-77708-5|page=1|edition=1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-77708-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex oxide materials are notable for their wide range of magnetic and electronic properties, such as [[ferromagnetism]], [[ferroelectricity]], and [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. These properties often come from their [[Strongly correlated material|strongly correlated]] electrons in d or f [[atomic orbital|orbitals]].

== Natural occurrence ==

Many [[mineral]]s found in the ground are complex oxides. Commonly studied mineral crystal families include [[spinel group|spinels]] and [[perovskite (structure)|perovskites]].

== Applications ==

Complex oxide materials are used in a variety of commercial applications.

=== Magnets ===

[[Image:Cable end.JPG|thumb|right|A [[ferrite bead]] near the end of a [[Mini USB]] cable helps suppress high-frequency noise.]]

[[Magnet]]s made of the complex oxide [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] are commonly used in [[transformer]] [[Magnetic core|cores]] and in [[inductor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldman|first1=Alex|title=Modern Ferrite Technology|date=2006|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-387-28151-3|pages=217–226|edition=2nd|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-29413-1_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrites are ideal for these applications because they are magnetic, [[insulator (electricity)|electrically insulating]], and inexpensive.

=== Transducers and actuators ===

[[Piezoelectric]] [[transducers]] and [[actuators]] are often made of the complex oxide PZT ([[lead zirconate titanate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is "PZT"?|url=https://www.americanpiezo.com/piezo-theory/pzt.html|website=American Piezo|publisher=APC International, Ltd.|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These transducers are used in applications such [[ultrasound]] imaging and some [[Microphone#Piezoelectric microphone|microphones]]. PZT is also sometimes used for [[piezo ignition]] in [[lighter]]s and [[barbecue grill|gas grills]].

=== Capacitors ===

Complex oxide materials are the dominant [[dielectric]] material in [[ceramic capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name="capacitor"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ho | first1 = J. | last2 = Jow | first2 = T. R. | last3 = Boggs | first3 = S. | title = Historical introduction to capacitor technology | doi = 10.1109/MEI.2010.5383924 | journal = IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine | volume = 26 | pages = 20 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}[http://www.ifre.re.kr/board/filedown.php?seq=179]&lt;/ref&gt; About one trillion ceramic capacitors are produced each year to be used in electronic equipment.

=== Fuel cells ===

[[Solid oxide fuel cell]]s often use complex oxide materials as their [[electrolyte]]s, [[anode]]s, and [[cathode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide cathode powder|url=https://www.fuelcellmaterials.com/site/powders-and-pastes/cathodes?page=shop.product_details&amp;category_id=11&amp;flypage=vmj_naru.tpl&amp;product_id=199|website=Fuel Cell Materials|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gemstone jewelry ===

[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish-made emerald and gold pendant exhibited at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O73034/pendant-unknown/ |title= Pendant &amp;#124; V&amp;A Search the Collections |website=Victoria and Albert Museum | accessdate=30 Jan 2014 | others=Given by Dame Joan Evans}} Museum item number M.138-1975&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Many precious gemstones, such as [[emerald]] and [[topaz]], are complex oxide crystals. Historically, some complex oxide materials (such as [[strontium titanate]], [[yttrium aluminium garnet]], and [[gadolinium gallium garnet]]) were also synthesized as inexpensive [[diamond simulant]]s, though after 1976 they were mostly eclipsed by [[cubic zirconia]].

=== New electronic devices ===

As of 2015, there is research underway to commercialize complex oxides in new kinds of electronic devices, such as [[ReRAM]], [[FeRAM]], and [[memristor]]s. Complex oxide materials are also being researched for their use in [[spintronics]].

Another potential application of complex oxide materials is [[Electric power transmission#Superconducting cables|superconducting power lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superconductor cable systems|url=http://www.amsc.com/gridtec/superconductor_cable_systems.html|publisher=AMSC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few companies have invested in pilot projects, but the technology is not widespread.

'''Eldar Sætre''' (born 8 February 1956) is a Norwegian businessman who since February 2015 is CEO of [[Equinor]], holding the position interim from October 2014.

==Early life==
Sætre was born in [[Vartdal]] in [[Ørsta]], son of a [[carpenter]].&lt;ref name=skarsaune&gt;Erlend Skarsaune (30 November 2014) [http://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/Dette-er-Eldar-Satre-3625337.html Dette er Eldar Sætre] {{no icon}} ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]''. 4 February 2015 [https://web.archive.org/web/20150204122336/http://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/Dette-er-Eldar-Satre-3625337.html Archive].&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a [[master's degree]] from [[Norwegian School of Economics]].

==Career==
He joined [[Equinor]] (then [[Statoil]]) in 1980. He was central in the listing of the company on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] and [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1981, following a privatization of Statoil. He has been part of the Executive board since 2003, first as [[CFO]] and from 2010 to 2014 as director of Marketing, Processing and Renewable energy. As CFO he played a major role in the merger of Statoil with [[Hydro Oil &amp; Gas]] in 2007. He has also been responsible for Statoil's marketing strategy for [[natural gas]] sale in Europe.&lt;ref name=dn&gt;Fredrick Chr. Ekeseth (4 February 2015) [http://www.dn.no/nyheter/naringsliv/2015/02/04/0833/Statoil/eldar-stre-er-firmaets-mann Eldar Sætre er firmaets mann] {{no icon}} ''[[Dagens Næringsliv]]''.

At the resignation of [[Helge Lund]] as CEO in 2014, Sætre was made interim CEO. He denied any interest in taking on the position permanently, but changed his mind after being asked by the board in December 2014.

He is, as of February 2015, a board member of Strømberg Gruppen and Trucknor.

==Personal life==
He lives in [[Sandnes]].&lt;ref name=skarsaune/&gt;

'''''Emery Tales''''' is a 2015 Greek [[documentary film]] written and directed by Susanne Bausinger and Stelios Efstathopoulos. Set on the island of [[Naxos]], the film illustrates the declining [[Emery (rock)|emery]] industry in an isolated and struggling mining community.

The film premiered at the [[Thessaloniki Documentary Festival]] on March 3, 2015.

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=July 2015}}
In 2014, a group of miners try to mine as much "smyrigli", or emery, as possible in the mountain of Naxos. They are only able to mine two or three times every year. [[Apeiranthos]], their community on the island, is dwindling due to its dwellers transferring to other more beneficial places in Greece.

==Production==
{{Expand section|date=July 2015}}
''Emery Tales'' was written and directed by Susanne Bausinger and Stelios Efstathopoulos, the former being a German director.&lt;ref name=TDF/&gt; The film is a co-production of Faos TV Productions with Roll Productions, a studio founded by the film's editor.&lt;ref name=Faos&gt;{{cite web|title=FAOStv|url=http://faostv.com|website=FAOStv|publisher=Wild West Domains, LLC|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roll&gt;{{cite web|title=Roll - About|url=http://rollproductions.gr/about|website=Roll Productions|publisher=Roll Productions|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Emery Tales'' premiered at the [[Thessaloniki Documentary Festival]] on March 3, 2015.&lt;ref name=TDF/&gt; It was also screened at the [[Ekotopfilm International Festival|42 Ekotopfilm Bratislava Documentary Festival]] on May 29, 2015,&lt;ref name=Ekotopfilm&gt;{{cite web|title=BRATISLAVA Film Program|url=http://www.ekotopfilm.sk/en/program/bratislava-film-program/|website=Ekotopfilm|publisher=Ekotopfilm|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[World Premieres Film Festival Philippines 2015]] in the "Cine Verde" section on June 30, 2015.&lt;ref name=Verde&gt;{{cite web|title=World Premieres Film Festival: The "Cine Verde" Section|url=http://wpff.ph/news.detail.php?id=51|website=World Premieres Film Festival|publisher=World Premieres Film Festival|accessdate=6 July 2015|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sperm-egg.jpg|right|299px|thumb|Sperm and ovum fusing]]
'''Fertilisation''' or '''fertilization''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|spelling differences]]), also known as '''generative fertilisation''', '''insemination''', '''pollination''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fertilization |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''fecundation''', '''syngamy''' and '''impregnation''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/impregnation{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the fusion of [[gametes]] to initiate the development of a new individual [[organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{], or outside ([[external fertilization|external fertilisation]])&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called [[sexual reproduction]]. During double fertilisation in angiosperms the haploid male gamete combines with two haploid polar nuclei to      form a triploid primary endosperm nucleus by the process of vegetative fertilisation.

==History==
In Antiquity, [[Aristotle]] conceived the formation of new individuals through fusion of male and female fluids, with form and function emerging gradually, in a mode called by him as [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenetic]].&lt;ref name=Maienschein&gt;Maienschein J. 2017. The first century of cell theory: From structural units to complex living systems. In: Stadler F. (eds.), ''Integrated History and Philosophy of Science. Vienna Circle Institute Yearbook''. Institute Vienna Circle, University of Vienna, Vienna Circle Society, Society for the Advancement of Scientific World Conceptions, vol 20. Springer, Cham. [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=zRgnDwAAQBAJ link].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784, [[Spallanzani]] established the need of interaction between the female's ovum and male's sperm to form a zygote in frogs.&lt;ref name=Birkhead/&gt; In 1827, von Baer observed a mammalian egg for the first time.&lt;ref name=Maienschein/&gt; [[Oscar Hertwig]] (1876), in Germany, described the fusion of nuclei of spermatozoa and of ova from [[sea urchin]].&lt;ref name="Birkhead"&gt;Birkhead, T.R. &amp; Montgomerie, R. (2009). Three centuries of sperm research, pp 1-42 in: Birkhead, T. R., Hosken, D. J. &amp; Pitnick, S. ''Sperm Biology: An Evolutionary Perspective''. Elsevier/Academic Press, Amsterdam. 642 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kctYNbO1fE0C].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The evolution of fertilisation is related to the [[Origin and function of meiosis|origin of meiosis]], as both are part of [[sexual reproduction]], originated in [[eukaryote]]s. There are two conflicting theories on how the couple meiosis–fertilisation arose. One is that it evolved from prokaryotic sex ([[bacterial recombination]]) as eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2011"&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair | first1 = Harris | last1 = Bernstein | first2 = Carol | last2 = Bernstein   | first3 = Richard E. | last3 = Michou | name-list-format = vanc  | editor-first1 = Inna | editor-last1 = Kruman | title = DNA repair | chapter = Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair | year = 2011 | publisher = InTech | doi = 10.5772/1751|isbn=978-953-307-697-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is that [[mitosis]] originated meiosis.&lt;ref name="Wilkins_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkins AS, Holliday R | title = The evolution of meiosis from mitosis | journal = Genetics | volume = 181 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19139151 | pmc = 2621177 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.108.099762 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fertilisation in plants==
[[File:DEV035048A.jpg|thumb|In the [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]]. This [[moss]] has been [[GUS reporter system|genetically modified]] so that the unfertilised egg within the archegonium produces a blue colour.]]&lt;p&gt;The gametes that participate in fertilisation of plants are the pollen (male), and the egg (female) cell.  Various families of plants have differing methods by which the female gametophyte is fertilized.  In [[Bryophyte]] land plants, fertilisation takes place within the [[archegonium]].  In [[Flowering plant|flowering plants]] a second fertilisation event involves another sperm cell and the [[central cell]] which is a second female gamete. In flowering plants there are two sperm from each pollen grain.&lt;/p&gt;In [[Seed plant|seed plants]], after [[pollination]], a [[pollen]] grain [[Pollen germination|germinates]], and a [[pollen tube]] grows and penetrates the [[ovule]] through a tiny pore called a [[Ovule|micropyle]]. The sperm are transferred from the pollen through the pollen tube to the ovule.

'''Pollen tube growth'''

Unlike animal sperm which is motile, plant sperm is immotile and relies on the pollen tube to carry it to the ovule where the sperm is released.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms4129 |title=Reactive oxygen species mediate pollen tube rupture to release sperm for fertilization in Arabidopsis |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |last1=Duan |first1=Qiaohong |last2=Kita |first2=Daniel |last3=Johnson |first3=Eric A |last4=Aggarwal |first4=Mini |last5=Gates |first5=Laura |last6=Wu |first6=Hen-Ming |last7=Cheung |first7=Alice Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pollen tube penetrates the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] and elongates through the extracellular matrix of the style before reaching the ovary.  Then near the receptacle, it breaks through the [[ovule]] through the micropyle (an opening in the ovule wall) and the pollen tube "bursts" into the embryo sac, releasing sperm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90427-1 |pmid=7634328 |title=A floral transmitting tissue-specific glycoprotein attracts pollen tubes and stimulates their growth |journal=Cell |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=383–93 |year=1995 |last1=Cheung |first1=Alice Y |last2=Wang |first2=Hong |last3=Wu |first3=Hen-Ming }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of the pollen tube has been believed to depend on chemical cues from the pistil, however these mechanisms were poorly understood until 1995.  Work done on [[Nicotiana|tobacco plants]] revealed a family of [[Glycoprotein|glycoproteins]] called TTS proteins that enhanced growth of pollen tubes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Pollen tubes in a sugar free pollen germination medium and a medium with purified TTS proteins both grew.  However, in the TTS medium, the tubes grew at a rate 3x that of the sugar-free medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  TTS proteins were also placed on various locations of semi [[In vivo|in vevo]] pollinated pistils, and pollen tubes were observed to immediately extend toward the proteins.  Transgenic plants lacking the ability to produce TTS proteins exhibited slower pollen tube growth and reduced fertility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Rupture of pollen tube'''

The rupture of the pollen tube to release sperm in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' has been shown to depend on a signal from the female gametophyte.  Specific proteins called FER protein kinases present in the ovule control the production of highly reactive derivatives of oxygen called [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/reactive-oxygen-species|title=Reactive oxygen species|last=Maejima|first=Yasuhiro|date=2012|website=Science Direct|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ROS levels have been shown via [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] to be at their highest during floral stages when the ovule is the most receptive to pollen tubes, and lowest during times of development and following fertilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    High amounts of ROS activate Calcium ion channels in the pollen tube, causing these channels to take up Calcium ions in large amounts. This increased uptake of calcium causes the pollen tube to rupture, and release its sperm into the ovule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Pistil feeding assays in which plants were fed diphenyl iodonium chloride (DPI) suppressed ROS concentrations in ''Arabidopsis'', which in turn prevented pollen tube rupture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
===Bryophytes===
Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that do not have true vascular tissue and are therefore called "non-vascular plants". Some bryophytes do have specialised tissues for the transport of water; however, since these do not contain lignin, they are not considered true vascular tissue.
{{empty section|date=January 2015}}

===Ferns===
A fern is a member of a group of roughly 12,000 species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular (i.e. having water-conducting vessels). They have stems and leaves, like other vascular plants. Most ferns have what are called fiddleheads that expand into fronds, which are each delicately divided.
{{empty section|date=January 2015}}

===Gymnosperms===
The gymnosperms are a group of seed producing plants that includes conifers, [[Cycad]]s, [[Ginkgo]], and [[Gnetales]]. The term "gymnosperm" comes from the Greek composite word γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός gymnos, "naked" and σπέρμα sperma, "seed"), meaning "naked seeds", after the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilised state). Their naked condition stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, often modified to form cones, or at the end of short stalks as in Ginkgo.

{{main article|Double fertilisation}}

After being fertilised, the ovary starts to swell and develop into the [[fruit]].&lt;ref name="facts_and_practice_for_a_level"&gt;{{cite book  |last1=Johnstone |first1=Adam |title=Biology: facts &amp; practice for A level |date= |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=  |isbn=0-19-914766-3 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; With multi-seeded fruits, multiple grains of pollen are necessary for syngamy with each ovule.  The growth of the pollen tube is controlled by the vegetative (or tube) cytoplasm. Hydrolytic [[enzymes]] are secreted by the pollen tube that digest the female tissue as the tube grows down the stigma and style; the digested tissue is used as a nutrient source for the pollen tube as it grows. During pollen tube growth towards the ovary, the generative nucleus divides to produce two separate sperm nuclei (haploid number of chromosomes)&lt;ref name="handbook_of_plant_science"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of plant science |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley |location=Chichester, West Sussex, England |isbn=978-0-470-05723-0 |page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a growing pollen tube therefore contains three separate nuclei, two sperm and one tube.&lt;ref name="biology_today_a01"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirk |first1=David |last2=Starr |first2=Cecie |title=Biology today |year=1975 |publisher=CRM |location=Del Mar, Calif. |isbn=978-0-394-31093-0 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sperms are interconnected and dimorphic, the large one, in a number of plants, is also linked to the tube nucleus and the interconnected sperm and the tube nucleus form the "male germ unit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raghavan |first1=Valayamghat |title=Double fertilization: embryo and endosperm development in flowering plant |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-540-27791-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Double fertilization|Double fertilisation]] is the process in [[angiosperms]] (flowering plants) in which two [[sperm]] from each pollen tube fertilise two [[cell (biology)|cells]] in a female [[gametophyte]] (sometimes called an embryo sac) that is inside an ovule. After the pollen tube enters the gametophyte, the pollen tube nucleus disintegrates and the two sperm cells are released; one of the two sperm cells ''fertilises'' the egg cell (at the bottom of the gametophyte near the micropyle), forming a [[diploid]] (2n) [[zygote]]. This is the point when fertilisation actually occurs; pollination and fertilisation are two separate processes. The nucleus of the other sperm cell fuses with two haploid polar nuclei (contained in the central cell) in the centre of the gametophyte. The resulting cell is [[triploid]] (3n). This triploid cell divides through [[mitosis]] and forms the [[endosperm]], a [[nutrient]]-rich [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], inside the [[seed]].

The two central-cell maternal nuclei (polar nuclei) that contribute to the endosperm arise by mitosis from the single meiotic product that also gave rise to the egg. Therefore, maternal contribution to the genetic constitution of the triploid endosperm is double that of the embryo.

One primitive species of flowering plant, ''[[Nuphar|Nuphar polysepala]]'', has endosperm that is diploid, resulting from the fusion of a sperm with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm linages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.&lt;ref name=Friedman2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00257.x |pmid=12683519 |title=Modularity of the Angiosperm Female Gametophyte and Its Bearing on the Early Evolution of Endosperm in Flowering Plants |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=216–30 |year=2003 |last1=Friedman |first1=William E |last2=Williams |first2=Joseph H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many plants, the development of the flesh of the fruit is proportional to the percentage of fertilised ovules. For example, with [[watermelon]], about a thousand grains of pollen must be delivered and spread evenly on the three lobes of the stigma to make a normal sized and shaped fruit.

Cross-fertilisation and self-fertilisation represent different strategies with differing benefits and costs.  An estimated 48.7% of plant species are either dioecious or self-incompatible obligate out-crossers.&lt;ref name="pmid16817548"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Igic B, Kohn JR |title=The distribution of plant mating systems: study bias against obligately outcrossing species |journal=Evolution |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=1098–103 |year=2006 |pmid=16817548 |doi= 10.1554/05-383.1|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also estimated that about 42% of flowering plants exhibit a mixed mating system in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodwillie C, Kalisz S, Eckert CG | year = 2005 | title = The evolutionary enigma of mixed mating systems in plants: Occurrence, theoretical explanations, and empirical evidence | url = | journal = Annu.

In the most common kind of mixed mating system, individual plants produce a single type of flower and fruits may contain self-fertilised, out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types.  The transition from cross-fertilisation to self-fertilisation is the most common evolutionary transition in plants, and has occurred repeatedly in many independent lineages.&lt;ref name="pmid23595268"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.0133 |pmid=23595268 |pmc=3652455 |title=Evolutionary consequences of self-fertilization in plants |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=280 |issue=1760 |pages=20130133 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=S.

===Self-Pollination===
{{main article|Self-pollination}}{{see also|Cleistogamy|Autogamy}}
Under circumstances where [[pollinator]]s and/or mates are rare, self-fertilisation offers the advantage of [[Reproductive success|reproductive assurance]].&lt;ref name="pmid23595268" /&gt;  Self-fertilisation can therefore result in improved colonisation ability. In some species, self-fertilisation has persisted over many generations.  ''[[Capsella rubella]]'' is a self-fertilisating species that became self-compatible 50,000 to 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid24068948"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003754 |pmid=24068948 |pmc=3772084 |title=Genomic Identification of Founding Haplotypes Reveals the History of the Selfing Species Capsella rubella |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=e1003754 |year=2013 |last1=Brandvain |first1=Yaniv |last2=Slotte |first2=Tanja |last3=Hazzouri |first3=Khaled M |last4=Wright |first4=Stephen I |last5=Coop |first5=Graham }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is a predominantly self-fertilising plant with an [[Allogamy|out-crossing]] rate in the wild of less than 0.3%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = RJ | last2 = Gomes | first2 = MF | year = 1989 | title = Population genetic structure and outcrossing rate of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

Consequently, one might expect self-fertilisation to be replaced in nature by an ameiotic asexual form of reproduction that would be less costly.  However the actual persistence of meiosis and self-fertilisation as a form of reproduction in long-established self-fertilising plants may be related to the immediate benefit of efficient [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|recombinational repair]] of DNA damage during formation of germ cells provided by meiosis at each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.5772/25117 |doi-access=free |chapter=Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair |title=DNA Repair |year=2011 |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Bernstein |first2=Carol |last3=Michod |first3=Richard E. |editor-first=Inna |editor-last=Kruman |isbn=978-953-307-697-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fertilisation in animals ==
{{see also|Sexual reproduction in animals|Animal sexual behaviour}}
The mechanics behind fertilisation has been studied extensively in sea urchins and mice.  This research addresses the question of how the [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and the appropriate egg find each other and the question of how only one sperm gets into the egg and delivers its contents. There are three steps to fertilisation that ensure species-specificity:

# Chemotaxis
# Sperm activation/acrosomal reaction
# Sperm/egg adhesion

=== Internal vs. external ===
Consideration as to whether an animal (more specifically a vertebrate) uses [[Internal fertilization|internal]] or [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] is often dependent on the method of birth. Oviparous animals laying eggs with thick calcium shells, such as [[chickens]], or thick leathery shells generally reproduce via internal fertilisation so that the sperm fertilises the egg without having to pass through the thick, protective, tertiary layer of the egg. [[Ovoviviparity|Ovoviviparous]] and [[viviparity|viviparous]] animals also use internal fertilisation. It is important to note that although some organisms reproduce via [[amplexus]], they may still use internal fertilisation, as with some salamanders. Advantages to internal fertilisation include: minimal waste of gametes; greater chance of individual egg fertilisation, relatively "longer" time period of egg protection, and selective fertilisation; many females have the ability to store sperm for extended periods of time and can fertilise their eggs at their own desire.

Oviparous animals producing eggs with thin tertiary membranes or no membranes at all, on the other hand, use external fertilisation methods. Advantages to external fertilisation include: minimal contact and transmission of bodily fluids; decreasing the risk of disease transmission, and greater genetic variation (especially during broadcast spawning external fertilisation methods).

=== Sea urchins ===
[[File:Acrosome reaction diagram en.svg|thumb|400px|Acrosome reaction on a sea urchin cell.]]

Sperm find the eggs via [[chemotaxis]], a type of ligand/receptor interaction. Resact is a 14 amino acid peptide purified from the jelly coat of ''A. punctulata'' that attracts the migration of sperm.

After finding the egg, the sperm penetrates the [[egg jelly|jelly coat]] through a process called sperm activation. In another ligand/receptor interaction, an oligosaccharide component of the egg binds and activates a receptor on the sperm and causes the [[acrosomal reaction]]. The acrosomal vesicles of the sperm fuse with the plasma membrane and are released. In this process, molecules bound to the acrosomal vesicle membrane, such as bindin, are exposed on the surface of the sperm.  These contents digest the jelly coat and eventually the vitelline membrane. In addition to the release of acrosomal vesicles, there is explosive polymerisation of [[actin]] to form a thin spike at the head of the sperm called the [[acrosomal process]].

The sperm binds to the egg through another ligand reaction between receptors on the [[vitelline membrane]]. The sperm surface protein bindin, binds to a receptor on the vitelline membrane identified as EBR1.

Fusion of the plasma membranes of the sperm and egg are likely mediated by bindin. At the site of contact, fusion causes the formation of a [[fertilization cone|fertilisation cone]].

=== Mammals ===
[[Mammal]]s internally fertilise through [[copulation]]. After a male [[male ejaculation|ejaculates]], many sperm move to the upper vagina (via contractions from the vagina) through the [[cervix]] and across the length of the [[uterus]] to meet the ovum. In cases where fertilisation occurs, the female usually [[ovulation|ovulates]] during a period that extends from hours before copulation to a few days after; therefore, in most mammals it is more common for ejaculation to precede ovulation than vice versa.

The [[capacitation|capacitated]] spermatozoon and the oocyte meet and interact in the ''ampulla'' of the [[fallopian tube]]. Rheotaxis, thermotaixs and chemotaxis are known mechanisms in guiding sperm towards the egg during the final stage of sperm migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1530/JOE-16-0302 |pmid=27875265 |title=Oviduct: Roles in fertilization and early embryo development |journal=Journal of Endocrinology |volume=232 |issue=1 |pages=R1–R26 |year=2016 |last1=Li |first1=Shuai |last2=Winuthayanon |first2=Wipawee }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spermatozoa respond (see [[Sperm thermotaxis]]) to the temperature gradient of ~2&amp;nbsp;°C between the oviduct and the ampulla,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mce.2006.03.027 |pmid=16672171 |title=Sperm thermotaxis |journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology |volume=252 |issue=1–2 |pages=115–9 |year=2006 |last1=Bahat |first1=Anat |last2=Eisenbach |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chemotaxis#Eukaryotic chemotaxis|chemotactic]] gradients of [[progesterone]] have been confirmed as the signal emanating from the [[cumulus oophorus]] cells surrounding rabbit and human oocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008211 |pmid=19997608 |pmc=2782141 |title=Molecular Mechanism for Human Sperm Chemotaxis Mediated by Progesterone |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=e8211 |year=2009 |last1=Teves |first1=Maria E |last2=Guidobaldi |first2=Hector A |last3=Uñates |first3=Diego R |last4=Sanchez |first4=Raul |last5=Miska |first5=Werner |last6=Publicover |first6=Stephen J |last7=Morales Garcia |first7=Aduén A |last8=Giojalas |first8=Laura C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacitated and hyperactivated sperm respond to these gradients by changing their behaviour and moving towards the cumulus-oocyte complex.

The [[zona pellucida]], a thick layer of extracellular matrix that surrounds the egg and is similar to the role of the vitelline membrane in sea urchins, binds with the sperm. Unlike sea urchins, the sperm binds to the egg before the acrosomal reaction. [[ZP3]], a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida, is responsible for egg/sperm adhesion in mice. The receptor [[galactosyltransferase]] (GalT) binds to the N-acetylglucosamine residues on the ZP3 and is important for binding with the sperm and activating the acrosome reaction. ZP3 is sufficient though unnecessary for sperm/egg binding. Two additional sperm receptors exist: a 250kD protein that binds to an oviduct secreted protein, and SED1, which independently binds to the zona.  After the acrosome reaction, the sperm is believed to remain bound to the zona pellucida through exposed ZP2 receptors. These receptors are unknown in mice but have been identified in guinea pigs.

In mammals, the binding of the spermatozoon to the GalT initiates the [[acrosome reaction]]. This process releases the [[hyaluronidase]] that digests the matrix of [[hyaluronic acid]] in the vestments around the oocyte.  Fusion between the oocyte [[plasma membrane]]s and sperm follows and allows the sperm [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], the typical [[centriole]], and atypical [[centriole]] that is attached to the [[flagellum]], but not the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]], to enter the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-04678-8 |title=A novel atypical sperm centriole is functional during human fertilization |journal=Nature Communications |volume=9 |year=2018 |last1=Fishman |first1=Emily L |last2=Jo |first2=Kyoung |last3=Nguyen |first3=Quynh P.

The egg "[[egg activation|activates]]" itself upon fusing with a single sperm cell and thereby changes its cell membrane to prevent fusion with other sperm. [[Zinc]] atoms are released during this activation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/human-eggs-spark-moment-fertilization{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Commons|Fertilization#Mammalian fertilization|Mammalian fertilization}}
This process ultimately leads to the formation of a [[diploid]] cell called a [[zygote]].  The zygote divides to form a [[blastocyst]] and, upon entering the uterus, [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the endometrium, beginning [[pregnancy]]. Embryonic implantation not in the [[uterus|uterine]] wall results in an [[ectopic pregnancy]] that can kill the mother.


In such animals as rabbits, coitus induces ovulation by stimulating the release of the pituitary hormone gonadotropin; this release greatly increases the likelihood of pregnancy.

==== Humans ====
[[File:Human Fertilization.png|thumb|Fertilisation in humans. The sperm and ovum unite through fertilisation, creating a zygote that (over the course of 8-9 days) implants in the uterine wall, where it resides for nine months.]]
{{main article|Human fertilisation}}

The term ''conception'' commonly refers to fertilisation, which is the successful fusion of gametes to form a new organism.  Its use 'conception' by some to refer to implantation makes it a subject of [[beginning of pregnancy controversy|semantic arguments about the beginning of pregnancy]], typically in the context of the [[abortion]] debate.
&lt;!-- In a statement by the [[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]] (AAPLOG), regarding the controversial [[morning-after pill]], AAPLOG claims:--&gt;
&lt;!-- NOTE: This is a quote for a developing section, if you have a problem with it, hide the text (like this text is) but don't remove it, until I can rework it. Sinreg, --&gt;
&lt;!--:"[Again,] one must be careful of the terminology. Many now speak of "conception" as that moment when the human blastocyst, the early ball of approximately 100 cells, implants in the mother’s uterus (womb).  The time from actual fertilisation (egg and sperm unite in the Fallopian Tube) until implantation, a period of about 7-10 days, is ignored, even though no genetic change occurs in the cells during this time period.  Many family planning specialists who have supported the terminology change can thus rationalize that the destruction of the human embryo between fertilisation and implantation should be labeled "contraception", rather than "early abortion".--&gt;
Upon [[gastrulation]], which occurs around 16 days after fertilisation, the implanted blastocyst develops three germ layers, the endoderm, the ectoderm and the mesoderm, and the genetic code of the father becomes fully involved in the development of the embryo; later twinning is impossible.  Additionally, interspecies hybrids survive only until gastrulation and cannot further develop.
However, some human developmental biology literature refers to the ''[[conceptus]]'' and such medical literature refers to the "products of conception" as the post-implantation embryo and its surrounding membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Moore, K. L.  |author2=T. V. M. Persaud |year=2003 |title=The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology |publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |isbn=0-7216-6974-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "conception" is not usually used in scientific literature because of its variable definition and connotation.

Insects in different groups, including the [[Odonata]] ([[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]]) and the [[Hymenoptera]] ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s) practise delayed fertilisation. Anong the Odonata, females may mate with multiple males, and store sperm until the eggs are laid. The male may hover above the female during egg-laying (oviposition) to prevent her from mating with other males and replacing his sperm; in some groups such as the darters, the male continues to grasp the female with his claspers during egg-laying, the pair flying around in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dijkstra |first=Klaas-Douwe B. |title=Field Guide to the Dragonflies of Britain and Europe |year=2006 |publisher=British Wildlife Publishing |isbn=0-9531399-4-8|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among social Hymenoptera, [[honeybee]] queens mate only on mating flights, in a short period lasting some days; a queen may mate with eight or more [[drone (bee)|drones]]. She then stores the sperm for the rest of her life, perhaps for five years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waldbauer |first1=Gilbert |title=The Birder's Bug Book|date=1998 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agriculture and Consumer Protection|title=Beekeeping in Africa: Colony life and social organization|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0104e/t0104e05.htm|publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--other bees ...--&gt;

==Fertilisation in fungi==
In many [[fungi]] (except [[chytrid]]s), as in some protists, fertilisation is a two step process. First, the cytoplasms of the two gamete cells fuse (called [[plasmogamy]]), producing a [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] or [[Heterokaryon|heterokaryotic]] cell with multiple nuclei. This cell may then divide to produce dikaryotic or heterokaryotic [[hyphae]]. The second step of fertilisation is [[karyogamy]], the fusion of the nuclei to form a diploid zygote.

In [[chytrid]] fungi, fertilisation occurs in a single step with the fusion of gametes, as in animals and plants.

==Fertilisation in protists==

===Fertilisation in protozoa===
There are three types of fertilisation processes in protozoa:&lt;ref&gt;''Fertilization in protozoa and metazoan animals: cellular and molecular aspects.'' Juan J. Tarín; Antonio Cano (eds.). Springer-Verlag, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

* gamontogamy.

===Fertilisation in algae===
Fertilisation in algae occurs by [[binary fission]]. The [[pseudopodia]] is first withdrawn and the nucleus starts dividing. When the cytoplasm is divided, the cytoplasm is also divided into two equal parts for each daughter cell. Two daughter cells are produced by one parent cell. It involves the process of [[mitosis]].{{empty section|date=September 2015}}

===Fertilisation in fungi-like protists===
{{empty section|date=March 2015}}

== Fertilisation and genetic recombination ==
[[Meiosis]] results in a random segregation of the genes that each parent contributes. Each parent organism is usually identical save for a fraction of their genes; each [[gamete]] is therefore genetically unique.  At fertilisation, parental [[chromosome]]s combine. In [[human]]s, (2²²)² = 17.6x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; chromosomally different [[zygote]]s are possible for the non-sex chromosomes, even assuming no [[chromosomal crossover]].  If crossover occurs once, then on average (4²²)² = 309x10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; genetically different zygotes are possible for every couple, not considering that crossover events can take place at most points along each chromosome.  The X and Y chromosomes undergo no crossover events{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and are therefore excluded from the calculation.  The [[mitochondrial DNA]] is only inherited from the maternal parent.

==Parthenogenesis==
{{main article|parthenogenesis}}
Organisms that normally reproduce sexually can also reproduce via [[parthenogenesis]], wherein an unfertilised female gamete produces viable offspring. These offspring may be clones of the mother, or in some cases genetically differ from her but inherit only part of her DNA. Parthenogenesis occurs in many plants and animals and may be induced in others through a chemical or electrical stimulus to the egg cell. In 2004, Japanese researchers led by [[Tomohiro Kono]] succeeded after 457 attempts to merge the [[ovum|ova]] of two mice by blocking certain proteins that would normally prevent the possibility; the resulting embryo normally developed into a mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02402 |pmid=15103378 |laysummary=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0421_040421_whoneedsmales.html |laysource=National Geographic |laydate=2004-04-21 |title=Birth of parthenogenetic mice that can develop to adulthood |journal=Nature |volume=428 |issue=6985 |pages=860–4 |year=2004 |last1=Kono |first1=Tomohiro |last2=Obata |first2=Yayoi |last3=Wu |first3=Quiong |last4=Niwa |first4=Katsutoshi |last5=Ono |first5=Yukiko |last6=Yamamoto |first6=Yuji |last7=Park |first7=Eun Sung |last8=Seo |first8=Jeong-Sun |last9=Ogawa |first9=Hidehiko }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allogamy and autogamy==
[[Allogamy]], which is also known as cross-fertilisation, refers to the fertilisation of an egg cell from one individual with the male gamete of another.

Autogamy which is also known as self-fertilisation, occurs in such hermaphroditic organisms as plants and flatworms; therein, two gametes from one individual fuse.

==Other variants of bisexual reproduction==

[[Gynogenesis]]: A sperm stimulates the egg to develop without fertilisation or syngamy. The sperm may enter the egg.

[[Hybridogenesis]]: One genome is eliminated to produce haploid eggs.

[[Canina meiosis]]: (sometimes called "permanent odd polyploidy") one genome is transmitted in the Mendelian fashion, others are transmitted clonally.

==Benefits of cross-fertilisation==
{{main article|Allogamy|Heterosis}}
The major benefit of cross-fertilisation is generally thought to be the avoidance of [[inbreeding depression]]. [[Charles Darwin]], in his 1876 book ''[[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'' (pages 466-467) summed up his findings in the following way.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin CR (1876).  The effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom. London: John Murray. http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881-Worms-CrossandSelfFertilisation-F1249/1876-F1249.html see page 466-467&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“It has been shown in the present volume that the offspring from the union of two distinct individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have an immense advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigour and fertility over the self-fertilised offspring from one of the same parents. And this fact is amply sufficient to account for the development of the sexual elements, that is, for the genesis of the two sexes.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, it is thought by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0340519 |pmid=16856849 |title=Why have sex? The population genetics of sex and recombination |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=519–22 |year=2006 |last1=Otto |first1=S.P |last2=Gerstein |first2=A.C }}&lt;/ref&gt; that a long-term advantage of out-crossing in nature is increased genetic variability that promotes adaptation and/or avoidance of extinction (see [[Genetic variability]]).

'''Fibre cement''' is a composite building and construction material, used mainly in [[roofing material|roofing]] and [[facade]] products because of its [[strength of materials|strength]] and durability. One common use is in [[fiber cement siding]] on buildings.

==Material description==
The term "cement" originates from the [[Latin]] word "''Caementum''", which signifies chopped stone. Cement describes a substance which will [[Chemical reaction|react chemically]] with water and develop into a material hard as stone.

In fibre cement there is a fibre reinforcement, which contributes to making the fibre-cement material even stronger. Together with a carefully planned production process, fibre cement makes it possible to develop strong and long lasting [[construction materials]].&lt;ref name="Eternit"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today fibre cement is considered as a material physically suited for construction products such as cladding and roofing. It is primarily due to its function, performance and commercial value.&lt;ref name="Eternit2"&gt;{{cite web
    | url=http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/article/fibre_cement_cladding

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fibre cement flat sheet classified, by accredited laboratories, as Category A according to BS EN 12467: 2004 Fibre-cement flat sheets – Product specification and test methods are sheets which are intended for applications where they may be subject to heat, high moisture and severe frost. While the best possible Reaction to Fire Classifications are A1 (construction applications) and A1Fl (flooring applications) respectively, both of which mean "non-combustible" according to EN 13501-1: 2007, as classified by a notified laboratory in Europe, some fibre cement boards only come with Fire Classification of A2 (limited combustibility) or even lower classifications, if they are tested at all.

==Material history==
Fibre-reinforced cement-products were invented in the late 19th century by the Austrian [[Ludwig Hatschek]]. He mixed 90% [[cement]] and 10% [[asbestos]] fibres with water and ran it through a [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] machine, forming strong thin sheets. Originally, the reinforcing fibres were of asbestos and the material was commonly used as [[siding]] in house buildings due to its low cost, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], water tightness, light weight, and other useful properties.

In the 1970s it became widely acknowledged that exposure to asbestos is harmful to [[health]], being directly related to a number of life-threatening diseases including, [[asbestosis]], [[pleural|pleural mesothelioma]] (lung) and [[peritoneal mesothelioma]] (abdomen). Consequently, asbestos use was progressively prohibited and safer [[fibre]] alternatives were developed, principally [[cellulose fiber|cellulose]], to allow continued exploitation of the widely acknowledged advantages of fibre cement.

Fibre cement products were amongst the last materials available to have contained large quantities of asbestos. The asbestos fibres are intimately bound to the cement matrix and were considered to be immobilized in the cement and therefore less prone to be released in the environment, [[aerosol|suspended]] in the air, and [[inhalation|inhaled]] in the [[lung]] than in other materials or applications, such as [[thermal insulation]] or [[flocking (texture)|flocking]], in which loose asbestos fibres were used. However, asbestos fibres are inevitably released during [[machining]] of the fibre-cement products, and by long-term erosion of the material after it has been exposed to atmospheric [[weathering]] and [[wind]], which causes the cement to [[concrete degradation|degrade]]. [[Occupational health]] concerns and the protection of workers in the fibre-cement [[factory|factories]] have finally led to the progressive elimination of asbestos from these products.&lt;ref name="Eternit" /&gt;

Users of fibre cement boards who seek high performance and reliable green building materials should source products that have been tested by accredited laboratories and proven to be 100% free from asbestos or other harmful materials such as sepiolite, inorganic fibre or formaldehyde.

==Material usage==
Fibre cement is a main component of long-lasting [[building material]]s. The main application areas are roofing and [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]]. The list below gives some common applications.

'''Internal cladding:'''
* Wet room applications – [[tile]] [[cement board|backer board]]s
* [[Fire protection]]
* [[Partition wall]]s
* [[Window sill]]s
* [[Ceiling]]s and [[floor]]s

'''External cladding:'''
* Flat sheets as base and/or architectural facing
* Flat sheets for e.g. wind shields, wall copings, and soffits
* [[wikt:corrugated|Corrugated]] sheets
* Slates as architectural full and partial facing
* Underroof
* [[Plank (wood)|Plank]]s

'''Roofing:'''
* [[Slate]]s
* Corrugated sheets

Fibre-cement products have found a wide usage in various sectors of construction: industrial, agricultural, domestic and residential buildings, mainly in roofing and cladding applications, for new constructions and [[Antiques restoration|refurbishment]] projects.

'''Floor sanding''' is the process of removing the top surfaces of a wooden floor by [[sanding]] with abrasive materials.

A variety of floor materials can be sanded, including [[timber]], [[cork (material)|cork]], [[particleboard]], and sometimes [[parquet]]. Some [[Flooring|floors]] are laid and designed for [[sanding]].&lt;ref name="DIY and Home Improve"&gt;{{cite book | title=Newnes all colour reference DIY and home improvement| last=Newnes| date=1984| publisher=Newnes Books| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many old floors are sanded after the previous coverings are removed and suitable wood is found hidden beneath. Floor sanding usually involves three stages: Preparation, sanding, and coating with a protective sealant.

==Machines==
All modern sanding projects are completed with specialized sanding machines. The majority of material is removed by large 220 volt [[belt sander|belt]] or drum sander. Belt sanders are preferred for the continuous sand paper belt design to prevent sanding machine marks in floors. The belt sander was invented by Eugen Laegler in 1969 out of Güglingen, Germany. 90% of the area can be reached with the belt/drum sander. The remaining 10% left such as edges, corners, under cabinets, and [[stairs]], are sanded by an edge sanding machine. A finishing machine known as a multi disc sander or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.

==Process==
Preparation is the first stage of the sanding process. All nails which protrude above the boards are punched down.  Nails can severely damage the sanding machines which are being used. [[Staple (fastener)|Staples]] or [[Thumbtack|tacks]] used to fasten previous coverings (if any) are removed to reduce the possibility of damage. Some brands or types of [[adhesives]] which have been used to secure coverings may need to be removed. Some adhesives clog papers and running gear of the machines used, and some can even make sanding impossible.

After the floor is prepared, the sanding begins. The ''first cut'' is done with coarse-grit papers to remove old coatings and to make the floor flat. The differences in height between the boards are removed. The large sanders are used across the grain of the timber. The most common paper used for the first cut is 40 grit.&lt;ref name="Sanding a Timber Floor. The areas which cannot be reached by the large sanders are sanded by an edger, at the same grit paper as the rest of the floor. If filling of holes or boards is desired this is the stage where this is usually done. 80 grit papers are usually used for the second cut. The belt sander is used inline with the grain of the timber in this cut. A finishing machine is then used to create the final finish. The grit paper used is of personal preference, however 100-150 grit papers are usually used.

The sanded floor is coated with [[polyurethane]], [[oils]], or other sealants.  If it is an oil-based sealant, then it is highly poisonous, having a high volatile organic compound&lt;ref&gt;[[Volatile organic compound]]&lt;/ref&gt; content, so wearing a suitable respirator mask&lt;ref&gt;[[Respirator]]&lt;/ref&gt;  is recommended.

==Issues==
Sanding removes all [[patina]], and can change the character of old floors. The result does not always suit the character of the building.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Sanding old boards sometimes exposes worm eaten cores, effectively ruining the floor's appearance.  This can reduce the sale price, or even cause the floor to require replacement.

Sanding removes material, and timber floors have a limit to how much they can be sanded.

In the [[United Kingdom]] '''[[fuel poverty]]''' is said to occur when, in order to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth, a household needs to spend more than 10% of its income on total fuel use. Adequate warmth is generally defined to be 21&amp;nbsp;°C in the main living room and 18&amp;nbsp;°C in other occupied rooms during daytime hours, with lower temperatures at night, following the recommendations of the [[World Health Organization]]. Fuel poverty is not just about access to heating as the definition of fuel is taken to include all expenditure on domestic energy, including that used for hot water, cooling, lights and appliances. This definition is essentially that first established by Dr Brenda Boardman in her book entitled ''Fuel Poverty'', first published in 1991&lt;ref&gt;B. Boardman, Fuel poverty: from cold homes to affordable warmth, Belhaven Press, London 1991&lt;/ref&gt;, although fuel poverty has been the focus of political action since the early 1970s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog |title=A short history of fuel poverty |date=December 7, 2016 |last=Kennard |first=Harry |url=https://www.harrykennard.com/blog/2016/12/7/a-short-history-of-fuel-poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Other definitions ==
There are, however, a variety of different ways of considering household income when measuring fuel poverty. The UK definition does not, for example, take account of the amount that a household actually spends on fuel, nor the amount available for the household to spend on fuel after other costs have been met.

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government’s preferred definition of household income includes income from housing-related benefits in the calculation of household income.  Other estimates of the extent of fuel poverty exclude benefits from household income. The charity [[National Energy Action]] (NEA) regards both these definitions as unacceptable and believes that disposable income (after the deduction of housing costs) should be used in the definition of fuel poverty.

On 14 March 2011, the [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]] announced he had asked Professor John Hills of the [[London School of Economics]] to lead a review of the fuel poverty definition and target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/hillsfuelpovertyreview |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427130717/http://www.decc.gov.uk/hillsfuelpovertyreview |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interim report of this independent review was published on 19 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/funding-support/fuel-poverty/3226-fuel-poverty-review-interim-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027022144/http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/funding-support/fuel-poverty/3226-fuel-poverty-review-interim-report.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 19 of the interim report, Hill suggests redefining a fuel poor household as one that has required fuel costs that are above the median level, and were they to spend that amount, would be left with a residual income below the official poverty line. No official action has yet been taken on this suggestion.

== Households in fuel poverty ==
In early 2008 it was estimated by [[Energywatch]] that there were around 4.4 million households in fuel poverty in the UK, with just over 3 million in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | author = Tim Webb (The Observer)
  | title = Fury as fuel poverty soars close to a 10-year record
  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/20/utilities.householdbills
  | accessdate = 2008-05-09
| work=The Guardian
| location=London
| date=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was more than double the number in 2003.

2008 saw significant price increases of approximately 45% by energy companies on gas and electric. In early 2009 the companies declared they were to drop their prices, but only a 10% reduction was seen across the board and this did not happen, with the exception of British Gas, until March 31, once the worst of the winter was over. Research from NEA showed that as of March 2009 over 5 million households across the UK were living in fuel poverty.

In April 2011 a [[YouGov]] survey indicated that the number of households in fuel poverty had risen to 6.3 million households, representing approximately 24% of all households in the UK.

The UK Government's 2015 Fuel Poverty Report showed that 4.5 million households, or 17% of UK households, were in fuel poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/468011/Fuel_Poverty_Report_2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304234802/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/468011/Fuel_Poverty_Report_2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Excess winter deaths ==
Excess winter deaths are defined by the [[Office for National Statistics]] as the difference between the number of deaths during the four winter months (December to March) and the average number of deaths during the preceding autumn (August to November) and the following summer (April to July).

Although the phenomenon of excess winter deaths is not unique to the United Kingdom, the incidence is markedly higher than for countries with similar climates and living standards. England has an 18% rise in deaths during the winter, on average, whereas Finland has a 10% increase, Germany and the Netherlands have 11%.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health, 2009 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, excess winter deaths in England and Wales remained generally at around 25,000. For the period of 2007-2008 the number of excess winter deaths was 27,480 of which the Hill reporte estimated that around 10% were caused directly by fuel poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choose.net/money/guide/news/household-energy-fuel-poverty.html |title=How can you tell whether your household is fuel poor? |website=Choose.net |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winter of 2008-2009 the coldest in 10 years, and the Office for National Statistics estimated there were a total of 36,700, an increase of 49% over the previous year, which represents a 23.8% rise in deaths during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Office for National Statistics, Excess winter mortality in England and Wales: 2008/09 (provisional).&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaths from [[hypothermia]] among UK pensioners almost doubled during the 5 years up to 2012, a time when several cold winters combined with largescale increases in energy prices.  

The number of pensioners dying from hypothermia has nearly doubled in five years, a period when a succession of cold winters has been coupled with drastic rises in energy bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Daniel |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2100232/Frozen-death-fuel-bills-soar-Hypothermia-cases-elderly-double-years.html |title=Frozen to death as fuel bills soar: Hypothermia cases among the elderly double in five years |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure to the cold does affect the number of winter deaths‚ but deaths from other cold related causes are very much more common than it is for the cold to kill people directly. In the main these deaths are from respiratory or cardio-vascular ailments. Overall deaths are from heart attacks‚ strokes‚ bronchial and other conditions‚ and may often occur several days after exposure to the cold. Spending too long in the cold will lower the body temperature which can often aggravate circulatory diseases‚ which can lead to strokes and heart attacks or respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis or pneumonia.

Under the [[Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006]] the Government is obliged to report annual progress in cutting the number of households in which one or more persons are living in fuel poverty.

== Action programmes ==
The UK's main programme targeting fuel poverty is the [[Energy Company Obligation]].

The Home Heat Helpline - 0800 33 66 99 - can provide assistance to the following vulnerable groups:
* Advice on social tariffs  – typically a 20% saving
* Access to the Priority Service Register, with free annual gas appliance safety checks, passwords for official gas and electricity-related callers. Third party, Braille, large print and talking billing
* Grants for free home insulation regardless of who owns the property and no means testing for the over 70s. Absolute right for them to receive free cavity wall and loft insulation or free top-ups to modern standards. Same help to all households in receipt of [[Attendance Allowance]], [[Disability Living Allowance]] or [[Employment and Support Allowance]] ([[Incapacity Benefit]]) [[Single Parent Allowance]] or households with young children with an annual income of less than £14,600.
* Flexible payment options for customers in fuel debt
* A disconnection safety net, ensuring  no vulnerable customer will be knowingly disconnected

The Home Heat Helpline also recognises that those most in need of help are often those least able to access it so the helpline now accepts third party applications.

==Parliamentary Inquiry==
The UK Parliamentary Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change recently launched an inquiry on home energy efficiency in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/energy-and-climate-change-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/home-energy-efficiency/ |title=Home energy efficiency and demand reduction inquiry - UK Parliament |website=Parliament.uk |date=2015-09-15 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice II''' is a [[rhombohedral]] crystalline form of [[ice]] with a highly ordered structure. It is formed from [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]] by compressing it at a temperature of 198 [[Kelvin|K]] at 300 [[MPa]] or by decompressing [[ice V]]. When heated it undergoes transformation to [[ice III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_ii.html |title=Ice-two structure |author=Chaplin, Martin |date=October 18, 2014 |work=Water Structure and Science |publisher=[[London South Bank University]] |accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary [[water]] ice is known as [[Ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]],  (in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature).  Different types of ice, from ice II to [[ice XVI]], have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures. It is thought that the cores of [[icy moon]]s like [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] may be made of ice II.

==History==
The properties of ice II were first described and recorded by [[Gustav Heinrich Johann Apollon Tammann]] in 1900 during his experiments with ice under high pressure and low temperatures. Having produced ice III, Tammann then tried condensing the ice at a temperature between {{convert|-70|and|-80|C|K F}} under {{convert|200|MPa|atm|abbr=on|comma=}} of pressure. Tammann noted that in this state ice II was denser than he had observed ice III to be. He also found that both types of ice can be kept at normal [[atmospheric pressure]] in a stable condition so long as the temperature is kept at that of [[liquid air]], which slows the change in conformation back to ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hobbs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hobbs |first=Peter V. |date=May 6, 2010 |title=Ice Physics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Is6AwAAQBAJ&amp;dq |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=61–70 |isbn=9780199587711 |accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later experiments by Bridgman in 1912, it was shown that the difference in volume between ice II and ice III was in the range of {{convert|0.0001|m3/kg|cuin/lb|abbr=on|comma=gaps}}. This difference hadn't been discovered by Tammann due to the small change and was why he had been unable to determine an [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|equilibrium curve]] between the two. The curve showed that the structural change from ice III to ice II was more likely to happen if the medium had previously been in the structural conformation of ice II. However, if a sample of ice III that had never been in the ice II state was obtained, it could be supercooled even below −70&amp;nbsp;°C without it changing into ice II. Conversely, however, any superheating of ice II was not possible in regards to retaining the same form. Bridgman found that the equilibrium curve between ice II and [[ice IV]] was much the same as with ice III, having the same stability properties and small volume change. The curve between ice II and [[ice V]] was extremely different, however, with the curve's bubble being essentially a straight line and the volume difference being almost always {{convert|0.0000545|m3/kg|cuin/lb|abbr=on|comma=gaps}}.&lt;ref name="Hobbs"/&gt;

The '''joule''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|uː|l}}; symbol: J) is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]] of [[energy]] in the [[International System of Units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is equal to the energy transferred to (or [[work (physics)|work]] done on) an object when a [[force]] of one [[Newton (unit)|newton]] acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one [[metre]] (1 newton metre or N&amp;sdot;m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric [[current (electricity)|current]] of one [[ampere]] passes through a [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] of one [[ohm]] for one second. It is named after the English physicist [[James Prescott Joule]] (1818–1889).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060413141420/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/joule American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], Online Edition (2009). Houghton Mifflin Co., hosted by [https://web.archive.org/web/20010502171832/http://education.yahoo.com/ Yahoo! Education].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary'', Second College Edition (1985). Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Physics'', Fifth Edition (1997). McGraw-Hill, Inc., p. 224. &lt;/ref&gt;

In terms firstly of base [[International System of Units|SI units]] and then in terms of other SI units:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{J} = \frac{\text{kg}{\cdot}\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2} = \text{N}{\cdot}\text{m} = \text{Pa}{\cdot}\text{m}^3 = \text{W}{\cdot}\text{s} = \text{C}{\cdot}\text{V},&lt;/math&gt;

where kg is the [[kilogram]], m is the [[metre]], s is the [[second]], N is the [[newton (unit)|newton]], Pa is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], W is the [[watt]], C is the [[coulomb]], and V is the [[volt]].

One joule can also be defined as:
* The work required to move an [[electric charge]] of one coulomb through an [[Voltage|electrical potential difference]] of one volt, or one ''coulomb-volt'' (C&amp;sdot;V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.
* The work required to produce one watt of [[power (physics)|power]] for one second, or one ''watt-second'' (W&amp;sdot;s) (compare [[kilowatt-hour]]{{snd}} 3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.

==Usage==
{{SI unit lowercase|James Prescott Joule|joule|J}}

==Confusion with newton metre==
{{Main article|newton metre}}
In [[mechanics]], the concept of [[force]] (in some direction) has a close analog in the concept of [[torque]] (about some angle):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Linear   !! Angular
|-
| Force    || Torque
|-
| [[Mass]] || [[Moment of inertia]]
|-
| Displacement 
(sometimes position)
| Angle
|}

A result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the [[newton metre]], which works out [[algebra]]ically to have the same [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] as the joule. But they are not interchangeable. The [[CGPM]] has given the unit of [[energy]] the name ''joule'', but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton metre (N&amp;sdot;m) – a compound name derived from its constituent parts.&lt;ref name=BIPM2/&gt; The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.&lt;ref name=BIPM2/&gt;

The distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] – the [[dot product]] of a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] force and a vector displacement. By contrast, torque is a vector – the [[cross product]] of a distance vector and a force vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;E = \tau \theta\ ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is energy, ''τ'' is (the [[magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vector space|vector magnitude]] of) torque, and ''θ'' is the angle swept (in [[radian]]s). Since radians are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.

== Practical examples ==
One joule in everyday life represents approximately:
* The energy required to lift a medium sized tomato up {{convert|1|m}} (assume the tomato has a mass of approximately {{convert|100|g}}).
* The energy released when that same tomato falls back down one metre.
* The energy required to accelerate a 1&amp;nbsp;kg mass at 1 m&amp;sdot;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; through a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;m.
* The [[heat]] required to raise the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;g of water by 0.24&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/heat-units-d_664.html |title=Units of Heat – BTU, Calorie and Joule |publisher=Engineeringtoolbox.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (approximately 17&amp;nbsp;ms).&lt;ref&gt;This is called the [[basal metabolic rate]]. It corresponds to about {{convert|1200|kcal|kJ|abbr=on|order=flip}} per day. The kilocalorie (symbol kcal) is also known as the [[calorie|dietary calorie]]. "At rest" means awake but inactive.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[kinetic energy]] of a 50&amp;nbsp;kg human moving very slowly ({{convert|0.2|m/s|km/h|abbr=on|disp=or}}).
* The kinetic energy of a 56&amp;nbsp;g tennis ball moving at {{convert|6|m/s|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ristinen |first=Robert A. |first2=Jack J. |last2=Kraushaar |title=Energy and the Environment |edition=2nd |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2006 |isbn=0-471-73989-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The kinetic energy of an object with mass 1&amp;nbsp;kg moving at {{radic|2}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8776;&amp;nbsp;1.4&amp;nbsp;m/s.
* The amount of electricity required to light a 1&amp;nbsp;W [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] for 1&amp;nbsp;s.

Since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kW&amp;sdot;h (kilowatt-hour), a kW&amp;sdot;h is thus 1000&amp;nbsp;W &amp;times; 3600&amp;nbsp;s = 3.6&amp;nbsp;MJ (megajoules).

==Watt second==
A '''watt second''' (also '''watt-second''', symbol '''W&amp;nbsp;s''' or '''W·s''') is a [[derived unit]] of [[energy]] equivalent to the joule.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=39–40, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The watt-second is the energy equivalent to the power of one [[watt]] sustained for one [[second]].  While the watt-second is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning, there are some contexts in which the term "watt-second" is used instead of "joule".

===Photography===
{{See also|Guide number}}
In photography, the unit for [[Flash (photography)|flashes]] is the watt-second. A flash can be rated in watt-seconds (e.g. 300&amp;nbsp;W⋅s) or in joules (different names for the same thing), but historically the term "watt-second" has been used and continues to be used. An on-camera flash, using a 1000 [[farad|microfarad]] capacitor at 300 [[volt]]s, would be 45 watt-seconds.  Studio flashes, using larger capacitors and higher voltages, are in the 200–2000 watt-second range. 

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Energy of a flash in joules or watt-seconds} = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot \text{capacitance of the storage capacitor in farads} \cdot \text{working voltage}^2&lt;/math&gt;

The energy rating a flash is given is not a reliable benchmark for its light output because there are numerous factors that affect the energy conversion efficiency. For example, the construction of the tube will affect the efficiency, and the use of reflectors and filters will change the usable light output towards the subject. Some companies specify their products in "true" watt-seconds, and some specify their products in "nominal" watt-seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imaginginfo.com/print/Studio-Photography/What-Is-A-Watt-Second/3$1043|title=What Is A Watt Second?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Salalah Oman.jpg|thumb|right|300px|During the khareef the mountains around [[Salalah]] and [[Al-Ghaydah]] are rainsoaked and shrouded in fog]] 

'''''Khareef''''' ({{lang-ar|خريف}}, autumn) is a [[Varieties of Arabic|colloquial Arabic]] term used in southern [[Oman]], southeastern [[Yemen]], southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Sudan]] for the southeastern [[monsoon]]. The monsoon affects [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah Governorate]]s from about June to early September. Towns such as [[Salalah]] depend upon the khareef for water supply. An annual Khareef festival is held in Salalah to celebrate the monsoon and attracts tourists.

The Khareef leads to a unique ecological habitat along the coast known as the [[Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llewellyn-Smith|first1=Robert|title=Western Asia: Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1302|website=WWF|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3572">'''Lean body mass''' (LBM) is a component of [[body composition]], calculated by subtracting [[body fat]] weight from total [[body weight]]: total body weight is lean plus fat. In equations:
:LBM&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BW&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;BF
::Lean body mass equals body weight minus body fat
:LBM&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;BF&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BW
::Lean body mass plus body fat equals body weight

The percentage of total body mass that is lean is usually not quoted – it would typically be 60–90%. Instead, the [[body fat percentage]], which is the complement, is computed, and is typically 10–40%. The lean body mass (LBM) has been described as an index superior to total body weight for prescribing proper levels of medications and for assessing metabolic disorders, as body fat is less relevant for metabolism. LBW is used by anesthesiologists to dose certain medications. For example, due to the concern of postoperative opioid-induced ventilatory depression in the obese patient, opioids are best based on lean body weight. The induction dose of propofol should also be based on LBW &lt;ref&gt;''Stoelting's Anesthesia and Co-Existing Disease, 6th Edition. Pages 329-330.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimation==
LBM is usually estimated using mathematical formulas. Several formulas exist, having different utility for different purposes. For example, the Boer formula is method of choice for LBM estimation to calculate the dose given in [[contrast CT]] in [[obese]] individuals with BMI between 35 and 40.&lt;ref name="CarusoDe Santis2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caruso|first1=Damiano|last2=De Santis|first2=Domenico|last3=Rivosecchi|first3=Flaminia|last4=Zerunian|first4=Marta|last5=Panvini|first5=Nicola|last6=Montesano|first6=Marta|last7=Biondi|first7=Tommaso|last8=Bellini|first8=Davide|last9=Rengo|first9=Marco|last10=Laghi|first10=Andrea|title=Lean Body Weight-Tailored Iodinated Contrast Injection in Obese Patient: Boer versus James Formula|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2018|year=2018|pages=1–6|issn=2314-6133|doi=10.1155/2018/8521893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nomogram based on height, weight and arm circumference may be used.&lt;ref name=fuchs /&gt;

===Boer&lt;ref name="CarusoDe Santis2018"/&gt;===

For men: LBM = (0.407 × W) + (0.267 × H) − 19.2

For women: LBM = (0.252 × W) + (0.473 × H) − 48.3

where W is body weight in kilograms and H is body height in centimeters.

===Hume===
The following formula may be used:&lt;ref name=hume /&gt;

For men: LBM = (0.32810 × W) + (0.33929 × H) − 29.5336

For women: LBM = (0.29569 × W) + (0.41813 × H) − 43.2933

where W is body weight in kilograms and H is body height in centimeters.

==Actual measurement==
{{further|Body composition#Measuring body composition}}
Instead of mathematical estimation the actual value of LBM may be calculated using various technologies such as [[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA).

A '''luthier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|t|i|ər}} {{respell|LOO|ti-ər}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/luthier Oxford Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; is someone who builds or repairs [[string instrument]]s generally consisting of a neck and a sound box. The word "luthier" comes from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:en:luth#French|luth]]'', which means [[lute]]. A luthier was originally a maker of lutes, but the term now includes makers of stringed instruments such as the [[Violin making and maintenance|violin]] or [[guitar]]. A luthier does not make harps or pianos, as these require different skills and construction methods because their strings are secured to a frame.
 
The [[craft]] of making string instruments, or lutherie (sometimes spelled luthiery), is commonly divided into two main categories: makers of stringed instruments that are [[Plucked string instrument|plucked]] or strummed, and those that are [[Bow (music)|bowed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Arts/Music/Instruments/Stringed/|title=Arts, Music, Instruments, Stringed|publisher=[[DMOZ]]|accessdate=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since bowed instruments require a bow, the second category includes a subtype known as a [[bow maker]] or archetier.
Luthiers may also teach string-instrument making, either through [[apprenticeship]] or formal classroom instruction.

{{Further|Classical guitar making|List of guitar manufacturers}}

Two important luthiers of the early 19th century connected with the development of the modern classical guitar are [[Louis Panormo]] and [[Georg Staufer]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guitar (From The Renaissance To The Present Day) by Harvey Turnbull (Third Impression 1978) - Publisher: Batsford. p68 (Ponormo) and p70 (Georg Staufer) - Chapter 4 (The Development Of The Instrument)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Torres Jurado]] is credited with developing the form of [[classical guitar]] still in use today. [[Christian Frederick Martin]] of Germany developed a form that evolved into the modern steel-string acoustic guitar.

The American luthier [[Orville Gibson]] specialized in mandolins, and is credited with creating the [[archtop guitar]]. The important 20th-century American luthiers [[John D'Angelico]] and [[Jimmy D'Aquisto]] made archtop guitars.  [[Lloyd Loar]] worked briefly for the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] making mandolins and guitars. His designs for a family of arch top instruments (mandolin, mandola, guitar, et cetera) are held in high esteem by today's luthiers, who seek to reproduce their sound.  [[Paul Bigsby]]'s innovation of the [[tremolo arm]] for archtop and [[electric guitar]]s is still in use today and may have influenced [[Clarence Leonidas Fender|Leo Fender]]'s design for the [[Stratocaster]] solid-body electric guitar, as well as the [[Fender Jaguar|Jaguar]] and [[Jazzmaster]].  Concurrent with Fender's work, guitarist [[Les Paul]] independently developed a solid-body electric guitar. These were the first fretted, solid-body electric guitars&amp;mdash;though they were preceded by the cast [[aluminum]] "[[Frying pan (guitar)|frying pan]]", a solid-body electric [[lap steel guitar]] developed and eventually patented by [[George Beauchamp]], and built by [[Adolph Rickenbacher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gruhn.com/articles/rickelectro.html |title=Rickenbacker Electro Spanish Guitar |first=George |last=Gruhn |accessdate=2006-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030065143/http://www.gruhn.com/articles/rickelectro.html |archivedate=2006-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A company founded by luthier Friedrich [[Gretsch]] and continued by his son and grandson, Fred and Fred, Jr., originally made banjos, but is more famous today for its electric guitars.  Vintage guitars are often sought by collectors.

{{Further|Violin construction and mechanics|Violin making and maintenance}}

Bowed instruments include: [[cello]], [[crwth]], [[double bass]], [[erhu]], [[fiddle]], [[hudok]], [[morin khuur]], [[nyckelharpa]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[rabab]], [[rebec]], [[sarangi]], [[viol]] ([[viola da gamba]]), [[viola]], [[viola da braccio]], [[viola d'amore]], and [[violin]].

The purported "inventor" of the violin is [[Andrea Amati]]. Amati was originally a lute maker, but turned to the new instrument form of violin in the mid-16th century. He was the progenitor of the famous Amati family of luthiers active in Cremona, Italy until the 18th century. Andrea Amati had two sons. His eldest was [[Antonio Amati]] (''circa'' 1537–1607), and the younger, [[Girolamo Amati]] (''circa'' 1561–1630). Girolamo is better known as Hieronymus, and together with his brother, produced many violins with labels inside the instrument reading "A&amp;H".  Antonio died having no known offspring, but Hieronymus became a father. His son Nicolò (1596–1684) was himself an important master luthier who had several apprentices of note, including [[Antonio Stradivari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=W. Henry Hill, Arthur F. Hill and Alfred E.|title=Antonio Stradivari: His Life and Work, 1664–1737|year=1963|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-20425-1|edition=New Dover|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (probably), Andrea [[Guarneri]], Bartolomeo Pasta, Jacob Railich, Giovanni Battista Rogeri, Matthias [[Klotz (violin makers)|Klotz]], and possibly [[Jacob Stainer]] and [[Francesco Rugeri]]. It is even possible Bartolomeo [[Bartolomeo Cristofori|Cristofori]], later inventor of the piano, apprenticed under him (although census data does not support this, which paints this as a possible myth).&lt;ref&gt;Pollens, Stewart (1995) The Early Pianoforte. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gasparo da Salò]] of [[Brescia]] (Italy) was another important early luthier of the violin family. About 80 of his instruments survive, and around 100 documents that relate to his work. He was also a double bass player and son and nephew of two violin players: Francesco and Agosti, respectively.

[[Gasparo Duiffopruggar]] of [[Füssen]], Germany, was once incorrectly credited as the inventor of the violin. He was likely an important maker, but no documentation survives, and no instruments survive that experts unequivocally know are his.

Da Salò made many instruments and exported to France and Spain, and probably to England. He had at least five apprentices: his son Francesco, a helper named Battista, Alexander of Marsiglia, Giacomo Lafranchini and—the most important—[[Giovanni Paolo Maggini]]. Maggini inherited da Salò's business in Brescia. [[Valentino Siani]] worked with Maggini. In 1620, Maggini moved to Florence.

Luthiers born in the mid-17th century include [[Giovanni Grancino]], [[Vincenzo Rugeri]], [[Carlo Giuseppe Testore]], and his sons [[Carlo Antonio Testore]] and [[Paolo Antonio Testore]], all from [[Milan]]. From [[Venice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pio|first=Stefano|title=Violin and Lute Makers of Venice 1640–1760|year=2004|publisher=Venice research|location=venezia, Italy|isbn=978-88-907252-2-7|pages=383|url=http://www.veniceresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the luthiers [[Matteo Goffriller]], [[Domenico Montagnana]], [[Sanctus Seraphin]], and [[Carlo Annibale Tononi]] were principals in the Venetian school of violin making (although the latter began his career in [[Bologna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartruff.com/history/|title=The History of the Violin|first=William|last=Bartruff|accessdate=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)]] purchased Antonio Stradivari's shop a few years after the master's death. [[David Tecchler]], who was born in Austria, later worked in both Venice and [[Rome]].

Important luthiers from the early 18th century include [[Nicolò Gagliano]] of [[Naples]], Italy, [[Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi]] of Milan, and [[Giovanni Battista Guadagnini]], who roamed throughout Italy during his lifetime. From Austria originally, [[Leopold Widhalm]] later established himself in [[Nuremberg|Nürnberg]], Germany.

The early 19th-century luthiers of the [[Mirecourt]] school of violin making in France were the [[Vuillaume]] family, [[Charles Jean Baptiste Collin-Mezin]], and Collin-Mezin's son, [[Charles Collin-Mezin, Jr.]], Honore Derazey, Nicolas Lupot, Charles Macoutel, [[Charles Mennégand]], and Pierre Silvestre.
Nicola Utili (also known as Nicola da Castel Bolognese) (Ravenna, Italy, March 1888 –  May 1962), beside traditional lute works, experimented the making of "pear-shaped" violins.

The Jérôme-Thibouville-Lamy firm started making wind instruments around 1730 at [[La Couture-Boussey]], then moved to Mirecourt around 1760 and started making violins, guitars, mandolins, and musical accessories.

The power plant is one of four operating in the Leyte Geothermal Production Field.&lt;ref name="EDC" /&gt; The power plants serve 10 million households in the Visayas with an average of 160 kiloWatthour per Household of 3 per month. The other 7 million is served by the Panlipin-on Geothermal Power of 100 Megawatts.

Formerly owned and operated by the California Energy under a [[build-operate-transfer]] scheme known as CE Luzon, it was transferred to PNOC-EDC in 2007, and since 2009 has been owned and operated privately by the [[Energy Development Corporation]].

In November 2013, the plant was damaged by [[Typhoon_Haiyan|Super Typhoon Yolanda]] and restored operations in January 2014.&lt;ref name="PDI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malitbog power plant unit in Leyte back in operation, EDC says|url=http://business.inquirer.net/158647/malitbog-power-plant-unit-in-leyte-back-in-operation-edc-says|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smokey Mountains in the eastern parts of Kananga and Ormoc is Leyte's pride home of five major geothermal power plants (former Leyte Geothermal Power Plant of NPC; Upper Mahiao, Malitbog and Mahanagdong A and B) and four optimization geothermal power plants (Tongonan, Malitbog, Mahanagdong A and B) all privately owned and operated by the Energy Development Corporation.

A '''metallic microlattice''' is a synthetic porous metallic material consisting of an [[Ultralight material|ultra-light]] [[metal foam]]. With a [[density]] as low as 0.9&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.00561&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), it is one of the lightest structural materials known to science.&lt;ref name=ChineseAerogel/&gt; It was developed by a team of scientists from [[California]]-based [[HRL Laboratories]], in collaboration with researchers at [[University of California, Irvine]] and [[Caltech]], and was first announced in November 2011. The prototype samples were made from a [[nickel]]-[[phosphorus]] alloy.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt; In 2012, the microlattice prototype was declared one of 10 World-Changing Innovations by ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterling |first=Robert |title=The world's lightest material |url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2012/10/bds_hrl_10_29_12.html |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=2 November 2012 |date=29 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BrcxiGOa?url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2012/10/bds_hrl_10_29_12.html |archivedate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallic microlattice technology has numerous potential applications in [[Automotive engineering|automotive]] and [[aeronautical engineering]].&lt;ref name=RevoBenefit/&gt; A detailed comparative review study among other types of metallic lattice structures showed them to be beneficial for light-weighting purposes but expensive to manufacture.&lt;ref name=j4/&gt;

==Synthesis==
To produce their metallic microslattice, the HRL/UCI/Caltech team first prepared a [[polymer]] template using a technique based on self-propagating [[waveguide]] formation,&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;&lt;ref name=j3/&gt; though it was noted that other methods can be used to fabricate the template.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; The process passed [[UV light]] through a perforated mask into a reservoir of UV-curable [[resin]]. [[Fiber-optic]]-like [[Total internal reflection|"self-trapping" of the light]] occurred as the resin cured under each hole in the mask, forming a thin polymer fiber along the path of the light. By using multiple light beams, multiple fibers could then interconnect to form a lattice.

The process was similar to [[photolithography]] in that it used a two-dimensional mask to define the starting template structure, but differed in the rate of formation: where [[stereolithography]] might take hours to make a full structure, the self-forming waveguide process allowed templates to be formed in 10–100 seconds. In this way, the process enables large free-standing 3D lattice materials to be formed quickly and scalably. The template was then coated with a thin layer of metal by [[electroless nickel plating]], and the template is etched away, leaving a free-standing, [[Periodic function|periodic]] porous metallic structure. Nickel was used as the microlattice metal in the original report. Owing to the electrodeposition process, 7% of the material consisted of dissolved phosphorus atoms, and it contained no [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]].&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

==Properties==
A metallic microslattice is composed of a network of interconnecting hollow struts. In the least-dense microlattice sample reported, each strut is about 100 [[micrometre]]s in diameter, with a wall 100 [[nanometre]]s thick. The completed structure is about 99.99% air by volume,&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Metallic microlattice 'lightest structure ever' |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2011/November/17111103.asp |publisher=Chemistry World |accessdate=21 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63MnWajdR?url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2011/November/17111103.asp |archivedate=21 November 2011 |date=17 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by convention, the mass of air is excluded when the microlattice density is calculated.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; Allowing for the mass of the interstitial air, the true density of the structure is approximately 2.1&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (2.1&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which is only about 1.76 times the density of air itself at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. The material is described as being 100 times lighter than [[Styrofoam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15788735|title=World's 'lightest material' unveiled by US engineers|publisher= BBC News|date=18 November 2011|accessdate= 25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic microlattices are characterized by very low densities, with the 2011 record of 0.9&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; being among the lowest values of any known solid. The previous record of 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was held by [[silica]] [[aerogel]]s, and [[aerographite]] is claimed to have a density of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=aerographite/&gt; Mechanically, these microlattices are behaviorally similar to [[elastomer]]s and almost completely recover their shape after significant compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Shankland|date=18 November 2011|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-57327382-264/breakthrough-material-is-barely-more-than-air/|title=Breakthrough material is barely more than air|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate= 26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives them a significant advantage over earlier aerogels, which are brittle, glass-like substances.  This elastomeric property in metallic microlattices furthermore results in efficient shock absorption. Their [[Young's modulus]] E exhibits different scaling, with the density ρ, E ~ ρ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to E ~ ρ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in [[aerogel]]s and [[carbon nanotube]] foams.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

==Applications==
Metallic microlattice may find potential applications as thermal and vibration insulators such as [[shock absorbers]], and may also prove useful as battery electrodes and catalyst supports.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; Additionally, the microlattices' ability to return to their original state after being compressed may make them suitable for use in spring-like energy storage devices.&lt;ref name="cw"/&gt; Automotive and aeronautical manufacturers are using microlattice technology to develop extremely lightweight and efficient structures that combine multiple functions, such as structural reinforcement and heat transfer, into single components for high-performance vehicles.&lt;ref name=RevoBenefit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imeche.org/news/institution/all/2013/02/28/microlattice-how-revolutionary-metallic-structures-are-benefiting-global-manufacturers|title=MICROLATTICE: HOW REVOLUTIONARY METALLIC STRUCTURES ARE BENEFITING GLOBAL MANUFACTURERS|publisher=[[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=25 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225084718/http://www.imeche.org/news/institution/all/2013/02/28/microlattice-how-revolutionary-metallic-structures-are-benefiting-global-manufacturers|archivedate=25 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar materials==
A similar but denser material, consisting of an [[electroplating|electrodeposited]] [[nanocrystal]]line nickel layer over a polymeric [[Rapid prototyping|rapid-prototyped]] truss, was created by researchers at the [[University of Toronto]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="lg"/&gt; In 2012, German researchers created a [[carbon]] foam known as [[aerographite]], with an even lower density than a metallic microlattice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/aerographit-leichtestes-material-der-welt-entwickelt-a-843819.html|title=Aerographit: Forscher entwickeln leichtestes Leichtgewicht|work=Der Spiegel|date=11 July 2012|accessdate=1 July 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Chinese scientists developed a carbon-based [[aerogel]] which was claimed to be lighter still.&lt;ref name=ChineseAerogel&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22079592|title=In pictures: Ultra-light material|publisher=BBC|date=9 April 2013|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NABI Bus, LLC''' ('''NABI''') was a manufacturer of heavy-duty [[transit bus]]es with its headquarters, bus manufacturing and assembly operations, located in [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabiusa.com/index.php/about |title=About NABI Bus | accessdate=21 May 2013}} {{dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its products ranged from 31-feet to 60-feet in length, and were sold to operators throughout the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. NABI's U.S. operations also include an aftermarket parts division in [[Delaware]], [[Ohio]] (at the former [[Flxible]] factory),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabiusa.com/index.php/nabi-parts |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140319205409/http://www.nabiusa.com/index.php/nabi-parts |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 March 2014 |title=Aftermarket Parts |accessdate=21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an after-sales service center at [[Mira Loma]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabiusa.com/index.php/service |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140319205331/http://www.nabiusa.com/index.php/service |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 March 2014 |title=Customer Service |accessdate=21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===1992&amp;ndash;1999===
The company that is now known as NABI was incorporated in the USA, in the state of Alabama, in November 1992, under the name American Ikarus, Inc. (American Ikarus). It was incorporated by the First [[Hungary]] Fund Limited, (FHF) a [[Jersey]] equity investment fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.industrytoday.com/article_view.asp?ArticleID=86 |title=North American Bus Industries Group | accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its incorporation was accompanied by FHF's concurrent formation of a Hungarian holding company, North American Bus Industries, Kft. (NABI Hungary) owning the shares of American Ikarus. This arrangement—with American Ikarus as a subsidiary of NABI Hungary--(collectively The Group) resulted in FHF's investment being Hungarian-based—in alignment with FHF's objective of investing in business opportunities resulting from the political and economic changes then taking place in Hungary. American Ikarus simultaneously acquired the assets of Ikarus USA, Inc. (Ikarus USA) a bus manufacturing subsidiary of the Union City Body Company, Inc. (UCBC) of [[Union City, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.busexplorer.com/WorldBus/Ikarus-Text.html |title=Chapter 12: Ikarus Buses |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612192224/http://busexplorer.com/WorldBus/Ikarus-Text.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such assets included facilities in Alabama, miscellaneous equipment and inventory.

UCBC and Ikarus USA had been parties to a strategic alliance with [[Ikarus (Hungarian company)|Ikarus]] Body and Coach Building Works of [[Budapest, Hungary]]. (Ikarus Hungary)  At the time, Ikarus Hungary was a very large bus manufacturer having multiple plants in Hungary, with a production output during the 1980s of over 13,000 buses per year.&lt;ref name="wsj-1984"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anders|first=George|authorlink=George Anders|title=Soviet Bloc Bus Builder Hits Bumpy Road in U.S.|date=March 28, 1984|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] (Eastern edition)|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="janes1986"&gt;Bushell, Chris; and Stonham, Peter (eds.) (1986).  ''Jane's Urban Transport Systems 1986'', pp. 484–486.  London: [[Jane's Information Group|Jane's Publishing Company]].  {{ISBN|0-7106-0826-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously with the formation of American Ikarus, the previously established strategic alliance between Ikarus USA and Ikarus Hungary was assigned to the newly incorporated American Ikarus.

At the time of incorporation, it was planned that American Ikarus would purchase unfinished buses from Ikarus Hungary under its strategic alliance, ship them to the U.S. and perform final assembly at its Alabama plant. This arrangement provided certain engineering and manufacturing benefits and allowed compliance with [[Buy America Act|"Buy America"]] requirements of the [[Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982]] which established American content requirements for federally assisted [[rolling stock]] procurements, including transit buses. Such vehicles had already been designed by Ikarus Hungary specifically for the U.S. market, with unfinished buses having been produced previously by Ikarus Hungary under the same strategic alliance with Ikarus USA. These vehicles were the Model 416 forty-foot standard-floor transit bus and its larger sibling, the Model 436 sixty-foot articulated transit bus.

The plant in [[Anniston, AL]] opened in 1993 under this business arrangement, performing final assembly operations, delivery and after-sales service using unfinished [[Knock-down kit|knock-down]] buses produced in Hungary. Delivery of unfinished buses was accomplished by rail shipment from Budapest to [[Bremerhaven]], then shipment by roll-on/roll-off ocean vessels to [[Charleston, SC]], and then by delivery on flatbed trailers to Anniston, AL.

At the time of incorporation, Ikarus' business was in decline due to unusual political and economic changes following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. Such decline continued after The Group's formation, resulting in the shutdown of one of Ikarus' plants in Budapest. This plant was purchased from Ikarus Hungary by NABI, Kft. which simultaneously entered a license agreement with Ikarus Hungary allowing NABI, Kft. to produce its own unfinished buses in Budapest and deliver them to its subsidiary in Alabama for final assembly and delivery to U.S. customers. In 1994 The Group began use of this manufacturing arrangement with no further involvement of Ikarus Hungary other than its role as licensor of the Model 416 and Model 436 standard-floor transit bus designs.

In 1996, the company began aggressive expansion of its aftermarket parts department which had previously supplied service parts only for its own products. This expansion was accomplished by hiring individuals previously employed within the aftermarket parts organization of the defunct Flxible Corporation, which had recently discontinued transit bus manufacturing and aftermarket parts operations in [[Ohio]]. Once hired, this group leased facilities in Ohio, and began to expand the sale of aftermarket parts to operators of competing makes of buses.

Also in 1996, American Ikarus, Inc. was renamed "North American Bus Industries, Inc." due to the dissolution of its affiliation with Ikarus Hungary some years earlier, and because the company was easily and incorrectly confused with the no longer related Ikarus Hungary, which had fallen into further distress due to continued decline of its European markets.

In 1997, NABI Kft. was re-registered in Hungary from a [[limited liability company]] to NABI, Rt., a [[joint stock company]], allowing it to raise capital via public offering. Thereafter, in August of that year, the company raised $US 27.1&amp;nbsp;million in a public offering, with its shares listed on the [[Budapest Stock Exchange]]. FHF retained approximately 56% of NABI, Rt. shares, with the remainder of the shares publicly traded.

Also in 1997, NABI Hungary was certified as conforming to the [[ISO 9001]] quality and organizational standard, with NABI, Inc. becoming ISO 9001 certified the following year. In 1998, The Group also implemented the use of BaaN, an integrated enterprise resource planning system. Additionally, 1998 marked the introduction of NABI's new, 40-foot low-floor Model 40-LFW transit bus. (35-foot and 31-foot variants of this product were later derived).

===2000&amp;ndash;2009===
In 2000, The Group announced its move into the European bus market with NABI, Inc.'s debt-financed acquisition of all of the shares of the [[Optare]] Group, (Optare) of [[Leeds]], U.K. for $US 28.5&amp;nbsp;million, making Optare a NABI, Inc. subsidiary. Anticipated benefits included immediate participation in the European market as well as eventual European market participation with a new, composite-structured bus then under development. Plans also included the derivation of certain left-hand-drive Optare products for U.S. and Hungarian markets.

Although there had been previous moderate expansion of NABI's Anniston, AL facility, 2001 marked additional and substantial factory expansion, taking the Anniston, AL plant to over 250,000&amp;nbsp;square feet (under roof). 2001 also marked derivation of the 30-foot NABI Model 30-LFN which was a left-hand-drive derivative of the recently developed Optare "Solo" being sold in the UK. Sale of these small low-floor buses commenced to private and public operators within the U.S. An additional outgrowth of the Optare acquisition was the sale of a small number of full-size (11&amp;nbsp;meter) NABI Model 700SE's the following year in Hungary. These were derived from the [[Optare Excel]], and were produced on [[Scania AB|Scania]] chassis.

In 2002, NABI Hungary completed construction of a new plant in [[Kaposvár]], Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xpatloop.com/news/9701 |title=Nabi unveils new factory in Kaposvar | date =7 January 2002 | accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new plant was purpose-built for the manufacture of the CompoBus, a new, composite-structured low-floor bus. Production of CompoBuses began inn earnest in 2003, with a significantly greater portion of this particular NABI product produced in Hungary than with other NABI products.

This new CompoBus manufacturing arrangement—unique for NABI—resulted in these buses being short of the FTA's normal Buy America requirements. However, NABI had sought Buy America waivers associated with the development of this new bus model, and had been granted two such waivers by the FTA. The first waiver allowed NABI to assemble its CompoBus outside the United States, and the second allowed it to count the composite chassis/frame as domestic for purposes of calculating the domestic component content of the vehicle. Both waivers applied to FTA funded procurements for which solicitations were issued within two years of the date of the waiver letter. That same year NABI introduced the 60-LFW, a new 60-foot low-floor articulated derivative of its 40-LFW model developed some years earlier.

In late 2004, NABI unveiled a new 60-foot low-floor [[articulated bus]] with rail-like styling, which had been in development since early 2003. This new product was designated the Model 60-BRT. Delivery of production versions began the following year, and a shorter, 42-foot derivative was eventually produced.

After continuing disappointing financial results through 2004, NABI, Inc. sold its Optare subsidiary in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bet.hu/newkibdata/116579/_1_NAB060428AR02EN.pdf |title=NABI - 2005 Annual Report |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000903/http://bet.hu/newkibdata/116579/_1_NAB060428AR02EN.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also idled its composite bus production facility in Kaposvar, laying off 23% of its workforce in Hungary. The shutdown was due to uncertain future demand for the CompoBus and the weakened U.S. dollar. Also, in December 2005, the FTA refused to extend the previously granted waivers exempting the CompoBus from Buy America requirements.

In early 2006, NABI entered a preliminary agreement with affiliates of [[Cerberus Capital Management]], L.P. (Cerberus) for the acquisition of all of the shares of NABI, Inc. and the business assets of NABI Rt. This transaction was completed in February 2006.&lt;ref name="apta.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apta.com/passengertransport/Documents/archive_3152.htm |title=NABI Acquires Optima Bus; Cerberus to Acquire Blue Bird | date =4 September 2006 | accessdate=21 May 2013|publisher= American Public Transit Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Concurrently, the Hungarian company that was not being acquired changed its name to ExBus, relegating itself to asset management unrelated to NABI.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/050Compecon/Centeur/Hungary/050117business.txt|title=Budapest Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, NABI announced its acquisition of [[Optima Bus Corporation]] in [[Wichita, KS]] (Optima) for an undisclosed amount. A short time later, it was announced that Cerberus had also acquired [[Blue Bird Corporation]] of Ft. Valley, GA (Blue Bird) thus rendering it a "sister" to NABI, Inc.&lt;ref name="apta.com"/&gt;

In June 2007, Optima's operations in Wichita, KS were shut down, and work-in-process, inventory and tooling for Optima's products were moved to NABI's Anniston, AL plant. At generally the same time, the work-in-process, tooling and inventory for Blue Bird's commercial buses were acquired by NABI and was also transferred to NABI, Inc.'s plant. NABI, Inc. elected to retain the names these products, and began producing these smaller buses at its Anniston, AL plant, thus adding Optima and Blue Bird brands to its product portfolio.

Generally at this same time, NABI also shifted the manufacture of its standard-floor model 416 unfinished buses from Hungary to newly leased facilities adjoining its existing Anniston, AL plant. Under this arrangement, standard-floor body structures and other vehicle elements are fabricated at the adjoining facility and are then towed a short distance into NABI's final assembly operation.

In late 2007, NABI began re-commissioning its CompoBus production plant in Kaposvar, simultaneously shifting certain assembly operations to Anniston and thus rendering the CompoBus compliant with Buy America requirements. CompoBus deliveries resumed in 2008 without the need for further waivers from the FTA.

2008 also saw additional expansion at NABI's Anniston, AL plant with the installation of a new, robotic paint system. This expansion took the Anniston plant to approximately 1/3&amp;nbsp;million square feet under roof, not including adjacent leased facilities used for manufacture of standard-floor unfinished buses.

===2010&amp;ndash;present===
Attempts to integrate the production of the smaller Optima and Blue Bird buses into NABI's operations eventually proved disruptive, and in 2010, NABI discontinued the production of its Optima and Blue Bird brand commercial bus products.

The following year, NABI commissioned a new fabrication shop at its plant, equipped with robotic laser cutting equipment as well as tube bending and other new fabrication equipment. At approximately the same time, new body assembly tooling for low-floor buses was installed at its adjoining body fabrication facility. With these changes in place, NABI shifted the manufacturing of its metal-structured low-floor unfinished buses from Hungary to the same facility that had already begun manufacturing NABI's standard-floor products in Alabama a few years earlier.

Also in 2010, NABI unveiled its new 12-meter Sirius bus at its plant in Kaposvar, Hungary.  This new product, produced on an [[MAN SE|MAN]] chassis, was developed for Hungarian public transportation operators.

In 2011, NABI unveiled new styling for its metal-structured low-floor product and its CompoBus. Restyling of both products was accomplished primarily by using a redesigned front mask, leaving the body structure unchanged from earlier versions of the same models. Also, a 40-foot CompoBus prototype incorporating the new styling was also produced.

On April 30, 2013, after completing a large order of CompoBuses for the [[Los Angeles MTA]], NABI produced its final CompoBus in Hungary. At the same time, NABI elected to discontinue promotion of its Hungarian Sirius bus, thus ending all production in Hungary and relegating all manufacturing and final assembly activities to its facilities in the USA.

On June 21, 2013, [[New Flyer Industries]] announced the acquisition of North American Bus Industries, Inc from [[Cerberus Capital Management]], L.P. (Cerberus) for $79 million. The deal was completed later that day. However, New Flyer continued the NABI name for its existing bus products, which continued in production for the time being. This made NABI a subsidiary of New Flyer, using the legal name of '''NABI Bus, LLC'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.145 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626063757/http://www.newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.145 |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Bird school bus production assets were not included in the sale to New Flyer; they remain owned by Cerberus. As of late 2013, all of New Flyer's metal-structured bus production (with the exception of the MiDi, a product of the New Flyer–[[Alexander Dennis]] joint venture) is now under the NABI brand.

In June 2014, New Flyer announced that the NABI product line would be discontinued after existing orders are filled. The last bus, which was built for the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] system, was completed in late October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://dartdallas.dart.org/2015/10/19/dart-nabi-mark-end-of-one-era-with-a-new-beginning/&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, New Flyer has exclusively produced its "Xcelsior" product line at the former NABI Anniston plant, under the new name of '''New Flyer of America, Inc.'''&lt;ref name="newflyer.com"/&gt;

== Production ==
Although NABI has utilized various manufacturing arrangements throughout its history, it has produced its metal-structured products entirely in Anniston. These metal-structured buses consisted of the standard-floor model 416 (40-foot length), the low-floor Model LFW (produced in 31-foot, 35-foot and 40-foot lengths) and the low-floor BRT (produced in 42-foot and 60-foot lengths).

All NABI products comply with current [[U.S. DOT]] Buy America requirements for federally funded transit bus procurements, including domestic component value requirements as well as final assembly requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">The '''oil-storage trade''', also referred to as '''[[contango]]''', a market strategy in which large, often vertically-integrated oil companies purchase oil for immediate delivery and storage—when the price of oil is low— and hold it in storage until the price of oil increases.&lt;ref name="Reuters_2015" /&gt; Investors bet on the future of oil prices through a [[financial instrument]], [[oil futures]] in which they agree on a contract basis, to buy or sell oil at a set date in the future.&lt;ref name="Yglesias_2014" /&gt; Crude oil is stored in salt mines, tanks and oil tankers.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt;

Investors can choose to take profits or losses prior to when the oil delivery date arrives or they can leave the contract in place and physical oil is "delivered on the set date" to an "officially designated delivery point". In the United States, that is usually to [[Cushing, Oklahoma|Cushing]], Oklahoma. When delivery dates approach, they close out existing contracts and sell new ones for future delivery of the same oil. The oil never moves out of storage. If the forward market is in "[[contango]]"—the [[forward price]] is higher than the current [[spot price]]—the strategy is very successful.&lt;ref name=FT2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ6oct2007 /&gt; While new tanks have been added in Cushing for a storage capacity of 6.6 million barrels, by March 2015 all the tanks were fully leased through 2015.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt;

{{quote|The strategy works because oil prices for delivery in the future are trading at a premium to those in the spot market - a market structure known in the industry as contango - with investors expecting prices to eventually recover from the near 60 percent slide in oil in the last seven months.|Reuters 2015}}

In 2015, global capacity for oil storage was out-paced by global oil production and an oil glut occurred. Crude oil storage space became a [[tradable commodity]] with [[CME Group]]— which owns [[NYMEX]]— offering [[oil-storage futures]] contracts in March 2015.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt; Traders and producers can buy and sell the right to store certain types of oil.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt;

==Chronology==
The concept started to be used by the oil traders in the market in early 1990.&lt;ref name="Yglesias_2014"&gt;{{citation |title=Why speculators are stashing vast quantities of crude oil on tanker ships |first=Matthew |last=Yglesias |date=25 December 2014 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/25/7443569/contango-oil-storage |work=VOX}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was in 2007 through 2009 the oil storage trade expanded.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|first=Michele|last=Norris|date=17 December 2008|title=Contango In Oil Markets Explained|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98410267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many participants—including Wall Street giants, such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Citicorp]]—turning sizeable profits simply by sitting on tanks of oil.&lt;ref name=WSJ6oct2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Has All The Oil Gone? After Sitting on Crude, speculators Unload It. The World's Eyes Fall on Cushing, Oklahoma|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119162309507450611|journal=Wall Street Journal|date=6 October 2007|first=Anne|last=Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May, 2007 Cushing's inventory fell by nearly 35% as the oil-storage trade heated up.&lt;ref name="WSJ6oct2007"/&gt;

{{quote|"The trend follows a spike in oil futures prices that has created incentives for traders to buy crude oil and oil products at current rates, sell them on futures markets and store them until delivery."|Financial Post 2009}}

[[File:Bateaux comparaison3.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The [[Seawise Giant|Knock Nevis]] (1979-2010), a ULCC supertanker and the longest ship ever built.]]
By the end of October 2009 one in twelve of the largest oil tankers were being used more for temporary storage of oil, rather than transportation.&lt;ref name=FT2009&gt;{{cite web|date=17 November 2009|title=Tankers store oil as futures prices rocket|first=Robert |last=Wright|journal=Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/29a6663e-d3af-11de-8caf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2QV1AuRl4|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 2014 to January 2015, as the price of oil dropped 60 percent and the supply of oil remained high, the world's largest traders in crude oil purchased at least 25 million barrels to store in supertankers to make a profit in the future when prices rise. Trafigura, Vitol, Gunvor, Koch, Shell and other major energy companies began to book oil storage supertankers for up to 12 months. By 13 January 2015 At least 11 [[Oil tanker#Size categories|Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC)]]" have been reported as booked with storage options, rising from around five vessels at the end of last week. Each VLCC can hold 2 million barrels."&lt;ref name="Reuters_2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102335399#. |title=Oil traders to store millions of barrels at sea as prices slump |date=13 January 2015 |work=Reuters |accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 5 March 2015, as oil production outpaces oil demand by 1.5 million barrels a day, storage capacity globally is dwindling. Crude oil is stored in old salt mines, in tanks and on tankers.&lt;ref name="oil_glut" /&gt; In the United States alone, according to data from the [[Energy Information Administration]], U.S. crude-oil supplies are at almost 70% of the U.S. storage capacity, the highest supply to capacity ratio since 1935.&lt;ref name="oil_glut"&gt;{{citation |title=Oil Glut Sparks Latest Dilemma: Where to put it all as storage tanks near capacity, some predict spillover will send crude prices even lower |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-glut-sparks-latest-dilemma-where-to-put-it-all-1425577673 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=5 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |first=Nicole |last=Friedman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bloomberg Business]], the efficiency of newer shale oil wells that use [[hydraulic fracturing]] in the United States, combined with the US$12 million upfront well drilling and construction costs, provide incentives to oil producers to continue to flood the already glutted market with under-priced oil in spite of crude oil storage limitations.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015_March"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-03-05/why-cheap-oil-doesn-t-stop-the-drilling |title=Why Cheap Oil Doesn't Stop the Drilling |date=5 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many less efficient and less productive older wells were shut down but these shale oil wells continue to increase production while making a profit in a market where crude oil is priced as low as US$50 a barrel.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015_March" /&gt;

==Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)==
The United States [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] (SPR) is the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil—727 million barrels— stored in huge underground salt caverns along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name="SPR"&gt;{{citation |title=Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) |url=http://energy.gov/fe/services/petroleum-reserves/strategic-petroleum-reserve |date= |accessdate=21 January 2015 |work=Office of Fossil Energy, U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; An emergency oil stockpile was recommended by several Presidents throughout the twentieth century, in 1944, in 1952, 1956 and in 1970. The SPR is a "deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool of foreign policy" but it has rarely been used.&lt;ref name="SPR" /&gt;

On October 20, 2014, a report by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) recommended reducing the size of the Reserve. According to the report, the amount of oil held in reserve exceeds the amount required to be kept on hand since the need for foreign imports of crude oil have decreased in recent years. The report said the U.S. Department of Energy agreed with the GAO’s recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Oil Exports Would Lower Gas Prices, Government Report Says - WSJ - WSJ

'''Potassium niobate''' (KNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[perovskite]] [[ferroelectric]] crystal. It has nonlinear optical coefficient properties, making it common in the manufacture of lasers.&lt;ref name="Palik1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palik|first=Edward D.|title=Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpuVttd2cuEC&amp;pg=PA821|accessdate=13 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-544423-1|page=821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanowires of potassium niobate have been used to produce tunable coherent light. The {{LD50}} for potassium niobate is 3000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (oral, rat).

==Crystal Structure==
On cooling from high temperature, KNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes a series of structural phase transitions. At 435&amp;nbsp;°C, the crystal symmetry changes from cubic centrosymmetric (Pm3 ̅m) to [[tetragonal]] non-centrosymmetric (P4mm). On further cooling, at 225&amp;nbsp;°C the crystal symmetry changes from tetragonal (P4mm) to [[orthorhombic]] (Amm2) and at −50&amp;nbsp;°C from [[orthorhombic]] (Amm2) to [[rhombohedral]] (R3m).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7782">'''Power integrity''' or '''PI''' is an analysis to check whether the desired [[volt]]age and [[electric current|current]] are met from source to destination. Today, power integrity plays a major role in the success and failure of new electronic products. There are several coupled aspects of PI: on the chip, in the chip package, on the circuit board, and in the system. Four main issues must be resolved to ensure power integrity at the printed circuit board level:&lt;ref name="Bogatin2009"/&gt;{{rp|615}}
# Keep the voltage ripple at the chips pads lower than the specification (e.g. less than +/-50 mV variation around 1V)
# Control [[ground bounce]] (also called synchronous switching noise, simultaneous switching noise, or simultaneous switching output (SSN or SSO))
# Control [[electromagnetic interference]] and maintain [[electromagnetic compatibility]]: the power distribution network is generally the largest set of conductors on the circuit board and therefore the largest (unwanted) antenna for emission and reception of noise.
# Maintaining a proper DC Voltage level at the load at high currents. A modern processor or [[field-programmable gate array]] can pull 1-100 Amps at sub-1V VDD levels with AC and DC margins in the tens of millivolts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp411_Sim_Power_Integrity.pdf|title=Simulating FPGA Power Integrity Using S-Parameter Models|publisher=Xilinx |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds183_Virtex_7_Data_Sheet.pdf|title=Virtex-7 T and XT FPGAs Data Sheet: DC and AC Switching Characteristics|publisher=Xilinx |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Very litle DC voltage drop can thus be tolerated on the power distribution network.

==Power distribution network==
[[File:PDN figure.png|300px|thumb|right|Power Distribution Network]]
The current path from the power supply through the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] and IC package{{clarify|What is this jargon abbreviation?|date=March 2018}} to the die (consumer) is called the power distribution network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~emc/20130530P1.pdf|title=Fundamentals of Signal and Power Integrity|publisher=Christian Schuster |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its role is to transfer the power to the consumers with little DC voltage drop, and to allow little ripple induced by dynamic current at the consumer(switching current). The DC drop occurs if there is too much resistance in the plane or power traces leading from the VRM to the consumer. This can be countered by raising the voltage on the VRM, or extending the "sense" point of the VRM to the consumer.

Dynamic current occur when the consumer switches its transistors, typically triggered by a clock. This dynamic current can be considerably larger than the static current (internal leakage) of the consumer. This fast current consumption can pull the voltage of the rail down, creating a voltage ripple. This change in current happens much faster than the VRM can react. The switching current must therefore be handled by [[decoupling capacitors]]. 

The noise or voltage ripple must be handled differently depending on the frequency of operation. The highest frequencies must be handled on-die. This noise is decoupled by parasitic coupling in on the die, and capacitive coupling between metal layers. Frequencies above 50-100 MHz must be handled on the package, this is done by on package capacitors. Frequencies below 100 MHz are handled on the PCB by plane capacitance and using [[decoupling capacitors]]. Capacitors work on different frequencies depending on their type, capacitance and physical size. It is therefore necessary to utilize multiple capacitors of different sizes to ensure a low PDN impedance across the frequency range&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~jfan/slides/Archambeault1.pdf|title=Effective Power/Ground Plane Decoupling for PCB|publisher=IBM |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The physical size of the capacitors affect its parasitic inductance. The parasitic inductance creates impedance spikes at certain frequencies. (Physically) Smaller capacitors are therefore better. The placement of the capacitors is of varying importance depending on its frequency of operation. The smallest value capacitors should be as close as possible to the consumer to minimize the AC current loop area. Larger capacitors in the micro Farad range can be placed more or less anywhere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spi2016.org/slides/SPI2016_Tutorial_Slides.pdf|title=Introduction to Power Integrity|publisher=PICOTEST, Keysight |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Target impedance===
The target impedance is the impedance at which the ripple created by the dynamic current of the specific consumer is within the specified range.
The target impedance is given by the following equation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spi2016.org/slides/SPI2016_Tutorial_Slides.pdf|title=Introduction to Power Integrity|publisher=PICOTEST, Keysight |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6623297|title=Designing for Power Integrity: Status, Challenges and Opportunities|publisher=IEEE |accessdate=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the target impedance, it is important to know which frequencies it applies, and at which frequency the consumer package is responsible (this is specified in the datasheet of the specific consumer IC).

:&lt;math&gt;\Z_{Target}= \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta I} [\Omega]&lt;/math&gt;

One usually use some form of simulation when designing the PDN to ensure that the PDN meets the target impedance. This can be done by [[SPICE]] simulation, chip vendor tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/support-centers/signal-power-integrity/power-distribution-network.tablet.html|title=Power Distribution Network|publisher=Altera |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, capacitor venor tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ksim.kemet.com/|title=K-SIM|publisher=KEMET |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or by tools embedded in the EDA software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altium.com/solution/cst-pdn-analyzer|title=CST PDN ANALYZER|publisher=Altium |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mentor.com/pcb/hyperlynx/power-integrity/|title=HyperLynx Power Integrity|publisher=Mentor|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cadence.com/content/cadence-www/global/en_US/home/tools/ic-package-design-and-analysis/si-pi-analysis-integrated-solution/allegro-sigrity-pi-base.html|title=Allegro Sigrity PI Base|publisher=Cadence|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.keysight.com/en/pd-2625864-pn-W2359EP/pipro-power-integrity-em-analysis-element?cc=NO&amp;lc=eng|title=W2359EP PIPro Power Integrity EM Analysis Element|publisher=Keysight|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Rimed snow''' refers to [[snow]]flakes that are partially or completely coated in tiny frozen water droplets called '[[Hard rime|rime]]'. Rime forms on a snowflake when it passes through a [[Supercooling|super-cooled]] [[cloud]].  Snowflakes that are heavily rimed typically produce very heavy and wet snow, with snow to liquid ratios in the 5-1 (i.e. five inches of snow per inch of rain) to 9-1 range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=2011-01-29|author=W. Junker|date=2011-01-28|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2011/01/what_made_wednesdays_storm_spe.html|title=What made Wednesday's storm special?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rimed snow has been found to provide greater initial stability for a snow layer. However, it also allows thicker, and therefore less stable, snow layers to build up.  It could be argued that these cancel each other out.

There has been research into the effect of rimed snow on [[Avalanche|avalanches]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9271">'''Solid-state chemistry,''' also sometimes referred  as '''materials chemistry''', is the study of the synthesis, structure, and properties of solid phase materials, particularly, but not necessarily exclusively of, non-molecular solids. It therefore has a strong overlap with [[solid-state physics]], [[mineralogy]], [[crystallography]], [[ceramic]]s, [[metallurgy]], [[thermodynamics]], [[materials science]] and [[electronics]] with a focus on the synthesis of novel materials and their characterisation. Solids can be classified as crystalline or amorphous on basis of the nature of order present in the arrangement of their constituent particles.

==History==
Because of its direct relevance to products of commerce, solid state inorganic chemistry has been strongly driven by technology.  Progress in the field has often been fueled by the demands of industry, well ahead of  academic curiosity.  Applications discovered in the 20th century include [[zeolite]] and [[platinum]]-based catalysts for petroleum processing in the 1950s, high-purity silicon as a core component of microelectronic devices in the 1960s, and “high temperature” superconductivity in the 1980s.  The invention of [[X-ray crystallography]] in the early 1900s by [[William Lawrence Bragg]] enabled further innovation.  Our understanding of how reactions proceed at the atomic level in the solid state was advanced considerably by [[Carl Wagner]]'s work on oxidation rate theory, counter diffusion of ions, and defect chemistry.  Because of this, he has sometimes been referred to as the ''father of solid state chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;For a historical perspective, cf. Pierre Teissier, ''L’émergence de la chimie du solide en France (1950-2000). De la formation d’une communauté à sa dispersion'' (Paris X: Ph.D. dissertation, 2007, 651 p.). Electronic version available: http://bdr.u-paris10.fr/sid/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthetic methods==
Given the diversity of solid state compounds, an equally diverse array of methods&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 of ''Solid state chemistry and its applications.'' Anthony R. West. John Wiley &amp; Sons 2003 {{ISBN|981-253-003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used for their preparation.  For organic materials, such as charge transfer salts, the methods operates near room temperature and are often similar to the techniques of [[organic synthesis]].  Redox reactions are sometimes conducted by electrocrystallisation, as illustrated by the preparation of the [[Bechgaard salt]]s from [[tetrathiafulvalene]].

===Oven techniques===
For thermally robust materials, high temperature methods are often employed.  For example, bulk solids are prepared using [[tube furnace]]s, which allow reactions to be conducted up to ca. 1100&amp;nbsp;°C. Special equipment e.g. ovens consisting of a tantalum tube through which an electric current is passed can be used for even higher temperatures up to 2000&amp;nbsp;°C. Such high temperatures are at times required to induce [[diffusion]] of the reactants, but this depends strongly on the system studied. Some solid state reactions already proceed at temperatures as low as 100&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Melt methods====
One method often employed is to melt the reactants together and then later anneal the solidified melt. If volatile reactants are involved the reactants are often put in an ampoule that is evacuated -ofnt mixture cold e.g. by keeping the bottom of the ampoule in liquid nitrogen- and then sealed. The sealed ampoule is then put in an oven and given a certain heat treatment....

====Solution methods====
It is possible to use solvents to prepare solids by precipitation or by evaporation. At times the solvent is used hydrothermal that is under pressure at temperatures higher than the normal boiling point. A variation on this theme is the use of flux methods, where a salt of relatively low melting point is added to the mixture to act as a high temperature solvent in which the desired reaction can take place. this can be very useful

====Gas reactions====
Many solids react vigorously with reactive gas species like chlorine, iodine, oxygen etc. Others form [[adduct]]s with other gases, e.g. CO or ethylene. Such reactions are often carried out in a tube that is open ended on both sides and through which the gas is passed. A variation of this is to let the reaction take place inside a measuring device such as a [[thermogravimetric analysis|TGA]]. In that case stoichiometric information can be obtained during the reaction, which helps identify the products.

A special case of a gas reaction is a [[chemical transport reaction]]. These are often carried out in a sealed ampoule to which a small amount of a transport agent, e.g. iodine is added. The ampoule is then placed in a zone oven. This is essentially two tube ovens attached to each other which allows a temperature gradient to be imposed. Such a method can be used to obtain the product in the form of single crystals suitable for structure determination by X-ray diffraction.

[[Chemical vapour deposition]] is a high temperature method that is widely employed for the preparation of coatings and [[semiconductor]]s from molecular precursors

===Air and moisture sensitive materials===
Many solids are [[hygroscopic]] and/or oxygen sensitive. Many [[halide]]s e.g. are very 'thirsty' and can only be studied in their anhydrous form if they are handled in a glove box filled with dry (and/or oxygen-free) gas, usually [[nitrogen]].

==Characterization==

===New phases, phase diagrams, structures===
The synthetic methodology and the characterization of the product often go hand in hand in the sense that not one but a series of reaction mixtures are prepared and subjected to heat treatment. The stoichiometry is typically ''varied'' in a systematic way to find which stoichiometries will lead to new solid compounds or to solid solutions between known ones. A prime method to characterize the reaction products is [[powder diffraction]], because many solid state reactions will produce polycristalline ingots or powders. Powder diffraction will facilitate the identification of known phases in the mixture. If a pattern is found that is not known in the diffraction data libraries an attempt can be made to index the pattern, i.e. to identify the symmetry and the size of the unit cell. (If the product is not crystalline the characterization is typically much more difficult.)

Once the unit cell of a new phase is known, the next step is to establish the stoichiometry of the phase. This can be done in a number of ways. Sometimes the composition of the original mixture will give a clue, if one finds only one product -a single powder pattern- or if one was trying to make a phase of a certain composition by analogy to known materials but this is rare.
Often considerable effort in refining the synthetic methodology is required to obtain a pure sample of the new material.
If it is possible to separate the product from the rest of the reaction mixture elemental analysis can be used. Another way involves [[Scanning electron microscopy|SEM]] and the generation of characteristic X-rays in the electron beam. The easiest way to solve the structure is by using single crystal X-ray diffraction.

The latter often requires ''revisiting'' and refining the preparative procedures and that is linked to the question which phases are stable at what composition and what stoichiometry. In other words, what does the [[phase diagram]] looks like.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Chapter 12 of Elements of X-ray diffraction, B.D. Cullity, Addison-Wesley, 2nd ed. 1977 {{ISBN|0-201-01174-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool in establishing this is [[thermal analysis]] techniques like [[Differential scanning calorimetry|DSC]] or [[Differential thermal analysis|DTA]] and increasingly also, thanks to the advent of [[synchrotron]]s temperature-dependent powder diffraction. Increased knowledge of the phase relations often leads to further refinement in synthetic procedures in an iterative way. New phases are thus characterized by their melting points and their stoichiometric domains. The latter is important for the many solids that are non-stoichiometric compounds. The cell parameters obtained from XRD are particularly helpful to characterize the homogeneity ranges of the latter.

===Further characterization===
In many -but certainly not all- cases new solid compounds are further characterized&lt;ref&gt;cf. Chapter 2 of ''New directions in Solid State Chemistry''. [[C. N. R. Rao]] and J. Gopalakrishnan. Cambridge U. Press 1997 {{ISBN|0-521-49559-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a variety of techniques that straddle the fine line that (hardly) separates solid-state chemistry from solid-state physics.

====Optical properties====
For non-metallic materials, it is often possible to obtain UV/VIS spectra. In the case of semiconductors that will give an idea of the band gap.

The '''strange quark''' or '''s quark''' (from its symbol, s) is the third lightest of all [[quark]]s, a type of [[elementary particle]]. Strange quarks are found in [[subatomic particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. Example of hadrons containing strange quarks include [[kaon]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Kaon}}), [[strange D meson]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange D}}), [[Sigma baryon]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Sigma}}), and other [[strange particle]]s.

According to the [[IUPAP]] the symbol '''s''' is the official name, while strange is to be considered only as a mnemonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Richard E |last2=Giacomo |first2=Pierre |title=Symbols, Units, Nomenclature and Fundamental Constants in Physics |publisher=IUPAP |page=12 |edition=2010 |url=http://iupap.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/A4.pdf |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name '''sideways''' has also been used because the s quark has a [[isospin|I{{sub|3}} value]] of 0 while the u (“up”) and d (“down”) quarks have values of +{{sfrac|1|2}} and −{{sfrac|1|2}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGervey |first1=John D. |title=Introduction to Modern Physics |date=1983 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-12-483560-3 |page=658 |edition=second |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2a94GI0-QF0C&amp;lpg=PA658&amp;dq=%22sideways%20quark%22&amp;pg=PA658#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sideways%20quark%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[charm quark]], it is part of the [[generation (physics)|second generation]] of matter, and has an [[electric charge]] of −{{sfrac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[elementary charge|''e'']] and a [[Quark#Mass|bare mass]] of {{val|95|5|-5|ul=MeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="PDG2012"/&gt; Like all [[quark]]s, the strange quark is an [[elementary particle|elementary]] [[fermion]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[spin-1/2|{{sfrac|1|2}}]], and experiences all four [[fundamental interaction]]s: [[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[weak interaction]]s, and [[strong interaction]]s. The [[antiparticle]] of the strange quark is the '''strange antiquark''' (sometimes called ''antistrange quark'' or simply ''antistrange''), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have [[additive inverse|equal magnitude but opposite sign]].

The first [[strange particle]] (a particle containing a strange quark) was discovered in 1947 ([[kaon]]s), but  the existence of the strange quark itself (and that of the [[up quark|up]] and [[down quark]]s) was only postulated in 1964 by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] to explain the [[Eightfold Way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] classification scheme of [[hadron]]s. The first evidence for the existence of quarks came in 1968, in [[deep inelastic scattering]] experiments at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]]. These experiments confirmed the existence of up and down quarks, and by extension, strange quarks, as they were required to explain the Eightfold Way.

==History==
In the beginnings of particle physics (first half of the 20th century), [[hadron]]s such as [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[pion]]s were thought to be [[elementary particle]]s. However, new hadrons were discovered and the '[[particle zoo]]' grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s. Some particles were much longer lived than others; most particles decayed through the [[strong interaction]] and had [[Mean lifetime|lifetime]]s of around 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. When they decayed through the [[weak interaction]]s, they had lifetimes of around 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. While studying these decays, [[Murray Gell-Mann]] (in 1953)&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]] is the result of these efforts to understand strange decays.

Despite their work, the relationships between each particle and the physical basis behind the strangeness property remained unclear. In 1961, Gell-Mann&lt;ref&gt;

'''Sulfur hexafluoride''' (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is an  [[inorganic compound|inorganic]], colorless, odorless, non-[[flammable]], extremely potent [[greenhouse gas]], and an excellent [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulator]].&lt;ref name=NYT61313 /&gt; {{chem|SF|6}}  has an [[octahedral geometry]], consisting of six [[fluorine]] atoms attached to a central [[sulfur]] atom. It is a [[hypervalent molecule]]. Typical for a nonpolar gas, it is poorly [[soluble]] in water but quite soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. It is generally transported as a [[liquefied gas|liquefied compressed gas]]. It has a density of 6.12&amp;nbsp;g/L at sea level conditions, considerably higher than the [[density of air]] (1.225&amp;nbsp;g/L).

==Synthesis and reactions==
{{chem|SF|6}} can be prepared from the elements through exposure of [[Sulfur|{{chem|S|8}}]] to [[fluorine|{{chem|F|2}}]]. This was also the method used by the discoverers [[Henri Moissan]] and [[Paul Lebeau]] in 1901. Some other sulfur fluorides are cogenerated, but these are removed by heating the mixture to [[disproportionation|disproportionate]] any [[Disulfur decafluoride|{{chem|S|2|F|10}}]] (which is highly toxic) and then scrubbing the product with [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] to destroy remaining [[Sulfur tetrafluoride|{{chem|SF|4}}]].

Alternatively, utilizing [[bromine]], sulfur hexafluoride can be synthesized from SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at lower temperatures (e.g. 100 °C), as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Winter R.W., Pugh J.R. and Cook P.W. (Jan. 9-14, 2011). “SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: Their Bromine−facilitated Production &amp; a New Preparation Method for SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br”. 20th Winter Fluorine Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

: 2CoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)  →  SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2CoF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

There is virtually no reaction chemistry for {{chem|SF|6}}. A main contribution to the inertness of SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[steric hindrance]] of the sulfur atom, whereas its heavier group 16 counterparts, such as [[Selenium hexafluoride|SeF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] are more reactive than SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as a result of less steric hindrance (See hydrolysis example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Duward Shriver |author2=Peter Atkins |title=Inorganic Chemistry |year=2010 |publisher=W. H. Freeman |pages=409 |isbn=978-1429252553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not react with molten [[sodium]] below its boiling point,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry: Volume II |edition=12th |first1=Gurdeep |last1=Raj |publisher=GOEL Publishing House |year=2010 |isbn= |page=160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxRhA3MZg6AC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=qxRhA3MZg6AC&amp;pg=PA160 Extract of page 160]&lt;/ref&gt; but reacts [[exothermic]]ally with [[lithium]].

==Applications==

More than 10,000 tons of {{chem|SF|6}} are produced per year, most  of which (over 8,000 tons) is used as a [[dielectric gas|gaseous dielectric medium]] in the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Constantine T. Dervos |author2=Panayota Vassilou |title=Sulfur Hexafluoride: Global Environmental Effects and Toxic Byproduct Formation |year=2012 |publisher=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other main uses include an [[inert gas]] for the casting of [[magnesium]], and as an inert filling for [[insulated glazing]] windows.

===Dielectric medium===
{{chem|SF|6}}  is used in the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industry]] as a [[dielectric gas|gaseous dielectric medium]] for high-voltage [[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|circuit breakers]], [[switchgear]], and other [[electricity|electrical]] equipment, often replacing oil filled circuit breakers (OCBs) that can contain harmful [[PCBs]]. {{chem|SF|6}} gas under [[pressure]] is used as an insulator in [[switchgear|gas insulated switchgear]] (GIS) because it has a much higher [[dielectric strength]] than [[air]] or dry [[nitrogen]]. The high dielectric strength is a result of the gas's high [[electronegativity]] and [[density]]. This property makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. This makes GIS more suitable for certain purposes such as indoor placement, as opposed to air-insulated electrical gear, which takes up considerably more room. Gas-insulated electrical gear is also more resistant to the effects of pollution and climate, as well as being more reliable in long-term operation because of its controlled operating environment. Exposure to an arc chemically breaks down {{chem|SF|6}} though most of the decomposition products tend to quickly re-form {{chem|SF|6}}, a process termed "self-healing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.weidmann-solutions.cn/zhenduan/sulfur_hexaflouride.pdf | last1= Jakob | first1= Fredi | last2= Perjanik | first2= Nicholas | title= Sulfur Hexafluoride, A Unique Dielectric | publisher= Analytical ChemTech International, Inc. | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040552/http://www.weidmann-solutions.cn/zhenduan/sulfur_hexaflouride.pdf | archivedate= 2016-03-04 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrical arc|Arcing]] or [[Corona discharge|corona]] can produce [[disulfur decafluoride]] ([[Disulfur decafluoride|{{chem|S|2|F|10}}]]), a highly [[toxic]] gas, with toxicity similar to [[phosgene]]. {{chem|S|2|F|10}} was considered a potential [[chemical warfare]] agent in [[World War II]] because it does not produce [[lacrimation]] or skin irritation, thus providing little warning of exposure.

{{chem|SF|6}} is also commonly encountered as a high voltage dielectric in the high voltage supplies of [[particle accelerator]]s, such as [[Van de Graaff generator]]s and [[Pelletron]]s and high voltage transmission [[electron microscope]]s.

===Tracer compound===
Sulfur hexafluoride was the [[tracer gas]] used in the first [[roadway air dispersion model]] calibration; this research program was sponsored by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and conducted in [[Sunnyvale, California]] on [[U.S. Highway 101]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Air_pollution_line_source?topic=49506 |title=Air pollution line source |date=September 10, 2011 |author=C Michael Hogan |publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529064051/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Air_pollution_line_source?topic=49506 |archivedate=29 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaseous {{chem|SF|6}} is used as a tracer gas in short-term experiments of [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] efficiency in buildings and indoor enclosures, and for determining [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] rates. Two major factors recommend its use: its concentration can be measured with satisfactory accuracy at very low concentrations, and the [[Earth's atmosphere]] has a negligible concentration of {{chem|SF|6}}.

Sulfur hexafluoride was used as a non-toxic test gas in an experiment at [[St. John's Wood tube station]] in [[London]], United Kingdom on 25 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Poison gas' test on Underground |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6492501.stm |date=25 March 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215005754/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6492501.stm |archivedate=15 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gas was released throughout the station, and monitored as it drifted around.  The purpose of the experiment, which had been announced earlier in March by the [[Secretary of State for Transport]] [[Douglas Alexander]], was to investigate how toxic gas might spread throughout [[London Underground]] stations and buildings during a terrorist attack.

Sulfur hexafluoride is also routinely used as a tracer gas in laboratory fume hood containment testing.  The gas is used in the final stage of [[ASHRAE]] 110 fume hood qualification.  A plume of gas is generated inside of the fume hood and a battery of tests are performed while a gas analyzer arranged outside of the hood samples for SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to verify the containment properties of the fume hood.

It has been used successfully as a tracer in [[oceanography]] to study [[wikt:diapycnal|diapycnal]] mixing and air-sea gas exchange.

* For entertainment purposes, when breathed, {{chem|SF|6}} causes the voice to become significantly deeper, due to its density being so much higher than air, as seen in this video, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7XdOyZIkko here]. This is related to the more well-known effect of breathing low-density [[helium]], which causes someone's voice to become much higher.  Both of these effects should only be attempted with caution as these gases displace [[oxygen]] that the lungs are attempting to extract from the air. Sulfur hexafluoride is also mildly anesthetic. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1964594|title=Anesthetic Potencies of Sulfur Hexafluoride, Carbon Tetrafluoride, Chloroform and Ethrane in Dogs: Correlation with the Hydrate and Lipid Theories of Anesthetic Action|publisher=Anesthesiology - The Journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc|date=September 10, 1968|author=Edmond I Eger MD et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, {{chem|SF|6}} falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its use for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, {{chem|SF|6}} is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except [[high-voltage switchgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sustainability/climate-meps-give-gas-bill-green-boost/article-145749 |title=Climate: MEPs give F-gas bill a 'green boost' |date=13 October 2005 |publisher=EurActiv.com |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603001718/http://www.euractiv.com/sustainability/climate-meps-give-gas-bill-green-boost/article-145749 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in 2013 that a three-year effort by the [[United States Department of Energy]] to identify and fix leaks at its laboratories in the United States such as the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]], where the gas is used as a high voltage insulator, had been productive, cutting annual leaks by 35,000 pounds.

==Physiological effects and precautions==

Like xenon, sulfur hexafluoride is a non-toxic gas, yet by displacing oxygen in the lungs, it also carries the risk of [[asphyxia]] if too much is inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sulfur Hexaflouride|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+825|work=Hazardous Substances Data Bank|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=26 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021853/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+825|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being more dense than air, if a substantial quantity of gas is released it will settle in low-lying areas and present a significant risk of asphyxiation if the area is entered. This is particularly relevant to its use as an insulator in electrical equipment where workers may be in trenches or pits below equipment containing {{chem|SF|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the safe use of SF6 in gas|url=http://www.eurelectric.org/Download/Download.aspx?DocumentID=2136|publisher=[[UNIPEDE]]/[[EURELECTRIC]]|accessdate=2013-09-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224624/http://www.eurelectric.org/Download/Download.aspx?DocumentID=2136|archivedate=2013-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all gases, the density of {{chem|SF|6}} affects the resonance frequencies of the vocal tract, thus changing drastically the vocal sound qualities, or [[timbre]], of those who inhale it. It does not affect the vibrations of the vocal folds. The density of sulfur hexafluoride is relatively high at room temperature and pressure due to the gas's large [[molar mass]]. Unlike [[helium]], which has a molar mass of about 4&amp;nbsp;grams/mol and gives the voice a childish and a "[[Alvin and the Chipmunks|chipmunk]] like" quality, {{chem|SF|6}} has a molar mass of about 146&amp;nbsp;g/mol, and the speed of sound through the gas is about 134&amp;nbsp;m/s at room temperature, giving the voice a "demonic" quality when {{chem|SF|6}} is inhaled.&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/ |title=Thermophysical Properties of Fluid Systems |publisher=NIST |accessdate=10 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115211056/http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/ |archivedate=15 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thescienceexplorer.com/brain-and-body/have-you-ever-wanted-sound-demon-here-s-how|title=Have You Ever Wanted to Sound Like a Demon?

The surface of this material is [[etching|etched]] with billions of [[nanoscale]] pits, so that it emits wave at the specified wavelengths&lt;ref name=electronicsnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=gizmag/&gt; and suppresses other wavelengths which are not required.&lt;ref name=gizmag/&gt; When the surface is exposed to heat energy, it radiates light energy at required wavelengths.&lt;ref name=crazyengineers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crazyengineers.com/sun-free-photovoltaics-699/|title="Sun-Free" Photovoltaics!|publisher=crazyengineers.com|accessdate=2011-08-08|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atoms liberates free electrons when radiation is applied, thus generating electricity.&lt;ref name=msn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43989608/ns/technology_and_science-future_of_technology/|title=Solar cells need no sun, just heat to create energy - Promising new technology can turn nearly anything hot into a power source|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=2011-08-10|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
A device that uses [[radioisotopes]] is capable of producing electricity for up to 30 years without interruption using a process called [[radioactive decay]].&lt;ref name=electronicsnews/&gt; Another similar device was developed by researchers from [[MIT]], which uses [[butane]] as a fuel source. It has the size of a button and is estimated to operate three times longer than a similarly sized [[lithium-ion battery]]&lt;ref name=physorg/&gt; and has the advantage of recharging immediately upon refuelling.&lt;ref name=mit/&gt; [[Thermo-photovoltaics]], which is a technology developed in the 1960s, is capable of converting heat energy into electricity.&lt;ref name=mit/&gt; It was previously known that sunlight is not absolutely necessary for photovoltaic cells to operate.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt; Infrared radiation is not utilized efficiently in photovoltaic materials which are characterized by low [[band gap]],&lt;ref name=physorg/&gt; though the performance is comparatively better than normal silicon [[photovoltaic cell]]s.&lt;ref name=nanowerk/&gt; One example of photovoltaics utilizing heat is a photovoltaic diode which produces electricity from heat given off by a hydrocarbon fuelled thermal emitter.&lt;ref name=mit/&gt;

In Sun-free photovoltaics, the thermal emitter described above is finely tuned to emit specific wavelengths that the photovoltaic diode can utilize, while at the same time stopping the wavelengths that cannot be used by the diode.&lt;ref name=nanowerk/&gt; This is achieved by etching features of nanoscale like ridges and holes on a photonic crystal&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt; so that the light passing through the crystal can be modified.&lt;ref name=mit/&gt;

==Operation==
A slab of tungsten&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; is used as a thermal emitter with billions of nanoscale pits on the surface,&lt;ref name=mit/&gt; with each pit acting like a [[resonator]].&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt; On heating, specific wavelengths are radiated by the slab as it generates an altered [[emission spectrum]].&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt;

==Applications==
Sun-free photovoltaics can be applied in electronic devices like smartphones. Its value of current density has the capability to be tripled in the coming years, when it could power a smartphone for more than 20 days without needing to recharge in between.&lt;ref name=physorg/&gt; It can also be used to utilize [[waste heat]] from electric appliances like [[television]]s and electronic appliances like [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name=electronicsnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

The '''Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant''' is a 520 MW [[run-of-river]] [[hydroelectric]] project being constructed on [[Dhauliganga River]] in [[Chamoli District]] of [[Uttarakhand]], India. The plant is expected to generate over 2.5k GWh of electricity annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntpc.co.in/power-generation/hydro-based-power-projects/tapovan-vishnugad&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapovan Vishnugad is NTPC’s second hydro power project since its foray into the sector. The 520 MW run-of-the-river project is situated on river Dhauliganga in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. Its’ journey started with NTPC entering into an understanding with the Govt. of Uttarakhand for feasibility study for the project on 31.12.2002 and then signing the Implementation Agreement on 23.06.2004. Currently, it is in advanced stage of construction with around 70% of the implementation completed. The project has set its target for commissioning in first half on FY 2020-21.

The Foundation Stone of TVHPP was laid by Shri P M Saeed, the then Union Minister for Power, on 14th February 2005 in the august presence of Shri ND Tiwari, CM of Uttarakhand.

The power plant is located downstream on the [[Alaknanda River]] and will contain four 130 MW [[Pelton turbine]]-generators. The barrage is being constructed across the [[Dhauliganga River]] and has a catchment area of 3,100 sq km.

[[BHEL]] was awarded the contract to supply four 130MW Pelton type turbines for the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric power project. The contractual scope also included the testing, commissioning and operation of the generators, switchgear and excitation system.

The '''telluride''' [[ion]] is the [[anion]] [[tellurium|Te]]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and its derivatives. It is analogous to the other [[chalcogenide]] anions, the lighter [[oxide|O]]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[sulfide|S]]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[selenide|Se]]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and the heavier [[polonide|Po]]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The telluride anion is formed from the reduction of [[tellurium]] (Te) metal. The [[reduction potential|redox potential]] of pure Te metal is fairly negative, −1.14 V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.chem.indiana.edu/c360/documents/redpot.pdf/ "Standard Reduction Potentials"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228124421/http://courses.chem.indiana.edu/c360/documents/redpot.pdf |date=2013-02-28 }}, [[Indiana University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

:Te(s) + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ↔ Te&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

The acid hydride of tellurium, [[hydrogen telluride]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te, is an unstable compound that decomposes to tellurium metal.  It is strongly acidic, dissociating into a hydrogen telluride ion (HTe&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) in [[aqueous solution]]s. Like its [[sulfide]] and [[selenide]] counterparts, the Te&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; anion only exists in aqueous solutions in basic conditions.

==Organic tellurides==
''Tellurides'' also describe a class of [[organotellurium compound]]s formally derived from Te&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.  An illustrative member is [[dimethyl telluride]], which results from the [[methylation]] of telluride salts:
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I  +  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te   →  (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te  +  2 NaI
Dimethyl telluride is formed by the body when tellurium is ingested. Such compounds are often called telluroethers because they are structurally related to [[ether]]s with tellurium replacing oxygen, although the length of the C–Te bond is much longer than a C–O bond. C–Te–C angles tend to be closer to 90°.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, G., et al. ''Journal of Organometallic Chemistry'', 642 (2002) 186– 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inorganic tellurides==
Many metal tellurides are known, including some [[telluride mineral]]s. These include natural gold tellurides, like [[calaverite]] and [[krennerite]] (AuTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[sylvanite]] (AgAuTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Commercially, the tellurides are minor ores of gold, although they comprise the major naturally occurring compounds of gold. (A few other natural compounds of gold, such as the bismuthide [[maldonite]] (Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi) and antimonide [[aurostibite]] (AuSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), are known). Although the bonding in such materials is often fairly covalent, they are described casually as salts of Te&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;. Using this approach, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te is derived from Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Te&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.

Tellurides do not have any great economic importance. [[Cadmium telluride]] does however have [[photovoltaic]] properties, and both [[bismuth telluride]] and [[lead telluride]] are exceptional thermoelectric materials, although not commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebigblogtheory.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/s04e14-the-thesbian-catalyst/ "The Thespian Catalyst"], [[David Saltzberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T Green coat of arms Hilda.jpg|thumb|right|Company Coat of Arms]]
'''Thomas Green &amp; Son, Ltd.''' were engineers who manufactured a wide range of products at the Smithfield Foundry, [[Leeds]], [[United Kingdom]].

== Introduction ==
[[File:Smithfield Hotel North Street 01.jpg|thumb|right|Former offices on North Street: the clock has "T Green &amp; Son" instead of numbers]]
Thomas Green came to Leeds from [[Carlton-on-Trent]] near [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]] and founded the company in 1835. The company was originally located at 34 Lower Head Row (now Eastgate), Leeds, and specialised in all types of [[Chain link fencing|wirework]], including wire weaving and [[Galvanization|galvanising]]. The Smithfield Foundry site in North Street was purchased in 1848 and the first buildings were erected in 1850. In 1900 they took over the former Smithfield Hotel which became the front entrance and offices.&lt;ref name=Godward&gt;Brian Godward (2004) The Changing Face of Leeds (Sutton Publishing, Stroud) {{ISBN|0-7509-3413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 a [[London]] office was opened, principally to serve the overseas trade. This was followed in 1881 by the opening of the "Surrey Works" in [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], London. Improvements in trade led to the opening of the "New Surrey Works" in 1902.

==Products==

=== Lawnmowers ===
[[File:T Green roller 5 Sep 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Garden roller at [[Abbey House Museum]]]]
One of the products that Greens are most known for, the [[Lawn mower|lawnmower]], was first constructed in 1855. The earliest lawn mower was patented by E. B. Budding of [[Stroud, Gloucestershire]] in 1830. Green improved the Budding design by adding a [[Rake (tool)|rake]] to lift the grass and reducing its weight. In 1858 Greens machine won first prize at the first lawn mower trial conducted at the London Horticultural Gardens, [[Chiswick]]. A short-lived product, introduced in 1902, was the [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] lawnmower, targeted at groundsmen. Greens produced mowers in a wide range of sizes from 8in to 42in and these were given grand names, such as Silens Messor (Britain’s first chain driven mower) and Multum in Parvo (with little, much), and along with [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies|Ransomes]] of [[Ipswich]] and Shanks of [[Arbroath]], dominated the market until the [[World War I|First World War]].

=== Tram engines ===

One of the products that Greens became well known for was steam [[tram engine]]s. The use of steam tramways in Britain was effectively prohibited by the draconian rules contained in the so-called Red Flag Act or more correctly the [[Locomotive Act]]s of 1861 and 1865. The introduction of new regulations, The Highways &amp; Locomotives (Amendments) Act 1879 set out a more workable arrangement as follows:-

* Engine to be governed to prevent speeds in excess of 10&amp;nbsp;miles per hour
* No steam or smoke to be emitted
* Be free from noise produced by blast or clatter
* The machinery to be concealed from view at all points above 4&amp;nbsp;inch from rail level

Thomas Green commenced building tramway locomotives in 1885. These locomotives were initially of the Wilkinson’s patent, built under licence. This design used a vertical boiler and a vertically mounted engine which drove one set of wheels through gears. The second pair of wheels was driven through coupling rods. The exhaust passed through a chamber in the firebox to provide reheat, which in principle would make the steam invisible. The [[Governor (device)|speed governor]] was an "Allen" paddle type which acted on the [[Valve gear|reversing gear]].

Thirty-nine Wilkinson type trams were delivered before Green’s developed their own design using a horizontal boiler, inclined cylinders and [[Joy valve gear]]. The machine quickly evolved such that Green’s tram engines became one of the market leaders.

====Customers====

Some of Green's customers for steam tram engines were:

* [[Accrington Corporation Steam Tramways Company]]
* Birmingham &amp; Midland Tramways Ltd.
* [[Blackburn and Over Darwen Tramways Company]]
* [[Blackburn Corporation Tramways]] Ltd.
* Bradford Tramways &amp; Omnibus Company Ltd.
* Bradford &amp; Shelf Tramways Company Ltd.
* Coventry &amp; District Tramways Company
* [[Drypool and Marfleet Steam Tramways Company|Drypool &amp; Marfleet Steam Tramways Company]] (Hull)
* [[Dublin and Lucan Steam Tramway Company]]
* [[Dundee and District Tramways]]
* [[Huddersfield Corporation Tramways]]
* Leeds Tramways Company
* Manchester, Bury, Rochdale &amp; Oldham Steam Tramway Company
* North Shields &amp; Tynemouth District Tramways Ltd.
* Rossendale Valley Tramways Company
* St. Helens &amp; District Tramways Company Ltd.
* [[South Staffordshire and Birmingham District Steam Tramways Company]]
* [[Wolverton and Stony Stratford Tramway]]

Others were despatched to [[Penang]] and [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. According to Whitcombe, 157 were built, the last in 1898 for Kimberley, [[South Africa]].

In a letter written in 1936 by Mr C.V.Clark of Thomas Green, he explains how the tram locomotives were constructed and transported. ''“Do you remember me shewing you the engine shop down that back street? Well, the engine boiler, motion and wheels were put together on the ground floor. The body of mild steel-plate was completed on the top floor of the building, say 50&amp;nbsp;feet or more up, Then two large trap-doors were opened, and the job was lowered onto the business end of the affair and it only remained to be bolted to the frames and get steamed up. If Leeds were taking delivery, a lot of flat plates were laid down the street during the night, and by brute force and cuss words the engine was run up under it’s{{sic|?}} own steam, then slewed round and dropped in the tram-lines.”''

=== Railway locomotives ===
The first conventional locomotive, an [[0-4-0]] well tank, was built in 1888 for [[Australia]]. Subsequently nearly forty locomotives were built of side or saddle tank arrangement. Two were exported in 1908 through [[Robert Hudson (company)|Robert Hudson]]. In the period 1902 to 1904, three were bought for the construction of the Colsterdale Reservoir for [[Harrogate (borough)|Harrogate Corporation]]. These were HARROGATE and CLARO both [[0-4-2]] saddle tanks and MASHAM an [[0-6-2]] saddle tank. A similar 0-6-2 saddle tank locomotive BARBER was delivered to Harrogate Gas Company. Three locomotives complete with circular railways were constructed in 1895 for fairgrounds. Eight locomotives were sent to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], three [[2-6-2]] side tanks to the [[West Clare Railway]], three to the Dublin &amp; Blessington and two [[0-4-4]] side tanks to the Cork &amp; Muskerry Railway. In 1897, two 0-4-0 saddle tanks are recorded as being delivered to the Lima Railway, [[Peru]]. In 1920, the last locomotive of a series of nine was exported to Societe Generale de Paris, [[France]].

BARBER has survived and after many years in storage at Armley Mills Museum in Leeds and an unsuccessful attempt to overhaul it, this locomotive is now owned by the [[South Tynedale Railway]], Alston, Cumbria.  Due to the extensive nature of the overhaul that was required, it is now expected that this will be completed early in 2014 and the locomotive returned to steam for the first time since the 1940s. During 2014, there will be a special gala when BARBER and HARROGATE will be seen together in steam (sources - STR leaflet 2013; STR video re;spring gala 2012; STR fundraising leaflet).{{update after|2015|01|01}} The full overhaul has been made possible by private donations and grants from public bodies. It will haul passenger trains on the South Tynedale from Alston, across the Northumberland – Cumbria border, first to Lintley Halt and later, when the line is reopened about 2016, to the village of Slaggyford.

=== Road Rollers ===
[[File:Steam Roller Hilda, Thomas Green, Bury April 2017.jpg|thumb|right|T. Green Steam Roller at [[Bury Transport Museum]]]]
Thomas Green also produced a range of steam road vehicles including fairground centre-engines, [[Traction engine|road tractors]] and agricultural tractors. Perhaps their most well known product in this range was the [[steamroller]], which commenced in 1872 with a vertical boilered model for the Royal Gardens, [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. Shortly afterward, in 1880, a convertible model (i.e. traction engine or road roller) was introduced. A conventional horizontal boilered model followed this in 1881. The range was developed to encompass the whole range of weights (3&amp;nbsp;ton to 12&amp;nbsp;ton) and styles (tandem roller, triple roller) which enabled them to become one of the market leaders, with around 300 machines supplied.

With an eye on sports grounds, Greens introduced the first of a range of [[petrol engine]]d rollers in 1905. The [[diesel engine]]d DRM model in the 1930s, and lighter versions, the DRL and DRX, superseded these. In the 1960s, the "Workman" was designed together with a heavier model, the "Pacemaker."

=== Other products ===

Many other types of products were produced, including [[Gas engine|gas]] and [[Petrol engine|petrol]] engines, [[boiler]]s, [[Food processing|food-preparing]] machinery, [[stable]] furnishings, [[garden furniture]], [[Ironwork|ornamental gates and railings]]. There are still [[public house]]s in Leeds with Thomas Green [[cast iron]] tables. The firm also made about 50 portable [[Electrical generator|electric lighting]] sets between 1895 and 1901 chiefly for [[Showman|showmen]].

== Later history ==

During the [[World War I|First World War]] the works continued to produce road rollers alongside the inevitable military products such as [[Naval mine|Mine Sinkers]], [[Lathe]]s, [[Bomb]]s, [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar Shells]], [[Artillery wheel]]s. The manager during this period was George W Blackburn whose son Robert Blackburn founded the [[Blackburn &amp; General Aircraft Company|Blackburn Aeroplane Company]]. Indeed, some of Roberts’s early efforts were constructed at Smithfield foundry.

After the First World War the lawnmower trade was developed by fitting a "Young" [[Two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] engine to their hand machines. The engine was changed in 1922 to the "Dalman" and so successful was this combination that in 1923, Greens took on the manufacture of these engines. The introduction of engine manufacture inevitably led to further engine designs being developed to match the range of mowers being produced. Subsequently, gang mowers for [[cricket pitch]]es and [[playing field]]s became one of the main products, indeed such famous grounds as [[Headingley Stadium#Headingley Carnegie Cricket Ground|Headingley]] and [[Trent Bridge]] used Greens equipment.

Manufacturing during the [[World War II|Second World War]] consisted primarily of parts for [[Blackburn Aircraft]] and in 1951 this company took control of the business. With amalgamations in the aircraft industry, [[Hawker Siddeley]] took over the business in 1960, but this was not a successful marriage and in 1975 Greens were sold to Atkinsons of [[Clitheroe]] and the Leeds works closed.

[[File:5651RegulatorTubeInOperation.jpg|thumb|upright|5651 Regulator tube in operation]]

A '''voltage-regulator tube''' ('''VR tube''') is an [[Electronics|electronic]] component used as a [[voltage regulator#Shunt regulators|shunt regulator]] to hold a [[voltage]] constant at a pre-determined level.

Physically, these devices resemble [[vacuum tube]]s, but there are two main differences:
* Their glass envelopes are filled with a [[gas]] mixture, and
* They have a [[cold cathode]]; the [[cathode]] is not heated with a [[electrical filament|filament]] to emit electrons.

Electrically, these devices resemble [[Zener diode]]s, with the following major differences:
* They rely on gas [[ionization]], rather than [[Zener breakdown]]
* The unregulated supply voltage must be 15–20% above the nominal output voltage to ensure that the discharge starts
* The output can be higher than nominal if the current through the tube is too low.
When sufficient voltage is applied across the electrodes, the gas [[ionize]]s, forming a [[electric glow discharge|glow discharge]] around the [[cathode]] electrode. The VR tube then acts as a [[negative resistance]] device; as the [[electric current|current]] through the device increases, the amount of ionization also increases, reducing the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the device to further current flow. In this way, the device conducts sufficient current to hold the voltage across its terminals to the desired value.

Because the device would conduct a nearly unlimited amount of current, there must be some external means of limiting the current. Usually, this is provided by an external [[resistor]] upstream from the VR tube. The VR tube then conducts any portion of the current that does not flow into the downstream load, maintaining an approximately constant voltage across the VR tube's electrodes. The VR tube's regulation voltage was only guaranteed when conducting an amount of current within the allowable range.  In particular, if the current through the tube is too low to maintain ionization, the output voltage can rise above the nominal output—as far as the input supply voltage.  If the current through the tube is too high, it can enter an [[Electric arc|arc discharge]] mode where the voltage will be significantly lower than nominal and the tube may be damaged.

Some voltage-regulator tubes contained small amounts of [[radionuclide]]s to produce a more reliable ionization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/electrontubes.htm Electron Tubes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Corona discharge|''Corona'']] VR tube is a high-voltage version that's [[hydrogen]]-filled at close to atmospheric pressure, for voltages ranging from 400&amp;nbsp;V to 30&amp;nbsp;kV at tens of microamperes. It has a [[coaxial]] form; the outer cylindrical electrode is the cathode and the inner one is the anode. The voltage stability depends on the gas pressure.

== Specific models ==
In America, VR tubes were given [[RETMA tube designation|RETMA tube part numbers]]. Lacking a heater (filament), the tube's part numbers began with "[[List of vacuum tubes#"0 volt" gas-filled cold cathode tubes|0]]" (zero).

In Europe, VR tubes were given part numbers under the [[List of vacuum tubes#Professional tubes|professional system]] ("[[List of vacuum tubes#ZZ|ZZ1xxx]]") and under a [[List of vacuum tubes#Voltage stabilizers|dedicated system]].

In USSR, glow-discharge stabilitrons were given designation in Cyrillic with serial number of development.&lt;ref name="lec4"&gt;{{ru icon}} http://library.tuit.uz/skanir_knigi/book/baz.lek.elektronike/baz.lek.po.elek2.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232556/http://library.tuit.uz/skanir_knigi/book/baz.lek.elektronike/baz.lek.po.elek2.htm |date=2013-12-30 }} Lection 4 of [[Tashkent University of Information Technologies]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "СГ21Б", "СГ204К" and i.e.&lt;ref name="lec4"/&gt;

VR tubes were only available in certain voltages. Common models were:

==Design considerations ==
The pinout of VR tubes was designed so that power could be forced to flow "through" the VR tubes to the load. That is, the load current would flow in one pin of the VR tube and out through a second pin. In this way, the circuit could be arranged so that unplugging the VR tube would disconnect the load. (Otherwise, unplugging the VR tube would have allowed the voltage to become unregulated, possibly rising as high as the source voltage and damaging the downstream load.)

Because the glow discharge is a "statistical" process, a certain amount of electrical noise is introduced into the regulated voltage as the level of ionization varies. In most cases, this could be easily filtered out by placing a small [[capacitor]] in parallel with the VR tube or using an RC decoupling network downstream of the VR tube. Too large a capacitance (&gt;0.1μF for an 0D3, for instance), however, and the circuit will form a [[relaxation oscillator]], definitely ruining the voltage regulation and possibly causing the tube to fail catastrophically.

VR tubes could be operated in [[series circuit|series]] for greater voltage ranges. They could not be operated in [[parallel circuit|parallel]]: because of manufacturing variations, the current would not be shared equally among several tubes in parallel. (Note the equivalent behavior with series and parallel connected Zener diodes.)

Presently, VR tubes have been almost-entirely supplanted by [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] regulators based on [[Zener diode]]s and [[avalanche diode|avalanche breakdown diode]]s.

==VR tube information==
Correctly operating VR tubes glow during normal operation. The color of the glow varies depending upon the gas mixture used to fill the tubes.

Though they lack a heater, VR tubes often do become warm during operation due to the current and voltage drop through them.

A '''Wilberforce pendulum''', invented by British physicist [[Lionel Robert Wilberforce]] around 1896,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is an example of a [[Coupled oscillation|coupled mechanical oscillator]], often used as a demonstration in [[physics]] education.  The mass can both bob up and down on the spring, and rotate back and forth about its vertical axis with [[Torsion spring|torsional]] vibrations.  When correctly adjusted and set in motion, it exhibits a curious motion in which periods of purely rotational oscillation gradually alternate with periods of purely up and down oscillation.  The energy stored in the device shifts slowly back and forth between the translational 'up and down' oscillation mode and the torsional 'clockwise and counterclockwise' oscillation mode, until the motion eventually dies away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Despite the name, in normal operation it does not swing back and forth as ordinary [[pendulum]]s do.  The mass usually has opposing pairs of radial 'arms' sticking out horizontally, threaded with small weights that can be screwed in or out to adjust the [[moment of inertia]] to 'tune' the torsional vibration [[Periodic function|period]].

==Explanation==
[[Image:Wilberforce pendulum.jpg|thumb|Wilberforce pendulum, 1908]]
The device's intriguing behavior is caused by a slight coupling between the two motions or degrees of freedom, due to the geometry of the spring.  When the weight is moving up and down, each downward excursion of the spring causes it to unwind slightly, giving the weight a slight twist.  When the weight moves up, it causes the spring to wind slightly tighter, giving the weight a slight twist in the other direction.  So when the weight is moving up and down, each oscillation gives a slight alternating rotational [[torque]] to the weight.  In other words, during each oscillation some of the energy in the translational mode leaks into the rotational mode.  Slowly the up and down movement gets less, and the rotational movement gets greater, until the weight is just rotating and not bobbing. 

Similarly, when the weight is rotating back and forth, each twist of the weight in the direction that unwinds the spring also reduces the spring tension slightly, causing the weight to sag a little lower.  Conversely, each twist of the weight in the direction of winding the spring tighter causes the tension to increase, pulling the weight up slightly.  So each oscillation of the weight back and forth causes it to bob up and down more, until all the energy is transferred back from the rotational mode into the translational mode and it is just bobbing up and down, not rotating.

==Alternation or 'beat' frequency==
The [[frequency]] at which the two modes alternate is equal to the difference between the oscillation frequencies of the modes.  The closer in frequency the two motions are, the slower will be the alternation between them.  This behavior, common to all [[Coupled oscillation|coupled oscillators]], is analogous to the phenomenon of [[beat (acoustics)|beat]]s in musical instruments, in which two tones combine to produce a 'beat' tone at the difference between their frequencies.  For example, if the pendulum bobs up and down at a rate of f&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = 4&amp;nbsp;Hz, and rotates back and forth about its axis at a rate of f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.1&amp;nbsp;Hz, the alternation rate f&lt;sub&gt;alt&lt;/sub&gt; will be:

&lt;math&gt;f_{alt} = f_R - f_T = 0.1\; \mathrm{Hz}&lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt;T_{alt} = 1 / f_{alt} = 10\; \mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;

So the motion will change from rotational to translational in 5 seconds and then back to rotational in the next 5 seconds.

The pendulum is usually adjusted by moving the moment of inertia adjustment weights in or out equal amounts on each side, until the rotational frequency is close to the translational frequency, so the alternation period will be slow enough to allow the change between the two modes to be clearly seen.

The '''winter of 2009–2010 in Europe''' was unusually cold. Globally, unusual weather patterns brought cold, moist air from the north. Weather systems were undergoing [[cyclogenesis]] from North American storms moving across the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and saw many parts of Europe experiencing heavy snowfall and record-low temperatures. This led to a number of deaths, widespread transport disruption, power failures and postponed sporting events.

=={{anchor|Causes}}Cause==
The cold weather was caused by high pressure over [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]] forcing weather patterns southward, a phenomenon described by meteorologists as the [[Arctic Oscillation]] and also the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] which were negative compared to normal.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article6982249.ece| title= Life in the deep freeze| work = www.timesonline.co.uk|date = 10 January 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604144717/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article6982249.ece| archivedate =4 June 2011 |author = Richard Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] in Winter 2009/10 was lower than during any winter in over a century and this resulted in more easterly winds bringing cold air into Northern Europe from Siberia and the Arctic.

Light snowfall occurred in the UK on 16 December and weather warnings were given on most local TV stations; there were some traffic jams towards the south. The snow later spread towards France and northern Spain. In mainland Europe, early snowfall was seen across much of the western half of the continent. On 17 December, the Swiss canton of [[Grisons]] saw a record-low overnight temperature of −32&amp;nbsp;°C (−25.6&amp;nbsp;°F). This snowfall led to the shutdown of [[Utrecht Centraal]] (the largest rail hub in the Netherlands). While snowfall on highways led to the busiest morning rush hour of 2009, with a total of 671&amp;nbsp;km (417 m) in traffic jams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/361576/Drukste-ochtendspits-van-het-jaar.html|title= Drukste ochtendspits van het jaar|publisher= De Pers|date = 17 December 2009|accessdate= 21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, heavy overnight [[snowfall]] caused widespread disruption across large parts of the [[South East England|South East]], [[East Anglia]], the [[East Midlands]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] in Britain. This snow was in the north half of a depression with east winds centred south of England. Several deaths attributed to the cold weather were reported.&lt;ref name=Gera &gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gV8Rxf2WHME7XwVV0USEblrKvHxQ|title= Subfreezing weather batters Europe, causing deaths and travel havoc|publisher= The Canadian Press|first= Vanessa|last= Gera|date= 20 December 2009|accessdate= 20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night of 18–19 December, five [[Eurostar]] trains were stuck in the [[Channel Tunnel]], trapping more than 2,000 people for up to 16 hours after the vehicles suffered electrical failures because of freezing overnight temperatures. Passengers were without heating, lighting and [[air-conditioning]] for several hours while food and water ran out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/World/Story/STIStory_468802.html|title= Cold snap lashes Europe|publisher= The Straites Times|date= 20 December 2009|accessdate= 20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some passengers were evacuated via service tunnels to car trains, while others were kept on their trains until the trains could be towed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8421875.stm|title= Thousands freed from Channel Tunnel after trains fail|publisher= BBC News|date= 19 December 2009|accessdate= 19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurostar added special services on the evening of 19 December to transport "vulnerable passengers" between London, Paris and Brussels.

On 20 December in the [[Netherlands]], the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute ([[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]]) issued an official weather alarm for the entire country following heavy snowfall ({{convert|15|-|20|cm|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the west, which eventually spread to the entire country. In most cities bus services were halted and tram service was halted in all four major cities.

In the Netherlands and Belgium, road salt used to keep the roads clear of snow and ice was running out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/255161/Strooizouttekort-dreigt-Van-der-Hoeven-schiet-te-hulp.htm|title= Strooizouttekort dreigt; Van der Hoeven schiet te hulp (Dutch)|publisher= Elsevier|date= 7 January 2010|accessdate= 7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National and secondary schools in Ireland were supposed to open after the Christmas break on this day; however, many were forced to close because of weather conditions. On 8 January, the Minister for Education announced that all schools were to remain closed until at least Thursday, 14 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0108/educationweather.html |title=RTÉ News: All schools to close until Thursday |publisher=RTÉ|date= |accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the [[Luas]] [[Green Line (Luas)|Green line]] there were difficulties getting up slopes, such as those between [[Harcourt Street railway station|Harcourt]] and Charlemont and between [[Beechwood]] and Cowper. This had caused some delays (especially when salt was scarce for sand tanks on the trams) for [[Dublin]] pedestrians. Major [[reservoirs]] in [[County Cork]], [[County Dublin]] and [[County Limerick]] were critically low; in areas such as [[County Laois]] and the rural areas of County Cork, bottled water was supplied by the Irish army. This had also been done for the people affected by floods in October and November 2009. The [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] issued its second alert in three days, asking suppliers to provide more gas and some businesses to switch to other power sources, as gas usage hit record levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8446487.stm|title= Gas usage set to hit new record|publisher= BBC News|date= 7 January 2010|accessdate= 7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow fell heavily in some parts of Spain. Prades (Tarragona, southern Catalonia) sported a 120&amp;nbsp;cm snow cover after a 30-plus- hour storm,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which led to an 18-hour closure of the AP7 motorway at La Jonquera (at the Spanish/French border).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20100108/nieve-mantiene-cortadas-siete-carreteras-red-principal-puerto-san-glorio/310595.shtml |title=La nieve mantiene cortadas siete carreteras de la red principal y el puerto de San Glorio|publisher=Radio y Televisión Española |date= |accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow showers persisted in the east of the UK. In the far south east, snow showers merged into longer and more persistent areas of snow. A low temperature of {{convert|-14.5|°C|1}} was recorded at Tulloch Bridge. The football schedule was also heavily affected by the snowfall; all but seven games (two in both the [[Premier League]] and [[Football League One|League 1]] and three in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]) were postponed in England, and all but five [[Scottish Cup]] games were played in Scotland.

Belgium was covered with another thick layer of snow, in some central provinces (such as [[Flemish Brabant]]) as deep as {{convert|10|cm}}. Since the snow (and possible traffic chaos) had been forecast for several days, this resulted in few people leaving their homes; traffic accidents were minor and few.

A large [[Low-pressure area|depression]] moved into the [[Western Approaches]] from the Atlantic on 10 January and began to infiltrate the coldest areas of Britain, bringing a thaw to southwest England. The weather in London cleared, allowing for transport access (particularly by road) across all areas of north and central London. A heavy snowstorm, named "Daisy", struck northern Germany on 9 and 10 January. Especially along the coast and on the islands of [[Usedom]], [[Rügen]] and [[Fehmarn]], snowdrifts made roads, parts of [[autobahn 20|the coastal autobahn]] and rail tracks impassable. In northern [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] and eastern [[Schleswig-Holstein]] secondary roads were closed and trains cancelled, while snowplows and excavators struggled to keep the main routes free. Since the storms were accumulating increasingly large snowbanks, hundreds of cars were stranded on [[Bundesautobahn 20|Autobahn 20]] near [[Jarmen]] during the night, and a train derailed after striking a snowbank near [[Miltzow]].&lt;ref name="SPON10Jan10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,671060,00.html|title=Tief "Daisy".

Parts of southern Spain, such as [[Seville]], saw their first snow since 1954.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

On 11 January, England and Wales continued to feel the effects of the depression in the [[Western Approaches]]. In the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Education ordered all schools to close for the day due to heavy snowfall.

Due to a mix of bitter cold and the milder system trying to push in from the [[Atlantic]], heavy snowfall in the United Kingdom resumed; there were fresh accumulations (on top of existing snow) of up to 15 centimetres (6&amp;nbsp;inches) on 12 January in [[Wales]] and [[South-west England]]. Snow later fell in [[English Midlands|The Midlands]] and [[South-east England]]. In [[Holmfirth]] and [[Barnsley]] in north England, [[freezing rain]] or [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]] fell onto deep-frozen roads; this created so much [[black ice]] that some people found that the only safe way to move about on roads was by [[Gait (human)#Crawls|crawling]].&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC TV]] news&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital accident and emergency units in the Sheffield, Rotherham and Barnsley areas of South Yorkshire reported being inundated by people with fractures and sprains after slipping on what one Council official in Sheffield described as the worst black ice seen in the area in living memory.

Many schools were again closed across England and Wales, and there were many road accidents and closures. The [[M25 motorway]] was down to one lane between [[Leatherhead]] and [[Reigate]]; roads across southern Great Britain were untreated, wreaking havoc on commuters. [[Gatwick]] and [[Birmingham]] airports were closed, and many flights were delayed at [[Heathrow]]. During 13 January the weather system continued north, affecting much of [[Northern England]] before reaching [[Scotland]]. Parts of northern France were also affected by snowfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More roads misery on "coldest day" |url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/21/20100113/tuk-more-roads-misery-on-coldest-day-6323e80.html |date=13 January 2010 |newspaper=[[Press Association]] |accessdate=13 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115115647/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/21/20100113/tuk-more-roads-misery-on-coldest-day-6323e80.html |archivedate=15 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 22 people died due to lower temperatures in [[Romania]] over a five-day period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-ultima_ora-6843711-gerul-provocat-22-decese-ultimele-cinci-zile.htm |title=Gerul a provocat 22 de decese in ultimele cinci zile – Ultima ora |publisher=HotNews.ro |date= |accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/stiri/meteo/mai-frig-ca-la-polul-nord-temperaturile-din-romania-mai-scazute-ca-in-nordul-continentului_90311.html |title=Mai frig ca la Polul Nord Temperaturile din Romania mai scazute ca in Alaska |publisher=Antena3.ro |date= |accessdate=15 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317041023/http://www.antena3.ro/stiri/meteo/mai-frig-ca-la-polul-nord-temperaturile-din-romania-mai-scazute-ca-in-nordul-continentului_90311.html |archivedate=17 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/stiri/romania/au-murit-de-frig-11-decese-din-cauza-gerului-in-ultimele-24-de-ore_90318.html |title=Au murit de frig 11 decese din cauza gerului in ultimele 24 de ore |publisher=Antena3.ro |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=15 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129042634/http://antena3.ro/stiri/romania/au-murit-de-frig-11-decese-din-cauza-gerului-in-ultimele-24-de-ore_90318.html |archivedate=29 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/english/cold-weather-kills-11-people-in-romania-health-ministry-5194135 |title=Cold Weather Kills 11 People in Romania – Health Ministry – Mediafax |publisher=Mediafax |date= |accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Sweden's official stations averaged below {{convert|0|C|F}} in terms of daily high, which is highly unusual.

By the end of the month, the unusual cold had spread from primarily the south to the north of [[Sweden]]. Although winters of 1966 and 1985 were much colder, the average low of coastal [[Luleå]] still measured at {{convert|-21.2|C|F}} and inland more southern locality [[Lycksele]] at {{convert|-22.4|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_feb10.pdf?84120|title=Temperature &amp; Wind February 2010|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further south a night low of {{convert|-29.7|C|F}} was measured in [[Gävle]] not far north of capital Stockholm.

A massive [[snowstorm]] travelled north through the UK until it reached [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], where it stayed for 61 hours. The [[Met Office]] issued emergency and extreme-weather warnings for Scotland and Northern Ireland for severe [[blizzard]]s, very heavy snow, heavy rain, gale-force winds, and severe drifting. On 29 March, snow began to fall heavily over Scotland and Northern Ireland; however, the 30th was far more severe, as gusts up to 80&amp;nbsp;mph brought trees down. There were accumulations of 30–60&amp;nbsp;cm of snow in Northern Ireland and Scotland; 3&amp;nbsp;ft of snow fell on [[Aviemore]].

On 31 March, a girl was killed in [[Lanarkshire]] when a [[school bus]] skidded on ice and crashed. Over 70,000 homes in Northern Ireland and Scotland were without power, and newborn [[domestic sheep|lamb]]s died in the extreme weather conditions. Thousands of cars were stranded on roads during the day; 300 cars were stranded in Northern Ireland by 5-foot [[snowdrift]]s. Strong winds brought down trees and created waves up to 20&amp;nbsp;ft. [[Travel trailer|Caravan]]s at Kingshorn were destroyed and a [[marina]] in the [[Lothians]] was bombarded and demolished by a surge of rain-driven waves. A [[seal (animal)|seal]] at St. Andrews Sea Life Centre went missing in the strong waves, and a river in [[Musselburgh]] overflowed. This snow event was the second-most disruptive of this winter in the UK.

==={{anchor|Airports|Trains|Roads and buses}}United Kingdom===

The following airports were at some point closed: [[London Gatwick Airport]], [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[Birmingham International Airport, West Midlands|Birmingham Airport]], [[Cardiff Airport]], [[London Luton Airport]], [[George Best Belfast City Airport]], [[Southampton Airport]], [[Blackpool International Airport]], [[Newcastle Airport]], [[Durham Tees Valley Airport]], [[Exeter International Airport]], [[Plymouth City Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]], [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], [[Manchester Airport]], [[Leeds Bradford Airport]], [[Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield]] and [[Bristol Airport]]. Some train services ran with revised timetables. Trains in Kent were delayed for up to three and a half hours, with hundreds of travellers left stranded. In late December, [[Eurostar]] trains from Paris or [[Brussels]] towards [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras station]] were [[Eurostar#Snowfall consequences|severely delayed]], with delays of up to 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Passengers trapped on Eurostar trains relive ordeal|publisher =BBC News|date=19 December 2009|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8422305.stm|accessdate = 7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Eurostar services were cancelled from 19–21 December; delays and service cancellations continued after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/customer_care/questions_answers.jsp |title=– Questions and Answers |publisher=Eurostar|date= |accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buses on the [[Isle of Wight]], [[Gloucester]] (skeleton service was being run in [[Gloucester]] during Wednesday 6 January) and across southern [[Hampshire]] were suspended on 5 January owing to heavy snowfall, leaving a large number of people stranded. Limited services were back in operation on 7 January in [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]] on the mainland and between [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]] and the other main towns on the [[Isle of Wight]]. All services in [[Gosport]], [[Fareham]], [[Locks Heath]], [[Titchfield]], [[Whiteley]] and [[Warsash]] areas were suspended and remained so for two days because of road conditions.  As of 8 January, one service was running between [[Gosport]] and [[Fareham]] and one between [[Fareham]] and [[Southampton]] (although this service was unable to serve Locks Heath or Titchfield). The [[A3 road|A3]] and the A3(M) around [[Horndean]] and the [[Hindhead]] area and the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] experienced disruption; many minor roads were closed and only the main motorway and A-road network were passable for much of 5, 6 and 7 January. In [[North East England]] the A1(M) and A19 suffered challenging conditions (mainly in the evenings and at night) as a result of temperatures dropping to well below zero Celsius. Bus service between Newcastle and Sunderland experienced some disruption, as local operators suspended services but the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] was an alternative which was only subject to delays due to the temperatures.

All schools were ordered to close for a day on Monday 11 January, due to the snow. Dublin's tram service [[Luas]] was badly affected; most drivers and bus riders were afraid to travel on the ice-covered roads.

==={{anchor|Trains|Snow removal}}Finland===

Long-distance railway traffic to and from [[Helsinki]] halted between 19 and 22 February. Cold weather, blizzards and drifting snow blocked 300 rail switches at the Ilmala rail yard, making traffic impossible. More than half the long-distance trains were cancelled, leaving hundreds of Lapland-bound winter holiday travellers stranded at [[Helsinki railway station|Helsinki Central Railway station]]. Trains which were not cancelled ran several hours late. The amount of [[Snow removal|snow cleared]] from [[Helsinki]] streets and transferred to [[snow collection site]]s was 210,000 truckloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Helsingin lumitalkoissa on rikottu kaikki ennätykset |author=Jenita Sillanpää |journal=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |date=6 March 2011 |url=http://omakaupunki.hs.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/helsingin_lumitalkoissa_on_rikottu_kaikki_ennatykset/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Star formation}}

'''Young stellar object''' ('''YSO''') denotes a star in its early stage of evolution. This class consists of two groups of objects: [[protostar]]s and [[pre-main-sequence star]]s.

==Classification by spectral energy distribution==
A star forms by accumulation of material that falls in to a protostar from a [[circumstellar disk]] or envelope. Material in the disk is cooler than the surface of the protostar, so it radiates at longer wavelengths of light producing excess infrared emission. As material in the disk is depleted, the infrared excess decreases. Thus, YSOs are usually classified into evolutionary stages based on the slope of their [[spectral energy distribution]] in the mid-[[infrared]], using a scheme introduced by Lada (1987). He proposed three classes (I, II and III), based on the values of intervals of [[spectral index]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="Lada1987"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Star Formation: From OB Associations to Protostars |title=Star Forming Regions: Proceedings of the 115th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union Held in Tokyo, Japan, November 11–15, 1985 |publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |first=Charles J. |last=Lada |editor1-first=Manuel |editor1-last=Peimbert |editor2-first=Jun |editor2-last=Jugaku |pages=1-17 |date=1987 |bibcode=1987IAUS..115....1L |isbn=978-90-277-2388-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{d\log(\lambda F_\lambda)}{d\log(\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;\lambda \,&lt;/math&gt; is wavelength, and &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[Luminous flux|flux]] density.

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha \,&lt;/math&gt; is calculated in the wavelength interval of 2.2–20 &lt;math&gt;{\mu}m&lt;/math&gt; ([[near-infrared|near-]] and [[mid-infrared]] region). Andre ''et al.'' (1993) discovered a class 0: objects with strong submillimeter emission, but very faint at &lt;math&gt;{\lambda}&lt;10{\mu}m&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Andre1993"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Submillimeter Continuum Observations of &lt;math&gt;{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; Ophiuchi A: The Candidate Protostar VLA 1623 and Prestellar Clumps |journal=The Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |first1=Philippe |last1=Andre |first2=Derek |last2=Ward-Thompson |first3=Mary |last3=Barsony |volume=406 |issue=1 |pages=122-141 |date=March 1993 |doi=10.1086/172425 |bibcode=1993ApJ...406..122A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greene ''et al.'' (1994) added a fifth class of "flat spectrum" sources.&lt;ref name="Greene1994"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Further Mid-infrared Study of the &lt;math&gt;{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; Ophiuchi Cloud Young Stellar Population: Luminosities and Masses of Pre-main-sequence Stars |journal=The Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 |first1=Thomas P. |last1=Greene |first2=Bruce A. |last2=Wilking |first3=Philippe |last3=Andre |first4=Erick T. |last4=Young |first5=Charles J. |last5=Lada |volume=434 |issue=2 |pages=614-626 |date=October 1994 |doi=10.1086/174763 |bibcode=1994ApJ...434..614G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Class 0''' sources – undetectable at &lt;math&gt;{\lambda}&lt;20{\mu}m&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Class I''' sources have &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&gt;0.3&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Flat spectrum''' sources have &lt;math&gt;0.3&gt;{\alpha}&gt;-0.3&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Class II''' sources have &lt;math&gt;-0.3&gt;{\alpha}&gt;-1.6&lt;/math&gt;
*'''Class III''' sources have &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;-1.6&lt;/math&gt;

This classification schema roughly reflects evolutionary sequence. It is believed that most deeply embedded Class 0 sources evolve towards Class I stage, dissipating their [[circumstellar envelope]]s. Eventually they become optically visible on the [[stellar birthline]] as pre-main-sequence stars.

Class II objects have circumstellar disks and correspond roughly to classical [[T Tauri star]]s, while Class III stars have lost their disks and correspond approximately to weak-line T Tauri stars. An intermediate stage where disks can only be detected at longer wavelengths (e.g., at &lt;math&gt;24{\mu}m&lt;/math&gt;) are known as transition-disk objects.

==Characteristics==
YSOs are also associated with early star evolution phenomena: [[astrophysical jet|jet]]s and [[bipolar outflow]]s, [[Astrophysical maser|masers]], [[Herbig–Haro object]]s, and [[protoplanetary disk]]s (circumstellar disks or proplyds).

==Classification of YSOs by mass==
These stars may be differentiated by mass: Massive YSOs, intermediate-mass YSOs, and [[brown dwarf]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2855">'''Zel'dovich mechanism''' is a chemical mechanism that describes the oxidation of nitrogen and [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;]] formation, first proposed by the Russian scientists [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]], [[David A. Frank-Kamenetskii]] and P. Ya. Sadovnikov in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldovich, Y. A., D. Frank-Kamenetskii, and P. Sadovnikov. Oxidation of nitrogen in combustion. Publishing House of the Acad of Sciences of USSR, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Forman A. "Combustion theory". (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeldovich, I. A., Barenblatt, G. I., Librovich, V. B., Makhviladze, G. M. (1985). Mathematical theory of combustion and explosions.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction mechanisms read as

:&lt;chem&gt;{N2} + O &lt;-&gt;[k_1] {NO} + {N},&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;{N} + O2 &lt;-&gt;[k_2] {NO} + {O},&lt;/chem&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; are the reaction rate constants in [[Arrhenius law]]. The overall global reaction is given by

:&lt;chem&gt; {N2} + {O2} &lt;-&gt;[k] 2NO.&lt;/chem&gt;

The overall reaction rate is mostly governed by the first reaction (i.e., [[Rate-determining step|rate-determining reaction]]), since the second reaction is much faster than the first reaction and occurs immediately following the first reaction. At fuel-rich conditions, due to lack of oxygen, reaction 2 becomes weak, hence, a third reaction is included in the mechanism, also known as '''extended Zel'dovich mechanism''' (with all three reactions),&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, G. A., Heywood, J. B., Keck, J. C. (1970). Experimental and theoretical study of nitric oxide formation in internal combustion engines. Combustion science and technology, 1(4), 313–326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, R. K., Salimian, S. (1984). Survey of rate constants in the N/H/O system. In Combustion chemistry (pp. 361–421). Springer, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;{N} + {OH} &lt;-&gt;[k_3] {NO} + {H}.&lt;/chem&gt;

The forward [[rate constant]]s of the reactions are given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.eng.ucsd.edu/mae/groups/combustion/mechanism.html |title=San Diego Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
k_{1f} &amp;= 1.47\times 10^{13} \, T^{0.3} e^{-75286.81/RT},\\
k_{2f} &amp;= 6.40\times 10^9 \, T e^{-6285.5/RT}, \\
k_{3f} &amp;= 3.80\times 10^{13},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[pre-exponential factor]] is measured in units of cm, mol, s and K, temperature in [[kelvin]]s, and the [[activation energy]] in cal/mol; ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]].

==NO formation==
The rate of [[Nitric oxide|NO]] concentration is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d[\mathrm{NO}]}{dt}= k_{1f} [\mathrm{N}_2] [\mathrm{O}] + k_{2f} [\mathrm{N}] [\mathrm{O}_2] + k_{3f} [\mathrm{N}] [\mathrm{OH}] - k_{1b} [\mathrm{NO}] [\mathrm{N}] - k_{2b} [\mathrm{NO}] [\mathrm{O}] - k_{3b} [\mathrm{NO}] [\mathrm{H}].&lt;/math&gt;
