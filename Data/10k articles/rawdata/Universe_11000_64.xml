The '''Sverdlovsk plane crash''' of 5 January 1950 killed all 19 persons on board, including almost the entire [[ice hockey]] team ([[VVS Moscow]]) of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] – 11 players, as well as a [[Team physician|team doctor]] and a masseur. The team was on board a twin-engined [[Lisunov Li-2]] transport aircraft, a licensed Soviet-built version of the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], heading to a match against the [[Dzerzhinets Chelyabinsk|Dzerzhinets]] ([[Chelyabinsk]]) (Traktor Chelyabinsk) hockey club. Due to poor weather at Chelyabinsk, the flight diverted to [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]. The crew attempted four approaches but during the fifth approach to [[Koltsovo Airport]] at Sverdlovsk in the [[Soviet Union]]{{'}}s [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]], the aircraft crashed near the airport in a heavy snowstorm with strong winds.&lt;ref name="olympic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=102155|title=Athletes - Famous Olympic Athletes, Medalists, Sports Heroes|date=9 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team players Viktor Shuvalov and Vsevolod Bobrov were not on the flight; Bobrov overslept and took the train instead, and Shuvalov was injured.

In memory of the crash victims, a memorial was erected near the common grave in [[Koltsovo, Yekaterinburg|Koltsovo]].

== Reaction of Vasiliy Stalin ==
The crash occurred two and a half weeks after the 70th birthday of [[Joseph Stalin]]. According to a recent news article, Stalin's son [[Vasily Dzhugashvili]], an Air Force commander of the [[Moscow Military District]] and the patron of the ice hockey team, was afraid of his father's possible reaction and of the crash investigation; he decided to recruit a new Air Force team in less than a day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/world/europe/08russia.html|title=Crash Wipes Out Russian Hockey Team, Killing N.H.L.

The '''Australian Energy Regulator (AER)''' is the regulator of the wholesale electricity and gas markets in Australia. It is part of the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] and enforces the rules established by the [[Australian Energy Market Commission]].

The AER was established in July 2005. The next year all 13 bodies previously responsible for energy regulation had transferred responsibility to the AER.&lt;ref name="aep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=10069 |title=Australia: Energy profile |work=Energy Publisher |publisher=EnerPub |accessdate=27 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001080326/http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=10069 |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions made by the regulator are subject to appeal.

==Functions==
The AER’s current functions are focused on regulating the natural monopoly transmission and distribution sectors of the national electricity market, monitoring the wholesale electricity market and enforcing electricity market rules. The AER's regulatory functions and powers are conferred upon it by the national electricity law and the national electricity rules. 

Under the national electricity law and national electricity rules, the AER’s key responsibilities at the present time include:

* regulating the revenues of transmission network service providers by establishing revenue caps 
* regulating the revenues of distribution network service providers 
* monitoring the electricity wholesale market 
* monitoring compliance with the national electricity law, national electricity rules and national electricity regulations 
* investigating breaches or possible breaches of provisions of the national electricity law, rules and regulations 
* instituting and conducting enforcement proceedings against relevant market participants 
* establishing service standards for electricity transmission network service providers  
* establishing ring-fencing guidelines for business operations with respect to regulated transmission services 
* exempting network service providers from registration.
==Staff==
The AER board currently has three members who are statutory appointments, including a full-time chair. Ms Paula Conboy is the Chair of the AER. Part IIIAA of the Trade Practices Act provides that one of the members of the AER must be a commissioner of the ACCC, with Ms Cristina Cifuentes appointed in this capacity. Mr Jim Cox is the AER member selected by the States and Territories.

'''Autolib'''' was an [[electric car|electric]] [[car sharing]] service which was inaugurated in [[Paris]], France, in December 2011. It closed on July 31st 2018.&lt;ref name=website&gt;https://www.autolib.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; It was operated by the [[Bolloré]] industrial group, and complemented the city's [[bike sharing]] scheme, [[Velib']], which was set up in 2007. The Autolib' scheme maintained a fleet of [[electric car|all-electric]] [[Bolloré Bluecar]]s for public use on a paid subscription basis, employing a citywide network of parking and [[charging station]]s.&lt;ref name=Econom0911&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528681?frsc=dg|title=All charged up for sharing|work=[[The Economist]]|date=10 September 2011|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gRjBY0fNQ1aBoJrGt9N1pYfekzwQ?docId=CNG.b55c97688ff9e8fbe0e4915e511e1a6e.211 "Autolib' in the Paris region: dissenting voices before the official launch"].

==History==
The Autolib' system was a follow-up to Paris' successful [[Velib']] [[bike sharing]] scheme, which began operations in 2007. The system's electric cars were supplied by the [[Bolloré]] industrial group, as the result of a collaboration with the Italian automotive firm [[Pininfarina]].&lt;ref name=bikeradar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/move-over-velib-autolib-is-on-its-way-17274|title=Move over Velib, Autolib is on its way|author= Mark Appleton|publisher=Bike Radar|date=30 June 2008|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also plans to integrate payment for the bicycle and car hire schemes with the ticketing systems for traditional modes of public transport.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/boris-jumps-on-board-frances-hire-an-electric-car-scheme-1635137.html |work=The Independent | location=London | title=Boris jumps on board France's 'hire an electric car' scheme | first=Michael |last=McCarthy | date=2 March 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, [[Vincent Bolloré]], the head of the Bolloré group, stated that he expected Autolib' to become profitable by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelinchallengebibendum.com/en/NEWS-AND-PUBLICATIONS/News-and-publications/Bollore-s-BlueCar-could-break-even-by-2018|title= Bolloré’s BlueCar could break even by 2018|publisher=[[Challenge Bibendum]]|date=31 May 2012|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Paris Autolib 06 2012 Bluecar 2905.JPG|thumb|left|Bolloré Bluecars recharging at an Autolib' service kiosk on Rue du Quatre Septembre, Paris, in June 2012.]]
Construction of the Autolib' stations began in mid-2011, and 66 of the scheme's Bolloré Bluecars were deployed for a two-month preliminary trial period between October and December 2011.&lt;ref name=Econom0911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/business/global/paris-tests-short-term-rentals-of-electric-cars.html?_r=1&amp;src=recg|title=Paris Tests Short-Term Rentals of Electric Cars |author=David Jolly |work=[[New York Times]]|date=3 October 2011|accessdate=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system entered service on 5 December 2011, with an initial fleet of 250 Bluecars and 250 Autolib’ rental stations serving the city of Paris and 18 surrounding communities (96 in 2016), grouped into the syndicate of associated collectivities "Autolib' Métropole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autolibmetropole.fr/autolib-metropole/qui-sommes-nous/|title=Autolib' Métropole, Qui sommes-nous ?|work=Autolib' Métropole|accessdate=24 July 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the scheme's inception, car availability was a problematic issue, as more Parisians than expected subscribed to the service. Moreover, by early January 2012, up to 40 of the 250 cars in the initial fleet had been temporarily withdrawn from service to repair vandalism or malfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2012/01/02/01016-20120102ARTFIG00265-autolib-deja-victime-de-pannes-et-de-vandalisme.php|title=Autolib' déjà victime de pannes et de vandalisme|trans-title=Autolib' already suffering breakdowns and vandalism|language=French|work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2012/01/13/parisian-autolib-car-sharing-service-suffers-setbacks-sells-6-0/|title=Parisian Autolib car sharing service suffers setbacks, sells 6,000 subscriptions |author=Domenick Yoney|publisher=[[Autoblog Green]]|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2012, 650 parking and [[charging station]]s had been deployed around Paris and the 46 [[Commune (administrative division)|communes]] participating in the scheme,&lt;ref name=LP1012/&gt; and by February 2013 there were 4,000 charging points.&lt;ref name=LeFigaro022013/&gt; The program's user base grew from 6,000 subscribers at the end of December 2011 to 27,000 in July 2012, and reached 37,000 by early October 2012, of which 13,000 had an annual subscription.&lt;ref name=LP1012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/transports/autolib/bollore-lance-la-bluecar-en-region-parisienne-05-10-2012-2207469.php|title=Bolloré lance la "BlueCar" en région parisienne|language=French|trans-title=Bolloré launches "BlueCar" in the Paris region|author=AFC and Le Parisien|work=[[Le Parisien]]|date=5 October 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.francesoir.fr/pratique/transport/autolib-plus-6000-abonnes-en-deux-semaines-166505.html|title=Autolib' : Plus de 6.000 abonnés en deux semaines |trans-title=Autolib' : More than 6,000 subscribers in two weeks|language=French|work=[[France Soir]]|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LesEchos&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.lesechos.fr/transports/paris-veut-eviter-le-changement-de-nom-d-autolib-0202185513768.htm|title=Paris veut éviter le changement de nom d'Autolib'|language=French|trans-title=Paris wants to avoid Autolib name change |author=Marion Kindermans |work=Les Échos (France) |date=23 July 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name lawsuit===
In December 2009, the car-rental company [[Europcar]] brought the City of Paris to court, arguing that the Autolib' name was a [[plagiarism]] and [[unfair competition]] by the city. Europcar is the trademark owner of the rental car subscription service "Autoliberté", which has been in operation since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/12/09/01011-20091209FILWWW00373-autolib-europcar-attaque-la-ville-de-paris.php|language=French|title=Autolib: Europcar attaque la Ville de Paris|trans-title=Autolib: Europcar attack the City of Paris|work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=9 December 2009|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed in March 2011 by the High Court of Paris, and Europcar decided to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2011/04/13/97002-20110413FILWWW00402-autolib-europcar-fait-appel.php  |title= Autolib': Europcar fait appel |language=French |trans-title=Autolib: Europcar files appeal|work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2012, the Paris [[Court of Appeal (France)|Court of Appeal]] set aside the judgment of the High Court, and ruled that within a month Autolib' had to change its name because it breached trademark laws. The ruling implied that the name had to be changed on all 1,800 Autolib' cars, docking stations and subscriber cards, and also required that all of the scheme's advertising to be rewritten.&lt;ref name=AutolibName&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120702-france-french-court-orders-autolib-car-share-scheme-change-name-bluecar-electric-green-transport|title=Court orders Paris car-share scheme Autolib' to change name|publisher=[[France 24]]|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ruling, the City of Paris and Europcar began negotiating an agreement to solve the brand name conflict.&lt;ref name=NomProbleme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/auto-addict/actualites/la-ville-de-paris-et-europcar-negocient-sur-le-nom-de-la-marque-autolib-02-08-2012-1492194_683.php|title=La Ville de Paris et Europcar négocient sur le nom de la marque Autolib'|language=French|trans-title=The City of Paris and Europcar are negotiating the name of the Autolib' brand|author=AFP|publisher=Auto Addict|date=2 August 2012|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, an agreement was reached to keep the Autolib' brand name. Europcar agreed to waive the enforcement of the court decision on the condition that the City of Paris would be the owner of the Autolib' brand, and in exchange for free advertising for Europcar's Autoliberté service. The agreement was signed for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/transports/autolib/paris-autolib-pourra-conserver-son-nom-28-11-2012-2362777.php|title=Paris : Autolib' pourra conserver son nom|language=French|trans-title=Paris: Autolib' will retain its name|author= |work=[[Le Parisien]]|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autorentalnews.com/Channel/Legislative/News/Story/2012/12/Europcar-Autolib-Paris-Reach-Agreement-on-Autolib-Brand.aspx#.UNSqO12tr0E.email|title=Europcar, Autolib, Paris Reach Agreement on Autolib Brand|publisher=Auto Rental News|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire incidents===
On 14 October 2013, a Bluecar was destroyed by fire while charging at an Autolib' kiosk in Paris; the fire then spread to a second Bluecar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.fr/20131014/in-images-two-autolib-cars-go-up-in-smoke-in-paris|title=Paris Autolib' electric cars go up in smoke|publisher=TheLocal.fr|date=14 October 2013|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A police investigation was subsequently conducted to ascertain the cause of the fire. According to Bolloré, the real-time telemetric monitoring system did not register a thermal runaway problem with the car's battery when the fire started. The company is attributing the origin of the fire to an external cause, probably vandalism. Bolloré reported that a total of 25 Autolib' Bluecars have burnt out since the scheme's inception, with most of the incidents certified as attributed to vandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/10/14/01016-20131014ARTFIG00412-incendies-d-autolib-des-actes-de-malveillance.php|title=Incendies d'Autolib': des actes de malveillance|language=French|trans-title=Autolib' Fire: Vandalism act|author=Jean-Marc Leclerc|work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=14 October 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plugincars.com/two-evs-parisian-autolib-car-sharing-service-burned-down-128577.html|title=Two Autolib Electric Cars Burn Down in Paris|author=Laurent J.

==Autolib' beyond Paris==
In early 2013, the Bolloré Group announced plans to launch a similar car sharing service in [[Lyon]] and [[Bordeaux]], but under a different brand name and with no cost to the cities. Bolloré's proposal was to fund the entire infrastructure, install and provide the vehicles, and cover the costs of maintenance and repairs. Bolloré furthermore expressed interest in launching a car-sharing service in Asia.&lt;ref name=TomorrowTheWorld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://droit-finances.commentcamarche.net/news/109908-apres-paris-et-lyon-bollore-veut-lancer-autolib-a-bordeaux |title=Après Paris et Lyon, Bolloré veut lancer Autolib' à Bordeaux |language=French |trans-title=After Paris and Lyon, Bolloré wants to launch Autolib' in Bordeaux |author=Relax News |publisher=Droid Finances |date=26 February 2013 |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222155253/http://droit-finances.commentcamarche.net/news/109908-apres-paris-et-lyon-bollore-veut-lancer-autolib-a-bordeaux |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, proposals were advanced for Scootlib', an [[electric scooter]] sharing scheme intended to complement Velib' and Autolib'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.fr/20131017/after-velib-and-autolib-is-paris-set-for-scootlib|title=After Velib' and Autolib' is Paris set for Scootlib'?|publisher=TheLocal.fr|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolloré's Lyon scheme, dubbed BlueLy, entered service in October 2013 with an initial fleet of 130 vehicles and 51 parking and charging stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blue-solutions.com/en/applications/mobilite/autopartage/bluecarsharing/bluely/|title=BlueLy|publisher=Blue Solutions|date=2014|accessdate=24 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224073723/https://www.blue-solutions.com/en/applications/mobilite/autopartage/bluecarsharing/bluely/|archive-date=24 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its Bordeaux service, BlueCub, began operating in January 2014 with an initial fleet of 90 vehicles, 40 parking stations and 180 charging stations.&lt;ref name=BordBluecub/&gt;

In June 2013, Autolib' formed an agreement with the American city of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], to develop an electric car sharing service there;&lt;ref name=Indianapolis/&gt; the scheme, named [[BlueIndy]], opened to the public in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/money/4019200/electric-car-sharing-indianapolis/|title=Groundbreaking Electric Car Sharing Program Launches in an Unlikely City|author=Brad Tuttle|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2015-09-02|accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar scheme based in [[London]] was announced in 2014, and will be inaugurated in March 2015, utilising London's existing network of electric car charging points.&lt;ref name=GuardJul14/&gt; The London scheme is intended to encompass 3,000 electric cars by 2018.&lt;ref name=GuardJul14/&gt;

In June 2016, Bolloré signed an agreement with [[Singapore|Singapore's]] [[Land Transport Authority|Land Transport Authority (LTA)]] and [[Economic Development Board]] to develop an electric car-sharing programme, known as [[BlueSG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-s-first-electric-car-sharing-programme-to-launch-in-9254156|title=Singapore's first electric car-sharing programme to launch in December|publisher=[[Channel News Asia]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the charging stations began at the end of September, 2017 and in December, 2017, the service was officially opened to the public with 30 charging stations and 80 cars located throughout the country, with plans to expand the service to offer 2,000 charging points in 500 charging locations, with 400 charging points open for public use and 1,000 [[electric car]]s deployed by 2020.&lt;ref name=StraitsTimes5000&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/more-than-5000-bluesg-electric-car-rentals-in-first-3-weeks-of-service|title=More than 5,000 BlueSG electric car rentals in first 3 weeks of service|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]|date=January 3, 2018|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Autolib' Station, Paris, Boulevard Diderot 01.jpg|thumb|An Autolib' kiosk on Boulevard Diderot.]]
The Autolib’ Bluecar is available to anyone aged 18 or older with a valid French driving license, or a valid foreign license plus the international driving license, who takes out a paid subscription. Users can choose between 2 rental packages, with 30-minute fees varying from {{euro|6}} to {{euro|9}} depending on the rental plan. An available car can be collected for use from any rental station and returned to any other rental station. Each car has on-board [[GPS]] capabilities and can be tracked by the system's operations center.&lt;ref name=Launch2/&gt;

In addition to the subscription fees, Autolib' charges a variable rate for each half an hour of use, but billing for each rental is calculated on a ''[[pro rata]]'' basis, which takes into account the actual duration of use rounded up to the nearest minute (except for the first 20 minutes, for which there is a minimum charge).&lt;ref name=Rates/&gt; The table below summarizes the subscription types available, the subscription fees and the corresponding 30-minute rates:

===Private EV charging service===
In addition to charging its own vehicles, the Autolib' scheme offers charging services for private owners of [[electric vehicle|electric cars and motorcycles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=30587 |title=E-Cycles Allowed Use of Autolib Charge Stations in Paris |publisher=EVWorld.com |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=28 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926151022/http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=30587 |archivedate=26 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers have to sign up for the "recharge" fee option. The subscription cost for cars and motorcycles is {{euro|15}} per year only the first year. Recharge customers have designated parking spaces at Autolib’ stations, marked with a blue square. Each hour costs {{euro|1}} for cars and motorcycles. Use of the charging infrastructure for private cars is limited to two times per day per subscriber.&lt;ref name=AutolibGuide&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autolib.eu/en/how-does-it-work/service/|title=Autolib', How it works?|publisher=Autolib'|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluecar leasing and sales program===
Bolloré began leasing the Bluecar to individual and corporate customers in October 2012 at a price of {{euro|500}} ({{USD|648}}) per month. The pricing includes insurance, parking and charging at Autolib' stations. According to Bolloré, each existing station already provides one recharging space for private electric cars outside the Autolib' system. The Bluecar retail version has a blue exterior color, unlike the Autolib' version's silver unpainted [[aluminum]] exterior.&lt;ref name=LP1012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autonews.fr/dossiers/votre-quotidien/90768-bollore-blucear-paris-location|title=Louez une Bluecarpour 500 € par mois|language=French|trans-title=Lease a Bluecar for €500 per month|author=Laurent Lepsch|publisher=Auto News|date=8 October 2012|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013 Bolleré announced the start of retail sales of the Bluecar, and for an optional monthly fee of {{euro|15}}, owners can have access to the Autolib' network of charging stations around Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avem.fr/actualite-voiture-electrique-la-bluecar-de-bollore-disponible-pour-12-000-3876.html|title=Voiture électrique – La Bluecar de Bolloré disponible pour 12.000 €|language=French|trans-title=Electric Cars – Bolloré Bluecar available for €12,000 |author=Michaël Torregrossa|publisher=Association pour l'Avenir du Véhicule Electrique Méditerranéen (AVEM) |date=21 February 2013|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate carsharing===
[[Atos]] and the Bolloré Group launched the MyCar corporate car sharing pilot program in December 2012. The service is dedicated to Atos employees for their business travel needs at the company's headquarters in the French town of [[Bezons]]. A fleet of ten Atos-branded Bolloré Bluecars were initially deployed. In addition to charging vehicles at the [[photovoltaic panel|solar-powered]] Bezons site, MyCar users can also access the Autolib' network of charging stations in Paris and its surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Atos1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avem.fr/news?id=3697|title=MyCar – L’Autolib’ professionnel de Bolloré déployé chez Atos|language=French|trans-title=MyCar – The Autolib' cars of Bolloré deployed at Atos|author=Michaël Torregrossa|publisher=Association pour l'Avenir du Véhicule Electrique Méditerranéen (AVEM)|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atos2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/06/idUS158566+06-Dec-2012+HUG20121206|title=Atos and Bolloré Group launch first 100% electric corporate car fleet|author=Atos Press Release|publisher=Reuters|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, a similar leasing deal was reached with [[Crédit Agricole]], the largest retail banking group in France. Five Bluecars were leased for 20 months for business travel use by the bank's employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france-mobilite-electrique.org/quand-la-bluecar-seduit-le-credit-agricole,4171.html?lang=fr|title=Quand La Bluecar Séduit Le Crédit Agricole du Finistère|language=French|trans-title=When the Bluecar Seduced the Crédit Agricole du Finistère|author=Laurent Meillaud|publisher=Automobile Propre|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baihetan Dam''' ({{zh|s=白鹤滩大坝|t=白鶴灘大壩|p=Báihètān Dàbà}}) is a large [[hydroelectric dam]] under construction on the [[Jinsha River]], a tributary of the  [[Yangtze River]] in [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces, in the southwest of [[People's Republic of China|China]]. 
The dam is a 277 m tall double-curvature [[arch dam]] with a crest elevation of 827 m. 
Its width will be 72 m at the base and 13 m at the crest.&lt;ref name="cwe"/&gt;

The facility will generate power by utilizing 16 [[water turbine|turbines]], each with a generating capacity of {{nowrap|1,000 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}, taking the generating capacity to {{nowrap|16,000 MW}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dongfang.com/data/v/201507/4714.html&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of generating capacity, it will be the second largest [[hydroelectric]] power plant in the world, after the [[Three Gorges Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bjx.com.cn/html/20151202/687530.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; When finished, it will be the third largest dam in [[China]] and the [[List of largest dams|fourth in the world]], in terms of dam volume. Construction on the dam began in 2008 and is expected to be complete in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Hydropower Development Baihetan |url=http://nn.lsz.gov.cn/lry.asp?id=164 |publisher=Baihetan China - Ningxia County Public Information Network |accessdate=20 March 2011 |language=Chinese |date=2 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823083909/http://nn.lsz.gov.cn/lry.asp?id=164 |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[agriculture]], [[gardening]], and [[forestry]], '''broadcast seeding''' is a method of [[sowing|seeding]] that involves scattering [[seed]], by hand or [[mechanization|mechanical]]ly, over a relatively large [[area]]. This is in contrast to:
*[[precision seeding]], where seed is placed at a precise spacing and depth;
*[[hydroseeding]], where a slurry of seed, [[mulch]] and water is sprayed over prepared ground in a uniform layer.

Broadcast seeding is of particular use in establishing dense [[plant]] spacing, as for [[cover crop]]s and [[lawn]]s. In comparison to traditional drill planting, broadcast seeding will require 10–20% more seed. It's simpler, faster, and easier than traditional row sowing. Broadcast seeding works best for plants that do not require singular spacing or that are more easily thinned later.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greatplainsag.com/en/cover-crops/10079/broadcasting-cover-crops|title=Broadcasting Cover Crops|last=megan.robl|date=2015-09-25|website=www.greatplainsag.com|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After broadcasting, seed is often lightly buried with some type of [[rake (tool)|raking]] action, often done using vertical tillage tools. Utilizing these tools increases the success rate of germination by increasing seed-to-soil contact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Seeds sown in this manner are distributed unevenly, which may result in overcrowding. This method may not ensure that all seeds are sown at the correct depth. Incorrect depth, if too deep, would result in germination that would not allow the young plant to break the surface of the soil and prevent sprouting. If they are not sown evenly then there would be a lack of various nutrients from sunlight, oxygen etc in many crops or plants. 

In addition, it is worth noting that not all seeds are good candidates for broadcast seeding. Often, only smaller seeds will sprout and continue to grow successfully when planted by way of broadcasting. In general, the larger the seed, the deeper it can be planted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">'''COSILAB''' is a software tool for solving complex chemical [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] problems.  It is used worldwide in research and industry, in particular in [[automotive]], [[combustion]], and [[chemical]] processing applications.

Problems to be solved by COSILAB may involve thousands of reactions amongst hundreds of species for practically any mixture composition, pressure and temperature. Its computational capabilities allow for a complex [[chemical reaction]] to be studied in detail, including intermediate compounds, trace compounds and [[pollutants]].

Whilst complex chemistry is accounted for, [[chemical reactor]] or [[combustion]] geometries that can be handled by COSILAB are relatively simple. For the purpose of ``real-life" simulations this limitation can be overcome, however, by using a library of pre-compiled subroutines and functions, that one can link to his or her own code written in [[Fortran]], the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or [[C++]].  In this way, it is possible to develop fully two-dimensional or three-dimensional CFD or [[computational fluid dynamics]] codes that are able to capture fairly realistic geometries.

The development of codes like COSILAB is motivated by a worldwide attempt to keep the environment clean and to save—or at least make best use of—the continuously diminishing [[fossil fuel]] resources.

'''Ceroma''' ({{lang-el|κήρωμα}}) was a word which first appeared in the works of the two Roman poets [[Juvenal]] and [[Martial]] and has come to be defined as a mixture of [[oil]], [[wax]] and earth; or, a cloth with which [[Greek wrestling|ancient wrestlers]] rubbed themselves, not only to make their limbs more sleek and less capable of gripping, but more pliable and fit for exercise. However, scholars point out that this definition is a misunderstanding of satire and its correct meaning is a "layer of mud or clay forming the floor of the wrestling ring in the times of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The light from the meteor was brighter than the [[Sun]], visible up to {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. It was observed over a wide area of the region and in neighbouring republics.  Some eyewitnesses also felt intense heat from the fireball.

The object was undetected before its [[atmospheric entry]], in part because its [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] was close to the Sun. Its explosion created panic among local residents, and about 1,500 people were injured seriously enough to seek medical treatment. All of the injuries were due to indirect effects rather than the meteor itself, mainly from broken glass from windows that were blown in when the shock wave arrived, minutes after the superbolide's flash. Some 7,200 buildings in six cities across the region were damaged by the explosion's shock wave, and authorities scrambled to help repair the structures in sub-freezing temperatures.

(http://cosmictusk.com/mini-tunguska-the-rio-curuca-brazil-1930/) --&gt; The Chelyabinsk meteor is also the only meteor confirmed to have resulted in a large number of injuries. No deaths were reported.

The earlier-predicted and well-publicized [[Near-Earth object|close approach]] of a larger asteroid on the same day, the roughly {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[367943 Duende]], occurred about 16 hours later; the very different orbits of the two objects showed they were unrelated to each other.

During the Chelyabinsk meteoroid's traversal, there was a bright object trailing smoke, then an [[air burst]] (explosion) that caused a powerful [[blast wave]]. The latter was the only cause of the damage to thousands of buildings in Chelyabinsk and its neighbouring towns. The fragments then entered [[Dark flight (astronomy)|dark flight]] (without the emission of light) and created a [[strewn field]] of numerous meteorites on the snow-covered ground (officially named Chelyabinsk meteorites).

The [[Russian Geographical Society]] said the passing of the meteor over Chelyabinsk caused three blasts of different energy.  The first explosion was the most powerful, and was preceded by a bright flash, which lasted about five seconds. Initial newspaper altitude estimates ranged from {{nowrap|30–70 km,}} with an explosive equivalent, according to NASA, of roughly {{convert|500|ktTNT}}, although there is some debate on this yield&lt;ref name="RT-337"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rt.com/news/scientists-explain-chelyabinsk-bolide-337/ | title=Russian meteorite blast explained: Fireball explosion equal to 20 Hiroshimas | publisher=[[RT (TV Network)|RT]] | date=15 February 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216074043/http://rt.com/news/scientists-explain-chelyabinsk-bolide-337/ | archivedate=16 February 2013 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-2013-11-07" /&gt; (500 kt is exactly the same energy released by the [[Ivy King]] nuclear explosion in 1952).

== Origin ==
Based on its entry direction and speed of 19 kilometres/second, the Chelyabinsk meteor apparently originated in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. It was probably a [[Breccia|fragmented]] asteroid. The meteorite has veins of black material which had experienced high-pressure shock and were once partly melted, due to a previous collision. The [[metamorphism]] in the [[chondrule]]s in the meteorite samples indicates the rock making up the meteor had a history of collisions and was once several kilometres below the surface of a much larger [[LL chondrite|LL-chondrite]] asteroid. The Chelyabinsk asteroid probably entered an [[orbital resonance]] with Jupiter (a common way for material to be ejected from the asteroid belt) which increased its orbital [[Eccentricity (astronomy)|eccentricity]] until its [[perihelion]] was reduced enough for it to be able to collide with the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kring|first=David A.|last2=Boslough|first2=Mark|date=1 September 2014|title=Chelyabinsk: Portrait of an asteroid airburst|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/67/9/10.1063/PT.3.2515|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=67|issue=9|pages=32–37|doi=10.1063/PT.3.2515|issn=0031-9228|bibcode = 2014PhT....67i..32K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Russian scientists reported that further investigation by magnetic imaging below the location of the ice hole in Lake Chebarkul had identified a {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=off|adj=on}}-size meteorite buried in the mud at the bottom of the lake.  Before recovery began, the chunk was estimated to weigh roughly {{convert|300|kg}}.&lt;ref name="rian20130622"&gt;{{cite news |title=Huge Chunk of Meteorite Located in Urals Lake – Scientist |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20130622/181805477/Huge-Chunk-of-Meteorite-Located-in-Urals-Lake---Scientist.html |newspaper=RIA Novosti |date=22 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623225109/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20130622/181805477/Huge-Chunk-of-Meteorite-Located-in-Urals-Lake---Scientist.html |archivedate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an operation lasting a number of weeks, it was raised from the bottom of the [[Chebarkul lake]] on 16 October 2013. With a total mass of {{Convert|654|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, this is the largest found fragment of the Chelyabinsk meteorite.

The number of injuries caused by the asteroid led the Internet-search giant Google to remove a [[Google logo|Google Doodle]] from their website, created for the predicted pending arrival of another asteroid, {{mpl|2012 DA|14}}.&lt;ref name="ABC-Google"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/02/asteroid-2012-da14-google-doodle-removed-after-russian-meteor-shower-injuries/ |title=Asteroid {{mp|2012 DA|14}} Google Doodle Removed After Russian Meteor Shower Injuries |first=Joanna |last=Stern |work=ABC News |date=15 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216092640/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/02/asteroid-2012-da14-google-doodle-removed-after-russian-meteor-shower-injuries/ |archivedate=16 February 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City planetarium director [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] stated the Chelyabinsk meteor was unpredicted because no attempt had been made to find and catalogue every {{nowrap|15-metre}} [[near-Earth object]].&lt;ref name="Today50820935"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.today.com/video/today/50820935 | title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: Radar could not detect meteor | date=15 February 2013 | work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509133134/http://www.today.com/video/today/50820935 | archivedate=9 May 2013 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so would be very difficult, and current efforts only aim at a complete inventory of {{nowrap|150-metre}} near-Earth objects. The [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]], on the other hand, could now predict some Chelyabinsk-like events a day or so in advance, when their radiant is not close to the Sun.

On 27 March 2013, a broadcast episode of the [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] science television series titled "Meteor Strike" documented the Chelyabinsk meteor, including the large amounts of meteoritic science revealed by the numerous videos of the airburst posted online by ordinary citizens. The NOVA program called the video documentation and the related scientific discoveries of the airburst "unprecedented".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10393">The '''''chronomètre''''' is a precursor of the [[metronome]]. It was invented circa 1694 by [[Étienne Loulié]] to record the preferred tempo of pieces of music. [[File:chronometre assembled.jpg|thumb|Loulié's ''chronomètre'' as shown in his ''Éléments'' (1696)]]

==The Device==
Circa 1694 [[Étienne Loulié]], a musician who had recently collaborated with mathematician [[Joseph Sauveur]] on the education of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe, Duke of Chartres]], was asked by Chartres to work with Sauveur on a scientific study of acoustics sponsored by the [[Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Science]].

To measure scientifically the number of beats per second caused by different dissonances, they used the "seconds [[pendulum]]" invented by [[Galileo]] earlier in the century. It doubtlessly was these experiments, on top of his lessons to Chartres, that gave Loulié the idea for his chronomètre, a precursor of the [[metronome]].

In his ''Éléments'' (Paris: Ballard, 1696) — which resumes the lessons Loulié had given to Chartres and is dedicated to the prince — Loulié described this invention, complete with an engraving of the device. (A translation of Loulié's description is provided below.) 

The device is basically a Galilean seconds pendulum disguised as a classical column. It consists of a six-foot-tall vertical "ruler" marked off in inches, with a little peg-hole at every inch. From the right-angle bar that protrudes at the capital of the Ionic capital, hangs a string with a plumb bob at the end. The length of the string — and therefore the speed of the pendulum swings — can be adjusted by moving the peg at the other end of the string up and down the vertical board and inserting it in one peg-hole or another. The shorter the string, the more rapid the swings; the longer the string, the slower the swings.

To specify the tempo of a piece, the composer could henceforth test the tempo at a variety of peg holes and, having determined the right tempo, could mark at the top of a piece the note value that represented the musical beat, plus the number of the hole into which the peg had been inserted.

Sauveur subsequently criticized the device because it was measured in inches, which did not conform with any known relation to the duration of a second. His ''échomètre'' tried to remedy this shortcoming, by marking the vertical ruler with the small units that the Sauveur was creating for his ''Nouveau système''. When Loulié died in 1702, [[Louis Léon Pajot, comte d'Onsenbray]], acquired Loulié's model and presented his own variant (the ''métromètre'') to the Academy of Sciences in 1732. It was measured in seconds and made the swings of the pendulum audible. The size of all three devices rendered them too cumbersome for widespread use.

==Its utility==
On pages 85–86 of his ''Éléments'', Loulié emphasized the usefulness of his device:

:This instrument is especially suitable for marking the tempos of pieces being sent abroad, or to know the exact tempo of imported pieces, as long as they have been marked by this instrument.

:A few years ago I gave a ''chronomètre'' to a person of great musical merit. I showed him how to use it. He took it with him to Italy, where he currently is. A musician who wanted to send that person a few sonatas he had written, and who was very happy to know that his airs would be executed as he intended, came to me not long ago and asked me to help him mark the tempo of his airs using the ''chronomètre''. [...]

:This instrument may not seem very necessary or even very useful.

:First, there are those who, being savant and very experienced in both French and foreign music, are capable of judging their true tempo, or approximately so.

:Second, those who are very familiar with the airs of Monsieur de [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] and other airs of this sort, neglect or even look down upon other types of music.

:Third, those whose only musical merits are a certain routine, with no refinement of taste, think that it makes little difference whether an air is performed more quickly or more slowly.

:But I flatter myself that those who have fine taste and who have observed how an air loses its beauty when executed too quickly or too slowly, will thank me for giving them a reliable way to determine the true tempo, especially people living in the provinces, who will be able to know the true tempo of all of Monsieur de Lully's works, which I have determined very accurately with the ''chronomètre'', with the help of people who performed them for many years under the direction of Monsieur de Lully himself.

Loulié's allusions to the airs of [[Jean Baptiste de Lully]] are particularly meaningful within the broader context of Loulié's business activities. Loulié was directing a workshop that copied Lully's airs (usually in trio form), probably for sale by his friend [[Henri Foucault]], the music-paper dealer and disseminator of Lully's works in both manuscript and print.

==Loulié's Description==
Loulié's own description of the invention follows, translated from pp.&amp;nbsp;83–86 of his ''Éléments'':

:The ''chronomètre'' is an instrument by means of which composers will henceforth be able to mark the true tempo of their composition; and their airs, marked according to this instrument, will be able to be performed, in their absence, as if they themselves were beating time.

:This instrument has only two parts:

:The first is a wooden ruler (AA) that is six feet tall (or 72 inches), about two inches wide, and approximately an inch thick. On the flat side of the ruler a line (BC) is traced from top to bottom, down the very middle. Along this line are marked, very precisely, inch-long divisions, and wherever these [horizontal] lines cross the vertical line, there is a hole about 1/6 inch in diameter and 3/4 inches deep. These holes are indicated by numbers, beginning with the lowest all the way up to 72 at the top.

:I used the universal foot [as a measurement] because it is known in all sorts of countries. [...]

:At the top of the ruler, at a right angle, is an iron or wooden bar (BD) six or seven inches long, inserted into the ruler an inch above section 71. About six or seven inches from the end of the angle-bar is a little hole (D) about as big as a shoelace or thick cord. At the other end, where it is inserted into the ruler, is another hole (B) at the central vertical line.

:The second part of this instrument is a ''pendulum'', that is, a plumb-bob (E) approximately one inch in diameter, pierced through with a hole the size of a thick cord, and through this hole is passed the cord, knotted above the plumb-bob.

:The cord and its plumb-bob are attached to the ruler by passing the cord through holes D and B in the angle-bar, so that one of the ends of the rope coincides with the central division line, and the other end, with the plumb-bob, hangs [''pend''] in the air, which is why it is called a ''pendulum''.

:At the other end of the cord, along the division line, is attached a wooden or iron peg (F) with the same diameter as the holes in the ruler, so that the peg just enters.

:The peg is made a bit like the pegs on a lute or a viol: there is a hole between the part one grabs with one's hand, and the part that goes into the holes on the ruler. The cord goes through this hole and is knotted, so that when the peg is in hole 72, the cord is 72 inches long from the hole (D) to the center of the plumb-bob. By means of this peg that is attached to the cord, one can modify the length of the ''pendulum'' (or ''pendillon'') as one wishes, by putting the peg into a higher or lower place. It is set into motion at the height of a quarter of a quarter of a circle, which is done by moving the plumb-bob two feet from perpendicular, or from its resting position, when the peg is in hole 72, or one foot when the peg is in hole 36, and six inches when the peg is in hole 18, and always a bit less as the pendulum becomes shorter. If one lets go of  the plumb-bob without forcing it, the pendulum can mark with utmost precision the quickness or the slowness of the musical beat, as a result of the swings [vibrations] at its various lengths.

:If a composer wants to mark the desired tempo for performing an air he has composed, irrespective of the time signature he must begin by putting the peg in one of the holes and then setting the pendulum in motion.

'''Cylindrospermopsin''' (abbreviated to '''CYN''', or '''CYL''') is a [[cyanotoxin]] produced by a variety of [[freshwater]] [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fastner J, Heinze R, Humpage AR, Mischke U, Eaglesham GK, Chorus I |title=Cylindrospermopsin occurrence in two German lakes and preliminary assessment of toxicity and toxin production of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Cyanobacteria) isolates |journal=Toxicon |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=313–21 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14559084 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(03)00150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; CYN is a [[Polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] [[uracil]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] containing [[guanidine|guanidino]] and [[sulfate]] groups. It is also [[zwitterion]]ic, making it highly water [[soluble]]. CYN is [[toxicity|toxic]] to [[liver]] and [[kidney]] tissue and is thought to inhibit [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] and to [[covalent]]ly modify [[DNA]] and/or [[RNA]].  It is not known whether cylindrospermopsin is a [[carcinogenicity|carcinogen]], but it appears to have no [[tumour]] initiating activity in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Falconer IR, Humpage AR |title=Preliminary evidence for in vivo tumour initiation by oral administration of extracts of the blue-green alga cylindrospermopsis raciborskii containing the toxin cylindrospermopsin |journal=Environmental Toxicology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=192–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11339720 |doi=10.1002/tox.1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CYN was first discovered after an outbreak of a mystery disease on [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The outbreak was traced back to a [[algal bloom|bloom]] of ''[[Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii]]'' in the local drinking water supply, and the toxin was subsequently identified. Analysis of the toxin led to a proposed [[chemical structure]] in 1992, which was revised after [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] was achieved in 2000. Several analogues of CYN, both toxic and non-toxic, have been isolated or synthesised.

''C. raciborskii'' has been observed mainly in [[tropical]] areas, however has also recently been discovered in temperate regions of [[Australia]], [[North America|North]], [[South America]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Poniedziałek B, Rzymski P, Kokociński M 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poniedziałek B, Rzymski P, Kokociński M |title=Cylindrospermopsin: Water-linked potential threat to human health in Europe|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology |year=2012 |pmid=22986102|doi=10.1016/j.etap.2012.08.005 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=651–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, CYN-producing strain of C. raciborskii has not been identified in Europe, several other cyanobacteria species occurring across the continent are able to synthesize it.&lt;ref name="Poniedziałek B, Rzymski P, Kokociński M 2012"/&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1979, 138 inhabitants of [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], were admitted to hospital, suffering various [[symptoms]] of [[gastroenteritis]]. All of these were children; in addition, 10 adults were affected but not hospitalised. Initial symptoms, including [[Abdomen|abdominal]] pain and [[vomiting]], resembled those of [[hepatitis]]; later symptoms included [[kidney failure]] and bloody [[diarrhoea]]. [[Urine]] analysis revealed high levels of [[proteins]], [[ketones]] and [[sugar]] in many patients, along with [[blood]] and [[urobilinogen]] in lesser numbers. The urine analysis, along with [[faeces|faecal]] [[microscopy]] and [[poison]] screening, could not provide a statistical link to the symptoms.  All patients recovered within 4 to 26 days, and at the time there was no apparent cause for the outbreak. Initial thoughts on the cause included poor water quality and diet, however none were conclusive, and the illness was coined the “Palm Island Mystery Disease”.&lt;ref name=Byth1980&gt;{{cite journal |author=Byth S |title=Palm Island mystery disease |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=40, 42 |date=July 1980 |pmid=7432268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was noticed that this outbreak coincided with a severe [[alga]]l bloom in the local drinking water supply, and soon after the focus turned to the dam in question. An [[epidemiological]] study of this “mystery disease” later confirmed that the [[Solomon Dam]] was implicated, as those that became ill had used water from the dam. It became apparent that a recent treatment of the [[algal bloom]] with [[copper sulfate]] caused lysis of the algal cells, releasing a [[toxin]] into the water.&lt;ref name=Bourke1983&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1016/0041-0101(83)90151-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A study of the dam revealed that periodic blooms of algae were caused predominantly by three strains of [[cyanobacteria]]: two of the genus ''[[Anabaena]]'', and ''Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii'', previously unknown in Australian waters.&lt;ref name=Griffiths2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffiths DJ, Saker ML |title=The Palm Island mystery disease 20 years on: a review of research on the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin |journal=Environmental Toxicology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=78–93 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12635096 |doi=10.1002/tox.10103}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mouse bioassay of the three demonstrated that although the two ''Anabaena'' strains were non-toxic, ''C. raciborskii'' was highly toxic.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1985&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawkins PR, Runnegar MT, Jackson AR, Falconer IR |title=Severe hepatotoxicity caused by the tropical cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenaya and Subba Raju isolated from a domestic water supply reservoir |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1292–5 |date=November 1985 |pmid=3937492 |pmc=238741 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3937492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later isolation of the compound responsible led to the identification of the toxin cylindrospermopsin.&lt;ref name=Ohtani1992&gt;{{cite journal

A later report alternatively proposed that the excess copper in the water was the cause of the disease. The excessive dosing was following the use of least-cost contractors to control the algae, who were unqualified in the field.&lt;ref name="MJA 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prociv P |title=Algal toxins or copper poisoning--revisiting the Palm Island "epidemic" |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=181 |issue=6 |pages=344 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15377259 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/181_06_200904/letters_200904_fm-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure determination===
[[Image:7-epiCYN.png|thumb|300px|Figure 1. Initial incorrect proposed structure of cylindrospermopsin (CYN), with its four rings labelled (A-D). The incorrect feature was the orientation of the [[hydroxyl]] group. This [[epimer]] was later identified as 7-epicyclindrospermopsin.]]

Isolation of the toxin using cyanobacteria cultured from the original Palm Island strain was achieved by gel filtration of an [[aqueous]] extract, followed by reverse-phase [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]. Structure elucidation was achieved via [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiments, and a structure (later proven slightly incorrect) was proposed (Figure&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name=Ohtani1992 /&gt;

This almost-correct [[molecule]] possesses a [[tricyclic]] [[guanidine]] group (rings A, B &amp; C), along with a [[uracil]] ring (D). The [[zwitterion]]ic nature of the molecule makes this highly water-soluble, as the presence of [[Charge (physics)|charged]] areas within the molecule creates a [[dipole]] effect, suiting the [[Chemical polarity|polar]] [[solvent]]. Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR [[spectrum]] to small changes in [[pH]] suggested that the uracil ring exists in a [[Ketone|keto]]/[[enol]] [[tautomer]]ic relationship, where a [[hydrogen]] transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2). It was originally proposed that a [[hydrogen bond]] between the uracil and guanidine groups in the enol tautomer would make this the dominant form.&lt;ref name=Ohtani1992 /&gt;

[[Image:Cylindrospermopsin tautomers.png|center|thumb|650px|Figure 2. Proposed tautomerism between the [[Ketone|keto]] and [[enol]] forms, showing the [[hydrogen bond]] between the [[uracil]] nitrogen and the guanidino hydrogen.]]

===Analogues===
[[Image:Deoxycylindrospermopsin.png|thumb|300px|Figure 3. Deoxycylindrospermopsin, a non-toxic metabolite of ''C. raciborskii'']]
A second [[metabolite]] of ''C. raciborskii'' was identified from extracts of the cyanobacteria after the observation of a frequently occurring peak accompanying that of CYN during [[Ultraviolet|UV]] and MS experiments. Analysis by MS and NMR methods concluded that this new compound was missing the [[oxygen]] adjacent to the uracil ring, and was named deoxycylindrospermopsin (Figure 3).&lt;ref name=Norris2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norris RL, Eaglesham GK, Shaw GR |title=Extraction and purification of the zwitterions cylindrospermopsin and deoxycylindrospermopsin from Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii |journal=Environmental Toxicology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=391–6 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11594025 |doi=10.1002/tox.1048|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, an [[epimer]] of CYN, named 7-epicyclindrospermopsin (epiCYN), was also identified as a minor metabolite from ''Aphanizomenon ovalisporum''. This occurred whilst isolating CYN from cyanobacteria taken from [[Lake Kinneret]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=Banker2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Banker R, Teltsch B, Sukenik A, Carmeli S |title=7-Epicylindrospermopsin, a toxic minor metabolite of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum from lake Kinneret, Israel |journal=Journal of Natural Products |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=387–9 |date=March 2000 |pmid=10757726 |doi=10.1021/np990498m}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed structure of this molecule differed from CYN only in the orientation of the [[hydroxyl]] group adjacent to the uracil ring (Figure 4).

[[Image:Cylindrospermopsin structure2.png|thumb|300px|Figure 4. Initial proposed structure of 7-epicyclindrospermopsin (epiCYN), which was later shown to be the structure of CYN]]

===Total synthesis===
[[Chemical synthesis|Synthetic]] approaches to CYN started with the [[piperidine]] ring (A), and progressed to [[annulation]] of rings B and C.&lt;ref name=Heintzelman1996&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heintzelman, G.R. |author2=Weinreb, S.M. |author3=Parvez, M. | year = 1996 | title = Imino Diels-Alder-Based Construction of a Piperidine A-Ring Unit for Total Synthesis of the Marine Hepatotoxin Cylindrospermopsin | journal = Chemical Abstracts | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | doi = 10.1021/jo960035a | pages = 4594–4599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[total synthesis]] of CYN was reported in 2000 through a 20-step process.&lt;ref name=Xie2000&gt;{{cite journal

 | volume = 122

 | pages = 5017–5024
 | doi = 10.1021/ja000647j
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements to synthetic methods led to a revision of the [[stereochemistry]] of CYN in 2001. A synthetic process controlling each of the six [[stereogenic]] centres of epiCYN established that the original assignments of both CYN and epiCYN were in fact a reversal of the correct structures.&lt;ref name=Heintzelman2001&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of this correct assignment, it was suggested that the enol form was not dominant.&lt;ref name=Heintzelman2001 /&gt;

===Stability===
One of the key factors associated with the [[toxicity]] of CYN is its [[chemical stability|stability]]. Although the toxin has been found to [[Chemical decomposition|degrade]] rapidly in an algal extract when exposed to [[sunlight]], it is resistant to degradation by changes in [[pH]] and [[temperature]], and shows no degradation in either the pure solid form or in pure water. As a result, in [[turbidity|turbid]] and unmoving water the toxin can persist for long periods, and although boiling water will kill the cyanobacteria, it may not remove the toxin.&lt;ref name=Chiswell1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicology==

===Toxic effects===
Hawkins ''et al.''. demonstrated the toxic effects of CYN by mouse bioassay, using an extract of the original Palm Island strain. [[Acute (medicine)|Acutely]] poisoned mice displayed [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[diarrhoea]] and gasping [[breathing|respiration]]. Autopsy results revealed haemorrhages in the [[lungs]], [[livers]], [[kidneys]], [[small intestines]] and [[adrenal glands]]. [[Histopathology]] revealed dose-related [[necrosis]] of [[hepatocytes]], [[lipid]] accumulation, and [[fibrin]] [[thrombi]] formation in [[blood vessels]] of the liver and lungs, along with varying [[epithelial cell]] necrosis in areas of the kidneys.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1985 /&gt;

A more recent mouse bioassay of the effects of cylindrospermopsin revealed an increase in liver weight, with both lethal and non-lethal doses; in addition the livers appeared dark-coloured. Extensive necrosis of hepatocytes was visible in mice administered a lethal dose, and some localised damage was also observed in mice administered a non-lethal dose.&lt;ref name=Saker1999 /&gt;

===Toxicity===

An initial estimate of the toxicity of CYN in 1985 was that an {{LD50}} at 24 hours was 64±5&amp;nbsp;mg of freeze-dried culture/kg of mouse body weight on [[intraperitoneal]] [[Injection (medicine)|injection]].&lt;ref name=Hawkins1985 /&gt; A further experiment in 1997 measured the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; as 52&amp;nbsp;mg/kg at 24 hours and 32&amp;nbsp;mg/kg at 7 days, however the data suggested that another toxic compound was present in the isolate of [[sonication|sonicated]] cells used;&lt;ref name=Hawkins1997&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawkins PR, Chandrasena NR, Jones GJ, Humpage AR, Falconer IR |title=Isolation and toxicity of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii from an ornamental lake |journal=Toxicon |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=341–6 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9080590 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(96)00185-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; predictions made by Ohtani ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Ohtani1992 /&gt; about the 24‑hour toxicity were considerably higher, and it was proposed that another metabolite was present to account for the relatively low 24‑hour toxicity level measured.&lt;ref name=Hawkins1997 /&gt;

Because the most likely human route of uptake of CYN is ingestion, [[Mouth|oral]] toxicity experiments were conducted on mice. The oral LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be 4.4-6.9&amp;nbsp;mg CYN/kg, and in addition to some [[Peptic ulcer|ulceration]] of the [[oesophageal]] [[gastric mucosa]], [[symptoms]] were consistent with that of intraperitoneal dosing. Stomach contents included [[culture]] material, which indicated that these LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; figures might be overestimated.&lt;ref name=Seawright1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism of action===

[[Pathological science|Pathological]] changes associated with CYN poisoning were reported to be in four distinct stages: [[Reaction inhibitor|inhibition]] of [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], [[Cell growth|proliferation]] of [[Biological membrane|membrane]]s, lipid accumulation within cells, and finally [[cell death]]. Examination of mice livers removed at autopsy showed that on intraperitoneal injection of CYN, after 16 hours ribosomes from the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] (rER) had detached, and at 24 hours, marked proliferation of the [[Biological membrane|membrane]] systems of the [[smooth ER]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] had occurred. At 48 hours, small lipid droplets had accumulated in the cell bodies, and at 100 hours, hepatocytes in the hepatic [[lobules]] were destroyed beyond function.&lt;ref name=Terao1994&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Terao K, Ohmori S, Igarashi K |title=Electron microscopic studies on experimental poisoning in mice induced by cylindrospermopsin isolated from blue-green alga Umezakia natans |journal=Toxicon |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=833–43 |date=July 1994 |pmid=7940590 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(94)90008-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of protein synthesis inhibition has been shown to be irreversible, however is not conclusively the method of [[cytotoxicity]] of the compound. Froscio ''et al.''. proposed that CYN has at least two separate modes of action: the previously reported protein synthesis inhibition, and an as-yet unclear method of causing cell death.  It has been shown that cells can survive for long periods (up to 20 hours) with 90% inhibition of protein synthesis, and still maintain viability.&lt;ref name=Froscio2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Froscio SM, Humpage AR, Burcham PC, Falconer IR |title=Cylindrospermopsin-induced protein synthesis inhibition and its dissociation from acute toxicity in mouse hepatocytes |journal=Environmental Toxicology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=243–51 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12900943 |doi=10.1002/tox.10121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since CYN is cytotoxic within 16–18 hours&lt;ref name=Runnegar1994&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Runnegar MT, Kong SM, Zhong YZ, Ge JL, Lu SC |title=The role of glutathione in the toxicity of a novel cyanobacterial alkaloid cylindrospermopsin in cultured rat hepatocytes |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=201 |issue=1 |pages=235–41 |date=May 1994 |pmid=8198579 |doi=10.1006/bbrc.1994.1694}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that other mechanisms are the cause of cell death.

[[Cytochrome P450]] has been implicated in the toxicity of CYN, as blocking the action of P450 reduces the toxicity of CYN.&lt;ref name=Runnegar1995&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Runnegar MT, Kong SM, Zhong YZ, Lu SC |title=Inhibition of reduced glutathione synthesis by cyanobacterial alkaloid cylindrospermopsin in cultured rat hepatocytes |journal=[[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=219–25 |date=January 1995 |pmid=7840799 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(94)00466-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that an activated P450-derived [[metabolite]] (or metabolites) of CYN is the main cause of toxicity.&lt;ref name=Froscio2003 /&gt; Shaw ''et al.''. demonstrated that the toxin could be metabolised ''[[in vivo]]'', resulting in bound metabolites in the liver tissue, and that damage was more prevalent in rat hepatocytes than other cell types.&lt;ref name=Shaw2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shaw GR, Seawright AA, Moore MR, Lam PK |title=Cylindrospermopsin, a cyanobacterial alkaloid: evaluation of its toxicologic activity |journal=Therapeutic Drug Monitoring |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=89–92 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10688267 |doi=10.1097/00007691-200002000-00019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the structure of CYN, which includes [[sulfate]], [[guanidine]] and [[uracil]] groups, it has been suggested that CYN acts on [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. Shaw ''et al.''. reported [[covalent]] binding of CYN or its metabolites to DNA in mice,&lt;ref name=Shaw2000 /&gt; and DNA strand breakage has also been observed.&lt;ref name=Shen2002&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shen X, Lam PK, Shaw GR, Wickramasinghe W |title=Genotoxicity investigation of a cyanobacterial toxin, cylindrospermopsin |journal=Toxicon |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1499–501 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12368121 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(02)00151-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humpage ''et al.'' also supported this, and in addition postulated that CYN (or a metabolite) acts on either the [[spindle apparatus|spindle]] or [[centromeres]] during [[cell division]], inducing loss of whole [[chromosomes]].&lt;ref name=Humpage2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Humpage AR, Fenech M, Thomas P, Falconer IR |title=Micronucleus induction and chromosome loss in transformed human white cells indicate clastogenic and aneugenic action of the cyanobacterial toxin, cylindrospermopsin |journal=Mutation Research |volume=472 |issue=1–2 |pages=155–61 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11113708 |doi=10.1016/S1383-5718(00)00144-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[uracil]] group of CYN has been identified as a [[pharmacophore]] of the toxin. In two experiments, the [[vinylic]] [[hydrogen]] atom on the uracil ring was replaced with a [[chlorine]] atom to form 5-chlorocylindrospermopsin, and the uracil group was truncated to a [[carboxylic acid]], to form cylindrospermic acid (Figure 6).

Of these the latter, which produces CYN, has attracted considerable attention, not only due to the Palm Island outbreak, but also as the species is spreading to more [[temperate]] areas. Previously, the algae was classed as only [[tropical]], however it has recently been discovered in temperate regions of Australia, [[Europe]],&lt;ref name="Poniedziałek B, Rzymski P, Kokociński M 2012"/&gt; [[North America|North]] and [[South America]],&lt;ref name="Griffiths2003"/&gt; and also [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=Stirling2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stirling DJ, Quilliam MA |title=First report of the cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin in New Zealand |journal=Toxicon |volume=39 |issue=8 |pages=1219–22 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11306133 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(00)00266-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1997, three [[cows]] and ten [[calves]] died from cylindrospermopsin [[Toxin|poisoning]] on a farm in northwest Queensland. A nearby dam containing an algal bloom was tested, and ''C. raciborskii'' was identified.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first report of ''C. raciborskii'' causing [[Death|mortality]] in animals in Australia.

The effect of a bloom of ''C. raciborskii'' on an [[aquaculture]] pond in [[Townsville]], Australia was assessed in 1997. The pond contained [[Redclaw]] [[crayfish]], along with a population of [[Lake Eacham]] [[Rainbowfish]] to control the excess food. Analysis revealed that the water contained both [[extracellular]] and [[intracellular]] CYN, and that the crayfish had accumulated this primarily in the liver but also in the [[muscle]] tissue. Examination of the gut contents revealed cyanobacterial [[Cell (biology)|cells]], indicating that the crayfish had [[ingestion|ingested]] intracellular toxin. An experiment using an extract of the bloom showed that it was also possible to uptake extracellular toxin directly into the tissues. Such [[bioaccumulation]], particularly in the aquaculture industry, was of concern, especially when humans were the end users of the product.&lt;ref name="pmid10484741"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Saker ML, Eaglesham GK |title=The accumulation of cylindrospermopsin from the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in tissues of the Redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus |journal=Toxicon |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1065–77 |year=1999 |pmid=10484741 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(98)00240-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of cyanobacterial blooms has been assessed in [[economic]] terms.

'''Disulfur decafluoride''' (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[chemical compound]] discovered in 1934 by Denbigh and Whytlaw-Gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denbigh |first1=K.

It was considered a potential [[chemical warfare]] [[pulmonary agent]] in [[World War II]] because it does not produce [[lacrimation]] or skin irritation, thus providing little warning of exposure. It is produced by the electrical decomposition of [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)—an essentially inert [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] used in high voltage systems such as [[transmission lines]], [[Electrical substation|substation]]s and [[switchgear]]. S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is also made during the production of  SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, but is distilled out. It is a colorless liquid with a burnt match smell similar to [[sulfur dioxide]]. 

==Production==
Disulfur decafluoride is produced primarily by the decomposition of [[sulfur hexafluoride]]:

:2&amp;nbsp;SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Properties==

This compound contains two sulfur atoms that have zero polarization between them and five polarized connections with fluorine atoms.

At temperatures above 150&amp;nbsp;°C, {{chem|S|2|F|10}} decomposes slowly ([[disproportionation]]) to {{chem|SF|6}} and {{chem|SF|4}}:

:S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[Sulfur tetrafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]

{{chem|S|2|F|10}} reacts with [[Tetrafluorohydrazine|{{chem|N|2|F|4}}]] to give [[Difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride|{{chem|SF|5|NF|2}}]]. It reacts with {{chem|SO|2}} to form {{chem|SF|5|OSO|2|F}} in the presence of ultraviolet radiation.

In the presence of excess [[chlorine]] gas, {{chem|S|2|F|10}} reacts to form [[sulfur chloride pentafluoride]] ({{chem|SF|5|Cl}}):

==Toxicity==

Disulfur decafluoride is a colorless gas or liquid with a [[sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-like odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pel88/5714-22.html | title = Sulfur Pentaflu | work = 1988 OSHA PEL Project | publisher = CDC NIOSH }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about 4 times as poisonous as phosgene. Its toxicity is thought to be caused by its [[disproportionation]] in the lungs into {{chem|SF|6}}, which is inert, and {{chem|SF|4}}, which reacts with moisture to form [[sulfurous acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Bridge not Attacked: Chemical Warfare Civilian Research During World War II | author = Johnston, H. | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-981-238-153-8 | pages = 33–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disulfur decafluoride itself is not toxic due to hydrolysis products, since it is hardly hydrolysed by water and most aqueous solutions.

[[File:ARMOR Downburst.png|thumb|Downburst seen from the [[ARMOR Doppler Weather Radar]] in Huntsville, Alabama in 2012. Note the winds in green going towards the radar, and the winds in red going away from the radar.]]
A '''downburst''' is a strong ground-level [[wind]] system that emanates from a point source above and blows [[Polar coordinate system|radially]], that is, in straight lines in all directions from the point of contact at ground level. Often producing damaging winds, it may be confused with a [[tornado]], where high-velocity winds circle a central area, and air moves inward and upward; by contrast, in a downburst, winds are directed downward and then outward from the surface landing point.

Downbursts are created by an area of significantly rain-cooled air that, after reaching ground level, spreads out in all directions producing strong winds. '''Dry downbursts''' are associated with [[thunderstorm]]s with very little rain, while '''wet downbursts''' are created by thunderstorms with high amounts of rainfall. [[Microburst]]s and '''macrobursts''' are downbursts at very small and larger scales, respectively. Another variety, the [[heat burst]], is created by vertical currents on the backside of old outflow boundaries and [[squall line]]s where rainfall is lacking. Heat bursts generate significantly higher temperatures due to the lack of rain-cooled air in their formation. Downbursts create vertical [[wind shear]] or [[microburst]]s, which is dangerous to aviation.

==Definition==
[[File:Microburst - NOAA.jpg|thumb|right|The curl phase soon after an intense microburst hit the surface]]
[[Image:Downburst damage.jpg|thumb|right|Downburst damages in a straight line. (Source [[NOAA]])]]
A downburst is created by a column of sinking air that after hitting ground level, spreads out in all directions and is capable of producing damaging straight-line winds of over {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}, often producing damage similar to, but distinguishable from, that caused by [[tornado]]es. This is because the physical properties of a downburst are completely different from those of a tornado. Downburst damage will radiate from a central point as the descending column spreads out when hitting the surface, whereas tornado damage tends towards convergent damage consistent with rotating winds. To differentiate between tornado damage and damage from a downburst, the term '''straight-line winds''' is applied to damage from microbursts.

Downbursts are particularly strong [[Updraft and Downdraft|downdrafts]] from thunderstorms. Downbursts in air that is [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] free or contains [[virga]] are known as '''dry downbursts''';&lt;ref name="micro"&gt;Fernando Caracena, Ronald L. Holle, and Charles A. Doswell III. [http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~doswell/microbursts/Handbook.html Microbursts: A Handbook for Visual Identification.] Retrieved on 9 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; those accompanied with precipitation are known as '''wet downbursts'''. Most downbursts are less than {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in extent: these are called [[microburst]]s.&lt;ref name="Macroburst"&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=macroburst&amp;submit=Search Macroburst.] Retrieved on 30 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Downbursts larger than {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in extent are sometimes called '''macrobursts'''.&lt;ref name="Macroburst"/&gt; Downbursts can occur over large areas. In the extreme case, a [[derecho]] can cover a huge area more than {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide and over {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, lasting up to 12 hours or more, and is associated with some of the most intense straight-line winds,&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. Parke and Norvan J. Larson.[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/dlh/science/event_archive/summer_archive/1999blowdown/1999blowdown.php Boundary Waters Windstorm.] Retrieved on 30 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but the generative process is somewhat different from that of most downbursts.

===Straight-line winds=== &lt;!-- the page "Thundergusts" links to this section heading --&gt;
{{see also|Derecho}}
'''Straight-line winds''' (also known as '''plough winds''', '''thundergusts''' and '''hurricanes of the prairie''') are very strong winds that can produce damage, demonstrating a lack of the rotational damage pattern associated with [[tornado]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=straight&amp;submit=Search Straight-line wind.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415101545/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=straight&amp;submit=Search |date=15 April 2008 }} Retrieved on 1 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Straight-line winds are common with the [[gust front]] of a thunderstorm or originate with a downburst from a thunderstorm. These events can cause considerable damage, even in the absence of a tornado. The winds can gust to {{convert|130|mph|kph|abbr=on|order=flip}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/derechofacts.htm#strength&lt;/ref&gt; and winds of {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} or more can last for more than twenty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/casepages/jun291998page.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, such straight-line wind events are most common during the spring when instability is highest and weather fronts routinely cross the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Straight-line wind events in the form of [[derecho]]s can take place throughout the eastern half of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/derechofacts.htm#climatology&lt;/ref&gt;

Straight-line winds may be damaging to marine interests. Small ships, cutters and sailboats are at risk from this meteorological phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Formation==
The formation of a downburst starts with [[hail]] or large [[rain]]drops falling through drier air. Hailstones melt and raindrops evaporate, pulling [[latent heat]] from surrounding air and cooling it considerably.  Cooler air has a higher density than the warmer air around it, so it sinks to the ground. As the cold air hits the ground it spreads out and a [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] [[Weather front|front]] can be observed as a [[gust front]]. Areas under and immediately adjacent to the downburst are the areas which receive the highest winds and rainfall, if any is present. Also, because the rain-cooled air is descending from the middle troposphere, a significant drop in temperatures is noticed. Due to interaction with the ground, the downburst quickly loses strength as it fans out and forms the distinctive "curl shape" that is commonly seen at the periphery of the microburst (see image). Downbursts usually last only a few minutes and then dissipate, except in the case of squall lines and derecho events. However, despite their short lifespan, microbursts are a serious hazard to aviation and property and can result in substantial damage to the area.

==Heat bursts==
{{main|Heat burst}}
A special, and much rarer, kind of downburst is a [[heat burst]], which results from precipitation-evaporated air compressionally heating as it descends from very high altitude, usually on the backside of a dying [[squall line]] or outflow boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma "heat burst" sends temperatures soaring |publisher=USA Today&amp;#124;1999-07-08 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheatbst.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961225110244/http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheatbst.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 December 1996 |accessdate=9 May 2007 |date=8 July 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heat bursts are chiefly a nocturnal occurrence, can produce winds over {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}, are characterized by exceptionally dry air, can suddenly raise the surface temperature to {{convert|100|F|C|order=flip}} or more, and sometimes persist for several hours.

==Danger to aviation==
{{see|Microburst#Danger to aircraft}}

Downbursts, particularly microbursts, are exceedingly dangerous to aircraft which are taking off or landing due to the strong vertical [[wind shear]] caused by these events.  A number of fatal crashes have been attributed to downbursts.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;NASA Langley Air Force Base.

'''EGP-6''' is a small type of [[nuclear reactor]], a scaled down version of the [[RBMK]] reactor design.  Notably, these reactors along with the [[RBMK]] designs are some of the few active reactors which still use ordinary (light) [[water]] cooled graphite as a [[neutron moderator]].

The only operating four reactors of this type exist at the [[Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant]], commissioned in 1974. The plant design was developed by the Ural Division of Teploelektroproekt together with [[Izhorskiye Zavody]] and [[IPPE|FEI]] in Obninsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uxc.com/smr/uxc_SMRDetail.aspx?key=EGP-6|title=UxC: SMR Design Profile|author=|date=|website=www.uxc.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces 12 MWe.

It is the world's smallest commercial nuclear reactor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.power-technology.com/features/featurethe-worlds-smallest-nuclear-reactors-4144463/{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Energising India''''' (2004) is a [[short films|short]] [[documentary film|documentary]] on how [[India]] can have energy without [[pollution|polluting]] the [[atmosphere]]. Although about [[India]], this is a [[Cinema of Germany|German film]] (since the producers are [[Germany|German]], [[GTZ]]) and [[Film director|directed]] by the [[National Film Awards|National Award]] winning [[Indian film directors|Indian director]] [[Jyoti Sarup]]. This [[film]] was [[premiered]] in the [[World Energy Conservation Conference]], [[Germany]], in 2004.

==Summary==
The film showcases methods of industrialisation through the case study of three of the top companies of India- INDAL Aluminium (Birla Group), [[Reliance Industries Limited|Reliance Petro-Chemical (Reliance Group)]] and Raymond (Raymond Group).

The film highlights the point that these companies have pollution below 1% and then shows the methods/techniques adopted by them.

==Trivia==
The film started off by showcasing only one company. But when the film was shown to Mr. Sahi, the Secretary, dept. of Energy Conservation, Govt. of India he appreciated the film and efforts and the final result and asked the producers to give the film a wider perspective by adding to more companies of different sectors in the film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3673">For [[gas appliance]]s, a '''flame supervision device''' ('''FSD''') – alternative name: '''flame failure device''' ('''FFD''') – is a general term for any device designed to stop [[flammable]] [[gas]] going to the burner of a gas appliance if the [[flame]] is extinguished. This is to prevent a dangerous buildup of gas within the appliance, its [[chimney]] or the room.&lt;ref name="Treloar, FSD" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of flame failure include chimney downdraught, temporary interruption of the gas supply, gas under-pressure, liquid overspill on cooker hotplates or the [[Mechanical draft|draught]] from an oven door being opened and closed.

FSDs may utilize one of several technologies: [[Thermocouple#Gas appliance safety|thermoelectric valve]]s, [[flame conductance]], [[flame rectification]], [[ultraviolet]] sensing devices and liquid [[pressure regulator|expansion valve]]s.&lt;ref name="Treloar, FSD" /&gt; 

FSD usage in consumer products differs among political units – in the U.S., FSDs are not required by law or regulation for gas range (or gas stove) top burners and consequently are not present on ranges in the U.S.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Cooker hotplates may not have a FSD on each burner. If a hotplate is to be used in a multi-occupancy building every burner must have its own FSD.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

When the FSD activates it should stop (or reduce to safe levels) gas flow to the burner until it is reset manually.

Older devices, such as bimetallic strips, were used in conjunction with [[pilot light]]s. The pilot light is no longer used in new devices, but may still be encountered on old appliances still in service.&lt;ref name="Treloar, FSD" /&gt; Pilot lights were withdrawn because their continual small flame represented a waste of fuel.&lt;ref name="Treloar, FSD" /&gt;  Pilot lights required their own FSD, typically a thermocouple which held the valve open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular testing of FSD is a part of routine maintenance for gas appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treloar|2005|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other safety devices may be fitted in addition to an FSD. One type of these are the [[Vitiation Sensing Device|Vitiation Sensing Devices]],&lt;ref name="Treloar, VSD" &gt;{{harvnb|Treloar|2005|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; that detect an adequate supply of [[oxygen]] for efficient combustion, thus avoiding the production of poisonous [[carbon monoxide]]. As well as detecting a blocked supply of oxygen, these must also detect a blocked exhaust or reversed flow in the exhaust flue owing to wind conditions. Two methods are used to provide these, an Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) that measures the availability of oxygen for combustion or an Atmospheric Sensing Device (ASD) measures excess heat rise in the exhaust.&lt;ref name="Treloar, VSD" /&gt;

A '''flexible alternating current transmission system''' (FACTS) is a system composed of static equipment used for the [[alternating current|AC]] [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical energy]]. It is meant to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability of the network. It is generally a [[power electronics]]-based system.

FACTS is defined by the [[IEEE]] as "a power electronic based system and other static equipment that provide control of one or more AC transmission system parameters to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability."&lt;ref&gt;''Proposed terms and definitions for flexible AC transmission system(FACTS)'', IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Volume 12, Issue 4, October 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;1848–1853. {{DOI|10.1109/61.634216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Siemens "FACTS Increase the reliability of AC grids and reduce power delivery costs. They improve transmission quality and efficiency of power transmission by supplying inductive or reactive power to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/en/power-transmission/facts/ Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) - Siemens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[Image:FACTS theory1.PNG|thumb|Transmission on a no-loss line.]]
[[Image:FACTS theory series compensation.PNG|thumb|Series compensation.]]
[[Image:FACTS theory shunt compensation1.PNG|thumb|Shunt compensation.]]

===Shunt compensation===
In shunt compensation, power system is connected in [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] (parallel) with the FACTS. It works as a controllable [[current source]].  Shunt compensation is of two types:

;Shunt capacitive compensation: This method is used to improve the [[power factor]]. Whenever an inductive load is connected to the transmission line, power factor lags because of lagging load current. To compensate, a shunt capacitor is connected which draws current leading the source [[voltage]]. The net result is improvement in power factor.

;Shunt inductive compensation: This method is used either when charging the [[transmission line]], or, when there is very low load at the receiving end. Due to very low, or no load&amp;nbsp;– very low current flows through the transmission line. Shunt capacitance in the transmission line causes voltage amplification ([[Ferranti effect]]). The receiving end voltage may become double the sending end voltage (generally in case of very long transmission lines). To compensate, shunt inductors are connected across the transmission line. The power transfer capability is thereby increased depending upon the power equation

&lt;math&gt;
P=\left(\frac{EV}{X}\right)\sin(\delta)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta =&lt;/math&gt; power angle

==Theory==

In the case of a no-loss line, voltage magnitude at the receiving end is the same as voltage magnitude at the sending end: V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=V.
Transmission results in a phase lag &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; that depends on line reactance X.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\underline{V_s}&amp;=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) +jV \sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
\underline{V_r}&amp;=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)-jV \sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
\underline{I}&amp;=\frac{\underline{V_s}-\underline{V_r}}{jX}=\frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}}{X}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As it is a no-loss line, active power P is the same at any point of the line:

&lt;math&gt;P_s=P_r=P=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}}{X}=\frac{V^2}{X}\sin(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;

Reactive power at sending end is the opposite of reactive power at receiving end:

&lt;math&gt;Q_s=-Q_r=Q=V\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{2V\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}{X}=\frac{V^2}{X}(1-\cos \delta)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--Thus, active power is &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{V^2}{X}\sin \delta&lt;/math&gt; whereas reactive power is &lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{V^2}{X}(1-cos \delta)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;
As &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is very small, active power mainly depends on &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; whereas reactive power mainly depends on voltage magnitude.

===Series compensation===
FACTS for series compensation modify line impedance: X is decreased so as to increase the transmittable active power. However, more reactive power must be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P&amp;=\frac{V^2}{X-Xc}\sin(\delta)\\
Q&amp;=\frac{V^2}{X-Xc}(1-\cos \delta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Shunt compensation===

Reactive current is injected into the line to maintain voltage magnitude. Transmittable active power is increased but more reactive power is to be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P&amp;=\frac{2V^2}{X}\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
Q&amp;=\frac{2V^2}{X}\left[1-\cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\right]   
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

** Thyristor-switched reactor (TSR): Same as TCR but thyristor is either in zero- or full- conduction. Equivalent reactance is varied in stepwise manner.
** {{anchor|TSC}}&lt;!-- inbound links --&gt; Thyristor-switched capacitor (TSC): capacitor is connected in series with a bidirectional thyristor valve. Thyristor is either in zero- or full- conduction. Equivalent reactance is varied in stepwise manner.
** Mechanically-switched capacitor (MSC): capacitor is switched by circuit-breaker. It aims at compensating steady state reactive power. It is switched only a few times a day.

The '''Forests Now Declaration''' is a declaration that advocates using [[carbon credits]] to [[forest protection|protect]] [[tropical forest]]s. The Declaration was created by the [[Global Canopy Programme]], and has been signed by over 200 NGOs, business leaders, scientists and conservationists. The Declaration was created as carbon credits from [[land use, land-use change and forestry]] were omitted from the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] for the First Commitment Period of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] despite contributing 18-25% of all emissions.&lt;ref&gt;1
Stern N. (2006).  The Stern Review on the economics of Climate Change.  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
[[Deforestation]] in the next five years will release more [[carbon dioxide]] than all aircraft since the [[Wright Brothers]] until at least 2025;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2017}}[http://www.globalcanopy.org/themedia/file/PDFs/Forests%20First%20June%202007.pdf  Forests First in the Fight Against Climate Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910214343/http://www.globalcanopy.org/themedia/file/PDFs/Forests%20First%20June%202007.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }} Global Canopy Programme, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; however, credits from reduced deforestation were omitted from the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] for the first commitment period of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], so there is little incentive for forested countries to reduce their deforestation rates. The Forests NOW declaration seeks to establish new market based mechanisms to protect the [[ecosystem services]] that forests provide in [[biodiversity]] [[conservation movement|conservation]], [[Carbon dioxide sink|carbon sequestration]] and global and local [[water cycle|hydrological]] and [[mineral cycle]]s.

==Prescriptions==
The Declaration prescribes six changes to the existing carbon market frameworks:
* Ensure that [[carbon credits]] for reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and the protection of standing forests are included in all national and international carbon markets, especially those created by the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]].
* Simplify and expand carbon market rules, including the [[Clean Development Mechanism]], to encourage reforestation, afforestation and sustainable forest management.
* Include tropical forest and land use carbon credits in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]], while maintaining strong incentives to reduce industrial emissions.
* Encourage mechanisms that recognise the value of carbon stocks and forest [[ecosystem services]], and support appropriate voluntary carbon market standards.
* Provide assistance for developing nations to build capacity to fully participate in the carbon markets, and to evaluate the ecosystem services their forests provide.
* Incentivize the sustainable use of degraded land and ecosystems, and remove incentives that encourage forest destruction.

A '''gas generator''' is a device for generating gas.  A gas generator may create gas by a chemical reaction or from a solid or liquid source, when storing a pressurized gas is undesirable or impractical.

The term often refers to a device that uses a [[rocket propellant]] to generate large quantities of gas.  The gas is typically used to drive a turbine rather than to provide [[thrust]] as in a [[rocket engine]].  Gas generators of this type are used to power [[turbopump]]s in rocket engines, and are used by some [[auxiliary power unit]]s to power [[electrical generator]]s and [[hydraulic pump]]s.  

Another common use of the term is in the [[Industrial gases]] industry, where gas generators are used to produce gaseous chemicals for sale.
For example, the [[chemical oxygen generator]], which delivers breathable oxygen at a controlled rate over a prolonged period.  During [[World War II]], portable gas generators that converted coke to [[producer gas]] were used to power vehicles as a way of alleviating [[petrol]] shortages.

Other types include the gas generator in an [[Airbag#Automobile|automobile airbag]], which is designed to rapidly produce a specific quantity of inert gas.

==Common applications==

===As a power source===
The [[V-2 rocket]] used [[hydrogen peroxide]] decomposed by a liquid [[sodium permanganate]]&lt;!-- Some sources say potassium permanganate.  See also Z-stoff --&gt; [[catalyst]] solution as a gas generator. This was used to drive a [[turbopump]] to pressurize the main [[LOX]]-[[ethanol]] propellants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

Gas generators have also been used to power [[torpedo]]es.  For example, the US Navy [[Mark 16 torpedo]] was powered by [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref name="US Torp"&gt;{{cite report

&lt;!--Could also mention things like the [mars lander?] reaction control system, which (if I remember correctly) is described as a gas generator feeding selectable nozzles.--&gt;

A concentrated solution of [[hydrogen peroxide]] is known as [[high test peroxide]] and decomposes to produce oxygen and water (steam).&lt;!-- May be relevant but not checked &lt;ref name="Sutton, 344" &gt;{{harvnb|Sutton|1992|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[[Hydrazine]] decomposes to nitrogen and hydrogen. The reaction is strongly exothermic and produces high volume of hot gas from small volume of liquid.&lt;!-- May be relevant but not checked &lt;ref name="Sutton, 344" /&gt; --&gt;
#3 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

#4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Many [[rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid rocket propellant]] compositions can be used as gas generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutton|1992|pages=441–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and fire suppression===
Many [[Airbag#Automobile|automobile airbag]]s use [[sodium azide]] for inflation ({{As of|2003|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  |doi=10.1080/10643380390245002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small pyrotechnic charge triggers its decomposition, producing [[nitrogen]] gas, which inflates the airbag in around 30 milliseconds. A typical airbag in the US might contain 130 grams of sodium azide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Similar gas generators are used for fire suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

[[Sodium azide]] decomposes exothermically to sodium and nitrogen.
: &lt;chem&gt;2 NaN3 -&gt; 2 Na + 3 N2&lt;/chem&gt;
The resulting sodium is hazardous, so other materials are added, e.g. potassium nitrate and silica, to convert it to a silicate glass.
&lt;!-- Seems to be room for something on disposal of unused sodium azide --&gt;

===Oxygen generation===
A [[chemical oxygen generator]] delivers breathable oxygen at a controlled rate over a prolonged period. 
Sodium, potassium, and lithium [[chlorate]]s and [[perchlorate]]s are used.

===Generation of fuel gas===
A device that converts [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] or other carbonaceous material into [[producer gas]] may be used as a source of fuel gas for industrial use.  Portable gas generators of this type were used during [[World War II]] to power vehicles as a way of alleviating [[petrol]] shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lord Barnby |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1941/jul/16/producer-gas-for-transport |title=PRODUCER GAS FOR TRANSPORT.

[[File:Hinkle Fieldhouse roof.jpg|thumb|upright|The ceiling of [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], was constructed of large [[truss]]es built of [[rivet]]ed girders.]]

A '''girder''' {{IPAc-en|'|g|ɜr|d|ər}} is a support [[Beam (structure)|beam]] used in [[construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Plate-Girder Construction |first=Isami |last=Hirol |publisher=[[BiblioBazaar]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-554-88802-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the main horizontal support of a structure which supports smaller beams. Girders often have an [[I-beam]] [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] composed of two load-bearing ''flanges'' separated by a stabilizing ''web'', but may also have a box shape, Z shape and other forms. A girder is commonly used to build bridges.

In traditional [[timber framing]] a girder is called a [[girt]].

Small steel girders are [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolled]] into shape.  Larger girders (1&amp;nbsp;m/3 feet deep or more) are made as '''plate girders''', welded or bolted together from separate pieces of [[steel plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~adluri/courses/steel/ppt%20files1/Topic%20-Plate%20girders.pdf |first=Adluri |last=Seshu |title=Structural Steel Design: Plate Girders (class notes) |publisher=Memorial University |date=17 Jun 2009 |accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Warren''' type girder replaces the solid web with an open latticework between the flanges.  This [[truss]] arrangement combines strength with economy of materials and can therefore be relatively light. Patented in 1848 by its designers [[James Warren (engineer)|James Warren]] and Willoughby Theobald Monzani, its structure consists of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted [[Triangle|equilateral triangle]]-shaped spaces along its length, ensuring that no individual [[strut]], beam, or [[Tie (engineering)|tie]] is subject to bending or torsional straining forces, but only to tension or compression. It is an improvement{{fact|date=December 2015|reason=Yes, this makes sense, but the factual statement should be sourced.}} over the '''Neville''' truss which uses a spacing configuration of [[Triangle|isosceles triangle]]s.

However, in a reversal of reference and defined units, a gram is now defined as one thousandth of the [[SI]] base unit, the [[kilogram]], or [[Scientific notation|1×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;]] kg, which itself is ''now defined'' by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], not in terms of grams, but by "the amount of electricity needed to counteract its force"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kilogram gets a new definition |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46143399 |website=BBC News |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only unit symbol for gram that is recognised by the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is "g" following the numeric value with a space, as in "640&amp;nbsp;g" to stand for "640 grams" in the English language. The SI does not support the use of abbreviations such as "gr" (which is the symbol for [[Grain (unit)|grains]]),&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology (October 2011).

==History==
The word ''gramme''  was adopted by the French [[National Convention]] in its 1795 decree revising the metric system as replacing the ''gravet'' introduced in 1793. Its definition remained that of the weight (''poids'') of a cubic centimetre of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ''metre'' (''mètre'') on which this definition depends was itself defined as the ten-millionth part of a quarter of Earth's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]], given in [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution|traditional units]] as 3 ''[[foot (unit)|pieds]]'',  11.44 ''lignes'' (a ''ligne'' being the 12th part of an ''pouce'' (inch), or the 144th part of a ''pied''.&lt;/ref&gt;
French ''gramme'' was taken from the [[Late Latin]] term ''{{lang|la|gramma}}''. This word—ultimately from Greek {{lang|grc|γράμμα}} (''grámma''), "letter"—had adopted a specialised meaning in [[Late Antiquity]] of "one twenty-fourth part of an ounce" (two [[oboli]]),&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dgramma2 s.v. "gramma"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717095000/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=gramma2 |date=2015-07-17 }}, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to about 1.14 modern grams. This use of the term is found in the ''carmen de ponderibus et mensuris'' ("poem about weights and measures") composed around 400 AD.{{efn|The date and authorship of this Late Latin didactic poem are both uncertain; it was attributed to [[Priscian]] but is now attributed to Rem(m)ius Favinus/Flav(in)us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knorr|first1=Wilbur R.|editor1-last=Hornblower|editor1-first=Simon|editor2-last=Spawforth|editor2-first=Antony|title=The Oxford Classical Dictionary.|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=019866172X|page=292|edition=3rd|chapter=Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's title is reflected in the French phrase ''poids et mesures'' ("weights and mesures") in the title of the 1795 National Convention decree, ''Décret relatif aux poids et aux mesures'' that introduced the gram, and indirectly in the name of the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] responsible for the modern definition of the metric units.}}
There is also evidence that the Greek {{lang|grc|γράμμα}} was used in the same sense at around the same time, in the 4th century, and survived in this sense into [[Medieval Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell. Robert Scott. ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (revised and augmented edition, Oxford, 1940)   [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=gra/mma s.v. γράμμα] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717095023/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgra%2Fmma |date=2015-07-17 }}, citing the 10th-century work ''[[Geoponica]]'' and a 4th-century papyrus edited in L. Mitteis, ''Griechische Urkunden der Papyrussammlung zu Leipzig'', vol. i (1906), 62 ii 27.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Latin term did not remain current in [[Medieval Latin]] and was recovered in Renaissance scholarship.{{efn|In the Renaissance, the ''carmen de ponderibus et mensuris'' was received as a work of the 1st-century grammarian [[Remmius Palaemon]] edited in 1528 by Johann Setzer of [[Hagenau]], together with works by [[Celsius]], [[Priscian]] and Johannes Caesarius; ''Aurelij Cornelij Celsi, De re medica, libri octo eruditissimi. Q. Sereni Samonici Praecepta medica, uersibus hexametris. Q. Rhemnij Fannij Palaemonis, De ponderibus [et] mensuris, liber rarus [et] utilissimus''}}

The gram was the fundamental unit of mass in the 19th-century [[centimetre–gram–second system of units|centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS)]]. The CGS system co-existed with the [[MKS system of units]], first proposed in 1901, during much of the 20th century, but the gram has been displaced by the [[kilogram]] as the fundamental unit for mass when the MKS system was chosen for the [[SI base units]] in 1960.

==Uses==

The gram is today the most widely used unit of measurement for non-liquid ingredients in cooking and grocery shopping worldwide{{who says|date=December 2018}}.

Most standards and legal requirements for nutrition labels on food products require relative contents to be stated per 100&amp;nbsp;g of the product, such that the resulting figure can also be read as a percentage by weight.

This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

'''High tension leads''' or '''high tension cables''' or '''spark plug wires''' or '''spark plug cables''' are the wires that connect a [[distributor]], ignition coil, or [[ignition magneto|magneto]] to each of the [[spark plugs]] in some types of [[internal combustion engine]]. "High tension lead" or "cable" is also used for any electrical cable carrying a [[high voltage]] in any context. ''Tension'' in this instance is a synonym for [[voltage]]. High tension leads, like many engine components, wear out over time. Each lead contains only one wire, as the current does not return through the same lead, but through the earthed/grounded engine which is connected to the opposite battery terminal (negative terminal on modern engines) high tension may also be referred to as HT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite patent

[[File:KA24ITB17.jpg|thumb|right| A set of spark plug wires.]]

==Description==
Spark plug wires have an outer insulation several times thicker than the conductor, made of a very flexible and heat-resistant material such as [[silicone]] or [[EPDM rubber]]. The thick insulation prevents [[arcing]] from the cable to an earthed engine component.  A rubber "boot" covers each terminal. [[Dielectric grease]] can be used to improve insulation; a small amount can be applied in the inside of the rubber boot at each end of each wire to help seal out moisture.  Printing on spark plug wires may include a brand name, insulation thickness (in millimeters), insulation material type, cylinder number, and conductor type (suppressor or solid wire).  
[[File:Produzione Cavo Candela Brecav.jpg|thumb|Candle Cable Production (Patent UA2016A009030&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)]]
The wire from each spark plug is just long enough to reach the distributor, without excess. Each end of a spark plug wire has a metal terminal that clips onto the spark plug and distributor, coil, or magneto. There are dedicated spark plug wire pliers, tools designed for removing the terminal from a spark plug without damaging it. 

To reduce [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] (RFI) produced by the spark being radiated by the wires, which may cause malfunction of sensitive electronic systems in modern vehicles or interfere with the car radio, various means in the spark plug and associated lead have been used over time to reduce the nuisance:
# Copper conductors (no suppression)
# Resistor in spark plug with copper conductor
# Compressed carbon powder as conductor in the lead to act as a resistor
# Stainless steel wire wound as a coil in the lead with a resistance of about 1300 ohms/meter since 1980s. This acts as an inductor and a resistor

During the production of the spark plug cable, the presence of residual dielectric is often found. This deposit affects the conductivity characteristics of the wire, creating a more or less important resistance that does not allow the wire to pass the routine tests. The patent of the company Brecav&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; allowed to pursue the improvement of the quality standards of production of the spark plug wire and a certification of the working hours of the spark plug cable.

==Application==
Placing spark plug wires back into their separators or holders during replacement helps to keep them in place despite engine vibration, extending their life. 
A common problem with spark plug wires is [[corrosion]] of the metal end terminals. Better-quality spark plug wires usually have [[brass]] terminals, which are more resistant to corrosion than other metals used.

Older engines also have a wire connecting the [[ignition coil]] to the [[distributor]], known as a '''coil wire'''. A coil wire is of the same construction as a spark plug wire, but generally shorter and with different terminals. Some distributors have an ignition coil built inside them, eliminating the need for a separate coil wire, e.g. GM [[High energy ignition]] system and some [[Toyota]]s and [[Honda]]s.

Many modern car engines have multiple ignition coils (one for each pair of cylinders) built into a [[distributor#Direct and distributorless ignition|coil pack]], eliminating the need for a distributor and coil wire. Some car engines use a small ignition coil [[distributor#Direct and distributorless ignition|mounted on top of each spark plug]], eliminating the need for spark plug wires entirely.

==Risks and Prevention==

The average life span of a candle cable is about 50000 km (in the case of a mixed path). The wear of the spark plug wire leads first to an increase in fuel consumption and a loss in performance. The increased risk of a worn spark plug wire is the possibility of damaging the system downstream of the carburation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.notiziariomotoristico.com/news/9734/brecav-perche-cambiare-cavi-candela-e-bobine|title=Brecav: perché cambiare cavi candela e bobine?|last=|first=|date=2018|work=Notiziario Motoristico|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3328">'''Hypermiling''' is driving a vehicle with [[Energy-efficient driving|techniques that minimize fuel consumption]]. Those who use these techniques are called "hypermilers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12181 |title=EERE News: Progressive Automotive X Prize Expanded to Include Major Automakers |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing popularity==

Hypermiling can be practiced in any vehicle regardless of fuel consumption. It gained popularity due to the rise in gasoline prices in the 2000s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Booth |first=Michael |url=http://www.denverpost.com/aurora/ci_9822065 |title=Hypermilers stretch their gas mileage |publisher=The Denver Post |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some hypermiling techniques are illegal in some countries because they are dangerous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectID=15&amp;articleID=20080717_15_E3_spa462136 |title='Hypermiling' tricks sometimes unlawful |publisher=Tulsa World |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2008, the New Oxford American Dictionary voted Hypermiling the best new word of the year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moscrip |first=Lara |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/11/news/economy/wordof_year/index.htm |title=Word of the year: 'Hypermiling' |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Safety and Awareness Program==

Hypermiling has come under fire from several sides because some hypermilers show dangerous or illegal behaviour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/motorists-risking-their-lives/2008/08/23/1219262622708.html |title=Motorists risking their lives to save on petrol |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2008-08-23 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as tailgating larger vehicles on motorways to save fuel, cycling between accelerating and coasting in neutral, and even turning the engine off when its power is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CNET|title=How To: Hypermile and get great gas mileage|date=2014-11-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsCt_bFvXeg&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Hypermiling Safety Foundation was established in August 2008 to promote a safety and education program that promotes legal fuel-saving techniques.

==Hypermiling with electric cars==
The range of electric cars is limited. To get maximum out of the battery, drivers sometimes use hypermiling.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.treehugger.com/cars/you-can-get-over-range-anxiety-oscar-helps.html What's Electric Vehicle Hypermiling?]&lt;/ref&gt; Some try to get a new record with one charging of battery. For example, a [[Tesla Model 3]] ran more than 1000 km with one battery charge. The average speed was 38 km/h and the whole drive took around 30 hours. The tester used the autopilot of Tesla Model 3, running the car unmanned. The test car did not drive on a public road.&lt;ref&gt;[https://electrek.co/2018/07/16/tesla-model-3-autopilot-unmanned-hypermiling-record/ Tesla Model 3 unmanned on Autopilot travels 1,000 km on a single charge in new hypermiling record]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The programme was formally launched in 1977&lt;ref name= EBC1/&gt;, following the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] which drove research into alternative sources of energy and technologies to improve energy efficiency. Since then, IEA EBC’s main aim has been to provide an international focus for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] research in the building sector, with its current mission being to ''“develop and facilitate the integration of technologies and processes for energy efficiency and conservation into healthy, low emission and sustainable buildings and communities, through innovation and research”''&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency Energy in Buildings and Communities (IEA EBC) Programme. Preface of “[http://www.iea-ebc.org/Data/Sites/1/media/docs/EBC/EBC_Strategic_Plan_2014_19.pdf Strategic Plan 2014-2019]”, 2013, p.iii&lt;/ref&gt;.

The wood colour is initially yellow but darkens to a richer copper brown over time.
It is yielded mostly (probably) by ''[[Milicia excelsa]]''. In much of the literature on this timber the names of the trees that yields it are given as ''Chlorophora excelsa'' and ''Chlorophora regia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294241/iroko-wood iroko wood], Encyclopædia Britannica on-line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=506548 Chlorophora excelsa  (Welw.)

==Uses==
[[File:Iroko wood.jpg|thumb|Iroko wood]]

The wood is used for a variety of purposes including boat-building, domestic flooring, furniture and outdoor gates.  From the late 1990s, it was used as part of the [[txalaparta]], a [[Basque music|Basque]] musical instrument constructed of wooden boards, due to its lively sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cancioneros.com/co/2839/2/la-txalaparta-el-sonido-ancestral-de-euskadi-por-pol-ducable-roges|title = La txalaparta, el sonido ancestral de Euskadi por Pol Ducable Rogés|website = CANCIONEROS.COM|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iroko is one of the traditional [[djembe#Shell|djembe]] woods.  Iroko wood was the wood chosen for the [[pew]]s in the [[Our Lady of Peace Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKoKHmuexywC|title=Architecture and Power in Africa|last=Elleh|first=Nnamdi|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275976798|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a very durable wood;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VfuWr1KxrGYC|title = Wood Structure and Properties '06|last = Kurjatko|first = Stanislav|last2 = Kúdela|first2 = Jozef|last3 = Lagaňa|first3 = Rastislav|date = 2006-01-01|publisher = Arbora Publishers|isbn = 9788096886845|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; iroko does not require regular treatment with oil or varnish when used outdoors, although it is very difficult to work with tools as it tends to splinter easily, and blunts tools very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HikdloJ3Z2gC|title = Upgrading Your Boat's Interior|last = Westin|first = Mike|date = 2013-04-12|publisher = A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn = 9781408159095|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK there are no trade restrictions on the machining of this timber. The only reported adverse effects known to be caused by the dust from Iroko are asthma, dermatitis and nettle rash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HSE Toxic Woods Information Sheet|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/wis30.pdf|publisher=Health and Safety Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kislaya Guba [[tidal power station|Tidal Power Station]]''' is an experimental project in [[Kislaya Guba]], [[Russia]].

The station is the world's 5th largest{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} tidal power plant with the output capacity of {{convert|1.7|MW}}. Station began operating in 1968, but was later shut down for 10 years until December 2004, when funding resumed. The old {{convert|0.4|MW}} French-built generation unit was dismantled. In 2004 was installed first new {{convert|0.2|MW}} generation unit, and in 2007&amp;nbsp;– second, {{convert|1.5|MW}}. The site was originally chosen because the long and deep [[fjord]] had a fairly narrow outlet to the sea which could easily be dammed for the project. There are plans for two larger scale projects based on this design near [[Mezen, Mezensky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast|Mezen]], on the [[White Sea]] and [[Tugur (Khabarovsk Krai)|Tugur]] on the [[Sea of Okhotsk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrdrenewables.com/sites/renew/Lists/EBRD%20Master%20Spreadsheet/All%20Item%20Public%20View.aspx Latest Developments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early years===
He was Minister for Coal and Energy in the [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]] in the 1970s.   He hit the headlines in 1979 in connection with his perceived role in exacerbating the consequences of the country's [[:de:Schneekatastrophe in Norddeutschland 1978|weather/energy crisis]] during the winter of 1978/79.&lt;ref name=spiegel311979&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40349078.html|author1=Publisher-editor [[Rudolf Augstein]] |author2=|title= Eigentlich teurer:  Wegen der düsteren Wirtschaftslage muß Ost-Berlin den Bürgern Konsum-Einschränkungen verordnen -- wahrscheinlich im Herbst, nach den Feiern zum 30. Jahrestag der DDR.|publisher= [[Der Spiegel]] (online)|date=30 July 1979|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Klaus Siebold was born in [[:de:Laubusch|Laubusch]], a small new town in eastern [[Saxony]].   Laubusch, originally named "Kolonie Erika" had been built ten years earlier to a plan by the architect/town planner Ewald Kleffel: it had taken on the name "Laubusch" from a nearby settlement that had been removed to make way for a lignite mine.   Kleffel, who designed the town, had been much influenced by the English town planner [[Ebenezer Howard]], but whereas Howard designed pleasant dormitory towns for London commuters, Kleffel's towns were built to support the rapidly expanding [[Lignite|Lignite (brown coal)]] mining industry, and Laubusch was built to accommodate workers of the [[:de:Ilse Bergbau AG|Ilse Bergbau AG]] mining company.   Klaus Siebold's education and later life were in several respects shaped by mining.  He trained as a miner.   He then studied at a technical college dedicated to mining engineering, where he became a qualified Mining Engineer.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKS/&gt;   Siebel was also selected for higher education at the prestigious [[Parteihochschule Karl Marx|Karl Marx Academy]] just outside Berlin, and here he gained a degree in Social Sciences.

===Career===
In 1952 Siebold took a job as a full-time official of East Germany's ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (SED/ ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'')]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKS/&gt;   Between 1957 and 1959 he served as director of a [[Fossil-fuel power station|lignite-fueled power plant]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKS/&gt;   He then became head of the Coal Industry section, both at the [[People's Economic Council|People's Economic Council (VWR / ''Volkswirtschaftsrat'')]], and with the [[:de:Staatliche Plankommission|National Planning and Development Commission]].   Between 1963 and 1965 he was Deputy Chairman with responsibility for Coal and Energy with the VWR.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenKS/&gt;

He entered government in December 1965 as Minister for Primary sector industry&lt;ref&gt;''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', 23 December 1965, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and was then switched in November 1971 to become [[:de:Ministerium für Kohle und Energie|Minister for Coal and Energy]],&lt;ref&gt;''Neues Deutschland'', 30 November 1971, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; a position he retained till 1979.

In April 1978 he traveled to [[Maputo]] where he signed an agreement to send more East German mining experts to [[Mozambique]].   Since January 1978 East Germans had been working in the [[Bituminous coal]] mine at [[Moatize]], following a [[firedamp]] explosion that had taken the lives of more than 100 Mozambican miners.&lt;ref&gt;Neues Deutschland, 25 April 1978, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;   As head of the East German side in the joint East German/Mozambique Economic Committee, Siebold visited Mozambique two more times in 1978, and was on each occasion received by [[Samora Machel|President Samora Machel]].&lt;ref&gt;Neues Deutschland, 11 July 1978, page 1 &amp; Neues Deutschland, 19 December 1978, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus Siebold lost his ministerial position because of the [[:de:Schneekatastrophe in Norddeutschland 1978|Energy Crisis]] that followed the exceptional winter weather in 1978/79.   He had sanctioned maintenance shut downs of power plant in January 1979 at a time when sustained heavy snow falls imperiled East German power supplies.   The pumps serving numerous district heating systems failed and families had to be evacuated from their frozen apartments.   In cold barns young cattle were frozen to death, as were hens in their battery cages.&lt;ref name=spiegel311979/&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel401979&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-39868802.html|title=Ulbrichts Schatten wird größer:  Die DDR im dreißigsten Jahr (I): Vorwärts in die Vergangenheit|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online)|author=Publisher-editor [[Rudolf Augstein]] |date=1 October 1979|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Shortly before the snow storms, on 13/14 December 1978, at the 9th conference of the SED Central Committee, Siebold was on the receiving end of the conventional lavish praise, here from a candidate for Politburo membership called [[:de:Werner Walde|Werner Walde]].&lt;ref&gt;''Neues Deutschland'', 15 December 1978, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;   In contrast, at the party's tenth conference, on 27 April 1979, criticism came from the party leader, [[Erich Honecker]], who asked that for a decisive improvement in leadership from the Ministry of Coal and Energy.   "Sudden power outages should on no account become necessary in the first place." (''„Plötzliche Abschaltungen dürfen gar nicht erst notwendig werden.“'')&lt;ref&gt;''Neues Deutschland'', 28 April 1979, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   On 28 June 1979 Siebold was sacked by the Chairman of the Council of State, [[Willi Stoph]].   His dismissal came without official plaudits, in eloquent contrast to the treatment afforded to [[:de:Kurt Fichtner|Kurt Fichtner]], the other minister dismissed at the same time:  Fichter was fulsomely thanked for his work.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'', 29 June 1979, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this Siebold was sent back to work in industry.   Among other things, he worked as Director of [[Fossil-fuel power station|lignite-fueled power plant]].

===Democratic politics===
In the first, and as it turned out last, [[East German general election, 1990|free national election]] held in East Germany, in March 1990, Klaus Siebold stood for election in the [[Cottbus]] electoral district, but he was not elected.&lt;ref&gt;''Neues Deutschland'', 9. March 1990, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS)''' in [[Daejeon, South Korea]] was independently established as the [[nuclear safety]] regulatory expert organization in February 1990 with a specific mission to develop and implement [[nuclear safety]] regulation. The ultimate goal of nuclear safety regulation is to protect the public and to preserve the environment from the radiation hazards that might be accompanied with the production or utilization of nuclear energy. Accomplishing its precious mission, KINS will make every effort to realize VISION 2020‘ Heart of Global Nuclear Safety’.

The vision of KINS is '''Heart of Global Nuclear Safety''' that means KINS becomes the "heart of global nuclear safety" trusted by the people and the world, by being committed to nuclear safety with the best expertise and leadership.

[[File:SN-p837.jpg|thumb|Laid paper from before the era of machine-made paper—leaf from [[Linnaeus]]'s ''Systema naturae'' (1758)]]
'''Laid paper''' is a type of [[paper]] having a ribbed texture imparted by the manufacturing process. In the pre-mechanical period of European [[papermaking]] (from the 12th century into the 19th century), laid paper was the predominant kind of paper produced. Its use, however, diminished in the 19th century, when it was largely supplanted by [[wove paper]]. Laid paper is still commonly used by [[artist]]s as a support for [[charcoal]] [[drawing]]s.

==History==
Before the mechanization of papermaking, the laid pattern was produced by the wire [[sieve]] in the rectangular mold used to produce single sheets of paper. A worker would dip the mold into a vat containing diluted [[linen]] pulp, then lift it out, tilt it to spread the pulp evenly over the sieve, and, as the water drained out between the wires, shake the mold to lock the fibers together. In the process, the pattern of the wires in the sieve was imparted to the sheet of paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Gaskell]], ''A New Introduction to Bibliography'' (New York &amp; Oxford: Oxford UP, 1972), pp. 57–58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Randolph Caldecott illustration2.jpg|left|thumb|Visible laid pattern effect in a [[picture book]] illustration by [[Randolph Caldecott]].  Published 1887, digitally restored.]]
Modern papermaking techniques use a [[Watermark#Dandy roll process|dandy roll]] to create the laid pattern during the early stages of manufacture, in the same way as applying a paper [[watermark]]. While in the wet state, the paper stock (a dilute dispersion of the cellulose fibers in water) is drained on a wire mesh to de-water the stock. During this process, a dandy roll with a laid mesh pattern is pressed into the wet stock, displacing the cellulose fiber.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Commerce, ''Circular of the Bureau of Standards'', No. 70 (Washington: GPO, 1917), [https://books.google.com/books?id=spMPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169].&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern has to be applied at a particular stock consistency; otherwise the pattern will be lost as the fiber flows back while the stock moves past the dandy (too wet), or fiber will pick out of the stock (too dry), causing surface disruption. As the fiber is displaced, localized areas of higher and lower density are produced in a laid pattern, and the pattern is also created on the paper's surface. The pattern is therefore apparent both as one looks through the sheet and as one views its surface. Applying the laid pattern as a mechanical emboss would not create the ribbed pattern seen on looking through the sheet, as this is achieved only by watermarking techniques.

The traditional laid pattern consists of a series of wide-spaced lines (chain lines) parallel to the shorter sides of the sheet—or, in machine-made paper, running in the machine direction—and more narrowly spaced lines (laid lines) which are at 90 degrees to the chain lines.

'''Leo Yaffe''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|FRSC}} (July 6, 1916 &amp;ndash; May 14, 1997) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[nuclear chemistry]] scientist and a proponent of the peaceful uses of [[nuclear power]].

Born in [[Devils Lake, North Dakota|Devils Lake]], [[North Dakota]], his family moved to [[Winnipeg]] in 1920. He studied at the [[University of Manitoba]] receiving a B.Sc.(Hons) in 1940, a [[Master of Science|M.Sc]] in 1941, and was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc]] in 1982. He received a Ph.D in 1943 from [[McGill University]].

In 1943, he was recruited by [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] to work at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s  [[Montreal Laboratory]], moving to the [[Chalk River Laboratories]], on the banks of the [[Ottawa River]], in [[Ontario]], at the end of the war. He remained with the AECL until 1952.

In 1952, he moved to Montreal, where the J.S. Foster [[cyclotron]] had just been built at [[McGill University]]. In 1958 he became the Macdonald Professor of Chemistry.

From 1963 to 1965 he was director of research at the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] in [[Vienna]]. Returning to McGill he was appointed head of the Department of Chemistry until 1972. In 1974 he was appointed Vice-Principal (administration) which he held until he retired in 1981. From 1981 to 1982, he was the president of the [[Chemical Institute of Canada]].

He married Betty Workman and has two children: Carla Krasnick, and Mark Yaffe. Yaffe died in Montreal in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;https://cns-snc.ca/media/history/pioneers/yaffe/yaffe.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McGill University Archives]] holds a collection of his personal papers and photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archivalcollections.library.mcgill.ca/index.php/leo-yaffe-fonds|title=Leo Yaffe Fonds, MG4046|last=|first=|date=|website=McGill Archival Collections Catalogue|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, many nuclear accidents have occurred since the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986. Two thirds of these mishaps occurred in the US.&lt;ref name=sovsing/&gt; The French [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|Atomic Energy Commission]] ([[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]]) has concluded that technical innovation cannot eliminate the risk of human errors in nuclear plant operation.

An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005–2055, at least four serious nuclear power accidents would be expected in that period.&lt;ref name=sovsing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/docs/policy-briefs/201101_RSU_PolicyBrief_1-2nd_Thought_Nuclear-Sovacool.pdf |title=Second Thoughts About Nuclear Power |author=Benjamin K.

==Nuclear safety==
{{Main article|Nuclear safety}}
The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.&lt;ref name=globen/&gt; Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Hugh Gusterson  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says  |author=James Paton |date=April 4, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.&lt;ref name=globen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z. |author2=Delucchi, Mark A. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005–2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.&lt;ref name="sovsing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |work= |page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Globally, there have been at least 99 (civilian and military) recorded nuclear power plant accidents from 1952 to 2009 (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define nuclear energy accidents that must be reported), totaling US$20.5 billion in property damages. Property damage costs include destruction of property, emergency response, [[environmental remediation]], evacuation, lost product, fines, and court claims.&lt;ref name=critev/&gt; Because nuclear power plants are large and complex, accidents on site tend to be relatively expensive.&lt;ref name=bksaccident/&gt;

The 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in [[Pennsylvania]] was caused by a series of failures in secondary systems at the reactor, which allowed radioactive steam to escape and resulted in the partial core meltdown of one of two reactors at the site, making it the most significant accident in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;Stencel, Mark. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/tmi.htm "A Nuclear Nightmare in Pennsylvania"], ''[[The Washington Post]], March 27, 1999. Accessed July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's worst nuclear accident has been the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the [[Soviet Union]], one of two accidents that has been rated as a level 7 (the highest) event on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nei.org/keyissues/safetyandsecurity/policybriefs/internationalnucleareventscale3 "International Nuclear Event Scale Enhances Public Communications"], [[Nuclear Energy Institute]]. Accessed July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the [[Chernobyl disaster]] may have scored an 8 or 9, if the scale continued. The accident occurred at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] after an unsafe systems test led to a rupture of the reactor vessel and a series of steam explosions that destroyed reactor number four. The radioactivity plume spread to the surrounding city of [[Prypiat (city)|Pripyat]] and covered extensive portions of Europe with traces of radioactivity, leaving reindeer in [[Northern Europe]] and sheep in portions of [[England]] unfit for human consumption. A {{convert|30|km}} "[[Zone of alienation]]" has been formed around the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, Steve. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4843316.stm "Chernobyl diary – Part One"], [[BBC News]], April 4, 2006. Accessed July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 57 accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and over 56 nuclear accidents have occurred in the USA. Relatively few accidents have involved fatalities.&lt;ref name=critev&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a923050767~db=all~jumptype=rss A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia] ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, pp. 379–380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that not all ratings are final as [[Cancer]] and Uncounted/Hidden results may have/will occur.

== Definition ==
Still in the stage of development, Local Flexibility Markets will enable distributed energy resources (short DER, e.g. storage operators, [[:en:Demand_response|demand response]] actors, [[:en:Electric_vehicle|electric vehicles]], [[:en:End_user|end users]], (renewable) power plants) to provide their flexibility in electricity demand or production/feed-in for the system operator or another counterparty at a local level. As there are different purposes for the use of this flexibility (market oriented, system oriented, grid oriented, see "flexibility triangle"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cired.net/publications/workshop2016/pdfs/CIRED2016_0128_final.pdf|title=Concepts for Flexibility Use - Interaction of Market and Grid on DSO Level|last=Ohrem, Telöken|first=|date=June 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there exist a variety of different market designs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2016/Smart_Markets/Agora_Smart-Market-Design_WEB.pdf#page=3|title=Smart-Market-Design in deutschen Verteilnetzen|last=Ecofys und Fraunhofer IWES|first=|date=March 2017|year=|website=|publisher=Agore Energiewende|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, comprising different actors and role models. Several local market models aim to efficiently tackle the widespread issue of grid congestion. This category of local markets is described further in this article.

== Background – Problems and Challenges (Northern Germany) ==
The already rapid expansion of [[:en:Renewable_energy|Renewable Energies]] accelerated in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erneuerbare_Energien#Situation_in_der_Europäischen_Union|title=Erneuerbare Energien|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|year=|website=|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc.|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case in Germany, and even more so in its Northern regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1= 50Hertz, Amprion, TenneT, TransnetBW|Title=EEG-Anlagenstammdaten|Date=2016|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50GW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/pocketbook_energy_2017_web.pdf#Page=88|title=EU Energy in Figures, Statistical Pocketb Book 2017|last=European Union|first=|date=July 2017|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of installed wind capacity generated over a third of Germanys electricity demand in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Prof. Dr. Bruno Berger|EditorSurname1= Fraunhofer Institut für Solare Energiesysteme ISE|Title=Stromerzeugung in Deutschland im Jahr 2017|Date=2018|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the Land of Schleswig-Holstein was able to cover 95%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Themen/W/windenergie.html|title=Windenergie|last=Ministerium für Energiewende, Landwirtschaft, Umwelt, Natur und Digitalisierung|first=|date=|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of its electricity demand by wind-generated energy ([[:en:Wind_power#Offshore_wind_power|onshore]]).

'''Slow grid expansion causes congestions'''
[[File:Regional congestions due to high energy feed-in.jpg|thumb|616x616px|Regional Congestions due to high energy feed-in]]
For transportation to the consumer via the electricity grid, these strong amounts of energy require accordingly developed grid capacities. But while the expansion of wind energy happened very fast, mainly due to the EEG-incentives, the expansion of the grid happened much slower, since the regulation behind grid expansion requires extensive bureaucratic efforts. This fact causes a sophisticated problem: in times of strong wind energy generation, the amount of electricity is too high to get properly feed in and distributed through the grid. The limited grid capacities are simply not constructed to transport such high amounts of energy at once, the result is congestions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2016/Smart_Markets/Agora_Smart-Market-Design_WEB.pdf#page=3|title=Smart-Market-Design in deutschen Verteilnetzen|last=Ecofys und Fraunhofer IWES|first=|date=March 2017|year=|website=|publisher=Agora Energiewende|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''Solving congestions through feed-in management'''

Today, [[System Operators|system operators]] are given only one possible tool to encounter this problem and to secure grid stability: in times of strong wind, certain wind turbines are shut down. This is called Feed-In Management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/direktvermarktung/einspeisemanagement|title=Was sind Einspeisemanagement (Eisman) und Abregelung?|last=|first=|date=|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=de-DE|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But stopping wind turbines when their energy output is at its highest, comes at very high cost: both ecologically and economically:

Ecologically, because for every curtailed kWh of wind energy, another power plant must be activated to offset the now missing volumes, since they have already been traded in the market. Because the supplementing power plant must be ramped up rather quickly and precise, the first and only choice are [[:en:Combined_cycle|combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs]]). This practice of balancing energy generation by activating certain power plants on the one hand, and shutting down certain generation capacities on the other is called [[:de:Redispatch_(Stromnetz)|Redispatch]].  

Feed-in management comes at very high economic costs for two reasons: first, the redispatched CCGT must be remunerated. Second, the wind turbine operator or owner must also be remunerated (by [[:en:German_Renewable_Energy_Sources_Act|EEG-law]]) for every kWh he would otherwise have produced. These costs are not paid directly by the system operator. The system operator is entitled to pass on the costs to the end consumer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Anreizregulierungsverordnung (ARegV), §4 Abs. 3 Satz 3|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that at the end, society pays. Annual costs for feed-in management in Germany were €373m in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Allgemeines/Bundesnetzagentur/Publikationen/Berichte/2017/Monitoringbericht_2017.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3#page=8|title=Monitoringbericht 2017|last=Bundesnetzagentur|first=|date=13 December 2017|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, €550m in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.50hertz.com/de/EEG/Veroeffentlichung-EEG-Daten|title=Veröffentlichungen von EEG-Daten|last=50Hertz|first=|date=|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tennettso.de/site/Transparenz/veroeffentlichungen/berichte-service/einspeisemanagement-nach-par-11|title=Einspeisemanagement-Einsätze nach §14 EEG|last=TenneT TSO GmbH|first=|date=2018|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=10 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and are likely to increase up to €5bn until 2025. 

'''New solution: Local Flexibility Markets''' 
[[File:Congestion solved with Local Market.jpg|thumb|527x527px|Congestion solved with Local Market]]
Local Flexibility Markets provide system operators with a new possibility instead of feed-in management. This new kind of market makes it possible to use local flexibility potential (provided by distributed energy resources (short DER) which can adapt their electricity demand or production, e.g. storage providers, electric vehicles, demand response and sector coupling facilities), meaning an increase/decrease in consumption/production at specific points in the grid. This means that higher electricity volumes can be used (or less volumes produced) locally, hence the amount of energy that needs to be transported over long distances via the grid is reduced. Regional trading of electricity enables the system operator to optimize local electricity flows in the grid. The condition for this is an examination of each DER, where the market operator assesses the physical impact of the DER on the grid, based on the location and the provided flexibility capacity (for example, the impact on the grid of a factory located directly next to a wind park is higher compared to a similar factory with a distance of several kilometers to the park). Regional pricing of electricity creates a financial incentive for flexibility providers to adapt their electricity demand or consumption to the current situation in the grid, which alleviates congestions in a market based manner.

== Technical Description and Principles ==
In recent years, a variety of concepts regarding the roles and actors in local markets were developed. This article highlights the following concept, which refers to a flexibility market used by Transmission and Distribution System Operators ([[:en:Transmission_system_operator|TSOs]] and [[:de:Verteilnetzbetreiber|DSOs]]) mainly for the purpose of alleviating grid congestions in a market based manner. It was developed within the EU H2020 project Smartnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smartnet-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20171109-EDSO-policy-workshop-SmartNet-coordination-schemes.pdf|title=Smartnet Project Presentation, EDSO workshop on flexibility, Brussels, November 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated by an independent and neutral third party.
=== Key roles in this model ===

*'''[[System Operator]]:''' (Transmission and Distribution System Operators) act as single buyer of energy volumes and are therefore counterpart in every trade. The execution of every trade therefore remains subject to the System Operator. The System Operator is also responsible for the financial remuneration of the flexibility providers.

*'''Market Operator''': a neutral third party that operates the market, including pre-defined profile exchange (meaning the examination of the physical impact of a DER), operation of order books, and potentially clearing activities.

*'''Flexible resource owner''': offers its flexibility to the system operator. Either downward flexibility (decrease of generation) or upward flexibility (increase of consumption) can be offered. Potential flexibility providers are: storage system owners, electric vehicles, traditional [[Power plant operator|power plant operators]] (downward flexibility), owners of demand response capacities (e.g. factories), owners of sector coupling facilities. An often used term for resources that can participate in a local market is  “DER”, referring to [[Distributed Energy Resource]] it simply means every resource that consumes or produces energy.

*'''Aggregator''': aggregates several smaller flexibility providers (that are too small to make viable bids) in one portfolio which participates in the market as one player. E.g. electric vehicles would not participate directly, but via an aggregator in the local market.

== Classification of Different Market Design Approaches ==
Over the past years, different approaches towards the design of local markets occurred. Their main objective (trade energy locally) is always common, yet there are many different secondary objectives and ways of filling the roles. The following table classifies these different approaches by distinguishing criteria.

== Benefits ==

=== For the system operator ===
The benefit of a Local Flexibility Market from a system operators point of view is mainly financial. As stated above, the system operator does not come up for the feed-in management costs as he passes them over to the consumers. This situation is secured by actual German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Anreizregulierungsverordnung ARegV, §4 Abs. 3 Satz 3|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the next five years, European law is going to change this situation by passing the so called “[[:en:European_Union_climate_and_energy_package|Clean Energy for all Europeans]]” Package, a central bill of law (see "Regulatory Framework)). In the modified, new regulatory framework, system operators will be incentivized to use flexibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52016PC0861|title=Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on common rules for the internal market in electricity|last=Council of the European Union|first=|date=2018|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shall avoid measures like feed-in management. Hence, using a Local Flexibility Market to solve congestions will be financially fortunate for a System Operator.

=== For the flexibility provider ===
Within current European electricity markets, very limited options to market flexibility are given to flexibility providers. Furthermore, these options (e.g. the German balancing market “Regelenergiemarkt”) only reward the adoption of consumption/generation in time (for example ramping up a power plant during peak demand times), regardless of geographic location of the provider. Hence, there is no existing possibility for flexibility providers to financially profit from their location, even though the location could often be very advantageous regarding local congestions (for example: if a large factory with flexible energy demand is located near a [[:en:Wind_farm|wind farm]], it potentially has a positive impact on the grid situation). By enabling flexibility providers to trade flexibility locally, Local Flexibility Markets enable them to participate in alleviating grid congestions and avoid expensive grid extension measures. For adapting their demand or production, they can be remunerated by the system operator in to ways: first, with either a surplus for selling or a discount&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enko.energy/images/Pr%C3%A4sentation_ENKO_April2018.pdf|title=Das Konzept zur verbesserten Integration von Grünstrom ins Netz|last=ARGE Netz GmbH &amp; Co. KG und Schleswig-Holstein Netz AG|first=|date=April 2018|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when buying more energy, second by getting a higher price for their electricity compared to the spot market price.

=== Macro-economic benefits ===
As stated above, the annual societal costs for feed-in management measures are likely to increase up to €5bn until 2025. These costs could partly be mitigated by local markets. But Local markets also bring another advantage: by enabling the use of flexibility, they decrease or at least delay the occurrence of additional costs relating to grid extension. Grid extension amounts for €50bn until 2030&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Dossier/netze-und-netzausbau.html|title=An electricity grid for the energy transition|last=Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|first=|date=|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; only on transmission level (Germany). By mitigating the required grid extension measures, local markets can extensively contribute to decrease the societal costs of the German [[:en:Energy_transition#Germany|Energy Transition]].

Furthermore, local markets support more accurate prices of electricity: within current market structures, the electricity prices in a country (zone) at a given time are even. The geographic location of a customer do not at all affect the price he pays for its electricity and significant price differences in between a price zone are not possible. This fact completely neglects the reality: due to local grid extension and transport of electricity, there are severe price differences within a country (for example, electricity in Northern Germany is way cheaper (theoretically) than in Southern Germany because it does not have to be transported as far). These price differences are not represented by current markets. local markets can determine and adjust prices according to real occurring costs at each node or location in the grid via transparent, market based procedures. This leads to prices that are more accurate than the current ones. More accurate prices maximize the social [[:en:Social_welfare_model|welfare]] and therefore display a macro-economic benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Hindriks, Jean; Myles, Gareth D|Title=Intermediate Public Economics|Edition=2|Publisher=The Mit Press|PublicationPlace=Cambridge|ISBN=978-0262018692|Date=5 April 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks / Challenges ==

=== Regional Circumstances ===
Within Europe and certain other countries, we face a variety of different regional circumstances regarding facts like installed renewable energy capacities, [[:en:Electrical_load|load density]] and flexibility potential, that strongly impact the suitability of local markets. Different regional circumstances require different Local Market Designs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2016/Smart_Markets/Agora_Smart-Market-Design_WEB.pdf#page=3|title=Smart-Market-Design in deutschen Verteilnetzen|last=Ecofys und Fraunhofer IWES|first=|date=March 2017|year=|website=|publisher=Agora Energiewende|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence there is no unified “one-size-fits -all” approach possible. This creates a need for the development and operation of several market designs, resulting in higher costs for the general public.

=== Nodal/Zonal Discussion ===
The advantageousness of the point "macro-economic benefits" remains subject to further discussion: politically, it makes indeed sense to unify the price for electricity within one country in order to avoid economic discrimination of certain regions. Yet, local markets would do exactly this: by pricing electricity according to local conditions, energy costs more in some regions than it does in others. Regional pricing of energy refers to the so called [[:en:Electricity_market#Bid-based,_security-constrained,_economic_dispatch_with_nodal_prices|“nodal pricing model” or “nodal markets”]] (currently reality in the US) and is a step away of the current zonal pricing model. This may be seen as a disadvantage of local markets. Nowadays, developments in the direction of a nodal market can be observed in the EU (see Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/2011/IAEE_TSIKORSKI(v1%200).pdf|title=Nodal Pricing project in Poland|last=Tomasz Sikorski|first=|date=21 June 2011|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Yet, it can be argued that Local Markets are a way to avoid going nodal, as they combine the advantages of both approaches: when used only for the purpose of alleviating congestions, the volumes that are traded in Local Markets are relatively small (compared to the national consumption), hence an effect for end-customers will not occur. Even though, regional price differences are taken into account and may affect more economically viable decisions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epexspot.com/en/press-media/press/details/press/enera_project_EWE_and_EPEX_SPOT_to_create_local_market_platform_to_relieve_grid_congestions|title=enera project: EWE and EPEX SPOT to create local market platform to relieve grid congestions|last=EPEX SPOT SE|first=|date=6 February 2018|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: for example, a storage provider can place its system at the best possible location for providing flexibility, given that he can access the necessary information.

== Regulatory Framework ==
As of now, regulation regarding Local Electricity Markets, or electricity markets in general, is split over a variety of different acts, rather than being centralized. Therefore, to analyze the regulatory framework, different acts must be taken into account. The key role in most Local Flexibility Market concepts plays the system operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2016/Smart_Markets/Agora_Smart-Market-Design_WEB.pdf#page=3|title=Smart-Market-Design in deutschen Verteilnetzen|last=Ecofys und Fraunhofer IWES|first=|date=March 2017|year=|website=|publisher=Agora Energiewende|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the following outlook into the regulatory framework strongly refers to a system operator point of view, as all important regulations derive from rules for system operators. The system operator of an electricity grid is always a monopolist, as there is only one electricity grid in each area. Hence, to ensure proper business activities, system operators are amongst the most strictly regulated companies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energie-lexikon.info/verteilungsnetzbetreiber.html|title=Verteilungsnetzbetreiber|last=RP-Energie-Lexikon|first=|date=|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=German|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also means that new business activities (like trading in Local Markets would be one), remain subject to legislative changes. As changes in regulation always take their time, system operators are not incentivized currently to use Local Flexibility Markets as a measure for congestion management by now. Current regulation therefore hampers the use of flexibility, as stated in the graphic below:

=== EU Level ===
Entering into force 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/clean-energy-all-europeans|title=Clean Energy for All Europeans|last=European Commission|first=|date=|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[:en:European_Union_climate_and_energy_package|Clean Energy Package 4]] (CEP 4)is the most important legislative act regarding the future role of system operators and the whole energy market, as it includes nearly all regulations regarding the EU energy sector. Among many other objectives, CEP pushes certainly in the direction of flexibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52016PC0861|title=Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the internal market for electricity|last=Council of the European Union|first=|date=30 November 2016|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt; use rather than traditional curtailment measures. Due to its high-level nature, it only points out and administrate the general direction of this development, rather than formulating specific detailed regulations. Specific law amendments are later on subject to federal administration. CEP 4 reflects the current developments in the system operators business very well and fosters these even further, especially regarding the employment of smart technology, digitalization, active grids and flexibility.

The main impacts of CEP 4 on system operator and market side are:

* System operators shall procure ancillary services such as balancing and flexibility through transparent market based procedures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52016PC0861|title=Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the internal market for electricity|last=Council of the European Union|first=|date=30 November 2016|year=|website=|publisher=|pages=|language=|format=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=13 June 2018|quote=|periodical=|month=|day=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distribution system operators shall now be responsible for congestion management and balancing in their respective grid area (formerly, this was subject to the TSO)
* DSO-TSO cooperation shall be fostered, in particular regarding to shared flexibility resources and associated data management
* System Operators shall not limit effective participation of market participants connected to their grid to the retail, wholesale and balancing markets (grid must be appropriately reinforced), market procedures must be transparent

=== Germany ===
On a national level, [[System Operators|system operators]] in Germany face a variety of different law acts regulating their business activities. The selection below lists the most important ones including the key points of each:

==== Energy Industry Law („[[:de:Energiewirtschaftsgesetz|Energiewirtschaftsgesetz]]“) ====

* Contains main regulations for energy utility companies, for example it
* Regulates mandatory ancillary services to be carried out by SOs
* Defines mandatory tasks and obligations of SOs
* Regulates unbundling

[[File:Current German Regulatory Framework.jpg|thumb|457x457px|Current German Regulatory Framework]]

==== Incentive Regulation Act („[[:de:Anreizregulierung|Anreizregulierungsverordnung]]“) ====

* Regulates revenue caps, network charges, innovation incentives
* Innovation incentive: 50% of costs for federal [[R&amp;D]] projects are compensated
* Enables appropriate innovation: 10 of 10 interviewed DSOs could finance the necessary measures of the integration of RES in the latest legislative period (including traditional grid expenses as well as smart technology investments)
* '''Criticism''': smart-technology investments usually have high share of [[Operating expense|OPEX]], which is less remunerated in [[:de:Anreizregulierung|ARegV]], hence leads to lower incentives for invest in smart technology

==== Electricity Market Law („[[Strommarktgesetz]]“) ====

* Increase of flexibility via load management measures

* Implementation of RES in balancing energy market

* Faster development of charging infrastructure for EV

* Implementation of reserves outside the market

=== Conclusion ===
The conclusion of the complex regulatory environment is the following: currently, System Operators are not incentivized to use Local Markets as a mean of congestion management (this regulatory analysis focused on Germany, but results would be similar in other European countries). Therefore, changes in regulation are required to support this development. Entering into force by 2020, the european Clean Energy Package will bring these required changes to EU countries by obliging its members to adopt regulation in a way that incentivizes flexibility use and penalizes curtailment measures. It will take several more years, but the regulatory framework for flexibility markets is on its way.

=== Current (Research) Projects ===

==== European Level ====

The '''Plasma Science and Fusion Center''' (PSFC) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) is known internationally as a leading university research center for the study of [[Plasma_(physics)|plasma]] and [[Nuclear_fusion|fusion]] science and technology.

The PSFC is an interdisciplinary research center, approaching the study of fusion by including the majority of the engineering and science disciplines found at MIT: [[physics]], [[Nuclear_engineering|nuclear science and engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[astrophysics]], [[materials science]], and more. The PSFC's mission is to identify and understand how cutting-edge advances in science and technology can provide fusion energy “smaller and sooner”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psfc.mit.edu/news/2015/smaller-faster-experimentation-seen-at-psfc-under-whyte&lt;/ref&gt; The PSFC hosts a wide variety of relatively small experimental facilities at the Albany Street corridor on the campus of MIT, including plasma devices, powerful superconductor magnets and high-energy accelerators. In parallel, novel measurements are developed for the challenging fusion environment, which are then compared to leading-edge theory and simulation. This research mission is integrated with training and mentoring a new generation of multidisciplinary fusion scientists and engineers.
 
The PSFC is one of the largest producers of plasma physics PhDs in the world. However, the Center is not a degree granting body and instead draws students from MIT academic departments. Since plasma physics and fusion are by nature interdisciplinary subjects, students who perform research at the PSFC satisfy their educational goals by residing at any of several departments associated with the PSFC. Each department has its own admission procedure, requirements, and offers a number of plasma-related courses, many of which are taught at the PSFC by PSFC-affiliated professors.

== History ==

Originally founded in 1976 as the '''Plasma Fusion Center''' (PFC), the Center consolidated research carried out in MIT's academic departments, the [[Francis Bitter]] Magnet Laboratory (FBML), and the [[Research_Laboratory_of_Electronics_at_MIT|Research Lab for Electronics]] (RLE). Since its founding, the PSFC has provided a home for work on a wide range of related topics covering fusion energy, plasma physics, plasma applications and magnet technology. In 2014, the magnet lab, which specializes in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, formally became part of the PSFC.

The synergy between ongoing research in plasma physics and the magnet technology developed at the FBML led to construction of the Alcator experiment in the early 1970s – the highest field magnetic confinement device in the world at that time. Success in that program and a growing national program in Fusion Energy provided the initial impetus for the Center’s formation. Founded at the request and with the collaboration of the U.S. Department of Energy, the original grant was for construction and operation of a tokamak reactor Alcator A, the first in a series of small, high-field tokamaks, followed by Alcator C (1978) and [[Alcator C-Mod]] (1993). 

MIT's most recent tokamak, Alcator C-Mod, ran from 1993 to 2016. In 2016 the project pressure reached 2.05 atmospheres – a 15 percent jump over the previous record of 1.77 atmospheres with a plasma temperature of 35 million degrees C, sustaining fusion for 2 seconds, yielding 600 trillion fusion reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zmescience.com/ecology/renewable-energy-ecology/fusion-energy-record-pressure-16102016|title=New record gets us closer to fusion energy|last=ANDREI|first=MIHAI|date=2016-10-17|work=|newspaper=ZME Science|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The run involved a 5.7 tesla magnetic field. It reached this milestone on its final day of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/nuclear-fusion-record/45932|title=Under pressure: New world record set on path to nuclear fusion|last=Franco|first=Michael|date=October 14, 2016|website=newatlas.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Research Universal''' (NRU) '''reactor''' was a 135 MW [[nuclear research reactor]] built in the [[Chalk River Laboratories]], [[Ontario]], one of [[Canada]]’s national science facilities. It was a multipurpose science facility that served three main roles. It generated [[nuclear medicine|isotopes]] used to treat or diagnose over 20 million people in 80 countries every year (and, to a lesser extent, other isotopes used for non-medical purposes). It was the neutron source for the [[National Research Council of Canada|NRC]] [[Canadian Neutron Beam Centre]]: a materials research centre that grew from the Nobel Prize-winning work of [[Bertram Brockhouse]]. It was the test bed for [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] to develop fuels and materials for the [[CANDU reactor]]. At the time of its retirement on March 31, 2018, it was the world's oldest operating nuclear reactor.

==History==
The NRU reactor design was started in 1949. It is fundamentally a Canadian design{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, significantly advanced from [[NRX]]. It was built as the successor to the [[NRX]] reactor at the Atomic Energy Project of the [[National Research Council of Canada]] at [[Chalk River Laboratories]]. The [[NRX]] reactor was the world's most intense source of [[neutron]]s when it started operation in 1947.&lt;ref name="eggleston"&gt;W. Eggleston, Canada's Nuclear Story, Pub. [[Clarke, Irwin &amp; Company]], 1965&lt;/ref&gt; It was not known how long a [[research reactor]] could be expected to operate, so the management of Chalk River Laboratories began planning the NRU reactor to ensure continuity of the research programs.&lt;ref name="eggleston" /&gt;

NRU started self-sustained operation (or went "critical") on November 3, 1957, a decade after the [[NRX]], and was ten times more powerful. It was initially designed as a 200 MW reactor, fueled with [[natural uranium]]. NRU was converted to 60 MW with highly-[[enriched uranium]] (HEU) fuel in 1964 and converted a third time in 1991 to 135 MW running on low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.

On Saturday, 24 May 1958 the NRU suffered a major accident.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8lIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JasFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=751%2C4882357 "Ottawa (AP) An atomic test reactor..." The Owosso Argus-Press newspaper. May 27, 1958.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1734799373/ An accident at NRU - Candu: The Canadian Nuclear Reactor - Science and Technology - CBC Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A damaged uranium [[fuel rod]] caught fire and was torn in two as it was being removed from the core. The fire was extinguished, but a sizeable quantity of [[radioactive]] combustion products had contaminated the interior of the reactor building and, to a lesser degree, an area of the surrounding laboratory site. The clean-up and repair took three months. NRU was operating again in August 1958. Care was taken to ensure no one was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation and staff involved in clean-up were monitored over the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, D.K., Morrison, D.P. and Werner, M.M., "Follow-up of AECL employees involved in the decontamination of NRU in 1958", AECL Report, AECL-7901, 1982 September 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A Corporal named '''Bjarnie Hannibal Paulson''' who was at the clean up developed unusual skin cancers and received a disability pension.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MSAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t6UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1073%2C2139723  "Battle For Pension Ending" by Peggy Curran, the Montreal Gazette , April 16 , 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KYY0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y6gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4139%2C4638446  "Nuclear Mishap Seen First Hand" by Michael Farber, the Montreal Gazette , April 29 , 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;

NRU's calandria, the vessel which contains its nuclear reactions, is made of [[aluminum]], and was replaced in 1971 because of corrosion. The calandria has not been replaced since, although a second replacement is likely needed. An advantage of NRU's design is that it can be taken apart to allow for upgrade and repair.

In October 1986, the NRU reactor was recognized as a nuclear historic landmark by the [[American Nuclear Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ans.org/honors/recipients/va-nuclandmark ANS : Honors and Awards : Recipients : Nuclear Historic Landmark Award&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since NRX was decommissioned in 1992, after 45 years of service, there has been no backup for NRU.

In 1994, Bertram Brockhouse was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], for his pioneering work carried out in the NRX and NRU reactors in the 1950s. He gave birth to a scientific technique which is now used around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/brock_e.html Brockhouse and the Nobel Prize - Canadian Neutron Beam Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217043548/http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/brock_e.html |date=2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[AECL]] informed the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (then known as the [[Atomic Energy Control Board]]) that operation of the NRU reactor would not continue beyond December 31, 2005. It was expected that a replacement facility would be built inside that time. However, no replacement was built and in 2003, AECL advised the CNSC that they intended to continue operation of the NRU reactor beyond December 2005. The operating licence was initially extended to July 31, 2006, and a 63-month licence renewal was obtained in July 2006, allowing operation of the NRU until October 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aecl.ca/NewsRoom/News/Press-2006/060731.htm "CNSC Approves Renewal of AECL's Chalk River Site Operating Licence"] AECL, July 31, 2006.

In May 2007, the NRU set a new record for the production of medical isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aecl.ca/NewsRoom/Bulletins/E-0706/E05.htm Email Bulletin - 2007 June - Nearing 50, National Research Universal Still Setting Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, a new [[neutron scattering]] instrument was opened in NRU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/news/reflectom_e.html Canada's first Neutron Reflectometer Officially Open - Canadian Neutron Beam Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The D3 Neutron Reflectometer is designed for examining surfaces, thin films and interfaces. The technique of [[Neutron Reflectometry]] is capable of providing unique information on materials in the nanometre length scale.

===2007 shutdown===

On November 18, 2007, the NRU reactor was shut down for routine maintenance.  This shutdown was voluntarily extended when AECL decided to install seismically-qualified emergency power systems (EPS) to two of the reactor's cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), as required as part of its August 2006 operating license extension by the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC). This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because AECL had not pre-arranged for an alternate supply.  On December 11, 2007, the [[House of Commons of Canada]], acting on what the government described as "independent expert" advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor with one of the two seismic connections complete (one pump being sufficient to cool the core), and authorizing the reactor's operation for 120 days without CNSC approval.  The legislation, C-38, was passed by the Senate and received Royal Assent on December 12. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] accused the "Liberal-appointed" CNSC for this shutdown which "jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians".  Others viewed the actions and priorities of the Prime Minister and government in terms of protecting the eventual sale of AECL to private investors.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/] theglobeandmail.com pay-site"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"David Ljunggren, [https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 Canadian parliament orders isotope reactor restart] Reuters.com"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Calamai, [https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 Future of AECL, Candu may figure in push to reopen Chalk River] thestar.com"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html Chalk River plant to begin making radioisotopes in a week] CBC.ca"&lt;/ref&gt;  The government later announced plans to sell part of AECL in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/05/28/aecl-future-sale.html Canada eyes sale of stake in AECL reactor business] CBC.ca, retrieved May 31, 2009"&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

On January 29, 2008, the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission#Political storm over dismissal of CNSC chair|former President]] of the CNSC, Linda Keen, testified before a Parliamentary Committee that the risk of fuel failure in the NRU reactor was "1 in 1000 years", and claimed this to be a thousand times greater risk than the "international standard".  These claims were refuted by AECL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aecl.ca/NewsRoom/News/Press-2008/080129.htm 2008 News Releases - AECL Clarifies Inaccurate Statements by Former CNSC CEO Linda Keen]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2008 the second seismic connection was complete.  This timing was well within the above 120-day window afforded by Bill C-38.

===2009 Shutdown===

In mid-May 2009 a heavy water leak at the base of the reactor vessel was detected, prompting a temporary shutdown of the reactor.  The leak was estimated to be 5&amp;nbsp;kg (&lt;5 litres) per hour, a result of corrosion. This was the second heavy water leak since late 2008. The reactor was defuelled and drained of all of its heavy water moderator. No administrative levels of radioactivity were exceeded, during the leak or defuelling, and all leaked water was contained and treated on site.

The reactor remained shut down until [http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html August 2010]. The lengthy shutdown was necessary to defuel the reactor, ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairs&amp;nbsp;— all with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of 8 metres due to the residual radioactive fields in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage.

===Decommissioning===
On March 31, 2018, following government direction to shut down operations, NRU was decommissioned.

==Production of isotopes==

|-
| [[Atom]]s are the building blocks of nature. The [[periodic table]] of the elements lists as many as 118 different types of [[atom]], called ''elements'', such as [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]] or [[carbon]]. Atoms of any element can occur in more than one weight, depending on the number of [[neutron]]s they contain. Two atoms of [[carbon]] for instance may weigh 12 and 13 [[Atomic mass unit|a.m.u.]]. They are both carbon atoms, but one has an extra neutron. They are referred to as ''[[isotope]]s'' of carbon.

Not all [[isotope]]s are stable. An unstable isotope will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] to a more stable state, releasing energy and possibly one or more particles. These particles and/or the energy emitted by said ''[[radionuclides|radioisotopes]]'' is used in a great variety of medical, industrial and scientific applications.
|}

With the construction of the earlier [[NRX]] reactor, it was possible for the first time to commercially manufacture isotopes that were not commonly found in nature. In the core of an operating reactor there are billions of [[free neutron]]s. By inserting a piece of target material into the core, atoms in the target can capture some of those neutrons and become heavier isotopes. Manufacturing medical isotopes was a Canadian medical innovation in the early 1950s.

The NRU reactor continued the legacy of NRX and until it was decommissioned March 31, 2018 produced more medical isotopes than any facility in the world.
*[[Cobalt-60]] from NRU is used in [[Radiation therapy]] machines that treat cancer in 15 million patients in 80 countries each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cna.ca/english/Nuclear_Facts/CNA_Best_Kept_Secret_August04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The NRU produced about 75% of the global supply.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mds.nordion.com/about/about.htm MDS Nordion - We Make a Difference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The decay of Cobalt-60 results in the emission of high energy photons.
*[[Technetium-99m]] from NRU used in the diagnosis of 5 million patients each year&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cna.ca/seminar2007/docs/DrCoulombespeech.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; represented about 80 per cent of all nuclear medicine procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mds.nordion.com/products/medical-isotopes-molybdenum-99.htm MDS Nordion - Medical Isotopes - Molybdenum-99&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NRU produced over half of the world's total supply.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Technetium-99m emits less energy as it decays than most gamma emitters, roughly as much as the X-rays from an X-ray tube.  This can act as an ''in situ'' source for a special camera that creates an image of the patient called a [[SPECT scan]].  NRU actually produced the more stable parent isotope, [[molybdenum-99]], which is shipped to medical labs.  There it decays into [[technetium-99m]], which is separated and used for testing.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Technetium-99m generator|Technetium cow]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;
*NRU produced xenon-133, iodine-131 and iodine-125, which are used in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
*[[Carbon-14]] produced in NRU was sold to chemistry, bioscience and environmental labs where it is used as a [[Carbon label|tracer]].
* Iridium-192 from NRU is used in several industries to [[Industrial radiography#Inspection of welds|inspect welds]] or other metal components to ensure they are safe for use.

The core of the NRU reactor was about 3 m wide and 3 m high, which is unusually large for a research reactor. That large volume enabled the bulk production of isotopes. Other research reactors in the world produce isotopes for medical and industrial uses, for example the European [[Petten nuclear reactor|High Flux Reactor]] at Petten in the Netherlands, [[Maria Reactor]] in Poland, and the [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor|OPAL]] reactor in Australia which began operation in April 2007.

NRU was originally scheduled to shut down in October 2016.  With no stable isotope manufacturer ready to step in until 2018, the Canadian Government allowed the NRU to produce Isotopes until March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Reprieve-for-Canadian-isotope-reactor-0902158.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutron beam research==
The NRU reactor is home to Canada's national facility for [[neutron scattering]]: the [[National Research Council of Canada|NRC]] [[Canadian Neutron Beam Centre]]. Neutron scattering is a technique where a beam of neutrons shines through a sample of material, and depending on how the neutrons scatter from the atoms inside, scientists can determine many details about the crystal structure and movements of the atoms within the sample.

An early pioneer of the technique was Bertram Brockhouse who built some of the early neutron spectrometers in the NRX and NRU reactors and was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in physics for the development of [[Neutron triple-axis spectrometry|neutron spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1994/ Physics 1994&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRC Canadian Neutron Beam Centre continues that field of science today, operating as an open-access user facility allowing scientists from across Canada and around the world to use neutrons in their research programs.

It is common for a developed country to support a national facility for neutron scattering and one for [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray scattering]]. The two types of facility provide complementary information about materials.

An unusual feature of the NRU reactor as Canada's national neutron source is its multipurpose design: able to manufacture isotopes, and support nuclear R&amp;D at the same time as it supplies neutrons to the suite of neutron scattering instruments.

The NRU reactor is sometimes (incorrectly) characterized as simply a ''nuclear'' research facility. Neutron scattering however is not [[Nuclear physics|nuclear research]], it is ''materials research''. Neutrons are an ideal probe of materials including metals, alloys, biomaterials, ceramics, magnetic materials, minerals, polymers, composites, glasses, nano-materials and many others. The neutron scattering instruments at the [[National Research Council of Canada|NRC]] [[Canadian Neutron Beam Centre]] are used by universities and industries from across Canada every year because knowledge of materials is important for innovation in many sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/home_e.html Welcome to the Canadian Neutron Beam Centre - Canadian Neutron Beam Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear power research and development==
{| cellpadding="10" border="1" style="width:400px; float:right; background:#eee;"
| Inside the core of a large electricity-producing reactor like a [[CANDU]] or a [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]], there are a great many [[free neutron]]s and high levels of [[gamma radiation]] from the [[nuclear fission]] process. It is important for engineers and scientists to understand how that environment will affect the materials that the reactor is made from. That knowledge is needed to design a reactor with a long service-life.
|}
The NRU reactor has test facilities built into its core that can replicate conditions inside a large electricity-producing reactor. NRU itself does not generate steam (or electricity); its cooling water heats up to approximately 55 degrees Celsius. Inside the test facilities though, high temperatures and pressures can be produced. It is essential to test out different materials before they are used in the construction of a nuclear generating station.

The fundamental knowledge gained from NRU enabled the development of the [[CANDU reactor]], and is the foundation for the [[Nuclear power in Canada|Canadian nuclear industry]].

A '''remote racking system''' is a system that allows an operator to operate a racking system from a remote location. It offers a safe alternative to manually racking [[circuit breaker]]s, which reduces the requirement for service personnel to wear a full-body [[arc flash]] hazard suit for protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inolect.com/Remote_Racking.html Remote racking]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsarcsafe.com/ Remote Racking Systems For Circuit Breakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages== 

A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit.

An arc flash is a type of electrical explosion that results from a low impedance connection to ground or another voltage phase in an electrical system. By permitting the automatic racking of the circuit breaker from a remote location, the remote racking systems move service personnel outside the [[arc flash]] protection boundary, thus reducing the need for a full-body arc flash hazard suit. 

A remote switch operator is used to remotely operate various types and styles of circuit breakers and controls. When the remote racking system is used in conjunction with a remote switch operator, the user can also operate, trip, and release the circuit breaker from a safe distance.

==Designs==

There are several designs of remote racking systems on the market and most include either a wired or wireless remote control.  The distance at which these can be used varies by which product is chosen.  Also the style and size will also be a factor in choosing a remote racking system as some are larger than others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaton.com/Electrical/USA/MarketSolutions/Safety/RemoteRackingandControl/ Remote racking and control]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Service drop.jpg|A [[three phase]] 220Y400 volt service drop in China. |thumb]]

In [[electric power distribution]], a '''service drop''' is an overhead electrical line running from a [[utility pole]],  to a customer's building or other premises.  It is the point where [[electric utility|electric utilities]] provide power to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;Carson Dunlop "Electrical Systems" Dearborn Real Estate, 2003 {{ISBN|0-7931-7932-7}} page 24&lt;/ref&gt; The customer connection to an underground distribution system is usually called a "service lateral". Conductors of a service drop or lateral are usually owned and maintained by the utility company, but some industrial drops are installed and owned by the customer. 

At the customer's premises, the wires usually enter the building through a [[weatherhead]] that protects against entry of rain and snow, and drop down through [[Electrical conduit|conduit]] to an [[electric meter]] which measures and records the power used for billing purposes, then enters the main [[Electrical service panel|service panel]].  The utility's portion of the system ends, and the customer's wiring begins, at the output socket of the electric meter.   The service panel will contain a "main" [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]], which controls all of the electric current entering the building at once, and a number of smaller fuses/breakers, which protect individual branch circuits.  There is always provision for all power to be cut off by operating either a single switch or small number of switches (maximum of six in the United States, for example); when circuit breakers are used this is provided by the main circuit breaker.

[[File:Residence service drop.JPG|thumb|A 240/120 V split-phase service drop providing power to a residence in USA.

In North America , the 120/240 V [[split phase]] system is used for residential service drops.&lt;ref name="Vadari"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A pole-mounted [[distribution transformer]] usually provides power for one or two residences. The service drop is made up of two 120 V lines and a [[Ground and neutral|neutral line]]. When these lines are insulated and twisted together, they are referred to as a triplex cable which may contain a supporting [[Overhead_line#Construction|messenger cable]] in the middle of the neutral conductor to provide strength for long spans. The neutral line from the pole is connected to a [[ground (electrical)|ground]] near the service panel; often a conductive rod driven into the earth. The service drop provides the building with two 120 V lines of opposite [[phase (waves)|phase]], so 240 V can be obtained by connecting a load between the two 120 V conductors, while 120 V loads are connected between either of the two 120 V lines and the neutral line. 240 V circuits are used for high-demand devices, such as [[air conditioners]], [[clothes dryer]]s, [[oven]]s and [[boiler]]s, while 120 V circuits are used for lighter loads such as lighting and ordinary small appliance outlets.

===European===
In many European countries and other countries that use European systems, [[three-phase]] service drops are often used for domestic residences. The use of three-phase power allows longer service drops to serve multiple residences, which is economical with the higher density of housing in Europe. The service drop consists of three phase wires and a neutral wire which is grounded.  Each phase wire provides around 230 V to loads connected between it and the neutral. Each of the phase wires carries 50 Hz alternating current which is 120° out of phase with the other two.  Several slightly different voltage standards have been used in the past as well:  220Y380, 230Y400 and 240Y415, with plans for future "harmonization" towards 230Y400. In this notation, the first number is the voltage between a phase wire and neutral, and the second number, after the "Y", is the line voltage (between any two-phase wires).

Other countries, such as the UK and Republic of Ireland, generally provide a single phase and neutral per house, with every third house on the same phase. In this case the available current is higher. Single-phase supplies with a supplier's fuse of up to 100 A are common, while the 3-phase domestic supplies are generally of lower current rating (often less than 50 A) per phase.

==Commercial and industrial==
Commercial and industrial service drops can be much bigger, and are usually [[Three-phase electric power|three phase]].  In the USA, common services are 120Y/208 (three 120 V circuits 120 degrees out of phase, with 208V line-to-line), 240 V three-phase, and 480 V three-phase. 600 V three-phase is common in Canada, and 380-415 V or 690 V three-phase is found in many other countries. Generally, higher voltages are used for heavy industrial loads, and lower voltages for commercial applications.

In North America where single-phase distribution transformers for service drops are the norm, three-phase service drops are often constructed using three single-phase transformers, wired in a Y configuration. This is called a ''transformer bank''.

==Underground==
Service conductors for a customer may be run underground, from a [[padmount transformer]] to a customer's meter.

'''Solar thermal energy''' ('''STE''') is a form of energy and a [[technology]] for harnessing [[solar energy]] to generate [[thermal energy]] or [[electrical energy]] for use in [[industry]], and in the residential and commercial sectors.

==Overview==
[[Solar thermal collector]]s are classified by the United States [[Energy Information Administration]] as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed and used to heat [[swimming pool]]s or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using [[mirror]]s or [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities are located in the American [[Mojave Desert]] of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] (377&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] installation (354&amp;nbsp;MW), and [[Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project|Crescent Dunes]] (110&amp;nbsp;MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), the [[Andasol solar power station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), and [[Extresol Solar Power Station]] (100&amp;nbsp;MW).

==History==
[[Augustin Mouchot]] demonstrated a solar collector with a cooling engine making ice cream at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Universal Exhibition in Paris]]. The first installation of solar thermal energy equipment occurred in the [[Sahara]] approximately in 1910 by [[Frank Shuman]]  when a steam engine was run on steam produced by sunlight. Because liquid fuel engines were developed and found more convenient, the Sahara project was abandoned, only to be revisited several decades later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/07/02/104680095.pdf American Inventor Uses Egypt's Sun for Power; Appliance Concentrates the Heat Rays and Produces Steam, Which Can Be Used to Drive Irrigation Pumps in Hot Climates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-temperature solar heating and cooling systems==
{{Main article|HVAC|Solar air heat|Passive solar building design|Thermal mass|Trombe wall|Solar chimney|Solar air conditioning|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
[[Image:Flipped MIT Solar One house.png|thumb|MIT's Solar House #1 built in 1939 used [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) for year-round heating.]]
Systems for utilizing low-temperature solar thermal energy include means for heat collection; usually heat storage, either short-term or interseasonal; and distribution within a structure or a district heating network. In some cases more than one of these functions is inherent to a single feature of the system (e.g. some kinds of solar collectors also store heat). Some systems are passive, others are active (requiring other external energy to function).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Brian|title=Harnessing Solar Heat|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heating is the most obvious application, but [[solar air conditioning|solar cooling]] can be achieved for a building or district cooling network by using a heat-driven [[Absorption heat pump|absorption]] or adsorption chiller (heat pump). There is a productive coincidence that the greater the driving heat from insolation, the greater the cooling output. In 1878, [[Auguste Mouchout]] pioneered solar cooling by making ice using a solar steam engine attached to a refrigeration device.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[heating]], [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and [[air conditioning]] ([[HVAC]]) systems account for over 25% (4.75 EJ) of the energy used in commercial buildings (50% in northern cities)  and nearly half (10.1 EJ) of the energy used in residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar heating, cooling, and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy. The most popular solar heating technology for heating buildings is the building integrated [[solar air heat|transpired solar air collection system]] which connects to the building's HVAC equipment. According to Solar Energy Industries Association over 500,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (5,000,000 square feet) of these panels are in operation in North America as of 2015.

In Europe, since the mid-1990s about 125 large solar-thermal district heating
plants have been constructed, each with over 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (5400&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of solar
collectors. The largest are about 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with capacities of 7
MW-thermal and solar heat costs around 4 Eurocents/kWh without subsidies.&lt;ref

===Low-temperature collectors===
{{Main article|Solar thermal collector}}

Glazed solar collectors are designed primarily for space heating. They recirculate building air through a solar air panel where the air is heated and then directed back into the building. These solar space heating systems require at least two penetrations into the building and only perform when the air in the solar collector is warmer than the building room temperature. Most glazed collectors are used in the residential sector.

[[Image:Transpired Air Collector.PNG|thumb|Unglazed, "transpired" air collector]]
Unglazed solar collectors are primarily used to pre-heat make-up ventilation air in commercial, industrial and institutional buildings with a high ventilation load. They turn building walls or sections of walls into low cost, high performance, unglazed solar collectors. Also called, "transpired solar panels" or "[[Solarwall|solar wall]]", they employ a painted perforated metal solar heat absorber that also serves as the exterior wall surface of the building. Heat transfer to the air takes place on the surface of the absorber, through the metal absorber and behind the absorber. The boundary layer of solar heated air is drawn into a nearby perforation before the heat can escape by convection to the outside air. The heated air is then drawn from behind the absorber plate into the building's ventilation system.

A [[Trombe wall]] is a passive solar heating and ventilation [[closed system|system]] consisting of an air channel sandwiched between a window and a sun-facing thermal mass. During the ventilation cycle, sunlight stores heat in the thermal mass and warms the air channel causing [[natural circulation|circulation]] through vents at the top and bottom of the wall. During the heating cycle the Trombe wall radiates stored heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Solar roof ponds are unique solar heating and cooling systems developed by Harold Hay in the 1960s. A basic system consists of a roof-mounted water bladder with a movable insulating cover. This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating is a concern the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight to warm the water bladder and store heat for evening use. When cooling is a concern the covered bladder draws heat from the building's interior during the day and is uncovered at night to radiate heat to the cooler atmosphere. The Skytherm house in Atascadero, California uses a prototype roof pond for heating and cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Solar space heating with [[solar air heat]] collectors is more popular in the USA and Canada than heating with solar liquid collectors since most buildings already have a ventilation system for heating and cooling. The two main types of solar air panels are glazed and unglazed.

Of the {{convert|21000000|sqft|m2}} of solar thermal collectors produced in the United States in 2007, {{convert|16000000|sqft|m2}} were of the low-temperature variety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb1007 EIA Renewable Energy- Shipments of Solar Thermal Collectors by Market Sector, End Use, and Type]&lt;/ref&gt;  Low-temperature collectors are generally installed to heat swimming pools, although they can also be used for space heating.  Collectors can use air or water as the medium to transfer the heat to their destination.

===Heat storage in low-temperature solar thermal systems===
{{Main article|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}

'''Interseasonal storage.''' Solar heat (or heat from other sources) can be effectively stored between opposing seasons in aquifers, underground geological strata, large specially constructed pits, and large tanks that are insulated and covered with earth.

'''Short-term storage.''' Thermal mass materials store solar energy during the day and release this energy during cooler periods. Common thermal mass materials include stone, concrete, and water. The proportion and placement of thermal mass should consider several factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass can passively maintain comfortable temperatures while reducing energy consumption.

===Solar-driven cooling===
{{Main article|Solar air conditioning}}

Worldwide, by 2011 there were about 750 cooling systems with solar-driven heat pumps, and annual market growth was 40 to 70% over the prior seven years. It is a niche market because the economics are challenging, with the annual number of cooling hours a limiting factor. Respectively, the annual cooling hours are roughly 1000 in the Mediterranean, 2500 in Southeast Asia, and only 50 to 200 in Central Europe. However, system construction costs dropped about 50% between 2007 and 2011. The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) Solar Heating and Cooling program (IEA-SHC) task groups working on further development of the technologies involved.&lt;ref&gt;Mugnier, D.; Jakob, U. (2012) [http://archive.iea-shc.org/publications/downloads/Mugnier_ISER_1_2012.pdf Keeping Cool with the Sun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506094233/http://archive.iea-shc.org/publications/downloads/Mugnier_ISER_1_2012.pdf |date=2015-05-06 }}. International Sustainable Energy Review, 6:1{28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar heat-driven ventilation===

A solar chimney (or thermal chimney) is a passive solar ventilation [[Open system (systems theory)|system]] composed of a hollow thermal mass connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an [[updraft]] that pulls air through the building. These systems have been in use since Roman times and remain common in the Middle East.

===Process heat===&lt;!--this is a link target--&gt;
{{Main article|Solar pond|Salt evaporation pond|Solar furnace}}

[[Image:Solar Evaporation Ponds, Atacama Desert.jpg|thumb|Solar Evaporation Ponds in the [[Atacama Desert]].]]

'''Solar process heating''' systems are designed to provide large quantities of [[hot water]] or [[space heating]] for nonresidential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_solar_process.html |title=Solar Process Heat |publisher=Nrel.gov |date=2013-04-08 |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901210847/http://www.nrel.gov/learning/re_solar_process.html |archivedate=2013-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaporation ponds are shallow ponds that concentrate dissolved solids through [[evaporation]]. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Altogether, evaporation ponds represent one of the largest commercial applications of solar energy in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett (1998), p.393-394&lt;/ref&gt;

Unglazed transpired collectors are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. Transpired collectors can also be roof mounted for year-round use and can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22&amp;nbsp;°C and deliver outlet temperatures of 45-60&amp;nbsp;°C. The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12&amp;nbsp;years) make them a more cost-effective alternative to glazed collection systems. As of 2015, over 4000 systems with a combined collector area of 500,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; had been installed worldwide. Representatives include an 860 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; collector in Coimbatore, India used for drying marigolds.&lt;ref&gt;Leon (2006), p.62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Labor for a simple open loop system in southern climates can take 3–5 hours for the installation and 4–6 hours in Northern areas.  Northern system require more collector area and more complex plumbing to protect the collector from freezing. With this incentive, the payback time for a typical household is four to nine years, depending on the state.  Similar subsidies exist in parts of Europe. A crew of one solar plumber and two assistants with minimal training can install a system per day.  Thermosiphon installation have negligible maintenance costs (costs rise if antifreeze and mains power are used for circulation) and in the US reduces a households' operating costs by $6 per person per month. Solar water heating can reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of a family of four by 1 ton/year (if replacing natural gas) or 3 ton/year (if replacing electricity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Durham Campaign for Solar Jobs | last = Kincaid | first = J. |date=May 2006 | accessdate = 2007-12-28 | url = http://www.cleanenergydurham.org/why/solarjobreport.doc |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070715053709/http://www.cleanenergydurham.org/why/solarjobreport.doc &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medium-temperature installations can use any of several designs: common designs are pressurized glycol, drain back, batch systems and newer low pressure freeze tolerant systems using polymer pipes containing water with photovoltaic pumping. European and International standards are being reviewed to accommodate innovations in design and operation of medium temperature collectors. Operational innovations include "permanently wetted collector" operation. This innovation reduces or even eliminates the occurrence of no-flow high temperature stresses called stagnation which would otherwise reduce the life expectancy of collectors.

===Solar drying===
[[Image:Solar Food Dryer.jpg|thumb|Industrial indirect solar fruit and vegetable dryer]]
Solar thermal energy can be useful for drying wood for construction and wood fuels such as wood chips for combustion. Solar is also used for food products such as fruits, grains, and fish. Crop drying by solar means is environmentally friendly as well as cost effective while improving the quality. The less money it takes to make a product, the less it can be sold for, pleasing both the buyers and the sellers. Technologies in solar drying include ultra low cost pumped transpired plate air collectors based on black fabrics. Solar thermal energy is helpful in the process of drying products such as wood chips and other forms of biomass by raising the temperature while allowing air to pass through and get rid of the moisture.&lt;ref name="Solar Thermal Energy"&gt;{{cite web

Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying and [[pasteurization]]. Solar cooking offsets fuel costs, reduces demand for fuel or firewood, and improves air quality by reducing or removing a source of smoke.

The simplest type of solar cooker is the box cooker first built by [[Horace de Saussure]] in 1767. A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. These cookers can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of 50–100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p.54-59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Concentrating solar cookers use reflectors to concentrate solar energy onto a cooking container. The most common reflector geometries are flat plate, disc and parabolic trough type. These designs cook faster and at higher temperatures (up to 350&amp;nbsp;°C) but require direct light to function properly.

The Solar Kitchen in [[Auroville]], [[India]] uses a unique concentrating technology known as the [[solar bowl]]. Contrary to conventional tracking reflector/fixed receiver systems, the solar bowl uses a fixed spherical reflector with a receiver which tracks the focus of light as the Sun moves across the sky. The solar bowl's receiver reaches temperature of 150&amp;nbsp;°C that is used to produce steam that helps cook 2,000 daily meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many other solar kitchens in India use another unique concentrating technology known as the Scheffler reflector. This technology was first developed by [[Wolfgang Scheffler (inventor)|Wolfgang Scheffler]] in 1986. A Scheffler reflector is a parabolic dish that uses single axis tracking to follow the Sun's daily course. These reflectors have a flexible reflective surface that is able to change its curvature to adjust to seasonal variations in the incident angle of sunlight. Scheffler reflectors have the advantage of having a fixed focal point which improves the ease of cooking and are able to reach temperatures of 450-650&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Distillation===
{{Main article|Solar still}}
Solar stills can be used to make drinking water in areas where clean water is not common. Solar distillation is necessary in these situations to provide people with purified water. Solar energy heats up the water in the still. The water then evaporates and condenses on the bottom of the covering glass.&lt;ref name="Solar Thermal Energy"/&gt;

==High-temperature collectors==
{{main article|Concentrated solar power}}
[[File:Solar Plant kl.jpg|thumb|Part of the 354 MW [[SEGS]] solar complex in northern [[San Bernardino County, California]].]]
[[Image:Four-solaire-odeillo-02.jpg|thumb|The [[solar furnace]] at [[Odeillo]] in the French [[Pyrenees-Orientales]] can reach temperatures up to 3,500°C .]]

Where temperatures below about 95&amp;nbsp;°C are sufficient, as for space heating, flat-plate collectors of the nonconcentrating type are generally used. Because of the relatively high heat losses through the glazing, flat plate collectors will not reach temperatures much above 200&amp;nbsp;°C even when the heat transfer fluid is stagnant. Such temperatures are too low for [[Efficient energy use|efficient conversion]] to electricity.

The efficiency of [[heat engine]]s increases with the temperature of the heat source.  To achieve this in solar thermal energy plants, [[solar radiation]] is concentrated by mirrors or lenses to obtain higher temperatures&amp;nbsp;– a technique called [[Concentrated Solar Power]] (CSP). The practical effect of high efficiencies is to reduce the plant's collector size and total land use per unit power generated, reducing the environmental impacts of a power plant as well as its expense.

As the temperature increases, different forms of conversion become practical.  Up to 600&amp;nbsp;°C, [[Rankine cycle|steam turbines]], standard technology, have an efficiency up to 41%.  Above 600&amp;nbsp;°C, [[Brayton cycle|gas turbines]] can be more efficient.  Higher temperatures are problematic because different materials and techniques are needed.  One proposal for very high temperatures is to use liquid fluoride salts operating between 700&amp;nbsp;°C to 800&amp;nbsp;°C, using multi-stage turbine systems to achieve 50% or more thermal efficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/scale/pubs/SOL-05-1048_1.pdf |title=ORNL's liquid fluoride proposal |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816191924/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/scale/pubs/SOL-05-1048_1.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[operating temperature]]s permit the plant to use higher-temperature dry heat exchangers for its thermal exhaust, reducing the plant's water use&amp;nbsp;– critical in the deserts where large solar plants are practical. High temperatures also make heat storage more efficient, because more watt-hours are stored per unit of fluid.

Commercial concentrating solar thermal power (CSP) plants were first developed in the 1980s. The world’s largest solar thermal power plants are now the 370&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], commissioned in 2014, and the 354&amp;nbsp;MW [[SEGS]] CSP installation, both located in the [[Mojave Desert]] of California, where several [[Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert|other solar projects]] have been realized as well.
With the exception of the [[Shams solar power station]], built in 2013 near [[Abu Dhabi]], the United Arab Emirates, all other [[List of solar thermal power stations|100&amp;nbsp;MW or larger CSP plants]] are either located in the United States or in Spain.

The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs between about 4 and 8&amp;nbsp;pm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peak Demand|url=https://www.energex.com.au/home/control-your-energy/managing-electricity-demand/peak-demand|website=Energex|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; many CSP power plants use 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;hours of thermal storage. With current technology, storage of heat is much cheaper and more efficient than storage of electricity. In this way, the CSP plant can produce electricity day and night. If the CSP site has predictable solar radiation, then the CSP plant becomes a reliable power plant. Reliability can further be improved by installing a back-up combustion system. The back-up system can use most of the CSP plant, which decreases the cost of the back-up system.

CSP facilities utilize high electrical conductivity materials, such as [[copper]], in field power [[Copper wire and cable|cables]], grounding networks, and [[Copper in energy efficient motors|motors]] for tracking and pumping fluids, as well as in the main generator and [[high voltage]] [[transformer]]s. ''(See: [[Copper in renewable energy#Copper in concentrating solar thermal power facilities|Copper in concentrating solar thermal power facilities]].)''

With reliability, unused desert, no pollution, and no fuel costs, the obstacles for large deployment for CSP are cost, aesthetics, land use and similar factors for the necessary connecting high tension lines. Although only a small percentage of the desert is necessary to meet global electricity demand, still a large area must be covered with mirrors or lenses to obtain a significant amount of energy. An important way to decrease cost is the use of a simple design.

When considering land use impacts associated with the exploration and extraction through to transportation and conversion of [[fossil fuel]]s, which are used for most of our electrical power, utility-scale solar power compares as one of the most land-efficient energy resources available:&lt;ref name=desmond12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/09/sorry-critics-solar-is-not-a-rip-off |title=Sorry, Critics - Solar Is Not a Rip-Off |author=Joe Desmond |date=September 24, 2012 |website=Renewable energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The federal government has dedicated nearly 2,000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development. In 2010 the [[Bureau of Land Management]] approved nine large-scale solar projects, with a total generating capacity of 3,682 megawatts, representing approximately 40,000 acres. In contrast, in 2010, the Bureau of Land Management processed more than 5,200 applications gas and oil leases, and issued 1,308 leases, for a total of 3.2 million acres. Currently, 38.2 million acres of onshore public lands and an additional 36.9 million acres of offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico are under lease for oil and gas development, exploration and production.&lt;ref name=desmond12/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===System designs===
During the day the sun has different positions. For low concentration systems (and low temperatures) tracking can be avoided (or limited to a few positions per year) if [[nonimaging optics]] are used.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO"&gt;Roland Winston et al., ''Nonimaging Optics'', Academic Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0127597515}}&lt;/ref&gt; For higher concentrations, however, if the mirrors or lenses do not move, then the focus of the mirrors or lenses changes (but also in these cases [[nonimaging optics]] provides the widest [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angles]] for a given concentration). Therefore, it seems unavoidable that there needs to be a tracking system that follows the position of the sun (for solar [[photovoltaic]] a [[solar tracker]] is only optional). The tracking system increases the cost and complexity. With this in mind, different designs can be distinguished in how they concentrate the light and track the position of the sun.

====Parabolic trough designs====
{{Main article|Parabolic trough}}

[[Image:Solarpipe-scheme.svg|thumb|Sketch of a parabolic trough design. A change of position of the sun parallel to the receiver does not require adjustment of the mirrors.]]

[[Trough concentrator|Parabolic trough]] power plants use a curved, mirrored trough which reflects the direct solar radiation onto a glass tube containing a fluid (also called a receiver, absorber or collector) running the length of the trough, positioned at the focal point of the reflectors. The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the orthogonal axis. For change of the daily position of the sun [[perpendicular]] to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver. Thus the trough design does not require tracking on a second axis. The receiver may be enclosed in a glass vacuum chamber. The vacuum significantly reduces convective heat loss.

A fluid (also called heat transfer fluid) passes through the receiver and becomes very hot. Common fluids are synthetic oil, [[molten salt]] and pressurized steam. The fluid containing the heat is transported to a [[heat engine]] where about a third of the heat is converted to electricity.

Full-scale parabolic trough systems consist of many such troughs laid out in parallel over a large area of land. Since 1985 a solar thermal system using this principle has been in full operation in [[California]] in the [[United States]]. It is called the [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] (SEGS) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fplenergy.com/portfolio/contents/segs_viii.shtml |title=SEGS system |publisher=Fplenergy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805074758/http://www.fplenergy.com/portfolio/contents/segs_viii.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other CSP designs lack this kind of long experience and therefore it can currently be said that the parabolic trough design is the most thoroughly proven CSP technology.

The SEGS is a collection of nine plants with a total capacity of 354&amp;nbsp;MW and has been the world's largest solar power plant, both thermal and non-thermal, for many years. A newer plant is [[Nevada Solar One]] plant with a capacity of 64&amp;nbsp;MW. The 150 MW [[Andasol solar power station]]s are in Spain with each site having a capacity of 50&amp;nbsp;MW. Note however, that those plants have heat storage which requires a larger field of solar collectors relative to the size of the steam turbine-generator to store heat and send heat to the steam turbine at the same time.  Heat storage enables better utilization of the steam turbine.  With day and some nighttime operation of the steam-turbine Andasol 1 at 50&amp;nbsp;MW peak capacity produces more energy than Nevada Solar One at 64&amp;nbsp;MW peak capacity, due to the former plant's thermal energy storage system and larger solar field. The 280MW [[Solana Generating Station]] came online in Arizona in 2013 with 6 hours of power storage. [[Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station]] in Algeria and [[Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center]] both use parabolic troughs in a combined cycle with natural gas.

====Enclosed trough====
{{Main article|Parabolic trough}}

[[File:Inside an enclosed CSP Trough.jpg|thumb|right|Inside an enclosed trough system]]
The enclosed trough architecture encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse. The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system.&lt;ref name="2012 pred"&gt;Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, [http://www.deloitte.com/energypredictions2012 "Energy &amp; Resources Predictions 2012"], 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended within the glasshouse structure. A [[Solar tracker|single-axis tracking system]] positions the mirrors to track the sun and focus its light onto a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure.&lt;ref name="Oil from the sun"&gt;Helman, Christopher, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0425/features-glasspoint-greenhouses-green-energy-oil-from-sun.html "Oil from the sun"], "Forbes", April 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Steam is generated directly, using oil field-quality water, as water flows from the inlet throughout the length of the pipes, without heat exchangers or intermediate working fluids.

The steam produced is then fed directly to the field’s existing steam distribution network, where the steam is continuously injected deep into the oil reservoir. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up as a result from exposure to humidity.&lt;ref name="2012 pred"/&gt; [[GlassPoint Solar]], the company that created the Enclosed Trough design, states its technology can produce heat for [[Enhanced oil recovery|EOR]] for about $5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.&lt;ref name="ehren chevron"&gt;Goossens, Ehren, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-03/chevron-using-solar-thermal-steam-at-enhanced-oil-recovery-plant.html "Chevron Uses Solar-Thermal Steam to Extract Oil in California"], "Bloomberg", October 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

GlassPoint’s enclosed trough system has been utilized at the [[Miraah]] facility in [[Oman]], and a new project has recently been announced for the company to bring its enclosed trough technology to the [[South Belridge Oil Field]], near [[Bakersfield, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mailchi.mp/glasspoint/belridge-solar-announcement|title=Belridge Solar Announcement|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power tower designs====&lt;!---This section is a target of links---&gt;
{{Main article|Solar power tower}}
[[File:IvanpahRunning.JPG|thumb|500px|center|[[Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System]] with all three towers under load, Feb., 2014. Taken from I-15 in [[San Bernardino County, California]]. The [[Clark Mountain Range]] can be seen in the distance.]]

[[Solar power tower|Power towers]] (also known as 'central tower' power plants or '[[heliostat]]' power plants) capture and focus the sun's thermal energy with thousands of tracking mirrors (called heliostats) in roughly a two square mile field.  A tower resides in the center of the heliostat field.  The heliostats focus concentrated sunlight on a receiver which sits on top of the tower.  Within the receiver the concentrated sunlight heats molten salt to over {{convert|1000|°F|°C}}.  The heated molten salt then flows into a thermal storage tank where it is stored, maintaining 98% thermal efficiency, and eventually pumped to a steam generator.  The steam drives a standard turbine to generate electricity.  This process, also known as the "Rankine cycle" is similar to a standard coal-fired power plant, except it is fueled by clean and free solar energy.

The advantage of this design above the parabolic trough design is the higher temperature. Thermal energy at higher temperatures can be converted to electricity more efficiently and can be more cheaply stored for later use. Furthermore, there is less need to flatten the ground area. In principle a power tower can be built on the side of a hill. Mirrors can be flat and plumbing is concentrated in the tower. The disadvantage is that each mirror must have its own dual-axis control, while in the parabolic trough design single axis tracking can be shared for a large array of mirrors.

A cost/performance comparison between power tower and parabolic trough concentrators was made by the NREL which estimated that by 2020 electricity could be produced from power towers for 5.47 ¢/kWh and for 6.21 ¢/kWh from parabolic troughs. The [[capacity factor]] for power towers was estimated to be 72.9% and 56.2% for parabolic troughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/solar/parabolic_trough.html |title=Assessment of Parabolic Trough and Power Tower Solar Technology Cost and Performance Forecasts |publisher=Nrel.gov |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627022055/http://www.nrel.gov/solar/parabolic_trough.html |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some hope that the development of cheap, durable, mass producible heliostat power plant components could bring this cost down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20071127_green.html |title=Google's Goal: Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal November 27, 2007 |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercial tower power plant was [[PS10 solar power tower|PS10]] in Spain with a capacity of 11&amp;nbsp;MW, completed in 2007. Since then a number of plants have been proposed, several have been built in a number of countries (Spain, Germany, U.S., Turkey, China, India) but several proposed plants were cancelled as photovoltaic solar prices plummeted. A solar power tower is expected to come online in South Africa in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/csp/solarpaces/project_detail.cfm/projectID=244]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] in California generates 392 MW of electricity from three towers, making it the largest solar power tower plant when it came online in late 2013.

====Dish designs==== &lt;!---This section is a target of links---&gt;
[[Image:SolarStirlingEngine.jpg|thumb|A parabolic solar dish concentrating the sun's rays on the heating element of a [[Stirling engine]]. The entire unit acts as a [[solar tracker]].]]
CSP-Stirling is known to have the highest efficiency of all solar technologies (around 30%, compared to solar photovoltaic's approximately 15%), and is predicted to be able to produce the cheapest energy among all renewable energy sources in high-scale production and hot areas, semi-deserts, etc.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} A [[Concentrated solar power#Dish Stirling|dish Stirling]] system uses a large, reflective, [[parabola|parabolic]] dish (similar in shape to a satellite television dish). It focuses all the sunlight that strikes the dish up onto a single point above the dish, where a receiver captures the heat and transforms it into a useful form. Typically the dish is coupled with a [[Stirling engine]] in a Dish-Stirling System, but also sometimes a [[steam engine]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;ANU 'Big Dish', http://solar-thermal.anu.edu.au/&lt;/ref&gt; These create rotational kinetic energy that can be converted to electricity using an electric generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stirlingenergy.com/solar_overview.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020220235835/http://www.stirlingenergy.com/solar_overview.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-02-20 |title=Stirling Energy Systems Inc. - Solar Overview |publisher=Stirlingenergy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Stirling Energy Systems and Tessera Solar commissioned the first demonstration 1.5-megawatt power plant ("Maricopa Solar") using Stirling technology in Peoria, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

====Fresnel technologies====
[[File:CLFR Alternating Inclination.JPG|thumb|Fresnel reflector]]
A linear [[Fresnel reflector]] power plant uses a series of long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small parabolic mirror can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. This is similar to the trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.

Rival single axis tracking technologies include the relatively new linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) and compact-LFR (CLFR) technologies. The LFR differs from that of the parabolic trough in that the absorber is fixed in space above the mirror field. Also, the reflector is composed of many low row segments, which focus collectively on an elevated long tower receiver running parallel to the reflector rotational axis.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mills, D. "Advances in Solar Thermal Electricity Technology." Solar Energy 76 (2004): 19-31. 28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prototypes of [[Fresnel lens]] concentrators have been produced for the collection of thermal energy by [[International Automated Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iaus.com/AdvancedSolarCollector.aspx |title=Web site of the International Automated Systems showing concepts about Fresnel lens |publisher=Iaus.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920142240/http://iaus.com/AdvancedSolarCollector.aspx |archivedate=2013-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No full-scale thermal systems using Fresnel lenses are known to be in operation, although products incorporating Fresnel lenses in conjunction with photovoltaic cells are already available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenandgoldenergy.com.au/ SunCube]&lt;/ref&gt;

====MicroCSP====
MicroCSP is used for community-sized power plants (1&amp;nbsp;MW to 50&amp;nbsp;MW), for industrial, agricultural and manufacturing 'process heat' applications, and when large amounts of hot water are needed, such as resort swimming pools, water parks, large laundry facilities, sterilization, distillation and other such uses.

====Enclosed parabolic trough====
The enclosed parabolic trough solar thermal system encapsulates the components within an off-the-shelf greenhouse type of glasshouse. The glasshouse protects the components from the elements that can negatively impact system reliability and efficiency.  This protection importantly includes nightly glass-roof washing with optimized water-efficient off-the-shelf automated washing systems.&lt;ref name="2012 pred"/&gt; Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires. A [[Solar tracker|single-axis tracking system]] positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight. The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure.&lt;ref name="Oil from the sun"/&gt; Water is pumped through the pipes and boiled to generate steam when intense sun radiation is applied. The steam is available for process heat. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors as a result from exposure to humidity.&lt;ref name="2012 pred"/&gt;

==Heat collection and exchange==
More energy is contained in higher frequency light based upon the formula of &lt;math alt="E = h nu"&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt;, where h is the [[Planck constant]] and &lt;math alt="nu"&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is frequency.  Metal collectors down convert higher frequency light by producing a series of [[Compton shift]]s into an abundance of lower frequency light.  Glass or ceramic coatings with high transmission in the visible and UV and effective absorption in the IR (heat blocking) trap metal absorbed low frequency light from radiation loss.  Convection insulation prevents mechanical losses transferred through gas.  Once collected as heat, thermos containment efficiency improves significantly with increased size.  Unlike Photovoltaic technologies that often degrade under concentrated light, Solar Thermal depends upon light concentration that requires a clear sky to reach suitable temperatures.

Heat in a solar thermal system is guided by five basic principles: heat gain; [[heat transfer]]; [[Thermal energy storage|heat storage]]; [[Coolant|heat transport]]; and [[heat insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jc-solarhomes.com/five_solar_heating_principles.htm Five Solar Thermal Principles] Canivan, John, JC Solarhomes, 26 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Here, heat is the measure of the amount of thermal energy an object contains and is determined by the temperature, mass and [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] of the object. Solar thermal power plants use heat exchangers that are designed for constant working conditions, to provide heat exchange. [[Copper in heat exchangers|Copper heat exchangers]] are important in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of copper’s high thermal conductivity, resistance to atmospheric and water corrosion, sealing and joining by soldering, and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and in primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks) of solar thermal water systems.&lt;ref&gt;2011 global status report by Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)); {{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/default.aspx?tabid=5434 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103024143/http://www.ren21.net/default.aspx?tabid=5434 |archivedate=2012-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat gain is the heat accumulated from the sun in the system. Solar thermal heat is trapped using the greenhouse effect; the greenhouse effect in this case is the ability of a reflective surface to transmit short wave radiation and reflect long wave radiation. Heat and infrared radiation (IR) are produced when short wave radiation light hits the absorber plate, which is then trapped inside the collector. Fluid, usually water, in the absorber tubes collect the trapped heat and transfer it to a heat storage vault.

Heat is transferred either by conduction or convection. When water is heated, kinetic energy is transferred by conduction to water molecules throughout the medium. These molecules spread their thermal energy by conduction and occupy more space than the cold slow moving molecules above them. The distribution of energy from the rising hot water to the sinking cold water contributes to the convection process. Heat is transferred from the absorber plates of the collector in the fluid by conduction. The collector fluid is circulated through the carrier pipes to the heat transfer vault. Inside the vault, heat is transferred throughout the medium through convection.

Heat storage enables solar thermal plants to produce electricity during hours without sunlight. Heat is transferred to a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during hours with sunlight, and is withdrawn for power generation during hours lacking sunlight. Thermal storage mediums will be discussed in a heat storage section. Rate of heat transfer is related to the conductive and convection medium as well as the temperature differences. Bodies with large temperature differences transfer heat faster than bodies with lower temperature differences.

Heat transport refers to the activity in which heat from a solar collector is transported to the heat storage vault. Heat insulation is vital in both heat transport tubing as well as the storage vault. It prevents heat loss, which in turn relates to energy loss, or decrease in the efficiency of the system.

==Heat storage for space heating==
{{Main article|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
A collection of mature technologies called [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) is capable of storing heat for months at a time, so solar heat collected primarily in Summer can be used for all-year heating. Solar-supplied STES technology has been advanced primarily in Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Holm L. (2012).

==Heat storage to stabilize solar-electric power generation==
{{Main article|Thermal energy storage}}
[[Thermal energy storage|Heat storage]] allows a solar thermal plant to produce electricity at night and on overcast days.  This allows the use of solar power for [[baseload]] generation as well as [[Peaking power plant|peak power generation]], with the potential of displacing both coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.  Additionally, the utilization of the generator is higher which reduces cost. Even short term storage can help by smoothing out the "[[duck curve]]" of rapid change in generation requirements at sunset when a grid includes large amounts of solar capacity.

Heat is transferred to a thermal storage medium in an insulated reservoir during the day, and withdrawn for power generation at night.  Thermal storage media include pressurized steam, concrete, a variety of phase change materials, and [[molten salt]]s such as calcium, sodium and potassium nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |title=Sandia National Lab Solar Thermal Test Facility |publisher=Sandia.gov |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/thermal_energy_storage.html |title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |publisher=Nrel.gov |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901224906/http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/thermal_energy_storage.html |archivedate=2013-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steam accumulator===
The [[PS10 solar power tower]] stores heat in [[Steam accumulator|tanks]] as pressurized steam at 50 bar and 285&amp;nbsp;°C. The steam condenses and flashes back to steam, when pressure is lowered. Storage is for one hour. It is suggested that longer storage is possible, but that has not been proven in an existing power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biello |first=David |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=sunny-outlook-sunshine-provide-electricity |title=Sunny Outlook: Can Sunshine Provide All U.S. Electricity? |publisher=Scientificamerican.com |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molten salt storage===

A variety of fluids have been tested to transport the sun's heat, including water, air, oil, and sodium, but Rockwell International&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarreserve.com/en/technology/molten-salt-energy-storage|title=Molten salt energy storage |accessdate= 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected [[molten salt]] as best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High temperature storage - Solar thermal application|url=http://regencyshutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/storage.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812144826/http://regencyshutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/storage.pdf|archive-date=12 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molten salt is used in solar power tower systems because it is liquid at atmospheric pressure, provides a low-cost medium to store thermal energy, its operating temperatures are compatible with today's steam turbines, and it is non-flammable and nontoxic. Molten salt is used in the chemical and metals industries to transport heat, so industry has experience with it.

The first commercial molten salt mixture was a common form of [[saltpeter]], 60% [[sodium nitrate]] and 40% [[potassium nitrate]]. Saltpeter melts at 220&amp;nbsp;°C (430&amp;nbsp;°F) and is kept liquid at 290&amp;nbsp;°C (550&amp;nbsp;°F) in an insulated storage tank. [[Calcium nitrate]] can reduce the melting point to 131&amp;nbsp;°C, permitting more energy to be extracted before the salt freezes.  There are now several technical calcium nitrate grades stable at more than 500&amp;nbsp;°C.

This solar power system can generate power in cloudy weather or at night using the heat in the tank of hot salt. The tanks are insulated, able to store heat for a week. Tanks that power a 100-megawatt turbine for four hours would be about 9&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 24&amp;nbsp;m (80&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter.

The [[Andasol Solar Power Station|Andasol]] power plant in Spain is the first commercial solar thermal power plant using molten salt for heat storage and nighttime generation. It came on line March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarmillennium.de/front_content.php?idart=155&amp;lang=2 |title=The Construction of the Andasol Power Plants |publisher=Solarmillennium.de |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 4, 2011, a company in Spain celebrated an historic moment for the solar industry: Torresol’s 19.9&amp;nbsp;MW concentrating solar power plant became the first ever to generate uninterrupted electricity for 24 hours straight, using a molten salt heat storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/07/05/260438/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight/ |title=Solar Can Be Baseload: Spanish CSP Plant with Storage Produces Electricity for 24 Hours Straight |publisher=Thinkprogress.org |date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102102227/http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/07/05/260438/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight/ |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 SolarReserve [http://www.utilitydive.com/news/solarreserve-proposes-2-gw-concentrated-solar-plant-with-storage-in-nevada/428348/ proposed] a 2 GW, $5 billion concentrated solar plant with storage in Nevada.

===Phase-change materials for storage===
[[Phase Change Material]] (PCMs) offer an alternative solution in energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terraforetechnologies.com/application-notes/epcm/ |title=Encapsulated Phase Change Materials (EPCM)                                                          Thermal Energy Storage (TES) |accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a similar heat transfer infrastructure, PCMs have the potential of providing a more efficient means of storage. PCMs can be either organic or inorganic materials.  Advantages of organic PCMs include no corrosives, low or no undercooling, and chemical and thermal stability. Disadvantages include low phase-change enthalpy, low thermal conductivity, and flammability. Inorganics are advantageous with greater phase-change enthalpy, but exhibit disadvantages with undercooling, corrosion, phase separation, and lack of thermal stability.  The greater phase-change enthalpy in inorganic PCMs make hydrate salts a strong candidate in the solar energy storage field.&lt;ref&gt;Zalba, Belen, Jose M. Marin, Luisa F. Cabeza, and Harald Mehling. "Review on Thermal Energy Storage with Phase Change: Materials, Heat Transfer Analysis and Applications." Applied Thermal Engineering 23 (2003): 251-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of water==
A design which requires water for condensation or cooling may conflict with location of solar thermal plants in desert areas with good solar radiation but limited water resources. The conflict is illustrated by plans of [[Solar Millennium]], a German company, to build a plant in the [[Amargosa Valley]] of Nevada which would require 20% of the water available in the area. Some other projected plants by the same and other companies in the [[Mojave Desert]] of California may also be affected by difficulty in obtaining adequate and appropriate water rights. [[California water law]] currently prohibits use of potable water for cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/business/energy-environment/30water.html "Alternative Energy Projects Stumble on a Need for Water"] article by Todd Woody in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designs require less water. The [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] in south-eastern California conserves scarce desert water by using air-cooling to convert the steam back into water.  Compared to conventional wet-cooling, this results in a 90% reduction in water usage at the cost of some loss of efficiency. The water is then returned to the boiler in a closed process which is environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/09/brightsource-bechtel-partner-on-440-mw-ivanpah-csp-project BrightSource &amp; Bechtel Partner on 440-MW Ivanpah CSP Project] ''Renewable Energy World'', September 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion rates from solar energy to electrical energy==
Of all of these technologies the solar dish/Stirling engine has the highest energy efficiency. A single solar dish-[[Stirling engine]] installed at [[Sandia National Laboratories]] [[National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF)]] produces as much as 25&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity, with a [[Energy conversion efficiency|conversion efficiency]] of 31.25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2008/solargrid.html |title=Sandia, Stirling Energy Systems set new world record for solar-to-grid conversion efficiency |date=2008-02-12 |publisher=[[Sandia National Laboratories]] |access-date=2008-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123082657/http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2008/solargrid.html/ |archive-date=2008-11-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar [[Trough concentrator|parabolic trough]] plants have been built with efficiencies of about 20%. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Fresnel reflectors have an efficiency that is slightly lower (but this is compensated by the denser packing).

The gross conversion efficiencies (taking into account that the solar dishes or troughs occupy only a fraction of the total area of the power plant) are determined by net generating capacity over the solar energy that falls on the total area of the solar plant. The 500-megawatt (MW) SCE/SES plant would extract about 2.75% of the radiation (1&amp;nbsp;kW/m²; see [[Solar power#Energy from the Sun|Solar power]] for a discussion) that falls on its 4,500 acres (18.2&amp;nbsp;km²).&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.edison.com/releases/major-new-solar-energy-project-announced-by-southern-california-edison-and-stirling-energy-systems-inc Major New Solar Energy Project Announced By Southern California Edison and Stirling Energy Systems, Inc.], press release&lt;/ref&gt; For the 50&amp;nbsp;MW AndaSol Power Plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarpaces.org/News/Projects/Spain.htm |title=2x50 MW AndaSol Power Plant Projects in Spain |publisher=Solarpaces.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515092633/http://www.solarpaces.org/News/Projects/Spain.htm |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is being built in Spain (total area of 1,300×1,500 m = 1.95&amp;nbsp;km²) gross conversion efficiency comes out at 2.6%.

Furthermore, efficiency does not directly relate to cost: on calculating total cost, both efficiency and the cost of construction and maintenance should be taken into account.

[[File:Taylor column rising ball.png|thumb|Motion of fluid above and below a moving object is forced to circulate, and are thus restricted to be within a column extended by the object in the axis of rotation.]]

A '''Taylor column''' is a fluid dynamics phenomenon that occurs as a result of the [[Coriolis effect]]. It was named after [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]]. Rotating fluids that are perturbed by a solid body tend to form columns parallel to the axis of rotation called Taylor columns.

An object moving parallel to the axis of rotation in a rotating fluid experiences more drag force than what it would experience in a non rotating fluid. For example, a strongly buoyant ball (such as a pingpong ball) will rise to the surface slower than it would in a non rotating fluid. This is because fluid in the path of the ball that is pushed out of the way tends to circulate back to the point it is shifted away from, due to the Coriolis effect. The faster the rotation rate, the smaller the radius of the inertial circle traveled by the fluid.

[[File:Coriolis effect07.gif|thumb|A unit of fluid (represented by the black dot) is pushed back to the point it is shifted from.]]

In a non-rotating fluid the fluid parts above the rising ball and closes in underneath it, offering relatively little resistance to the ball. In a rotating fluid, the ball needs to push up a whole column of fluid above it, and it needs to drag a whole column of fluid along beneath it in order to rise to the surface.

A rotating fluid thus displays some degree of rigidity.

== History ==
Taylor columns were first observed by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]], in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;James Thomson (Lord Kelvin's brother) (1868) Letter to William Thomson (30 September). Glasgow University Library, MS Kelvin T120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O.

(1882) "Elasticity viewed as possibly a mode of motion," ''Proceedings of the Royal Institution'', vol. 9, pages 520–521; also in: ''Popular Lectures and Addresses'', vol. 1, pages 142–146.  See also:  Thomson, W. (1887) "On the stability of steady and of periodic fluid motion," ''Philosophical Magazine'', vol. 23, pages 459–464.

The “Operatives’ lecture” of the British Association meeting at Leeds, 6th September, 1890.''

== Theory ==

Taylor columns have been rigorously studied. For ''[[Reynolds number|Re]]''&lt;&lt;1, ''[[Ekman number|Ek]]''&lt;&lt;1, ''[[Rossby number|Ro]]''&lt;&lt;1, the drag equation for a cylinder of radius, ''a'', the following relation has been found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=D. W.|last2=Saffman|first2=P. G.|date=1969-09-18|title=The Structure of Free Vertical Shear Layers in a Rotating Fluid and the Motion Produced by a Slowly Rising Body|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/264/1156/597|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=264|issue=1156|pages=597–634|doi=10.1098/rsta.1969.0036|issn=1364-503X|bibcode=1969RSPTA.264..597M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{16}{3}\rho a^{3}\Omega U&lt;/math&gt;

To derive this, Moore and Saffman solved the linearised [[Navier–Stokes equations|Navier–Stokes equation]] along in cylindrical coordinates,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where some of the vertical and radial components of the viscous term are taken to be small relative to the Coriolis term:

&lt;math&gt;-2\Omega v=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2\Omega u=\nu \left (\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial r^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial v}{\partial r}-\frac{v^2}{r} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+\nu \left (\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial r^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial w}{\partial r} \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

To solve these equations, we incorporate the volume conservation condition as well:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (ur)}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

We use the Ekman compatibility relation for this geometry to restrict the form of the velocity at the disk surface:

&lt;math&gt;w-U=\pm\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\nu}{\Omega}}\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial (rv)}{\partial r}
&lt;/math&gt;

The resultant velocity fields can be solved in terms of [[Bessel function]]s.

&lt;math&gt;u=-\frac{\nu}{2\Omega}\int\limits_{0}^{\infin} k^2 A(k) J_1(kr)e^{-\nu k^3 z/2\Omega}dk&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v=\int\limits_{0}^{\infin} A(k) J_1(kr)e^{-\nu k^3 z/2\Omega}dk&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;w=-\int\limits_{0}^{\infin} A(k) J_0(kr)e^{-\nu k^3 z/2\Omega}dk&lt;/math&gt;

whereby for ''[[Ekman number|Ek]]''&lt;&lt;1 the function ''A(k)'' is given by,

&lt;math&gt;A(k)=\frac{2Ua}{\pi}\left ( \cos ka - \frac{\sin ka}{ka} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating the equation for the ''v'', we can find the pressure and thus the drag force given by the first equation.

'''''The Fourth Revolution: Energy''''', also known as ''Die 4. Revolution – Energy Autonomy'', is a German [[documentary film]] about [[List of films about renewable energy|renewable energy]] by [[Carl-A. Fechner]], released in 2010. It depicts a vision for a global society that obtains 100 % of its energy from [[Renewable energy|renewable sources]] and the complete reconstruction of the economy that this will require.

Production took four years and was financed by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/kino/0,1518,684054,00.html Der Spiegel]&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the film were made in 10 different countries, showing existing pioneer projects in different cultures, from those funded by [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Muhammad Yunus|Muhammed Yunus]] through micro-credit, to the vision of the [[Right Livelihood Award]] laureate [[Hermann Scheer]] of [[Eurosolar]], to modern businesses working in the renewable energy sector. The film launched in cinemas in Germany March 18, 2010 and had its U.S. premiere at the [[San Francisco Green Film Festival]] in March 2011.

In the German trailer to the film, the revolution in capitalist ownership of energy resources is stressed; Hermann Scheer says that ''"instead of a few owners we will have hundreds of thousands..."'' and ''"energy supply will be democratized"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-revolution.de/index.swf film trailer ] (partly english with german subtitles)&lt;/ref&gt; The film embodies the philosophy of Hermann Scheer, who died in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyautonomy.org/ film website] (german and english) Scheer's book ''Energy Autonomy'' .. was instrumental.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/kino/0,1518,684054,00.html Der Spiegel] (german) "2006 Idee"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TurbidityStandards.jpg|right|frame|Turbidity standards of 5, 50, and 500 NTU]]
'''Turbidity''' is the cloudiness or [[haze|haziness]] of a [[fluid]] caused by large numbers of individual [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] that are generally invisible to the [[naked eye]], similar to [[smoke]] in [[air]]. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of [[water quality]].

[[Fluids]] can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the [[Settling|settable solids]]), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are [[colloid]]al. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.

'''Turbidity''' (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production, haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5° from the incoming light direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php Haze technical definition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822002852/http://www.thermallaminatingfilms.com/haze.php |date=August 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Turbidity in open water may be caused by growth of [[phytoplankton]]. Human activities that disturb land, such as [[construction]], [[mining]] and [[agriculture]], can lead to high [[sediment]] levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to [[storm water]] [[surface runoff|runoff]]. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as [[urbanized]] areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater [[water pollution|pollution]] from [[Pavement (material)|paved]] surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/urbanmm/index.html "National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Urban Areas."] Chapters 7 and 8. Document No. EPA 841-B-05-004. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some industries such as [[quarry]]ing, [[coal mine|mining]] and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.

In drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop [[gastrointestinal diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Mann, C.C. Tam, C.D. Higgins, &amp; L.C. Lodrigues. (2007). The association between drinking water turbidity and gastrointestinal illness: a systematic review. ''BMC Public Health''. 7(256): 1 - 7&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]] can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with [[chlorine]] because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|ultraviolet (UV) sterilization]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civilengineerbuddy.com/turbidity-water-its-measurment-environmental-engineering/|title=Turbidity of water and its measurment &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; – disinfection not possible without removing suspended particles|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In water bodies such as [[lake]]s, rivers and [[reservoirs]], high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plants]] and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/savpage.htm "Decline of Submerged Plants in Chesapeake Bay."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Chesapeake Bay Program. Annapolis, MD. [http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx "Sediments."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073649/http://www.chesapeakebay.net/sediments.aspx |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many [[mangrove]] areas, high turbidity is needed in order to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of [[Australia]], in particular [[Moreton Bay]], turbidity levels as high as 600 [[Nephelometer|Nephelometric]] Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper [[ecosystem]] health.

==Measurement==
[[Image:Runoff torbidity.jpg|thumb|right|Turbid creek water caused by heavy rains.]]

The most widely used measurement unit for turbidity is the [[Formazine|Formazin]] Turbidity Unit (FTU). [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] refers to its units as FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Units). [[ISO 7027]] provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the [[concentration]] of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a [[photodiode]], which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. [[Open source hardware]] has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an [[Arduino]] microcontroller and inexpensive [[LED]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bas Wijnen, G. C. Anzalone and Joshua M. Pearce, Open-source mobile water quality testing platform. Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4(3) pp. 532–537 (2014). doi:10.2166/washdev.2014.137 [https://www.academia.edu/8319858/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of [[attenuation]] (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or '''JTU''') is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.

The propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a [[nephelometer]] with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are lots of small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units ('''NTU'''). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation.

Turbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a [[Secchi disk]]. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the [[euphotic zone]] with a 3-fold division of the ''Secchi depth'', however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.

An additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2013}}Waterwatch Australia, Module 4 - physical and chemical parameters [https://web.archive.org/web/20060513024523/http://www.waterwatch.org.au/publications/module4/turbidity.html "Methods Turbidity"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myre, E, Shaw, R. The Turbidity Tube: Simple and Accurate Measurement of Turbidity in the Field. [http://watsanmissionassistant.wikispaces.com/file/view/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf/360203097/Turbidity-Myre_Shaw.pdf "The Turbidity Tube"]&lt;/ref&gt; The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the Secchi disk.

Turbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;HelioClim (Center for Energy and Processes). Paris, France.

==Standards and test methods==
[[File:Turbidimeters.JPG|thumb|[[Turbidimeter]]s used at a water purification plant to measure turbidity (in NTU) of raw water and clear water after filtration.]]

===Drinking water standards===
Governments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods turbidity cannot be higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/index.html#3 "Drinking Water Contaminants."] 2009-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The European standards for turbidity state that it must be no more than 4 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/standards.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]], establishes that the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenntech.com/turbidity.htm#ixzz3R3yPreK7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient water standards===
The U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published water quality criteria for turbidity.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/goldbook.pdf "Quality Criteria for Water."] (Commonly known as the "Gold Book.") 1986. Document No. EPA-440/5-86-001.&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are scientific assessments of the effects of turbidity, which are used by states to develop [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] for water bodies. (States may also publish their own criteria.) Some states have [[Promulgation|promulgated]] water quality standards for turbidity, including:
* [[Louisiana]]. 25, 50 or 150 NTU, or background plus 10 percent, depending on the water body.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Baton Rouge, LA.[http://epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/la/la_6_wqs.pdf "Surface Water Quality Standards."] ''Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC).'' Title 33, Part IX, Chapter 11. August 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Vermont]]. 10 NTU or 25 NTU, depending on water body classification.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Water Resources Board. Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf "Vermont Water Quality Standards."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231093748/http://www.nrb.state.vt.us/wrp/publications/wqs.pdf |date=2013-12-31 }} January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. 5 NTU over background (when background is 50 NTU or less), or 10 percent increase when background is over 50 NTU.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Department of Ecology. Olympia, WA.[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/wa/wa_10_chapter173-201a.pdf "Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the State of Washington."] ''Washington Administrative Code (WAC).'' Chapter 173-201A. November 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
'''Turbidity''' is commonly treated using either a settling or filtration process. Depending on the application, chemical reagents will be dosed into the wastewater stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. [[Potable water]] treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of sand filtration, settling tanks, and clarifiers.

[[In-situ water treatment]] or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a [[flocculant]], evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at [[coal mine]]s and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in-situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents.

===Reagents===
There are a number of [[chemical reagent]]s that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents available for treating turbidity include [[aluminium sulfate]] or [[alum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[ferric chloride]] (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), poly-[[aluminium chloride]], long chain [[acrylamide]]-based [[polymer]]s and numerous proprietary reagents.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Systems, Clear Solutions newsletter - Focus on Turbidity [http://www.earthsystems.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ClearSolutions_No1_2003.pdf] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the [[pH]] of the water.

The dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the [[Flocculation|flocs]] may be broken apart by excessive mixing.

[[Image:Volute spring1.jpg|right|thumb|A volute spring. Under compression the coils slide over each other, so affording longer travel.]]
A '''volute spring''' is a compression [[spring (device)|spring]] in the form of a cone (a [[volute]]). Under compression, the coils slide past each other, thus enabling the spring to be compressed to a very short length in comparison with what would be possible with a more conventional [[helix]] spring.

The shape of the initial spring steel (or other material) is a "V", with the ends of the V at either end of the wound spring (which forms a distorted cylinder, of wider diameter at the centre), and the bottom point of the V at the centre.

Such springs can frequently be found as a component of garden [[secateurs]]. Short posts anchored in each side of the handles, and inserted into each narrow end of the spring, keep the spring in position.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''μ(I)'' rheology}}

In [[granular mechanics]], the '''''μ(I)'' rheology''' is one model of the [[rheology]] of a granular flow. 

==Details==

The inertial number of a granular flow is a [[dimensionless quantity]] defined as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{||\dot\gamma|| d}{\sqrt{P/\rho}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the shear rate tensor, &lt;math&gt;||\dot\gamma||&lt;/math&gt; is its magnitude, ''d'' is the average particle diameter, ''P'' is the pressure and ''&amp;rho;'' is the density. It is a local quantity and may take different values at different locations in the flow. 

The ''&amp;mu;''(''I'') rheology asserts a [[constitutive relationship]] between the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] of the flow and the rate of strain tensor:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{ij} = -p\delta_{ij} + \mu(I)p \frac{\dot\gamma_{ij}}{||\dot\gamma_{ij}||} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where the eponymous ''&amp;mu;''(''I'') is a dimensionless function of ''I''. As with [[Newtonian fluid]]s, the first term -''p&amp;delta;''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect of pressure. The second term represents a [[shear stress]]: it acts in the direction of the shear, and its magnitude is equal to the pressure multiplied by a coefficient of friction ''&amp;mu;''(''I''). This is therefore a generalisation of the standard [[Coulomb friction]] model.

One deficiency of the ''μ(I)'' rheology is that it does not capture the [[hysteresis|hysteretic]] properties of a granular material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forterre|first1=Yoël|last2=Pouliquen|first2=Olivier|title=Flows of Dense Granular Media|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|date=January 2008|volume=40|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.40.111406.102142|bibcode=2008AnRFM..40....1F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The ''μ(I)'' rheology was developed by Jop ''et al.'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holyoake|first1=Alex|title=Rapid Granular Flows in an Inclined Chute|date=December 2011|url=http://alexholyoake.com/academic/RapidGranularFlows_Holyoake.pdf|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jop|first1=Pierre|last2=Forterre|first2=Yoël|last3=Pouliquen|first3=Olivier|title=A constitutive law for dense granular flows|journal=Nature|date=8 June 2006|volume=441|issue=7094|pages=727–730|doi=10.1038/nature04801|arxiv=cond-mat/0612110|bibcode=2006Natur.441..727J}}&lt;/ref&gt;
