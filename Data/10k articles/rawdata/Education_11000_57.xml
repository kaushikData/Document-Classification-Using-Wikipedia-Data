'''Alan Jay Perlis''' (April 1, 1922 – February 7, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]] and professor at [[Purdue University]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Yale University]]. He is best known for his pioneering work in [[programming language]]s and was the first recipient of the [[Turing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Hashagen, Reinhard Keil-Slawik, Arthur L. Norberg (2002) ''History of Computing: Software Issues''. p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Perlis was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. He graduated from [[Taylor Allderdice High School]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A.M Turing Award Winnders: Alan J. Perlis|url=https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/perlis_0132439.cfm|website=Association for Computing Machinery|access-date=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[chemistry]] from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later renamed [[Carnegie Mellon University]]). During [[World War II]], he served in the [[U.S. Army]], where he became interested in mathematics. He then earned both a [[master's degree]] (1949) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1950) in [[mathematics]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). His doctoral dissertation was titled "On [[Integral equation|Integral Equations]], Their Solution by Iteration and [[Analytic continuation|Analytic Continuation]]".

In 1952, he participated in [[Project Whirlwind]].&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Engineering (1979) "Alan Jay Perlis" in: ''Memorial tributes''. Vol 10. p.168&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty at [[Purdue University]] and in 1956, moved to the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He was chair of mathematics and then the first head of the [[computer science]] department. In 1962, he was elected president of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].

He was awarded the inaugural Turing Award in 1966, according to the citation, ''for his influence in the area of advanced programming techniques and [[compiler]] construction''. This is a reference to the work he had done as a member of the team that developed the programming language [[ALGOL]].

In 1971, Perlis moved to [[Yale University]] to become the chair of computer science and hold the Eugene Higgins chair. In 1977, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]].

In 1982, he wrote an article, ''[[Epigrams on Programming]]'', for [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s (ACM) SIGPLAN journal, describing in one-sentence distillations many of the things he had learned about programming over his career. The [[epigram]]s have been widely quoted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpsc.yale.edu/epigrams-programming Computer science quotations]&lt;/ref&gt;
He remained at Yale until his death in 1990.

==Early life and education==
Anni Albers was born '''Annelise Else Frieda Fleischmann''' on June 12, 1899 in [[Berlin]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anni-Albers "Anni Albers"], Encyclopedia Britannica, Retrieved online 14 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was from a family in the [[publishing]] industry and her father was a [[furniture]] maker. Even in her childhood, she was intrigued by art and the visual world. She painted during her youth and studied under [[impressionism|impressionist]] artist [[Martin Brandenburg]], from 1916–19, but was very discouraged from continuing after a meeting with artist [[Oskar Kokoschka]], who upon seeing a portrait of hers asked her sharply "Why do you paint?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anni Albers|last=Weber|first=Nicholas Fox|last2=Asbaghi|first2=Pandora Tabatabai|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|year=1999|isbn=0810969238|location=New York|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albers eventually decided to attend art school, even though the challenges for art students were often great and the living conditions harsh.  Such a lifestyle sharply contrasted the affluent and comfortable living that she had been used to. She attended the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] in [[Hamburg]] for only two months in 1919, then in April 1922 began her studies at the [[Bauhaus]] at [[Weimar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Anni Albers, 94, Textile Artist And the Widow of Josef Albers|last=Reif|first=Rita|date=May 10, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dessau bauhaus 04.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Bauhaus in Dessau, Germany]]
At the Bauhaus she began her first year under [[Georg Muche]] and then [[Johannes Itten]]. Women were barred from certain disciplines taught at the school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71336738|title=Practicing modernity : female creativity in the Weimar Republic|date=2006|publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann|others=Schönfeld, Christiane., Finnan, Carmel, 1958-|isbn=3826032411|location=Würzburg|oclc=71336738}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during her second year, unable to get into a glass workshop with future husband [[Josef Albers]], Albers deferred reluctantly to [[weaving]], the only workshop available to women.&lt;ref name="NMWA"&gt;[https://nmwa.org/explore/artist-profiles/anni-albers "Anni Albers"], National Museum of Women in the Arts, Retrieved online 14 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; With her instructor [[Gunta Stölzl]], however, Albers soon learned to appreciate the challenges of tactile construction and began producing geometric designs.{{Baro, Gene.

== Career ==
In 1925, Anni and Josef Albers, the latter having rapidly become a "Junior Master" at the Bauhaus, were married.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The school moved to [[Dessau]] in 1926, and a new focus on production rather than craft at the Bauhaus prompted Albers to develop many functionally unique textiles combining properties of light reflection, sound absorption, durability, and minimized wrinkling and warping tendencies. She had several of her designs published and received contracts for wall hangings &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11650684|title=The woven and graphic art of Anni Albers.|last=1947-|first=Weber, Nicholas Fox,|date=1985|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|others=Jacob, Mary Jane., Field, Richard S., Renwick Gallery.|isbn=0874749786|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=11650684}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For a time Albers was a student of [[Paul Klee]], and after Gropius left Dessau in 1928 Josef and Anni Albers moved into the teaching quarters next to both the Klees and the [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinskys]]. During this time, the Albers began their lifelong habit of travelling extensively: first through [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41713625|title=Anni Albers|last=1947-|first=Weber, Nicholas Fox,|date=1999|publisher=Guggenheim Museum Publications|others=Tabatabai Asbaghi, Pandora., Albers, Anni., Peggy Guggenheim Collection., Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.|isbn=0810969238|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=41713625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Gunta Stölzl left the Bauhaus in 1931, Anni Albers took over her role as Head of the Weaving Workshop, making her one of the few women to hold such a senior role at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus100.de/en/past/people/masters/anni-albers/ Bauhaus100. Anni Albers] (Accessed: 5 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bauhaus at Dessau was closed in 1932 under pressure from the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party and moved briefly to Berlin, permanently closing a year later in August 1933. Anni and Joseph Albers, who were Jewish, fled to [[North Carolina]], where they were invited by [[Philip Johnson]] to teach at the experimental [[Black Mountain College]], arriving stateside in November 1933.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Both taught at Black Mountain until 1949. During these years Anni Albers's design work, including weavings, were shown throughout the US. Albers wrote and published many articles on design.

In 1949, Anni Albers became the first textile designer to have a one-person exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Albers's design exhibition at MoMA began in the fall and then toured the US from 1951 until 1953, establishing her as one of the most important designers of the day. During these years, she also made many trips to [[Mexico]] and throughout the Americas, and became an avid collector of [[pre-Columbian]] artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/pre-columbian-mexican-miniatures-the-josef-and-anni-albers-collection/oclc/253845585&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Pre-Columbian Mexican miniatures the Josef and Anni Albers collection|last=Albers|first=Anni|last2=Bernal|first2=Ignacio|last3=Coe|first3=Michael Douglas|last4=Hill|first4=John T|date=1970|publisher=Praeger|location=New York; Washington|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Black Mountain in 1949, Anni moved with her husband to [[Connecticut]], and set up a studio in her home. After being commissioned by Gropius to design a variety of bedspreads and other textiles for [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and following the MoMA exhibition, Albers spent the 1950s working on mass-producible fabric patterns, creating the majority of her "pictorial" weavings, and publishing a half-dozen articles and a collection of her writings, ''On Designing''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1963, while at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in [[Los Angeles]] with Josef for a lecture of his, Anni Albers was invited to experiment with print media. She grew immediately fond of the technique, and thereafter gave up most of her time to [[lithography]] and [[screen printing]]. She was invited back as a fellow to Tamarind in 1964, wrote an article for [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica]] in 1963, and then expanded on it for her second book, ''On Weaving'', published in 1965. The book was a powerful voice of the midcentury textile design movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=T'ai|title=Bauhaus Weaving Theory: From Feminine Craft to Mode of Design|date=2014|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8166-8723-7|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her design work and writings on design helped establish Design History as a serious area of academic study.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1976, Anni Albers had two major exhibitions in Germany, and a handful of exhibitions of her design work, over the next two decades, receiving a half-dozen honorary doctorates and lifetime achievement awards during this time as well, including the second [[American Craft Council]] Gold Medal for "uncompromising excellence" in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards/american-craft-council-gold-medalists|title=ACC Gold Medalists {{!}} American Craft Council|website=American Craft Council|language=en|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She continued to travel to Latin America and Europe, to design and to make prints, and to lecture until her death on May 9, 1994, in [[Orange, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Josef Albers, who had served as the chair of the design department at [[Yale University|Yale]], after the artists had moved from Black Mountain to Connecticut, in 1949, had predeceased her in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.001.0001/acref-9780199773787-e-00002081|title=Albers, Josef {{!}} Benezit Dictionary of Artists|language=en|doi=10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.b00002081|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1971, the Albers founded the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation,&lt;ref name="Foundation"&gt;[http://www.albersfoundation.org/   The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation website]&lt;/ref&gt; a not-for-profit organization they hoped would further "the revelation and evocation of vision through art."&lt;ref name=Foundation/&gt; Today, this organization not only serves as the office Estate of both [[Josef Albers]] and Anni Albers, but also supports exhibitions and publications focused on Albers works. The official Foundation building is located in Bethany, Connecticut, and "includes a central research and archival storage center to accommodate the Foundation's art collections, library and archives, and offices, as well as residence studios for visiting artists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albersfoundation.org/Foundation.php?inc=Mission The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation: Mission Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080715232841/http://www.albersfoundation.org/Foundation.php?inc=Mission|date=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albers was inducted into the [[Connecticut women's hall of fame|Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame|title=Anni Albers Inductee Profile|url=http://www.cwhf.org/inductees/arts-humanities/anni-albers|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Albers was a designer who worked primarily in textiles and, late in life, with print media. She produced numerous designs in ink washes for her textiles, and occasionally experimented with jewelry design. Her woven works include many wall hangings, curtains and bedspreads, mounted "pictorial" images, and mass-produced yard material. Her weavings are often constructed of both traditional and industrial materials, not hesitating to combine [[jute]], paper, and [[cellophane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/guia-educadores/with-verticals-1946/|title=With Verticals, 1946 - Museo Guggenheim Bilbao|work=Museo Guggenheim Bilbao|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/06/paul-smith-on-his-muse-anni-albers-the-rest-of-us-are-still-struggling-to-catch-up|title=Paul Smith on his muse Anni Albers: ‘The rest of us are still struggling to catch up’|last=Andrew Dickson|date=2018-10-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11075">'''Assessment in computer-supported collaborative learning''' (CSCL) environments is a subject of interest to educators and researchers. The [[Educational assessment|assessment]] tools utilized in [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] settings are used to measure groups' knowledge of the [[collaborative]] processes, the quality of groups' products and individuals' collaborative learning skills.

==Perspective==
Traditional assessment is equated with individualized exams and evaluations. However, in online collaborative learning, assessment requires a broader perspective as it encompasses the collaborative interactions using [[asynchronous learning|asynchronous]] and [[Synchronization|synchronous]] communications between group members. Assessment has been found to have a significant effect on CSCL by motivating learners through accountability and constructive feedback. It supports students in growing familiar with the course content through discourse and effectively encourages the participation of students.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Assessment is the systematic basis for making inferences about the learning and development of students. Specifically, assessment is the process of defining, selecting, analyzing, interpreting, and using information to increase students' learning and development.&lt;ref name="Swan, Shen, &amp; Hiltz 2006"&gt;Swan, Shen, &amp; Hiltz (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessment is an ongoing process aimed at understanding and improving student learning. It involves making expectations explicit and public; setting appropriate criteria and high standards for learning quality; systematically gathering, analyzing, and interpreting evidence to determine how well performance matches those expectations and standards; and using the resulting information to document, explain, and improve performance.&lt;ref name="Swan, Shen, &amp; Hiltz 2006" /&gt;
Types of assessment in CSCL include whole-group assessment, self-assessment, peer assessment, assessment tools in CSCL, &lt;!--what does this mean distinct from the others?--&gt; performance [[rubric]], product rubric, and [[blog]]s&lt;!--really? how isn't that just a product, not an assessment type?--&gt;

==Instructor's role in CSCL assessment==
A paradigm shift occurs in the assessment of the products and processes in CSCL. In the traditional educational setting, final assessment is performed exclusively by the instructor.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;232) In CSCL, the instructor designs, facilitates, direct instruction and provide [[Technology|technical]] guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, et al.2001&lt;/ref&gt; The participants take an active role in setting the standard criteria for assessing individual and group learning.

==Technology use in CSCL assessment==
Various technologies may provide information that may be used for assessment purposes. For example, email, computer conferencing systems, bulletin boards, and [[hypermedia]] can be used as media for communication between group members in CSCL classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, V (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;13). This technology can be used to keep a record of the students' interactions. This interaction record enables the instructor and students in assessing a learner's participation and collaboration with the group.&lt;ref&gt;Suther, D. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;664).

==Process assessment vs. product assessment==
In CSCL settings, the relative value of the collaborative process and the product must be appropriately balanced. The [[pedagogical]] principle in CSCL environments is the assumption that knowledge is constructed through social negotiation and discussion with others. This social interaction encourages [[critical thinking]] and [[understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, Manca, Persico and Sarti (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;309) When learning occurs through social interaction, knowledge building can also be observed through text analysis or [[discourse analysis]]. One way to assess knowledge construction in online collaborative settings is by collecting and analyzing the discursive events recorded and kept as history in computer conferencing systems in the form of  [[virtual artifact]]. [[:wikt:transcript|Transcript]]s can be used to determine the quantity and quality of interactions in negotiating meaning of the course material.&lt;ref name="Macdonald 2003"&gt;Macdonald (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;379) The instructor evaluates the messages exchanged by the students for meaningfulness and pertinence in regards to the target content.

==Assessment of the process==
Instructors can use discourse analysis to assess the students' learning of the collaborative process itself. The instructor can make use of the dialogue to look for cues of collaboration: support and respect in their criticisms, consideration of other teammates' opinions, negotiation of meaning, demonstration of mutual understanding, achievement of consensus, problem-solving, and time and task management issues. Another consideration in assessing students' collaborative skills, is the students' competence in online collaboration. As proficiency develops in progressive stages, the instructor can design the assessment to account for the students' developing competence in progressive steps throughout the online collaborative process.&lt;ref name="Macdonald 2003" /&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;378)

==Assessment of the product==
Collaborative products can be used to assess learners' knowledge acquisition. The products can be: a concept map, a report, a research paper, an essay, a [[wiki]], a [[website]], etc. Two assessable elements of collaborative product are the overall quality of the collaborative product and the contributions of each individual.&lt;ref name="Pozzi et al. 2007"&gt;Pozzi et al. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;386)  Each member of the group must participate in the collaborative activities. The products created by groups of students in CSCL contexts cannot be used as the sole evidence of knowledge acquisition. Although a quality product may be important, it is the process that generates the actual learning."&lt;ref name="Pozzi et al. 2007" /&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;170)

==Self and peer assessment==
[[Self assessment]] in CSCL, students taking responsibility of learning by evaluating and judging aspects of their own learning activity.&lt;ref name="Falchikov, 1986"&gt;Falchikov, (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In peer assessment, individuals take into account the quantity and quality of their own product or performance.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In CSCL, these two types of assessments are dynamically interrelated. The aim of self and peer assessments in CSCL is to improve students' learning, and develop individual learning skills as well as grading individual learning outcomes.&lt;ref name="Falchikov, 1986" /&gt;
Self and peer assessment:
# drives students' learning;
# aids students in recognizing individual potential and sharing collaborative work effectively and efficiently;
# enables instructors to perceive the effect of individual learning through discourse;
# informs the instructor of the students' opinion change and skill improvement that occurs through adversity in the online collaborative process;
# develops students as retrospective thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--This is how you auto number lists, but prose is considered better form than lists in Wikipdia articles--&gt;

==Group work assessment==
Group work assessment in CSCL measures the quantity and quality of students' learning as a team. Group work or [[teamwork]] is a collaborative learning situation in which students share the task of developing a product presented at the end of the course.&lt;ref name="De Hoyos2004"&gt;De Hoyos(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Group work is not measured and interpreted independently but evaluated with other assessment tools, and plays a role in assisting learners' to reflect on their learning process.&lt;ref name="De Hoyos2004" /&gt;
Group work assessment:
# diagnoses the collaborative learning process and shows the instructor what works and what does not;
# identifies and corrects destructive conflict in collaborative learning;
# facilitates learners' reflection making the collaborative task effective and efficient;
# allows the instructor to monitor the collaborative learning processes and gather the information about individual performance and contributions to product quality.

==E-portfolio assessment==
[[E-portfolio]] can be used in assessment of CSCL activities by showing students' growth or proficiency in learning. Organizing information about individual students, the instructor keeps track of the student's learning process. These portfolios are managed online and are referred to as electronic portfolio, digital portfolio, or web-portfolio.
In using E-portfolios in CSCL assessment an instructor determines:
# purpose;
# type;
# choice of items to include;
# guidelines or criteria;
# impact on the teacher and students;
# self-reflection component.&lt;ref&gt;Butler &amp; McMunn, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atatürk Centennial''' was declared in 1981 by [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]]. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] is the only person to receive such recognition by UNESCO.

The centennial of his birth was honored by the [[United Nations]] and [[UNESCO]] by declaring it ''The Atatürk Year in the World'' and adopting the ''Resolution on the Atatürk Centennial'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114032e.pdf], ''Records of the General Conference Twentieth Session Paris, 24 October to 28 November 1978 Volume I Resolutions'' (Paris: United Nations, 1979), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|The General Conference,
Convinced that eminent personalities who worked for international understanding, co-operation,
and peace, should serve as an example for future generations,

Recalling that the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Mustafa Kemal Atatûrk, the founder of
the Republic of Turkey, will be celebrated in 1981,

Bearing in mind that he was an exceptional reformer in all the fields coming within Unesco’s
competence,

Recognizing in particular that he was the leader of one of the earliest struggles against colonialism
and imperialism,

Recalling that he set an outstanding example in promoting the spirit of mutual understanding
between peoples and lasting peace between the nations of the world, having advocated all
his life the advent of ‘an age of harmony and co-operation in which no distinction would be
made between men on account of colour, religion or race’,

1. Decides that Unesco shall co-operate on the intellectual and technical planes with the Turkish
Government for the organization in 1980, at that Government’s financial expense, of an international
symposium designed to bring out various aspects of the personality and work of
Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, whose action was always directed towards
the promotion of peace, international understanding and respect for human rights;

2. Requests the Director-General to take the necessary steps for the implementation of this
resolution.

'''Berufswertigkeit''' is a concept of comparative evaluation concerning the competences of persons with different formal educational achievements. It derives from the requirements of modern professional business practice and enables comparisons respectively an assessment of the considered persons or educational achievements from the specific view of professional practice.

== Concept ==

''Berufswertigkeit'' orientates oneself on a modern occupation term which covers a pronounced functionality and a high identification of the working persons with their tasks, actions and areas of responsibility (comprehensive professionalism).

With this measurement concept the assessment perspective of the professional world is chosen and regarded for the first time. Therefore, the requirements of professional practice and expectations of companies towards their employees respectively of the operational environment towards employees and executives in companies and towards a comprehensive professionalism independent of formal pre-qualification are set in the center of attention and less the theoretical comparison of defined competence fields. The term is in this respect based on the term ‘employability’ from the [[bologna process]] which claims a specific orientation of qualifications on the requirements of professional practice.

Furthermore, the term ‘Berufswertigkeit’ stands for a [[comparative]] moment for different professional qualifications and professional operational areas. Herein the term is based on the discussion of ‘equality’ of different formal forms of achievements. These discussions are considered insofar as the concept ‘Berufswertigkeit’ provides a standard of comparison which locates an occupational equality as a comparable value of the considered employees of the company through the concrete balance of detected fulfillments of requirements of the employees with different formal achievements. So this orientates largely independent from formal qualifications on the value contribution for the company. To realize a scientifically based assessment concept several working stages have been realized. (concept 2006, survey 2007, survey 2009, survey 2011)

== Working stages ==

The obtained results of examinations from the view of Berufswertigkeit shall and can serve to support scientific and public discussions in education. These can be orientated on:
*(a) comparability (equality discourse) and promotion of the transition between different [[education system]]s (comparative objective),
*(b) support of a general recognition and also motivation, e.g. of school leavers to acquire an [[educational attainment|educational achievement]] in the direction of their own professional activities (promotion objective),
*(c) further development of the several frameworks of qualifications like for example curricula, forms and terms of achievement due to feedback from professional practice.
The concept Berufswertigkeit was coined in two research studies 2007 and 2009 among others by Prof. Dr. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110317032231/http://www.fom-ild.de/organisation/direktorium-professoren.html Matthias Klumpp]

[[Mexico City]]'s '''Biblioteca Vasconcelos''' (''Vasconcelos Library''), also known as '''Biblioteca Vasconcelos''' or else '''''la Biblioteca Vasconcelos''''' or '''''la Vasconcelos''''' and labeled by the press as the ''Megabiblioteca'' ("megalibrary"), is a library in the downtown area of [[Mexico City]] ([[colonia Buenavista|Buenavista neighborhood]], [[delegación Cuauhtémoc|Cuauhtémoc borough]]). It was dedicated to [[José Vasconcelos]], the  philosopher and former presidential candidate and former president of the [[National Library of Mexico]]. The library is spread across 38,000 square metres (409,000 sq ft)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/guiaocio/8760.html|title=El Universal, el periódico de México líder en noticias y clasificados|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201030844/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/guiaocio/8760.html|archivedate=1 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an initial planned cost of 954 million pesos (roughly US$98 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/340992.html|title=En orden los recursos de Biblioteca Vasconcelos: CAPFCE|work=eluniversal.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congress of Mexico]] proposed plans to reduce the budget of 2006 that included cuts for all three branches of government. [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN) presented an alternative budget that preserved funds for [[Enciclomedia]] and the Vasconcelos Library.&lt;ref&gt;http://dgcs.pgr.gob.mx/Sintesis/Matutina/Matutina2004/matutinaNov2004/Nov1504.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Then President of Mexico [[Vicente Fox]] inaugurated the library on 16 May 2006, and stated that this was one of the most advanced constructions of the 21st century, and that it would be spoken of throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/349449.html|title=El Universal - - Inaugura Fox megabiblioteca "Jos Vasconcelos"|date=20 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inauguration took place a week before the deadline the president had to promote his accomplishments before the 2006 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universia.net.mx/index.php/news_user/content/view/full/37309/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928190430/http://www.universia.net.mx/index.php/news_user/content/view/full/37309/ |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library had to close in March 2007 due to construction defects.&lt;ref name="jornada-closed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/03/30/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a04n1cul|title=La ASF pide fincar responsabilidad a funcionarios de Vicente Fox|author=La Jornada|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archrecord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/070522kalach.asp|title=Kalach's Mexico City Library Shuttered|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Superior Auditor of the Federation detected 36 construction irregularities and issued 13 motions of responsibility for public servants of the federal government.&lt;ref name="jornada-closed" /&gt; Among the irregularities found was the misplacement of marble blocks at a cost of 15 million pesos (roughly 1.4 million dollars).&lt;ref name="jornada-closed" /&gt;

The library is located in downtown [[Cuauhtémoc, D.F.|Delegación Cuauhtémoc]] at the Buenavista train station where the [[Mexico City Metro|metro]], [[Ferrocarril Suburbano de la Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México|suburban train]], and [[Mexico City Metrobús|metrobus]] meet. It is adorned by several sculptures by Mexican artists, including [[Gabriel Orozco]]'s ''Ballena'' (''Whale''), prominently located at the centre of the building.

During [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa|Calderón]]'s administration, efforts to restore it continued with a further investment of 32 million pesos (roughly US$3 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/52782.html|title=El Universal - - 32 mdp m s a la ´megabiblioteca´|date=27 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reopened to the public in November 2008 after 22 months.

The winning proposal for the library was designed by the Mexican architects [[Alberto Kalach]] and [[Juan Palomar]]

'''Capitation fee''' refers to an illegal transaction whereby an organisation that provides educational services collects a fee that is more than what is approved by regulatory norms.

==Definition==
In the context of [[India]]n law, a capitation fee refers to the collection of payment by educational bodies not included in the prospectus of the institution, usually in exchange for admission to the institution.

The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 defines it as any amount that

*Demanded or charged or collected, directly or indirectly, for, or, on behalf of any institution, or paid by any person in consideration for admitting any person as student in such institution; and which is in excess of the fee payable towards tuition fee and other fees and other charges declared by any institution in its prospectus for admitting any person as student in such institution; or
*Paid or demanded or charged or collected, by way of [[donation]], for, or, on behalf of any institution, or paid by any person in consideration for admitting any person as a student in such institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Act, 2010, Bill No. 56 of 2010 Lok  Sabha|url=http://164.100.24.167/newcommittee/press_release/bill/Committee%20on%20HRD/The%20Prohibition%20of%20Unfair.pdf|format=PDF|website=164.100.24.167|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A submission by counsel, F.S. Nariman, in the P.A. Inamdar case (August 2005) defines capitation fee as "something taken over and above what the institution needs by way of revenue and capital expenditure plus a reasonable surplus.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayatna.typepad.com/education/2005/06/what_exactly_do.html|title=Education in India: The definition of capitation fee in the context of education in India|website=Prayatna.typepad.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions for capitation fee also include "any amount, by whatever name called, paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the fee prescribed...",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tndte.com/ACT%20AND%20REGULATIONS.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220064648/http://www.tndte.com/ACT%20AND%20REGULATIONS.pdf# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "any amount by whatever name called whether in cash or in kind paid or collected or received directly or indirectly in addition to the fees determined"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfhha.org/images/pdf/Hospital_Laws/Kerala_profes_sional_colleges%20_or_institution_ammendment%20act_%202006.pdf|format=PDF|title=No. 11510/Leg.Uni.3/06/Law|website=Rfhha.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "any amount, by whatever name called, whether in cash or kind, in excess of the prescribed or, as the case may be, approved, rates of fees..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/acts/1988.06.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025114132/http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/libweb/acts/1988.06.pdf# |archive-date=2016-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Tagore Gandhi.jpg|thumb|Tagore and Gandhi; 'Knowledge without Character' and 'Commerce without Morality' were social sins for Mahatma Gandhi.]]
This practice is widely prevalent in private colleges and universities in India, especially those that grant baccalaureate degrees in engineering, IT and the sciences for which the demand for admissions exceeds the supply, though a number of technical educations has been closing down in recent years and many seats go vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livechennai.com/detailnews.asp?newsid=26452 |title=100 engineering colleges to be closed throughout India: Details on Tamil Nadu colleges,AICTE,engineering colleges to be closed ,India,Tamil Nadu, colleges |publisher=Live Chennai |date=2016-05-13 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/aicte-approves-closure-150-private-colleges |title=AICTE approves closure of 150 private colleges |publisher=India Education Review |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ample evidence to the collection of capitation fee exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shammi Prabhakar/Mathrubhumi News |url=http://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/capitation-fee-for-medical-admissions-evidence-out-i-audio-capitation-fee-medical-admissions-1.1392480 |title=Capitation fee for medical admissions: Evidence out I Audio - Kerala-Mathrubhumi Kerala News, Latest Kerala News, Kerala Breaking News, Kerala Politics |publisher=English.mathrubhumi.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Correspondent |first=Our |url=http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/kerala-vigilance-probe-capitation-fee-self-finance-medical-admis.html |title=Capitation fee: Kerala CM orders vigilance probe |publisher=English.manoramaonline.com |date=2016-09-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

Capitation fee has been one of the major contributors to corruption in education and society. Those who complete their course by paying capitation fee are looking for a "return on investment". This attempt to recover the investment fuel unethical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Sudhir|title=Human Resources Management|date=2009|publisher=Tata McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-bmj-action-illegal-payments-india.html |title=The BMJ calls for action over illegal payments to India's private medical colleges |publisher=Medicalxpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitation fee has been considered to be one of the reason for the exorbitant hike in healthcare costs and deteriorating medical standards.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeetha D’Silva, journalist, Mumbai |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h106 |title=India’s private medical colleges and capitation fees |publisher=The BMJ |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150215/jsp/7days/story_3404.jsp |title=Have money, can prescribe |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitation fee comes as a surprise to the student when the student may have forsaken admission deadlines at other institutions. Choosing not to pay additional fee may even lead to a form of extortion, by withholding the degree from students. Parents often pay so that there is no ill bearing that affects their wards scores or standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capitation fee: ‘early bird' phenomenon continues |publisher=The Hindu |date=23 May 2011 |url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/23/stories/2011052362280300.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130125193611/http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/23/stories/2011052362280300.htm |archivedate=25 January 2013 |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fee might not be uniformly applied. The donation money is often not accounted, and its usage and allocation are mismanaged and not reported to income tax. In such cases of malpractice, students overpay for substandard education.

Students are also misguided. Some institutions add the capitation fee along with the fee approved by regulatory norms. This combined fee is projected as the actual fee to the students.

==Arguments for and against capitation fees==
[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb|[[Nalanda]], an ancient centre for higher learning; 'Speak the Truth', 'Live Righteousness' says the Upanishads ('Sathyam Vada, Dharmam Chara')]]
Capitation fees are generally seen as a main revenue generator that private institutions may charge, which contend that admissions that cater to affordable sections of society somehow affects the overall number of students educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/ugc-decide-fee-structure-private-deemed-universities|title=UGC to decide fee structure of private deemed universities - IndiaEducationReview|date=14 March 2011|website=Indiaeducationreview.com|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/private-universities-in-himachal-to-be-regulated-by-law# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819032529/http://www.indiaeducationreview.com/news/private-universities-in-himachal-to-be-regulated-by-law# |archive-date=2016-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also controls the seat allocation, number and ratio of management, payment and free seats. That limits the institutions' ability to raise money through tuition, leaving institutions in need for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphinlifesciences.com//|title=The Secret of Successful best college |accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashanet.org/projects-new/documents/678/SupremeCourtJudgementForClauseImplementation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Supreme Court's double whammy for elite schools |website=Ashanet.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collecting donations becomes a side effect of the government laws that disallow institutions from setting their fees, but some parents genuinely donate to improve the infrastructure of their wards' college.

The practice of charging capitation fees by various institutions and universities has been subjected to criticism on various grounds. It has been often referred as 'killing of merit'. In its emphatic judgement in the [[Mohini Jain V/s State of Karnataka case]], Supreme Court declared that charging of capitation fee was arbitrary, unfair, and in violation of the fundamental right to equality in Article 14 of the Constitution. The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 recognized capitation fee as a cognizable offence.

On the other hand, various private colleges have defended capitation fee on the ground that it avails institutions with funds to reinvest in the institution to impart quality education. V Raghunathan, former professor, IIM-Ahmedabad said "For engineering colleges in most states, the permitted fee for unaided private colleges is in the vicinity of Rs 30,000 per student per annum. Given that even most kindergarten schools charge a higher fee in the cities, one wonders exactly how the private institutions are expected to provide high quality technical education for this fee".&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/pvt-colleges-defend-capitation-fee/593749/0 |title=Pvt colleges defend capitation fee |publisher=Financialexpress.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faking News has written an article 'School Principal elected for the coveted 'Business Person of the Year' award' acknowledging the practices of some of the private schools in India, while also noting that "a school principal winning a business award created unrest among the top business leaders in India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/india/school-principal-elected-coveted-business-person-year-award-17096|website=Faking News |title=School Principal elected for the coveted 'Business Person of the Year' award |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, institutions (business schools, engineering colleges, medical colleges) that take capitation fee also receive significant amount of funding from governmental funding agencies like AICTE, DST, UGC and various ministries under central government and state government. The funds support infrastructure ranging from faculty laptops, printers, lab facilities and trading rooms in business schools.

Educational regulatory agencies, at the national level&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/1842250_deemedregulation2014.PDF |title=Extraordinary|website=Ugc.ac.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also at the regional level,&lt;ref name="asckerala1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asckerala.org/sites/default/files/MBA%20DIRECTIVES%20ISSUED%20TO%20ALL%20SELF-FINANICNG%20MANAGEMENT%20INSTITUTUES%20ON%2011.05.2015.pdf |title=ADMISSION SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE &amp; FEE REGULATORY COMMITTEE FOR PROFESSIONAL COLLEGES OF KERALA|website=Asckerala.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has mandated that an institution should include the fee in the prospectus. Institutions has been charging fee from students under various categories, that the fee regulatory committee of Karnataka Government has listed 99 different categories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kea.kar.nic.in/cet2014/NOTICE_FRC.pdf |title=Fee Regulatory Committee of Karnataka Government|website=Kea.kar.nic.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the institutions may be collecting fee from the students. While fee regulatory agencies fix a fee that cover expenses incurred by an institution along with a basic surplus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frctech.ac.in/2011_NewFee/mba_frc.pdf |title=Fee Regulatory Committee (Technical)|website=Frctech.ac.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrcmp.org/index.php/2015-11-25-08-40-18 |title=Admission &amp; Fee Regulatory Committee|website=Afrcmp.org |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojee.nic.in/publicinfo/Handler/FileHandler.ashx?i=File&amp;ii=98&amp;iii=Y |title=Fixation of Fee Structure |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; many institutions has been charging a fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/others/thinkingan-mba-knowreal-costs_882184.html |title=Thinking of an MBA?

The National Policy on Education "encourages non-governmental and voluntary efforts in Education, while preventing the establishment of institutions which intend to commercialize Education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelcontent.aspx?relid=108677 |title=English Releases |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While education is not meant to be a commercial practice, corruption in educational institutions has made a noble endeavor such as education into a "notorious business" that has been repeatedly raided by governmental authorities, resulting in identification and seizure of unaccounted wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-it-dept-seizes-unreported-valueables-worth-over-rs-330-crore-2250360 |title=IT dept seizes unreported valueables worth over Rs 330 crore &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2016-08-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Various renowned and prestigious private schools and colleges across India have been found demanding capitation fee. It was found that sum of Rs 500,000 was allegedly paid by a student through a demand draft to Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering (SVCE), a private college in Pennalur, Sriperumbudur, near Chennai. The incident came into light through a surprise check drive initiated by the government in Tamil Nadu at 142 self-financing engineering colleges in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/31/stories/2007073154040600.htm |title=Archive News |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scam exposed by a popular news channel, Times Now, suggested that Information and Broadcasting Minister for State Jagathrakshakan was allegedly associated with the Shree Balaji Medical College in malpractices in admissions. The minister later denied having associated with the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kLeDd0bqG4 |title=College capitation fee scam |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jagathrakshakan said, "I have never been the Chairman. Once I was a trustee. Before election I quit. I have absolutely no connection with the college or the trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author={{author}} |url=http://www.timesnow.tv/Minister-denies-link-to-capitation-fee-scam/videoshow/4318636.cms |title=Home |publisher=Timesnow.tv |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, students filed a case against Mercedes Benz International School, a prestigious school in Pune for allegedly collecting 'capitation fees' under the guise of a building donation fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-02-13/pune/27113500_1_capitation-fee-student-files-suit-maharashtra-educational-institutions |title=India News, Latest Sports, Bollywood, World, Business &amp; Politics News - Times of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income Tax Department has been conducting raids on some of the organisations that take capitation fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bangalore Mirror Bureau |url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/cover-story/I-T-dept-makes-record-seizure-of-Rs43cr-cash-from-Vydehi-Institute-trustee/articleshow/54551833.cms?prtpage=1 |title=I-T dept makes record seizure of Rs43cr cash from Vydehi Institute trustee |publisher=Bangalore Mirror |date=2016-09-28 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Income-tax-raids-in-Tamil-Nadu-Pondy-yield-80-crore/2016/06/25/article3499219.ece|newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |title=Income tax raids in Tamil Nadu, Pondy yield 80 crore |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626133559/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Income-tax-raids-in-Tamil-Nadu-Pondy-yield-80-crore/2016/06/25/article3499219.ece |archivedate=26 June 2016 |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/Capitation-fee-draws-Income-Tax-sleuths-to-top-schools-in-Namakkal/2013/06/14/article1633889.ece|newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |title=Capitation fee draws Income-Tax sleuths to top schools in Namakkal |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/d-y-patil-group-income-tax-raid-cash-unaccounted-jewellery-seized-2950621/|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]] |title=Rs 30 crore, 40 kg bullion seized from D Y Patil Group by Income Tax |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrests have been made related to cheating associated with admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/srm-chairmans-arrest-warning-andhra-govt-it-parades-private-unis-amarvati-49231 |title=SRM chairman’s arrest a warning to Andhra govt as it parades private universities in Amaravati|website=Thenewsminute.com |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal implications==
The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Institutions and Universities Bill 2010 was introduced as a strict measure to bring about the transparency in the educational system regarding the fee structures and other crucial issues. Charging or accepting capitation fee is considered as violation of Provision 6, which prohibits any institution from demanding or accepting capitation fee, directly or indirectly. If found guilty, the institution will be liable to a penalty of up to Rs.5,000,000 and maximum imprisonment for three years. The bill has been criticized by various private institutions essentially for restricting the autonomy of the institution in such matters. J Philip, President, Xavier Institute of Management Education, Bangalore and former director, IIM – Bangalore, said, "The Bill promises to be beneficial. But it also runs the risk of curbing the autonomy and the freedom of institutions and challenge dynamic functioning. Again, it could be misused by students or anyone trying to settle scores".&lt;ref name="financialexpress1"/&gt; However, this bill lapsed, before it became a law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livelaw.in/prashant-bhushan-writes-lodha-committee-systematic-changes-structure-functioning-medical-council/ |title=Prashant Bhushan writes to Lodha Committee for systematic changes in the structure and functioning of Medical Council|website=Livelaw.in |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reports indicate that black money in education in India is generating more than 40,000 crores, while black money generation in medical education would be more than 10,000 crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praja.in/en/blog/murali772/2016/02/01/business-medical-education |title=The business of medical education &amp;#124; Praja |publisher=Praja.in |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing into black money practices in India has started its probe into the area, which was outside the ambit of SIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-money-sit-set-to-crack-down-on-donations-capitation-fee/article1-1326761.aspx |title=Special team probing black money set to crack down on unaccounted funds in education sector &amp;#124; india |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggestions to curb practice ==
Concerns have been raised on how capitation fee has been charged in the name of donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-vow-to-fight-unitary-university-plan-capitation-fee/article128385.ece |title=Teachers vow to fight ‘unitary university’ plan, capitation fee - TAMIL NADU |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the Supreme Court appointed Mr Salman Khurshid, former Union Law Minister, as an amicus curiae and asked him to come out with suggestions and methodologies to end this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/424408/sc-names-khurshid-amicus-curiae.html|title=SC names Khurshid amicus curiae|newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]]|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to stringent legal actions, other practices that government can adopt to curb the practice include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/errorpage/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103165110/http://www.thehindu.com/errorpage/# |archive-date=2018-01-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical Education / Higher Education===
All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the regulatory body for technical education in India, has called "upon the students, parents and the general public not to pay any capitation fee or any other fee other than that mentioned in the Prospectus of the Institutions for consideration of admission.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/notice_prohibition_capitation_fee.pdf|format=PDF|title=Notice : Accepting/Paying Capitation Fees is Strictly Prohibited|website=Aicte-india.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AICTE also mentions that the fee charged from students, including for programs such as PGDM, has to be approved by the fee regulatory committee of the state, and the institute should mention the fee in its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/ApprovalProcessHandbook2016-17.pdf |title=All India Council for Technical Education: Approval Process Handbook: (2016 – 2017)|website=Aicte-india.org |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per AICTE norms, the business schools are not meant to charge a fee higher than what is mentioned in the prospectus. Educational regulatory agencies, at the national level&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and also at the regional level,&lt;ref name="asckerala1"/&gt; has mandated that an institution should include the fee in the prospectus.

===School education===
Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) states that a school should be run as a service and not as a business and that commercialization does not take place in the school. The Board has mentioned that "No capitation fee or voluntary donations for gaining admission in the school or for any other purpose should be charged/collected in the name of the school. In case of such malpractices, the Board may take drastic action leading to disaffiliation of the school". The school is also punishable with fine which may extend to ten times the capitation fee charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/Circular%20No.%2002-2016%20dated%2003.06.2016.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adherence to Rules of Affiliation|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBSE has issued notification/s asking schools affiliated to CBSE to mention fee details in the school website, and also in the CBSE website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/mdnew.pdf|format=PDF|title=INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER MANDATORY DISCLOSURE|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/md.pdf|format=PDF|title=Extension of date of filing disclosures|website=Cbse.nic.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar notifications have been released by regional educational departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schooleducation.tripura.gov.in/sites/default/files/Notification%20on%20Admission.pdf|format=PDF|title=Admission in privately-owned unfunded schools over capitation fees|website=Schooleducation.tripura.gov.in|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celia Franca''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|OOnt}} (25 June 1921&amp;nbsp;– 19 February 2007) was the founder of The [[National Ballet of Canada]] (1951) and its artistic director for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=6384de00-8cbf-4e6d-b7af-cc174899f90c&amp;k=89472 Celia Franca dies in hospital].

==Early life==
Franca was born '''Celia Franks''' in London, England, the daughter of an East End tailor. Her family were Polish Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.news.yorku.ca/2011/11/29/york-grad-writes-first-biography-of-national-ballet-founder-celia-franca/ "York grad writes first biography of National Ballet Founder Celia Franca"]. ''Aumni News'', 2011-11-29. York University.&lt;/ref&gt; She began to study dance at the age of four and was a scholarship student at the [[Guildhall School of Music]] and the [[Royal Academy of Dance]].&lt;ref name=martin&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/national-ballet-founder-dies-at-85/article20393119/?page=all "National Ballet founder dies at 85"]. ''Globe and Mail'', Sandra Martin, February 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She made her professional debut aged 14.&lt;ref name="III2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris M. Lentz III|title=Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2007: Film, Television, Radio, Theatre, Dance, Music, Cartoons and Pop Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3zGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=2 June 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3481-7|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She successfully auditioned for [[Marie Rambert]]'s ballet company in 1936. She changed her name to Franca in emulation of Alicia Marks, who changed hers to [[Alicia Markova]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'', 13 April 2007, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; She entered into the first of three marriages, to fellow dancer Leo Kersley.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2011/12/13/shedding_new_light_on_celia_franca.html "Shedding new light on Celia Franca"]. ''Toronto Star'', Michael Crabb, Dec. 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1941, aged 20, she was a dramatic ballerina in the [[Sadler's Wells]] company.&lt;ref name="III2008" /&gt; In 1947 she joined the [[Metropolitan Ballet]] as a soloist and ballet mistress. It was there that she began choreographing for television, creating the first two ballets – ''[[Eve of St. Agnes (ballet)|Eve of St. Agnes]]'' and ''[[Dance of Salomé]]'' – commissioned by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name="III2008"/&gt;

Franca continued television work after the Metropolitan Ballet shut down.&lt;ref name="Davidson1952"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladys Davidson|title=Ballet biographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4G1AAAAIAAJ|year=1952|publisher=W. Laurie|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1950, a group of [[Toronto]] balletomanes asked Franca, who had come to Canada to attend a festival,&lt;ref name=martin /&gt; to start a Canadian classical company; she did so in the very short time of 10 months. While supporting herself as a file clerk at Eaton's department store, she recruited and trained dancers,&lt;ref name="Gwyn1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Gwyn|title=Women in the Arts in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVcJAQAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=Information Canada|pages=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; staged some Promenade Concerts, organized a summer school,&lt;ref name="YoungbergHolmlund2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gail Youngberg|author2=Mona Holmlund|title=Inspiring Women: A Celebration of Herstory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XhHUzUwJtA4C&amp;pg=PA222|year=2003|publisher=Coteau Books|isbn=978-1-55050-204-6|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; she gathered an artistic staff and prepared her uneven but enthusiastic new company for its opening on 12 November 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/celia-franca/ "Celia Franca"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; She and [[Betty Oliphant]] founded the [[National Ballet School of Canada]] in 1959 to provide trained dancers for the Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/national-ballet-founder-celia-franca-dies-1.641213 "National Ballet founder Celia Franca dies"]. ''CBC Arts'', Feb 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Franca  joined  [[Merrilee Hodgins]] and Joyce Shietze as a Co-Artistic Director to [[The School of Dance]] in Ottawa, a non-profit organization designed to provide professional training for dance.&lt;ref name="YoungbergHolmlund2003" /&gt;

Franca lived in [[Ottawa]] and was a co-artistic director of [[The School of Dance]], a member of the board of governors of [[York University]] and the board of directors of the Canada Council and later served on the Board of Directors for the Canada Dance Festival Society.

Franca continued her association with the National Ballet, revising works for the Company, including ''[[Offenbach in the Underworld]]'' (1983) and staging ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. She returned to the Company to produce a 35th Anniversary Gala Performance at Toronto's O'Keefe Centre.

In 1967, she was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] and was promoted to Companion in 1985.&lt;ref name="YoungbergHolmlund2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/goodbye-to-a-very-great-lady/article1001486/ "Goodbye to a great lady"].  Obituary on the ''Globe and Mail'', July 24, 2004, John Fraser.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Franca received a [[Governor General's Performing Arts Award]] for Lifetime Artistic Achievement.

After a year of poor health after breaking the vertebrae in her back, she died on 19 February 2007, aged 85, in an Ottawa Hospital.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5223">'''Changzhou School of Thought''' 常州學派, the [[Changzhou]]-centered influential school of scholarship of the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing dynasties (1644-1912). Scholars in this school are best known for their contribution to the [[New Text Confucianism]].

== Ming ==
[[Tang Shunzhi]] 唐順之 (1507-1560), the famous Ming mathematician and advocate of the ancient prose style, is considered the precursor of the school, since his work underlined importance of calendaric studies and mathematics in the [[Han learning|Han scholarship]]. Tang's argument for the "concrete studies" (''shixue''), as well as concern about diluting influence of the Buddhist and Daoist teachings on Confucianism of [[Wang Yangming]] became an important feature of the Changzhou intellectual framework.&lt;ref&gt;Elman,81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tang Shunzhi was married to the grandmother of Zhuang Qiyuan (1559-1633), who compiled genealogies of Tangs and Zhuangs and claimed intellectual affinity to his predecessors. Qiyuan was influenced by Catholicism and [[Diego de Pantoja]] in particular, praising it as superior to Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhuang Qiyuan's sons kept the proclivity for practical knowledge: Zhuang Yinqi (''jinshi'' 1643) reissued a Ming book on children diseases, expanded with his own commentaries; Zhuang Yinghui (''jinshi'' 1628), with help of his brothers and sons, compiled a work on military history, extolling the "Confucian technical expertise".

== Qing ==
By the beginning of Qing, "Changzhou ''shixue''" was distinct from the [[Suzhou]] and [[Yangzhou]] traditions. However, its proponents were less interested in the Han learning, sticking to the [[Cheng-Zhu school|Cheng-Zhu]] orthodoxy as a reliable way to examination success.

In the middle of Qing, however, Changzhou had a plethora of Han learning scholars: [[Sun Xingyan]], [[Hong Liangji]] (1746–1809), [[Huang Jingyan]], [[Zhao Huaiyu]], [[Zhao Yi (scholar)|Zhao Yi]], Li Zhaole (1769-1849). The spread of Han learning was stimulated by [[Lu Wenchao]], a Hangzhou native, who moved to the Changzhou Longcheng Academy after being the head of the Jiyang Academy 暨陽書院 in the nearby Jiangyin in 1790-96.   

Zhuang Youke 莊有可, though largely unknown outside Changzhou,&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 194-5 states that he kept a number of teaching posts around the empire (Hefei and Zhili): it is unclear why this was not conductive to his scholarly popularity.&lt;/ref&gt; was recognized as a fine scholar dealing with the Old text/New text controversy. He was praised for mastery of the [[Shuowen]] dictionary and produced a number works on the ''Change classic'' and the ''Chunqiu''. His support to [[Yan Ruoqu]]-[[Hui Dong]]'s refutation of the Old Text ''Shangshu'' chapters stood in opposition to [[Zhuang Cunyu]]'s politics-bound view: Cunyu held that the ''renxin-Daoxin'' 人心 道心 notion of the "Councils of Yu the Great" chapter was crucially important for the imperial ethics, while the ''Han xue'' proponents, including Youke, interpreted it as a heterodox Buddhist influence on the Confucian doctrine.

Zhuang Cunyu (another prominent native of Changzhou), however, had an intellectual influence other than textological: he was an embodiment of the message that scholarly activity for a Confucian cannot be divorced from the political. Besides, he was the tutor of the younger generations of his lineage, including [[Zhuang Shuzu]] (cousin), [[Zhuang Shoujia]] and [[Liu Fenglu]] (grandsons). Shoujia was instrumental in publishing grandfather's works, restraining from popularization of his own writings.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the diplomatic and scholarly success of Liu Fenglu ([[:zh:劉逢祿|劉逢祿]], 1776—1829) in Beijing, the Changzhou school obtained national fame.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 218-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he persuaded [[Ruan Yuan]] (1764-1849) to include a number of Changzhou-originated studies of classics into the ''Huang Qing jingjie'' 皇清经解.

The new intellectual generation in Chanzhou showed interest in paleography. Zhuang Shoujia, developing the ideas of Shuzu, authored the ''Shi shuming'' (Explication of writing and names), providing a history of ancient calligraphy with etymological (''xungu'') and paleographic (''wenzixue'') insights. Among the sources of his studies, Shoujia used remnants of the [[Xiping Stone Classics]] (Han dynasty). Shuzu's pupil [[Song Xiangfeng]] [[:zh:宋翔風|宋翔風]] (1776-1860) developed specialization in etymology, studying the [[Erya]] disctionary. However, quite in spirit of Zhuang Cunyu, he claimed: "In antiquity, those who studied the Classics did not drown in etymological glosses... Etymologists, if they reach farfetched explanations, and theorists, if they wind up in airy and distant studies, must both be criticized...  if the Tao is not put into effect, then the empire will not be ordered. The blame will fall on no one else but on scholars."&lt;ref&gt;Elman, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Education Museum''' ({{lang-ms|Muzium Pendidikan}}) is a [[museum]] in [[Melaka City]], [[Melaka]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazingmelaka.com/2012/01/education-museum-malacca/|title=Education Museum|work=AmazingMelaka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myrokan.com/2013/12/muzium-muzium-di-negeri-melaka.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perzim.gov.my/ms/portfolio/education-museum/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum building was built in 1884 during [[British Malaya]]. In 1931, it housed the Melaka High School. Due to the growing number of student intake, the school had to be relocated to Chan Koon Cheng Street. The building then housed the Melaka Labour and Audit Department until 1978. After that, the department relocated to the Federal Building at Hang Tuah Street and the building was left vacant. In 2003, the building underwent renovation and the Melaka Museum Corporation proposed to the Melaka State Government to convert the building into the Museum of Education due to its historical past of housing the Melaka High School.&lt;ref&gt;http://generalabout.blogspot.com/2012/10/education-museum.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The building design is a mix of British, Dutch, Moorish and Anglo-Chinese architecture styles. The windows are of Dutch design with no wind holes, using British materials and bricks and Indian double-layered roof and roof tiles

==Exhibitions==
The museum exhibits the historical development of the Melaka education system since [[Melaka Sultanate]], [[British Malaya]], [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]] up to present time.

==Opening time==
The museum opens everyday from 9.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.

'''Eleanor Swift''' is a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Boalt Hall School of Law]].  She is best known for her work on the theory of [[evidence (law)|evidence]], and additionally teaches [[civil procedure]], the [[legal profession]], and periodic seminars.

==Early career==
Eleanor Swift graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory High School.
Upon graduating from Yale Law School, Eleanor Swift clerked for Judge M. Joseph Blumenfeld of the U.S. District Court in Hartford and for Chief Judge [[David L. Bazelon]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]]. She then practiced in Houston with the firm of [[Vinson &amp; Elkins]].

==At Boalt==

Swift joined the Boalt faculty in 1979. She served as associate dean at Boalt from 1998 to 2000. She is also chair of the Committee on Professional Development of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] and is a past chair of the Evidence Section. From 1992 to 1997, she chaired a special faculty-student committee appointed by Dean [[Herma Hill Kay]] to develop a proposal for improving and expanding the clinical curriculum at Boalt. In 1998 she received Boalt's Rutter Award for Teaching Distinction and in 2000 she received UC Berkeley's Distinguished Teaching Award.

The focus of her teaching and research is on the adversary system: the legal rules, practices, and procedures that govern civil and criminal trials. She teaches courses in Civil Procedure, Evidence, and the Legal Profession.

Swift incorporates three perspectives in her classes: theoretical, professional, and ethical. "My aim," she says, "is to introduce students to the practice of law under a system of rules, to develop their ability to critique those rules, and to enable them to experience the ethical dilemmas of lawyers acting in role."

Students consistently point to the effect her teaching has had on their lives. A former student says, "It would be easy for me to say that I went to the Eleanor Swift School of Law. . . .The lasting imprint of her message makes me use my legal education to make the world a slightly better place. I could never thank her enough for her instruction."

Student course evaluations point to the demanding nature of the course: "Evidence is a conceptually difficult course, but her teaching brought out clear thinking," says one student. Says another, "I think this topic is pretty complex and difficult, which makes the instructor and class materials all the more impressive."

One of Professor Swift's most lasting contributions to the Law School's teaching mission is her leadership in the establishment of Boalt's Center for Clinical Education," which brings clients in need of legal advice to Boalt, where students, directed by a faculty member, provide counsel.

==Swift v. Boalt==
Swift was originally denied tenure at Boalt Hall in 1987.  She initiated a suit against the University alleging sex discrimination in her tenure review process.  The suit was settled with an agreement to leave the tenure decision to an outside independent review committee of distinguished academics.  This committee unanimously recommended that she be promoted to tenure, which finally happened in the fall of 1989.

She wrote about this experience in ''Becoming a Plaintiff'', 4 Berkeley Women's L.J. 245 (1990).

==Statement of Teaching Philosophy==

"The courses that I teach at the School of Law—Civil Procedure, Evidence, and Legal Profession—all focus on the adversary system. My goal is, of course, to develop students' knowledge of the legal rules, practices and procedures that govern civil and criminal trials. Equally important, however, is that students understand how these rules establish roles for the participants in the adversary system — the lawyers, their clients, the judge and the jury. I develop opportunities for students to learn how lawyers function in resolving individual and societal disputes, and to critique this function from theoretical, professional, and ethical perspectives.

"Taking a theoretical perspective on the rules of the adversary system requires examination of the core values—truth (or rectitude of decision), fairness, efficiency and finality—that underlie our procedural justice system. The rules are carefully examined and debated with regard to their efficacy in promoting these values. Since these core values are often in tension, alternatives are explored and compromises are evaluated.

"A professional perspective on legal rules integrates both theory and practice. Students are introduced to acting in the lawyers' and judge's roles through specific role-playing techniques that I have incorporated into all of my classes. These techniques permit discussion of ethical dilemmas in the lawyer's role to arise naturally in class.

"The ethical perspective emphasizes the importance of the lawyer's responsibility to the client within the adversary system. Law students tend to think of lawyers as "in charge" and it is important to expose them to the constraints on their autonomy created by a representational relationship. My aim is to introduce students to various other role dilemmas, to the incomplete answers provided by our codes of professional ethics, and hence to their own responsibility to develop their individual moral commitments both in and out of role. Finally, I also address the ethical obligation of the legal profession to provide access to our system of justice.

"The practice of law is challenging precisely because it is constantly working out the tension in the core values of the justice system. Legal education must train students to think competently and critically not only about the content of the law and legal rules, but also about the lawyer's role as a professional, with obligations to others, including the legal system in general, beyond self-interest. In law teaching, it is easy to focus almost exclusively on content, but to do so would be to fail in our own professional responsibility."

==Publications==

Swift's recent and forthcoming publications include "One Hundred Years of Evidence Law Reform: Thayer's Triumph" in the California Law Review (2000); "Rival Claims to 'Truth'" in Hastings Law Journal (1998); and Evidence: Text, Problems and Cases, 2nd ed. (with Allen and Kuhns, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/facultyProfile.php?facID=115 Faculty Profiles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14585">'''Environmental peacebuilding''' examines and advocates environmental protection and cooperation as a factor in peaceful relations. Peacebuilding is both the theory and practice of identifying the conditions that can lead to a sustainable peace between those who have previously been adversaries, and assisting adversaries to move towards a sustainable peace. In the Middle East, common environmental challenges have been identified as a basis for regional cooperation and peacebuilding.  A small Middle Eastern civil society network reaches across adversarial boundaries to promote and practice environmental cooperation.

==Peacebuilding==

The study of [[peacebuilding]] (a term coined by Galtung, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. 1975.  "Three approaches to peace: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding." In Peace, War and Defence - Essays in Peace Research Vol. 2, 282-304. Copenhagen:  Christian Ejlers.&lt;/ref&gt; develops from interest in identifying the conditions that lead beyond a temporary cessation of violence to sustainable processes of conflict management and mutual cooperation between those who have previously been adversaries.  Lederach&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, John Paul.  Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press) 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly cited, and his work has influenced national aid and development agencies, international agencies, and the network of NGOs that have placed peacebuilding on their agendas.  

Beginning with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali promoting An Agenda for Peace in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;UN Secretary-General. 1992. "An Agenda for peace: preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping." UN Doc. A/47/277. June 17.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations adopted the language of peacebuilding and developed programs based on it.  Initiatives promoting human security and human rights share a similar concern with developing an international system that promotes the underlying conditions for the movement towards a peaceful world.

==Environmental peacebuilding==

Within the field of peacebuilding studies and practice, there is a sub-literature on environmental peacebuilding that examines the role of environmental factors in moving towards a sustainable peace.  At the most basic level, warfare devastates ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on natural resources, and the anarchy of conflict situations leads to the uncontrolled, destructive exploitation of natural resources.  Preventing these impacts allows for an easier movement to a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2008|title=Challenges and opportunities of human conflict and environmental transformation in Ecuadorian highlands|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44201034_Challenges_and_opportunities_of_human_conflict_and_environmental_transformation_in_Ecuadorian_highlands|journal=Pirineos|volume=163|pages=63-75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a more positive perspective, environmental cooperation can be one of the places where hostile parties can sustain a dialogue, and sustainable development is a prerequisite for a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;Carius, A. (2006). Environmental Peacebuilding: Cooperation as an Instrument of Crisis Prevention and Peacebuilding: Conditions for Success and Constraints. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle, S. (Editor). (2009). From Conflict to Peacebuilding: The Role of Natural Resources and Environment. United Nations Environment Programme. Nairobi: Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conca and Wallace&lt;ref&gt;Conca, K., &amp; Wallace, J. (2009). Environment and Peacebuilding in War-torn Societies: Lessons from the UN Environment Programme's Experience with Postconflict Assessment. Global Governance, 15, 4, pp. 185-105.&lt;/ref&gt; note the relationship between environmental peacebuilding projects and studies of environment and conflict.  They observe that environmental challenges may be opportunities for peacebuilding, but they may also harden differences and reinforce conflict.  Environmental challenges are also usually complexly interconnected to economic and governance challenges.  Environmental issues are now routinely acknowledged as aspects of conflicts, and are necessarily part of the movement towards conflict management and the transformation of conflictual relations into peaceful ones.  

The United Nations Environment Programme has placed environmental conflict and cooperation on its agenda,&lt;ref&gt;UNEP. (2004). Understanding Environment, Conflict, and Cooperation. Nairobi: Kenya.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted environmental assessments of conflict zones and has recommended&lt;ref&gt;Halle, S. (Editor). (2009).

Governmental and civil society organizations have also explored the role of environmental issues in peacebuilding.  The EU sponsored [http://www.initiativeforpeacebuilding.eu/index.php Initiative for Peacebuilding ] has produced a series of [http://www.initiativeforpeacebuilding.eu/publications/index.php?c=2 papers on environmental peacebuilding.] The International Crisis Group includes [http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/key-issues/climate-change-and-conflict.aspx Climate Change and Conflict] as one of its key areas.  In conflict settings, civil society groups have promoted environmental peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Obi, Cyril I. 2005. Environmental Movements in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Political Ecology of Power and Conflict.  UNRISD Programme on Civil Society and Social Movements, Paper Number 15, January.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==

The 1991 Madrid Conference, co-sponsored by the United States and the USSR, brought together representatives of the governments of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, and a Palestinian delegation within the Jordanian delegation.  The conference established working groups on refugees, regional security, economic development, water, and environment.  The working groups on water and environment, and to some extent the one on economic development as well, had the agenda of bringing environmental cooperation and sustainable development into the formulation of a path to a sustainable 
Middle East peace.    

The subsequent Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Peace treaty between Jordan and Israel each had sections that envisioned joint committees on water, environmental cooperation and economic development.  When negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority stalled and relations again became strongly adversarial, progress towards cooperation on water, the environment and sustainable development also stalled.  At the formal level there are contacts across adversarial lines between government officials and experts, water infrastructure was kept out of the violence of the Second Intifadah, and there is some degree of cooperation – not widely publicized - on urgent water and environmental concerns.  Cooperative relations between Jordan and Israel have been maintained but progress is limited by the effects of the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  

Diplomatic work on environmental peacebuilding in the region has been supplemented by the development of a small network of civil society organizations that promote and practice regional environmental cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Stuart.  2010.  "Environment and Human Security in the Eastern Mediterranean: Regional Environmentalism in the Reframing of Palestinian-Israeli-Jordanian Relations" in P. H. Liotta, David Mouat, Judith Lancaster, Bill Kepner and David Smith, eds. Achieving Environmental Security: Ecosystem Services and Human Welfare. Amsterdam: IOS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, A. (2008). Regional Water Cooperation and Peacebuilding in the Middle East.  Adelphi Research, Initiative For Peace.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==
===Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information===
[[Israel/Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information|IPCRI]] opened in 1989 during the first Intifada under joint Israeli and Palestinian directors.  IPCRI established the Water and Environment division in 1992.  A 1993 edited book presented Palestinian and Israeli perspectives on water cooperation.  Three IPCRI workshops held between 1994-6 on "Our Shared Environment" were followed by three volumes of papers from the workshops.  The IPCRI Water and Environment division took the lead in organizing a 2004 Israeli-Palestinian International "Water for Life" Conference, co-chaired by Israeli and Palestinian professors, held in Turkey, where over five days about 130 participants from the region were joined by about 50 international water experts. 

Subsequently, working with Israeli and Palestinian experts, IPCRI undertook a study of the management of the [[trans-boundary river|trans-boundary]] Nahal Alexander / Wadi Zomer basin.  IPCRI is a partner in the "GLOWA Jordan River" study of the impact of climate change on the Jordan basin, and has undertaken, with the support of the Government of Japan, work designed to provide a model for low cost sanitation to a West Bank village.

===EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East===
[[Friends of the Earth Middle East|EcoPeace / FoEME]] was founded in 1994 as a meeting place for Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Israeli environmental NGOs and became an affiliate of Friends of the Earth in 1998.  FOEME has a wide range of projects – organized around particular geographic areas (the Jordan River valley, the Dead Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba / Eilat), water (Good Water Neighbors, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Conduit, the mountain aquifer, "water, peace and the environment," water privatization), and environmental policy (sustainable development, climate change, "violent conflicts and the environment," trade and environment, solar power and healthy food).  FoEME has promoted protection rather than development of the Dead Sea and its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, advocated the establishment of a "peace park" along the Jordan River, and vigorously questioned the proposed mega-project to channel water from the Read Sea to the Dead Sea.  

Since 2001 the FoEME Good Water Neighbors project has been working with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian communities that are mutually dependent on shared water resources.  Each community is partnered with a neighboring community.  Good Water Neighbors works with local community members on water education, awareness and development.  GWN uses dependence on shared water sources as a basis for dialogue and cooperation between partnered communities.

FoEME has published its own study of environmental peacebuilding,&lt;ref&gt;Harari, N., &amp; Roseman, J. (2008).  Environmental Peacebuilding Theory and Practice: A Case Study of the Good Water Neighbours Project and In Depth Analysis of the Wadi Fukin / Tzur Hadassah Communities. EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt; and circulates a monthly "environmental peacemaking" listserv.

===Arava Institute for Environmental Studies===
The [[Arava Institute for Environmental Studies|institute]] opened in the 1996-7 academic year.  For one or two semesters students from Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt and overseas live and study together on Kibbutz Ketura (in a remote part of the Negev desert south of the West Bank and just across the valley from Jordan) and receive university credit.&lt;ref&gt;Alleson, Ilan and Stuart Schoenfeld.  2007. 	"Environmental Justice and Peacebuilding in the Middle East," Peace Review 19:371-379.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrolment, which is capped at 45, has varied.  From 1996 to 2010, about 600 students have studied at the institute.  University credit is now received through Ben Gurion University, and the institute co-sponsors a Master's program with Ben Gurion, in which some of its alumni have studied.

The alumni division maintains active Yahoo and Facebook "groups."  Alumni involvement is supplemented by  the Arava Alumni Peace and Environment Network (AAPEN) which held its first meeting in Aqaba in 2005 and has held subsequent meetings and other activities.  The institute has also developed as a research center.  The institute participates in projects as partners with Palestinian and Jordanian researchers and research organizations.  These projects have included developing a center for sustainable agriculture, developing policy options for the Dead Sea, transboundary stream restoration, and a study of health effects from exposure to airborne particles.  These projects involve links to international networks of research funding, and have brought regional conferences to the institute on a regular basis.   The institute has co-sponsored a conference on alternative energy and the supported the development of the solar power oriented Arava Power Corporation.

'''Fania Esiah Mindell'''  (December 15, 1894{{snds}}July 18, 1969) was an American feminist, activist, and theater artist.

== Life and career ==

Mindell was born in Minsk, Russia on December 15, 1894. She emigrated to Brooklyn, New York in 1906 with her parents and family, and became a US citizen in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Passport Applications, 1795–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; She was an accomplished artist, and became a set and costume designer for Broadway theaters  in New York.&lt;ref&gt;“Who is Fania Mindell?”. New York Times,  Sunday, January 11, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; She translated dramatic materials from Russian to English including her version of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s play, "Night Lodging", which was performed at the Plymouth Theater in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Gorky, Maksim, Transl. by Fania Mindell. Night Lodging. 1919. Print. [196 pages].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.A. Sulveritsky, Transl. by Fania Mindell. "A Tchehov Note." The New Republic ,  30.388 (May 22, 1922): pp 312-313.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward G. Robinson]] was among the performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=6746|title=Night Lodging - IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information|author=The Broadway League|date=|work=ibdb.com|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fania was also the proprietor of Little Russia, a small boutique in Greenwich Village, just off Washington Square which featured curios from Russia, but her true passion was for feminist and progressive causes.&lt;ref&gt;Little book of Greenwich Village : a handbook of information concerning New York's Bohemia, with which is incorporated a map and directory. (1918).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fania Mindell. “Machine Millinery,” International Socialist Review 16.3 (9/15): 173-174. (Organized millinery workers in Chicago).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young political activist in 1916 she met the now famous feminist [[Margaret Sanger]] and her sister [[Ethel Byrne]]. Together, the three women opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in Brooklyn known as the "Brownsville Clinic" (after the Brownsville section of Brooklyn in which it was located).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sullivan |first1=Taylor |title=Brownsville Clinic |url=https://sangerpapers.wordpress.com/tag/brownsville-clinic/ |website=Margaret Sanger Papers Project |publisher=New York University |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic caused an immediate sensation in the press, getting national attention, and all three women were arrested and tried for "distributing obscene materials".

"The police monitored the Clinic from its opening and sent in a female undercover agent to purchase contraceptive supplies. On October 26 (1916) an undercover police woman and vice-squad officers raided the clinic, confiscated an assortment of contraceptives from [[Pessary|pessaries]] to [[condoms]], along with 20 'books on young women', and arrested Sanger, Byrne and Mindell. After being arraigned, Sanger and Mindell spent the night in the Raymond Street jail, Byrne at the Liberty Avenue station. All were released the next morning on $500.00 bail." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/ Margaret Sanger Papers Project, NYU].&lt;/ref&gt;

All three women were found guilty, but eventually the verdicts were overturned, and their campaign was ultimately successful, leading to major changes in social policy and to the laws governing birth control and sex education around the world.&lt;ref&gt;“Mrs Sanger Gets 30 Days.” Washington Post, February 7, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Sanger's Aide Is Found Guilty". New York Times, January 9, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic closed but later became the basis for what was to become known as [[Planned Parenthood]].

On December 3, 1929 Fania married [[Ralph Roeder|Ralph Edmund LeClercq Roeder]], a scholar, historian, and author who shared her interest in drama and theater, and in leftist causes.&lt;ref&gt;New York, New York, Marriage Indexes 1866–1937.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple traveled extensively- in Europe, the Caribbean, and Haiti in the 1930s- but seem to have fallen in love with Mexico by the 1940s. Fania's brother, Jacob "Pop" Mindel, a dentist by profession, was a [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] member who was later prosecuted and jailed under the [[Smith Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"Bail of 13 Reds Revoked; Hunt Begun."  Stars and Stripes: January 13, 1955. p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter: "[[Bertrand Russell]] Urges Parole for Jacob Mindel." The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell Volume 29: Détente or Destruction 1955–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother's views and her association with leftist causes may have influenced the Roeder's decision to move to Mexico by the 1950s when [[McCarthyism]] was prevalent in the United States.  During this period many political activists, artists and intellectuals from the United States sought refuge in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Anhalt, Diana. (2001). A Gathering of Fugitives: American Political Expatriates in Mexico, 1948–1965. Santa Maria, CA: Archer Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fania and her husband spent much of their later lives there as expatriates in Mexico City where  Ralph studied and authored a number of books including a seminal biography of [[Benito Juárez]] for which he was honored with Mexico's highest literary award, the [[Orden del Águila Azteca]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Obituary: February 21, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fania and her husband both died in Mexico City in 1969{{snds}}Fania on July 18 and her husband in October. Both are buried there in the city's ''[[Panteón de Dolores]]''.&lt;ref name="FG"&gt;{{Find a Grave| grid= 126585497| name= Fania Esiah Mindell| work= American Feminist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florence Adelaide Fowle Adams''' (October 15, 1863 – July 31, 1916) was a dramatic reader, actor, author, and teacher.

==Biography==
She was born Florence Adelaide Fowle in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], the only child of the artist Edward Augustus Fowle.&lt;ref name=operaglass/&gt; She attended the Chelsea public school, the [[Boston Latin Academy|Girls' Latin School]] in Boston, and the [[Boston School of Oratory]], from which she graduated in 1884.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt; 

Fowle joined the faculty of the Boston School of Oratory, where she taught the Delsarte method of dramatic expression developed by the teacher [[François Delsarte]]. Feeling the lack of a textbook for beginning students that clearly set forth the principles of the Delsarte method, she published her own book on the Delsarte method, ''Gestures and Pantomimic Action'' (1891), using herself as the model for the volume's many illustrations.&lt;ref name=willard/&gt;

She occasionally appeared on stage in dramatic roles; for example, as Julie de Mortemar in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s play ''[[Richelieu (play)|Richelieu]]''.&lt;ref name=operaglass/&gt; She also organized her own company of young women for staging [[tableaux vivants]], the Boston Ideal Tableaux Company.&lt;ref name=operaglass/&gt;

'''Friedrich Rehberg''' (22 October 1758 - 20 August 1835) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Portrait painting|portrait]] and [[History painting|historical]] painter.&lt;ref name="bryan"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bryansdiction04brya#page/206/mode/1up Friedrich Rehberg] in Bryan's "Bryan's dictionary of painters and engravers" (New York : Macmillan, 1903) p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Rehberg was born into a middle-class [[protestant]] family in [[Hanover]] in 1758, the son of a secretary for the estates of [[Calenberg]] (one of the duchies of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hannover]]). His elder brother, [[August Wilhelm Rehberg]] (1757–1836), became a notable politician, philosopher and writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:August Wilhelm Rehberg|August Wilhelm Rehberg]], 25 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich, himself, studied first with [[Adam Friedrich Oeser|Oeser]] in [[Leipzig]], then with [[Giovanni Battista Casanova]] and [[Johann Eleazar Zeissig]], in [[Dresden]]. In 1777, he went to [[Rome]], where he studied the [[Old Master]]s, such as [[Annibale Carracci|Caracci]], [[Domenichino]] and [[Michelangelo]], under [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]. Here he became a close friend of fellow-painter [[Jacques-Louis David|David]].&lt;ref name="bryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andresen"&gt;Andresen and Wessely, 1866, pp. 61-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1783 he returned to Hanover, where his reputation was now well-established, and received many commissions to paint portraits, including those of the Duke Wilhelm and the Bishop of Osnabrück. In 1784 he became drawing master at the [[Philanthropinum]], a progressive school in [[Dessau]] where he taught art to the crown prince, [[Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Frederick]]. In 1786, he was made a fellow at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] in Berlin, becoming professor in 1787. He then returned to Rome to manage the satellite Prussian art academy which was to be built there. For political reasons, this project never materialised but Rehberg remained in the city. There he painted "Belisarius",&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Date_Obolum_Belisario_%28Engraving%29 Belisarius] (The Jefferson Encyclopedia).&lt;/ref&gt; "Oedipus and Antigone", "The Death of Abel", "Bacchus", "Orpheus and Eurydice" and "Jupiter and Venus".&lt;ref name="bryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andresen" /&gt;

In 1791 he went to [[Naples]] and made a series of drawings of [[Lady Hamilton]] posing as classical [[statuary]], which were published in book form in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;The full title of this work was, "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qZ8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Drawings faithfully copied from Nature at Naples] and, with permission, dedicated to the Right Honorable Sir William Hamilton, his Brittanic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and plenipotentiary at the court of Naples''" (1794).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813 he went to London, and, in 1814, painted an allegory of Napoleon's fall. In the same year he returned for a time to Rome, but eventually settled at [[Munich]], where he published, in 1824, "''Raffael Sanzio von Urbino": the Elements of Lithographic Drawing''" ("Anfangs gründe des Steinzeichners'), with thirteen of his own lithographs.&lt;ref name="bryan" /&gt;

Rehberg died in Munich on the 20 August 1835.&lt;ref name="bryan" /&gt;

'''Glenn John McQueen''' (December 24, 1960 – October 29, 2002) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] supervisor of digital animation and supervising character animator at [[Pixar]] and [[Pacific Data Images|PDI]].

== Personal life ==
McQueen graduated from [[Sheridan College]] in 1985. He was sent by Sheridan on a scholarship to the [[New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab]], where he worked as head of the 3-D production department, which made film effects, TV commercials and scientific visuals.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1994 he moved to [[Pixar Animation Studios]] (partly due to his interest in ''[[Toy Story]]'' and his respect for [[John Lasseter]]), where he supervised the animation on Pixar's early successes, including ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' and ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plume|first=Kenneth|title=Interview with Glenn McQueen|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/10/interview-with-pixar-animator-glenn-mcqueen-conclusion|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2000-02-10|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

McQueen also served as a member of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] in [[Hollywood]]. He and his wife, Terry, had a daughter.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/19/local/me-passings19.2 Obituary], latimes.com, November 19, 2002; accessed September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On October 29, 2002, McQueen died from [[melanoma]] in [[Berkeley, California]], at the age of 41. His death occurred during the production of ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', which is dedicated to him. His former colleagues also paid homage by naming the main character in the film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' "[[Lightning McQueen]]".&lt;ref name="Remembering"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rizvi|first=Samad|title=Remembering Glenn McQueen, 1960-2002|url=http://pixartimes.com/2010/12/24/remembering-glenn-mcqueen-1960-2002/|publisher=Pixar Times|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nusair|first=David|title=5 Things You Didn't Know About the Cars Series|url=http://movies.about.com/od/cars2/tp/cars-trivia.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cars Easter Egg - Tribute to Dead Animator|url=http://www.eeggs.com/items/45652.html|publisher=husband and wife team of David and Annette Wolf|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
McQueen has admirers all over the world for his work, and has been hailed as one of the best animators in the field. Pixar co-founder [[John Lasseter]] called McQueen "the heart and soul of our animation department", and also said that "Glenn is not gone from us. He’s still alive in all of us."&lt;ref name="Remembering"/&gt;

Pixar Animation Studios had plans underway to open a new studio in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, which would be named the [[Pixar Canada|Glenn McQueen Pixar Animation Center]] to honor McQueen. It was planned to be around {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}} and be located in the downtown area of Vancouver.  The studio focused on producing short films and TV episodes based on Pixar characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Pixar+open+Vancouver+studio/1574458/story.html|title=Pixar to open Vancouver studio|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420005139/http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Pixar+open+Vancouver+studio/1574458/story.html|author=Marke Andrews|date=2009-05-08|archivedate=2010-04-20|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job qualifications were released in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiananimationresources.ca/?p=771|title=Jobby: Production Manager, Layout Artist, Pixar Vancouver!|author=Mike Valiquette|date=2009-11-15|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the studio opened in spring 2010, producing many [[film short|shorts]] including ''[[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]'' (2011) and ''[[Partysaurus Rex]]'' (2012).

In October 2013, the studio was closed down in order to re-focus Pixar's efforts at its main headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pixar Canada shuts its doors in Vancouver|url=http://blogs.theprovince.com/2013/10/08/pixar-canada-shuts-its-doors-in-vancouver/|newspaper=[[The Province]]|accessdate=June 20, 2014|date=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independent Schools’ Bursars Association''' originated as the Public Schools Bursars' Association. The first general meeting was held on 26 April 1932 at [[Epsom College]].&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc"&gt;{{Cite web | title=The Association | publisher=ISBA | url=http://www.theisba.org.uk/association.asp  | accessdate=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization changed its name to "Independent Schools' Bursars Association" in 1983.&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc" /&gt; The Association is a [[registered charity]]; its stated object is "the advancement of [[education]] by the promotion of efficient and effective administration and ancillary services at [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]]s."&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc" /&gt; The Association provides support for [[bursar]]s in independent schools and promotes good practices. Individual schools are members of the association; most schools select their [[bursar]] as the representative to the Association.&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc" /&gt;

There are nearly 900 [[United Kingdom|UK]] members in addition to about 30 overseas Associate Members.&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc" /&gt; ISBA is one of the seven constituent members of the [[Independent Schools Council]] (ISC). The Association is represented on the ISC Governing Council and on some of the ISC Committees.&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc" /&gt;

==Structure==
The ISBA has an Executive Committee. The EC members are elected for two years, and may be re-elected for a second term of two years. After a serving a second term, a member will leave the Committee unless the member is elected either Vice Chairman or Chairman. The Chairman and Vice Chairman are elected annually (at the General Meeting). No person may hold the office of  Chairman and Vice Chairman for more than three years. The Executive Committee has 10 members in addition to the Chairman and Vice Chairman. The Chairman of the Scottish Bursars’ Association is an [[ex officio]] member of the Committee, representing [[Schools in Scotland|Scottish schools]].&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc" /&gt;

There are more than 20 autonomous groups within the Association. These are organized on a regional basis or by type of school. The Autonomous Groups are self organizing and arrange meetings, usually once per school term. The Association [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]] generally attends these meetings.&lt;ref name="ISBA_Desc" /&gt;

'''International Children's Book Day''' ('''ICBD''') is a yearly event sponsored by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] (IBBY), an international non-profit organization. Founded in 1967, the day is observed on or around [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s birthday, April 2. Activities include writing competitions, announcements of book awards and events with authors of [[children's literature]].

Each year a different National Section of IBBY has the opportunity to be the international sponsor of ICBD. It decides upon a theme and invites a prominent author from the host country to write a message to the children of the world and a well-known illustrator to design a poster. These materials are used in different ways to promote books and reading. Many IBBY Sections promote ICBD through the media and organize activities in schools and public libraries. Often ICBD is linked to celebrations around children's books and other special events that may include encounters with authors and illustrators, writing competitions or announcements of book awards.

The '''International Workshop on Balto-Slavic Accentology''' (abbreviated '''IWoBA''') is an annual international conference on comparative and historical [[Balto-Slavic]] [[accentology]], including the prehistory and history of the separate [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages, as well as synchronic and dialectal issues that have to do with accentology.

The first conference was held in Zagreb 1–3 July 2005 with contributions by some of the world's foremost Balto-Slavists, Baltologists and Slavists, organized by the Croatian linguists [[Ranko Matasović]] and [[Mate Kapović]]. It proved to be an immense success and was thus followed by annually held IWoBA conferences.

'''King Schools, Inc.''' is an American [[computer]] [[software]] company headquartered in [[San Diego, California]], USA.  The company focuses on the creation of [[Computer Based Training]] (CBT) or [[E-learning]], to assist individuals in obtaining all levels of [[Pilot certification in the United States]].  Over the years, the company has expanded its training courses to cover the various [[pilot certificates]], ratings and educational requirements, along with many aeronautical elective studies.  More recently, it has begun offering all of its courses in [[Web-based training]] (WBT) and mobile device formats.

King Schools was founded in 1975 by John and Martha King, husband and wife.  As [[Certified flight instructor|Certificated Flight Instructors]], the Kings first began as a traveling ground school, offering two-day courses in various cities.  A little more than a decade later, they began producing training videos that other flight instructors could incorporate into their own curriculum.  Eventually, demand for their videos by individuals learning to fly led to the development of courses that could be used for self-paced study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0305003 |title=Martha and John King: Practical Risk Management for Pilots |date=May 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707102454/http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0305003 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2010, King Schools has over 70 employees and operates exclusively from an {{convert|18000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility near [[Montgomery Field]].&lt;ref name="aboutking"/&gt;  Course development, production, customer service and shipping all occur at this location.  Course videos are filmed either in the in-house digital studio or at nearby Montgomery Field.

John and Martha King are two of the most recognized experts in flight instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstflightcentennial.org/100_Aviation_Heroes.html  | title = First Flight Foundation 100 Heroes of Aviation  | date = 2003-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?ContentBlockID=d4a19d2b-7eef-4f1a-aee1-712bf0384417&amp;Dynamic=1&amp;Range=WEEK&amp;FromDate=07/26/2007&amp;ToDate=08/02/2007&amp;Category=/index.cfm  | title = Aero-News.Net: Oshkosh Memories...

The company claims that more than half of all pilots in the United States have studied using one of their courses.  Of the courses they offer, the [[Private Pilot]] Knowledge Test Course is likely the most used, supporting [[FAA]] Part 61 ground schools.  Among the approximately 90 other courses offered, topics covered include Private Pilot, Instrument Pilot, Commercial Pilot, International Operations and risk management.  King Schools also produces the [[Cessna]]-branded courses used by Cessna Pilot Centers, which are Part 141 ground schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flyingmag.com/pilot-technique/new-pilots/pilot-command-new-cessna-pilot-course  | title = Pilot in Command: The New Cessna Pilot Course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* In 1975, King Schools, Inc. was started by John and Martha King as a touring 2-day ground school.
* In 1989, King Schools moves to its current facility in [[San Diego, California]], near [[Montgomery Field]]
* In 1999, King Schools produces the flight training videos for [[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000]], featuring John and Martha King providing personal instruction for virtual pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1999/11-01flight.mspx  | title = Flight Simulator 2000 Reaches New Heights | date = 1999-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, John and Martha King were inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-57864-397-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flying Risk Awareness Advocacy==
In March 2001, [[Flying (magazine)|Flying Magazine]] published an interview with John King titled "John King's Crusade to Change Aviation's Culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Lane|title=Battling the "Big Lie": John King's Crusade to Change Aviation's Culture|url=http://www.kingschools.com/news/BigLie.htm|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the article, John openly charged the General Aviation industry with mischaracterizing that light aircraft could be considered safe.  He argued that General Aviation pilots were insufficiently trained to recognize and address flight hazards.  King Schools later joined efforts with Avemco Insurance to produce a training video to do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avemco.com/Articles/OnApproach2004.pdf  | title = Avemco and King Schools: Risk Management, One Year Later | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, this led to the first in a series of training videos marketed by King Schools as a "Practical Risk Management" course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avweb.com/news/reviews/184109-1.html  | title = Surviving the Flight - Review of Practical Risk Management for Pilots | date = 2003-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning for Life''' ('''LFL''') is a United States [[school]] and work-site based [[youth program]] that is an affiliate of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].  It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem, and for careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learning-for-life.org/ |title=Learning for Life&amp;nbsp;— Exploring |accessdate=January 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning for Life is not considered a traditional [[Scouting]] program; it does not use the [[Scout Oath|Scout Promise]], [[Scout Law]], uniforms or insignia of traditional Scouting.  All Learning for Life programs are open to youth and adults without restriction based on gender, residence, religion, sexual orientation, or other considerations, other than minimum age requirements.  Exploring posts require background checks for adults over 18 years old as a condition of membership.

==Programs==
===School based programs===

Learning for Life is a series of school-based programs for use by schools and educational organizations in the areas of character education, life skills, building self-esteem, and developing ethical decision-making skills.

The participant program categories, each with its own Learning for Life curriculum developed by the national office, consists of programs covering pre-kindergarten through Grade 12:
* [[Pre-kindergarten|Pre-K]]
* [[Kindergarten]]
* [[First grade]]
* [[Second grade]]
* [[Third grade]]
* [[Fourth grade]]
* [[Fifth grade]]
* [[Sixth grade]]
* [[Seventh grade]]
* [[Eighth grade]]
* [[High school]] - Personal Compass
* High school - Roadmap for the Future
* High school - Leadership Development

Curriculum used for these programs is based on lesson plans developed over the years by teachers and school volunteers.  It was originally modeled on lesson plans adapted from Scouting meeting plans, but has been revised substantially so that it currently has little resemblance to Scout meetings.

Learning for Life programs emphasize the need to reinforce self-esteem and recognize student achievement and participation through recognition programs.  Most of the Learning for Life programs include the use of wall charts, recognition stickers, iron-on emblems, and certificates produced by the national Learning for Life office.

There are also recognitions for schools, principals, teachers, and volunteers who successfully implement the programs.  Local councils may recognize outstanding adults with the Golden Apple Award.

[[Exploring (Learning for Life)|Exploring]] is the worksite-based program of Learning for Life, and focuses on involving teenagers in clubs, called posts, that allow young people to learn about possible careers, form friendships, develop leadership skills, and enjoy activities with like-minded teens and adults.  Exploring clubs are open to young men and women who are at least 10 years old or in grades 6-8 but not yet 15 years old. Exploring posts are open to young men and women who are 15 to 20 years old.  Teens who are 14 and have graduated from eighth grade are also eligible to join an Exploring post.  All Explorers are under the supervision of adults who serve as Post Advisors of Club Sponsors.  The Explorers elect their own peer leaders to serve as officers, subject to the approval of the adult advisors and sponsors.

Exploring's purpose is to provide experiences that help young people mature and to prepare them to become responsible and caring adults. The result is a program of activities that helps youth pursue their special interests, grow, and develop.

Typical Exploring programs include groups of teenagers specializing in a field such as [[Law Enforcement Exploring|law enforcement]], [[Fire Service Exploring|fire and emergency service]], [[Health Career Exploring|health careers]], [[engineering]], [[aviation]], [[skilled trades]], and [[technology]].  Exploring posts or clubs do not wear an official uniform. Any uniform worn is related to the type of career on which the post or club is focused. For example, youth in law enforcement Exploring posts and clubs wear a modified law enforcement uniform, similar to the uniform a police officer would wear. Many posts and clubs do not wear a specific uniform if the career field does not have a standard uniform.

Some Exploring posts gather together for national Exploring conferences and regional activities, sometimes called academies or musters.  The law Explorers had an annual National Explorer Mock Trial Competition for many years but the competition has not been held since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.learningforlife.org/exploring/lawandgovt/index.html|title=Exploring|website=resources.learningforlife.org|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some BSA councils host activities at which local Exploring posts and clubs participate.

The National Learning for Life office administers college scholarships for eligible Explorers, based on written applications.  The office also creates a number of recognitions presented by local councils for Exploring adult volunteers and community organizations, the most prestigious of which is the William H. Spurgeon III Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploring.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/William-H.-Spurgeon-III-Award.pdf|title=William H. Spurgeon Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Exploring|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Learning for Life office also promotes the [[Young American Award]] which recognizes outstanding young women and young men who excel in academics, sports and hobbies, community life, and civic service. These awards (which include a scholarship) are presented at the annual meeting of the BSA National Council.

==History==
[[File:Exploring (Big E 1998).svg|100px|thumb|Exploring&lt;br /&gt;"Big E" logo]]
During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, over 40 BSA councils organized innovative, non-traditional programs called In-School Scouting.  These units were in public schools (usually in low-income neighborhoods), where the schools invited the BSA and other partner organizations such as the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] and [[Camp Fire USA]] to provide Scouting programs as part of the school curriculum, usually for an hour a week during a daytime elective period.  There were some critics who complained that these programs were innovative to the point of not being "real Scouting," and there were occasionally difficulties in maintaining partnerships between these youth-serving agencies in delivering school programs to both boys and girls.  This led the BSA to explore options regarding delivery of youth programs in public school settings, and a two-year effort including grass-roots task forces led to the development of Learning for Life, including its name.

The Learning for Life affiliate was launched in 1991 as a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization from the BSA to continue serving youth through public schools and educational organizations with specially developed curriculum separate from traditional Scouting, and with distinctive programs that no longer used traditional Scouting methods like the [[Scout Promise|Scout Oath]] and [[Scout Law]].  Participants in Learning for Life programs would be open to both sexes at all program levels (unlike [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)]] and Boy Scouting), which allows the BSA to provide in-school programs if the traditional girls' agencies are not able or willing to do so.  All existing programs called In-School Scouting, as well as the large number of Career Awareness Exploring posts (where youth participation consisted primarily of career seminars during school hours) were rolled into Learning for Life.  This had the immediate effect of dropping the membership totals of the BSA, but had no significant effect on the total numbers of youth served by the BSA when combining membership totals of traditional Scouting with the youth served totals of Learning for Life.

When a number of government agencies and community leaders began to seriously question the appropriateness of those agencies continuing to charter Exploring posts, BSA decided to reorganize the structure of Exploring programs.  The decision was made in 1998 to separate work-based Exploring programs from those that were primarily focused on traditional BSA programming, hobbies, outdoors, and sports.  The work-based Exploring posts and their membership were transferred to the Learning for Life affiliate, and the posts that were traditional to hobbies, outdoors, and sports were renamed [[Venturing (Boy Scouts of America)|Venturing]] crews and [[Sea Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Sea Scout]] ships, and remained as part of the traditional BSA organization.  Both posts and crews continue to serve the same age-groups of young women and men ages 15–20, but over the years, the terminology and methods of the Exploring and Venturing programs have evolved in separate directions, with Exploring continuing in a very non-traditional direction.

Almost every one of the 264 BSA Councils has at least one Exploring post, and about 90 have Learning for Life programs that are school-based groups.  These groups and posts have youth who are described as participants and members of Learning for Life, but are not members of the BSA nor subject to membership restrictions such as faith requirements, other than minimum age requirements.  The health and safety policies of Learning for Life are very similar to those used with BSA programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploring.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LFL-safety-first-guidelines-3.21.17.pdf|title=Safety First Guidelines|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Non-profit status and funding===
Although the national Boy Scouts of America organized Learning For Life as an independent affiliate of their own organization, in the local Boy Scouts of America councils the Learning for Life program does not have a separate [[501(c)]]3 non-profit status.  This occasionally leads to difficulties with grant-making agencies that do not desire to indirectly support the BSA due to its policies (see [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=United Way pulls funding for Philly-area Boy Scouts |pages=22 |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 3, 2003 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BJoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hHADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5097,182957 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Learning for Life Foundation exists so that local councils can apply for grants or funding from organizations or corporations that do not allow discrimination of any type. Councils work with the National Learning for Life Service Center to apply through the LFL Foundation and when funds are received, 100% of them are sent to the local council for use specifically with LFL/Exploring programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploring.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Workforce-Development-Funding-Campaign_Final_11.7.16.pdf|title=Workforce Development Fund Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
Nationally, Learning For Life is an affiliate of the Boy Scouts of America's umbrella. The Learning for Life organization consists of a leadership team of national Learning for Life volunteers, including specialized committees for the various Exploring programs, and supported by seasoned senior executive professionals. These committees and professionals develop the curriculum and national programs for Learning for Life, and advise and provide support to the Learning for Life field offices across the United States and overseas.

Within local BSA councils, Learning for Life groups are supported through special committees of Learning for Life volunteers. The day-to-day support of Learning for Life and Exploring programs is provided by the council through one or more certified executives, either full-time Learning for Life professionals or equally often, through BSA commissioned professionals. These professionals, whether certified Learning for Life executives or BSA commissioned executives, are employees of the local BSA council.

===Local Learning for Life Marketing and Promotions===
Learning for Life on a council level may have its own version of a Key 3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Bryan Wendell |title= What is the Key 3? |url= https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2015/08/19/what-is-the-key-3/ |access-date= 2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (chair, vice chair and program executive), and in those cases will be responsible for creating its own subcommittees (finance, marketing, program, membership).

'''Literacy''' is traditionally defined as the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and [[writing|write]].&lt;ref&gt;"Literate." Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 19 August 2014. &lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literate&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern world, this is one way of interpreting literacy. A more broad interpretation is literacy as knowledge and competence in a specific area.&lt;ref&gt;"Sitwe Benson Mkandwire." Literacy versus Language: Exploring their Similarities and Differences, 2018. The University of Zambia.

The [[Modern history|modern]] term's meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images, computers, and other basic means to understand, communicate, gain useful knowledge, solve mathematical problems and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture.&lt;ref name="Ed for All, UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNESCO|title=Education for All: A Global Monitoring Report|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/GMR2006/full/chapt6_eng.pdf|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of literacy is expanding across [[OECD]] countries to include skills to access knowledge through technology and ability to assess complex contexts.&lt;ref name="Ed for All, UNESCO"/&gt; A person who travels and resides in a foreign country but is unable to read or write in the language of the host country would also be regarded by the locals as illiterate.

The key to literacy is [[reading (process)|reading]] development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading development involves a range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds ([[phonology]]), spelling patterns ([[orthography]]), word meaning ([[semantics]]), grammar ([[syntax]]) and patterns of word formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading [[fluency]] and comprehension.

Once these skills are acquired, the reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Gillis, Ed.D., President, Literacy How, Inc., and Research Affiliate, Haskins Laboratories at Yale University; Sally Grimes, Ed.M., Executive Director, Literate Nation and Founder, Grimes Reading Institute; Cinthia Haan, Author and Chair, The Haan Foundation for Children and President, Power4Kids Reading Initiative; Peggy McCardle, Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Louisa Moats, Ed.D., President, Moats Associates Consulting, Inc.; Anthony Pedriana, Author and retired urban schoolteacher and principal; Susan Smartt, Ph.D., Senior Research Associate, National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality, Vanderbilt University; Catherine Snow,  Ph.D., Author, Researcher and Professor of Education,  Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University; Cheryl Ward, M.S.M., C.A.L.P., Co-founder of Wisconsin Reading Coalition and academic language practitioner; Maryanne Wolf, Ed.D., Author and Director, Center for Reading and Language Research, Tufts University.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/analphabetism|title=analphabetism {{!}} Definition of analphabetism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001362/136246e.pdf|title=The Plurality of Literacy and its implications for Policies and Programs|journal=UNESCO Education Sector Position Paper|year=2004|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistoric literacy===

====Origins of literacy====
Literacy is  emerged with the development of [[numeracy]]  and computational devices as early as 8,000 BCE. Script developed independently at least five times in human history [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indus civilization]], lowland [[Mesoamerica]], and [[China]].&lt;ref name=camb&gt;Chrisomalis, Stephen (2009), "The Origins and Coevolution of Literacy and Numeracy", in Olsen, D. &amp; Torrance, N. (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Literacy'' (pp. 59-74). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Writing Systems |url=http://hkotek.com/teaching/intro2015/week5-writing-systems.pdf |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Bill of sale of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]
The earliest forms of [[Writing|written communication]] originated in [[Serbia]] ([[Vinča culture]]), followed by [[Sumer]], located in southern Mesopotamia about 3500-3000 BCE. During this era, literacy was "a largely functional matter, propelled by the need to manage the new quantities of information and the new type of governance created by trade and large scale production".&lt;ref&gt;Easton, P. (in press). "History and spread of literacy", Excerpted from ''Sustaining Literacy in Africa: Developing a Literate Environment'', Paris: UNESCO Press pp. 46-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing systems in Mesopotamia first emerged from a recording system in which people used impressed token markings to manage trade and agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmandt-Besserat | first1 = D | year = 1978 | title = The earliest precursor of writing | url = | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 238 | issue = 6| pages = 38–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The token system served as a precursor to early [[cuneiform]] writing once people began recording information on clay tablets. [[Cuneiform script|Proto-cuneiform]] texts exhibit not only numerical signs, but also [[ideograms]] depicting objects being counted.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] emerged from 3300-3100 BCE and depicted royal iconography that emphasized power amongst other elites. The Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system was the first notation system to have [[phonetic]] values.

Writing in lowland Mesoamerica was first put into practice by the [[Olmec]] and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] civilizations in 900-400 BCE. These civilizations used [[glyph]]ic writing and bar-and-dot numerical notation systems for purposes related to royal iconography and calendar systems.

The earliest written notations in China date back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] in 1200 BCE. These systematic notations were found inscribed on bones and recorded sacrifices made, tributes received, and animals hunted, which were activities of the elite. These oracle-bone inscriptions were the early ancestors of modern Chinese script and contained [[logosyllabic]] script and numerals.

[[Indus script]] is largely pictorial and has not been deciphered yet. It may or may not include abstract signs. It is thought that they wrote from right to left and that the script is thought to be [[logographic]]. Because it has not been deciphered, linguists disagree on whether it is a complete and independent writing system; however, it is genuinely thought to be an independent writing system that emerged in the [[Harappa]] culture.

These examples indicate that early acts of literacy were closely tied to power and chiefly used for management practices, and probably less than 1% of the population was literate, as it was confined to a very small ruling elite.

====Origins of the alphabet====
According to [[social anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]], there are two interpretations that regard the origin of the alphabet. Many classical scholars, such as historian [[Ignace Gelb]], credit the Ancient Greeks for creating the first alphabetic system (c. 750 BCE) that used distinctive signs for consonants and vowels. But Goody contests, "The importance of Greek culture of the subsequent history of Western Europe has led to an over-emphasis, by [[Classics|classicists]] and others, on the addition of specific [[vowel]] signs to the set of [[consonant]]al ones that had been developed earlier in Western Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-41. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, many scholars argue that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] of northern [[Canaan]] (modern-day [[Syria]]) invented the [[Abjad|consonantal alphabet]] as early as 1500 BCE. Much of this theory's development is credited to English archeologist [[Flinders Petrie]], who, in 1905, came across a series of Canaanite inscriptions located in the turquoise mines of [[Serabit el-Khadem]]. Ten years later, English Egyptologist [[Alan Gardiner]] reasoned that these letters contain an alphabet, as well as references to the Canaanite goddess [[Asherah]]. In 1948, [[William F. Albright]] deciphered the text using additional evidence that had been discovered subsequent to Goody's findings. This included a series of inscriptions from [[Ugarit]], discovered in 1929 by French archaeologist [[Claude F. A. Schaeffer]]. Some of these inscriptions were mythological texts (written in an early Canaanite dialect) that consisted of a 32-letter [[cuneiform]] consonantal alphabet.

Another significant discovery was made in 1953 when three arrowheads were uncovered, each containing identical Canaanite inscriptions from twelfth century BCE. According to [[Frank Moore Cross]], these inscriptions consisted of alphabetic signs that originated during the transitional development from pictographic script to a linear alphabet. Moreover, he asserts, "These inscriptions also provided clues to extend the decipherment of earlier and later alphabetic texts".&lt;ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20"&gt;Cross, Frank Moore, "Newly Found Inscriptions in Old Canaanite and Early Phoenician Scripts", ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', No. 238 (Spring, 1980) p. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consonantal system of the Canaanite script inspired alphabetical developments in subsequent systems. During the Late [[Bronze Age]], successor alphabets appeared throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region and were employed for [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]].

According to Goody, these cuneiform scripts may have influenced the development of the Greek alphabet several centuries later. Historically, the Greeks contended that their writing system was modeled after the Phoenicians. However, many Semitic scholars now believe that [[Ancient Greek]] is more consistent with an early form Canaanite that was used c. 1100 BCE. While the earliest Greek inscriptions are dated c. eighth century BCE, [[Epigraphy|epigraphical]] comparisons to [[Proto-Canaanite]] suggest that the Greeks may have adopted the consonantal alphabet as early as 1100 BCE, and later "added in five characters to represent vowels".&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49"&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-49. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenician, which is considered to contain the first [[list of writing systems|"linear alphabet"]], rapidly spread to the Mediterranean port cities in northern [[Canaan]].&lt;ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20"/&gt; Some archeologists believe that Phoenician scripture had some influence on the developments of the Hebrew and Aramaic alphabets based on the fact that these languages evolved during the same time period, share similar features, and are commonly categorized into the same language group.&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, P. Kyle. "The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 37, No. 3 (Sep. 1974): 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Israelites migrated to Canaan between 1200 and 1001 BCE, they also adopted a variation of the Canaanite alphabet. [[Baruch ben Neriah]], Jeremiah's scribe, used this alphabet to create the later scripts of the [[Old Testament]]. The Early Hebrew alphabet was prominent in the Mediterranean region until [[Neo-Babylonian|Chaldean Babylonian]] rulers exiled the Jews to [[Babylon]] in the sixth century BCE. It was then that the new script ("Square Hebrew") emerged and the older one rapidly died out.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49"/&gt;

The [[Aramaic alphabet]] also emerged sometime between 1200 and 1001 BCE. As the [[Bronze Age collapse]]d, the [[Aramaeans]] moved into Canaan and Phoenician territories and adopted their scripts. Although early evidence of this writing is scarce, archeologists have uncovered a wide range of later Aramaic texts, written as early as the seventh century BCE. Due to its longevity and prevalence in the region, Achaemenid rulers would come to adopt it as a "diplomatic language".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 50. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Aramaic alphabet rapidly spread east to the Kingdom of Nabataea, then to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], eventually making its way to [[Africa]]. Aramaic merchants carried older variations of the language as far as [[India]], where it later influenced the development of [[Brahmi]] scripture. It also led to the developments of [[Arabic]], [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (an Iranian adaptation), "as well as for a range of alphabets used by early Turkish and Mongol tribes in [[Siberia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Turkestan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 49-51. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Literacy at this period spread with the merchant classes and may have grown to number 15-20% of the total population.

The Aramaic language would die out with the spread of [[Islam]] and with it, its influence of Arabic.

===Ancient and post-classical literacy===
{{Further information|Latin alphabet}}
Until recently it was thought that the majority of people were illiterate in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{Cite book |title=Ancient literacy |last=Harris |first=William V. |date=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674033818 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=436359723}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent work challenges this perception.&lt;ref&gt;See Brian J. Wright, "Ancient Literacy in New Testament Research: Incorporating a Few More Lines of Enquiry," TrinJ 36 (2015): 161-189. https://www.academia.edu/13211795/_Ancient_Literacy_in_New_Testament_Research_Incorporating_a_Few_More_Lines_of_Enquiry_TrinJ_36_2015_161-189&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony DiRenzo asserts that [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman society]] was "a civilization based on the book and the register", and "no one, either free or slave, could afford to be illiterate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Di Renzo | first1 = Anthony | year = 2000 | title = His master's voice: Tiro and the rise of the roman secretarial class | url = http://faculty.ithaca.edu/direnzo/docs/scholarship/mastersvoice.pdf| journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.2190/b4yd-5fp7-1w8d-v3uc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Dupont points out, "The written word was all around them, in both public and private life: laws, calendars, regulations at shrines, and funeral epitaphs were engraved in stone or bronze. The Republic amassed huge archives of reports on every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Dupont, Florence. (1989) ''Daily Life in Ancient Rome'' Tr. Christopher Woodall. Oxford: Blackwell; p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial civilian administration produced masses of documentation used in judicial, fiscal and administrative matters as did the municipalities. The army kept extensive records relating to supply and duty rosters and submitted reports. Merchants, shippers, and landowners (and their personal staffs) especially of the larger enterprises must have been literate.    

In the late fourth century the [[Desert Father]] [[Pachomius]] would expect literacy of a candidate for admission to his monasteries:
&lt;blockquote&gt;they shall give him twenty Psalms or two of the Apostles' epistles or some other part of Scripture. And if he is illiterate he shall go at the first, third and sixth hours to someone who can teach and has been appointed for him. He shall stand before him and learn very studiously and with all gratitude. The fundamentals of a syllable, the verbs and nouns shall all be written for him and even if he does not want to he shall be compelled to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pachomius]], Rule 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of the 4th and 5th century the Churches made efforts to ensure a better clergy in particular among the bishops who were expected to have a classical education, which was the hallmark of an socially acceptable person in higher society (and possession of which allayed the fears of the pagan elite that their cultural inheritance would be destroyed). Even after the remnants of the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 470s literacy continued to be a distinguishing mark of the elite as communications skills were still important in political and Church life (bishops were largely drawn from the senatorial class) in a new cultural synthesis that made "Christianity the Roman religion," &lt;ref&gt;Jas Elsner, Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph, 1998, p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-284201-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, these skills were less in needed than previously in the absence of the large imperial administrative apparatus whose middle and top echelons the elite had dominated as if by right. Even so, in pre-modern times it is unlikely that literacy was found in more than about 30-40% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;This connection is pursued in [[Alan K. Bowman]] and [[Greg Woolf]], eds., ''Literacy and Power in the Ancient World'', (Cambridge) 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest percentage of literacy during the Dark Ages was among the clergy and monks who supplied much of the staff needed to administer the states of western Europe. 

Post-Antiquity illiteracy was made much worse due to a lack of suitable writing medium. When the Western Roman Empire collapsed, the import of [[papyrus]] to Europe ceased. Since papyrus perishes easily and does not last well in the wetter or damper European climate, the alternative was [[parchment]] which was expensive and accessible only by the Church and upper layers of the society. Once [[paper]] was introduced into Europe in the 11th century in Spain. Its use spread north slowly over the next four centuries. Increased literacy saw a resurgence because of its use. By the 15th century paper had largely replaced parchment except for many luxury manuscripts (some of which used paper). 

The [[Reformation]] stressed the importance of literacy and being able to read the Bible. The Protestant countries were the first to attain full literacy; [[Scandinavia]]n countries were fully literate in the early 17th century. The Church{{which|date=October 2018}} demanded literacy as the pre-requisite for [[marriage]] in [[Sweden]]{{when|date=October 2018}}, this further propagating full literacy.

==Modern literacy==

=== Spread of literacy since the mid-twentieth century ===
[[File:Figure 1 Adult literacy rates have increased Reading the past writing the futureUPDATED.svg|thumb|Adult literacy rates have increased at a constant pace since 1950.]]
Literacy data published by [[UNESCO]] displays that since 1950, the adult literacy rate at the world level has increased by 5 percentage points every decade on average, from 55.7 per cent in 1950 to 86.2 per cent in 2015. However, for four decades, the population growth was so rapid that the number of illiterate adults kept increasing, rising from 700 million in 1950 to 878 million in 1990. Since then, the number has fallen markedly to 745 million in 2015, although it remains higher than in 1950 despite decades of universal education policies, literacy interventions and the spread of print material and information and communications technology (ICT). However, these trends have been far from uniform across regions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Regional disparities ===
Available global data indicates significant variations in literacy rates between world regions. [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[West Asia]], and [[Central Asia]] have achieved almost full adult literacy (individuals at or over the age of 15) for both men and women. Most countries in [[East Asia and the Pacific]], as well as [[Latin America and the Caribbean]], are above a 90% literacy rate for adults.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|date=September 2015|title=Adult and Youth Literacy|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/literacy/Documents/fs32-2015-literacy.pdf|journal=UIS Fact Sheet|volume=No. 32|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy persists to a greater extent in other regions: 2013 [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] (UIS) data indicates adult literacy rates of only, 67.55% in [[South Asia]] and [[North Africa]], 59.76% in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=166#)|title=Education : Literacy rate|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 5 Literacy has rapidly spread Reading the past writing the future.svg|left|thumb|Literacy has rapidly spread in several regions over the last twenty-five years.]]
In much of the world, high youth literacy rates suggest that illiteracy will become less and less common as younger generations with higher educational attainment levels replace older ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee. (2016). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k0mUCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 Literacy Development: Global Research and Policy Perspectives]''.

Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-1-4408-3223-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where the vast majority of the world's illiterate youth live, lower school enrollment implies that illiteracy will persist to a greater degree.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee. (2016).

Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. p. 106. {{ISBN|978-1-4408-3223-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2013 UIS data, the youth literacy rate (individuals ages 15 to 24) is 84.03% in South Asia and North Africa, and 70.06% in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

That being said, literacy has rapidly spread in several regions in the last twenty-five years (see image).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Gender disparities ===
[[File:Figure 4 Progress towards gender parity Reading the past writing the future.svg|thumb|Gender parity indices in youth literacy rates by region, 1990–2015. Progress towards gender parity in literacy started after 1990.]]
On a worldwide scale, illiteracy disproportionately impacts women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyitso|first=Mabel|last2=Olomukoro|first2=C. O.|date=3 August 2012|title=Enhancing Women's Development through Literacy Education in Nigeria|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/res/article/view/19478|journal=Review of European Studies|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=66|doi=10.5539/res.v4n4p66|issn=1918-7181}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2015 UIS data collected by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], about two-thirds (63%) of the world's illiterate adults are women. This disparity was even starker in previous decades: from 1970 to 2000, the global gender gap in literacy would decrease by roughly 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorius|first=Shawn F.|last2=Firebaugh|first2=Glenn|date=1 July 2010|title=Trends in Global Gender Inequality|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/5/1941|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1941–1968|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0040|issn=0037-7732|pmc=3107548|pmid=21643494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this progress has stagnated, with the remaining gender gap holding almost constant over the last two decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In general, the gender gap in literacy is not as pronounced as the regional gap; that is, differences between countries in overall literacy are often larger than gender differences within countries.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/chapter-3.pdf Education and Health: Where do Gender Differences Really Matter]?" in Gender Equality and Development: World Development Report 2012. Washington, D.C: The World Bank: 114.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gap between men and women would narrow from 1990 onwards, after the increase of male adult literacy rates at 80 per cent (see image).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247563e.pdf|title=Reading the past, writing the future: Fifty years of promoting literacy|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100214-4|location=|pages=21–23, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the region with the lowest overall literacy rates, also features the widest gender gap: just 52% of adult females are literate, and 68% among adult men. Similar gender disparity persists in two other regions, [[North Africa]] (86% adult male literacy, 70% adult female literacy) and South Asia (77% adult male literacy, 58% adult female literacy).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1990 World Conference on [[Education For All|Education for All]], held in Jomtien, Thailand, would bring attention to the literacy gender gap and prompt many developing countries to prioritize women's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWz6mAEACAAJ|title=Gender, Literacy, and Empowerment in Morocco|last=Agnaou|first=Fatima|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415947657|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past decade, global development agendas would increasingly address the issue of female literacy. For example, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] would center his 2010 [[International Literacy Day]] speech around the theme "Empowering Women Through Literacy Empowers Us All," emphasizing the broad societal progress that higher female literacy rates could promote.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In many contexts, female illiteracy co-exists with other aspects of gender inequality. [[Martha Nussbaum]], for example, make illiterate women more vulnerable to becoming trapped in an abusive marriage, given that illiteracy limits their employment opportunities and worsens their [[intra-household bargaining]] position. Moreover, Nussbaum links literacy to the potential for women to effectively communicate and collaborate with one another in order "to participate in a larger movement for political change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|date=1 January 2004|title=Women's Education: A Global Challenge|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=29|issue=2|pages=332–333|doi=10.1086/378571|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Challenges of increasing female literacy ====

Social barriers prevent expanding literacy skills among women and girls.

==== Gender gap for boys in developed countries ====

While women and girls comprise the majority of the global illiterate population, in many developed countries a literacy gender gap exists in the opposite direction. Data from the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) has consistently indicated the literacy underachievement of boys within member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Anne|last2=Kehler|first2=Michael|last3=Martino|first3=Wayne|date=1 February 2010|title=The Problem of Boys' Literacy Underachievement: Raising Some Questions|journal=Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy|language=en|volume=53|issue=5|pages=356–361|doi=10.1598/JAAL.53.5.1|issn=1936-2706}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of such findings, many education specialists have recommended changes in classroom practices to better accommodate boys' learning styles, and to remove any gender stereotypes that may create a perception of reading and writing as feminine activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Senn|first=Nicole|date=1 November 2012|title=Effective Approaches to Motivate and Engage Reluctant Boys in Literacy|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=211–220|doi=10.1002/TRTR.01107|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZHAAAAACAAJ|title=Me Read?

===Socioeconomic impact===
Many policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure of the value of a region's [[human capital]]. For example, literate people can be more easily trained than illiterate people, and generally have a higher socioeconomic status;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thephonicspage.org/On%20Phonics/profitable.html|title = Phonics. It's Profitable|website=The Phonics Page |accessdate = 11 December 2007|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus they enjoy better health and employment prospects. The international community has come to consider literacy as a key facilitator and goal of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Vasudeva|last2=S|first2=B.|last3=Gupta|first3=P.

=== Health impacts ===
Illiterate people are generally less knowledgeable about hygiene and nutritional practices, an unawareness which can exacerbate a wide range of health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puchner|first=Laurel D.|date=1 July 1995|title=Literacy links: Issues in the relationship between early childhood development, health, women, families, and literacy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/073805939400041M|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=15|issue=3|pages=307–319|doi=10.1016/0738-0593(94)00041-M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within developing countries in particular, literacy rates also have implications for [[child mortality]]; in these contexts, children of literate mothers are 50% more likely to live past age 5 than children of illiterate mothers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldliteracyfoundation.org//wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WLF-FINAL-ECONOMIC-REPORT.pdf|title=The Economic and Social Cost of Illiteracy: A Snapshot of Illiteracy in a Global Context|date=24 August 2015|website=|publisher=World Literacy Foundation|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health research has thus increasingly concerned itself with the potential for literacy skills to allow women to more successfully access health care systems, and thereby facilitate gains in child health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeVine|first=Robert A.|last2=Rowe|first2=Meredith L.|title=Maternal Literacy and Child Health in Less-Developed Countries: Evidence, Processes, and Limitations|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00004703-200908000-00012|journal=Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=340–349|doi=10.1097/dbp.0b013e3181b0eeff|pmid=19672161|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a 2014 descriptive research survey project correlates literacy levels with the socioeconomic status of women in Oyo State, Nigeria. The study claims that developing literacy in this area will bring "economic empowerment and will encourage rural women to practice hygiene, which will in turn lead to the reduction of birth and death rates."&lt;ref&gt;OKOJI, O. F., &amp; LADEJI, O. O. (2014). Influence of Adult Literacy Education on Socio-Economic Empowerment of Rural Women in Oyo State, Nigeria. Gender &amp; Behaviour, 12(3), 6016-6026.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic impacts ===
Literacy can increase job opportunities and access to [[higher education]]. In 2009, the National Adult Literacy agency (NALA) in [[Ireland]] commissioned a cost benefit analysis of adult literacy training. This concluded that there were economic gains for the individuals, the companies they worked for, and the Exchequer, as well as the economy and the country as a whole—for example, increased [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |title=nala.ie |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723224750/http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] and coauthors have revealed a rather significant correlation between the level of literacy in the early 19th century and successful modernization and economic breakthroughs in the late 20th century, as "literate people could be characterized by a greater innovative-activity level, which provides opportunities for modernization, development, and economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korotayev | first1 = Andrey | last2 = Zinkina | first2 = Julia | last3 = Bogevolnov | first3 = Justislav | last4 = Malkov | first4 = Artemy | title = Global Unconditional Convergence among Larger Economies after 1998? | url = http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140671/| journal = Journal of Globalization Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literacy promotion efforts ===
While informal learning within the home can play an important role in literacy development, gains in childhood literacy often occur in primary school settings. Continuing the global expansion of public education is thus a frequent focus of literacy advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee. (2016).

&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of broad improvements in education often require centralized efforts undertaken by national governments; alternatively, local literacy projects implemented by NGOs can play an important role, particularly in rural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckman|first=Paula J.|last2=Gallo|first2=Jessica|date=October 2015|title=Rural Education in a Global Context|url=http://ger.mercy.edu/index.php/ger/article/view/238|journal=Global Education Review|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|page=7|issn=2325-663X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for both youth and adult literacy programs often comes from large international development organizations. [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], for example, steered donors like the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the [[Global Partnership for Education]] toward the issue of childhood literacy by developing the [https://www.eddataglobal.org/reading/ Early Grade Reading Assessment].&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Lesley and Julia Frazier (2015). "Literacy and Development." In ''Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development''. Edited by Simon McGrath and Qing Gu. {{ISBN|1317752236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy groups like the [[NIACE|National Institute of Adult Continuing Education]] have frequently called upon international organizations such as UNESCO, the [[International Labour Organization]], the [[World Health Organization]], and the [[World Bank]] to prioritize support for adult women's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (2012). ''[http://www.learningandwork.org.uk/sites/niace_en/files/document-downloads/womensrighttoliteracy_web.pdf Women's Right to Literacy: Advocating Women's Right to Access Learning Literacy through International Development].'' Leicester: NIACE.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to increase adult literacy often encompass other development priorities as well; for example, initiatives in [[Ethiopia]], [[Morocco]], and [[India]] have combined adult literacy programs with vocational skills trainings in order to encourage enrollment and address the complex needs of women and other marginalized groups who lack economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (2013).

In 2013, the [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning]] published a set of case studies&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002225/222588e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on programs that successfully improved female literacy rates. The report features countries from a variety of regions and of differing income levels, reflecting the general global consensus on "the need to empower women through the acquisition of literacy skills."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (2013). "[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002225/222588e.pdf Literacy Programmes with a Focus on Women to Reduce Gender Disparities]." Hamburg: UIL. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the impetus for UNESCO's focus on literacy is a broader effort to respond to globalization and "the shift towards knowledge-based societies" that it has produced.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2006).

In ''Education for All Global Monitoring Report''. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; While globalization presents emerging challenges, it also provides new opportunities: many education and development specialists are hopeful that new information and communications technologies (ICTs) will have the potential to expand literacy learning opportunities for children and adults, even those in countries that have historically struggled to improve literacy rates through more conventional means.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee.

=== Literacy as a development indicator ===
The [[Human Development Index]], produced by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), uses education as one of its three indicators; originally, adult literacy represented two-thirds of this education index weight. In 2010, however, the UNDP replaced the adult literacy measure with mean years of schooling. A 2011 UNDP research paper framed this change as a way to "ensure current relevance," arguing that gains in global literacy already achieved between 1970 and 2010 meant that literacy would be "unlikely to be as informative of the future."&lt;ref&gt;Klugman, Jeni, Francisco Rodriguez, and Hyung-Jin Choi. (April 2011). "[http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdrp_2011_01.pdf The HDI 2010: New Controversies, Old Critiques]." ''United Nations Development Programme''. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, have since warned against overlooking the importance of literacy as an indicator and a goal for development, particularly for marginalized groups such as women and rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stromquist|first=Nelly|title=Adult Literacy and Women: A Present Account|url=http://journals.uncc.edu/index.php/DSJ/article/view/506|journal=Dialogues in Social Justice: An Adult Education Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(...) There are millions, the majority of whom are women, who lack opportunities to learn or who have insufficient skills to be able to assert this right. The challenge is to enable them to do so.

===30 April: Dia! Diversity in Action===

Dia! Which stand for Diversity in Action and is also known as "El Dia de los Ninos/El dia de los libros (Children's Day/Book Day)" is a program which celebrates the importance of reading to children from all cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Dia! is celebrated every year on 30 April in schools, libraries, and homes and this website provides tools and programs to encourage reading in children. Parents, caregivers, and educators can even start a book club.&lt;ref&gt;Mora, P. (1 January 2013). Dia! Diversity in Action Dia de los ninos, dia de los libros | Dia!

===READ/Orange County===

This community literacy program was initiated in 1992 by the [[Orange County Public Libraries|Orange County Public Library]] in [[California]].  The mission of READ/Orange County is to "create a more literate community by providing diversified services of the highest quality to all who seek them." Potential tutors train during an extensive 23-hour tutor training workshop in which they learn the philosophy, techniques and tools they will need to work with adult learns.&lt;ref name="Selnick, S." /&gt; After the training, the tutors invest at least 50 hours a year to tutoring their student.The organization builds on people's experience as well as education rather than trying to make up for what has not been learned. The program seeks to equip students with skills to continue learning in the future.&lt;ref name="Selnick, S." /&gt; The guiding philosophy is that an adult who learns to read creates a [[ripple effect]] in the community.  The person becomes an example to children and grandchildren and can better serve the community.

===BoulderReads!===

Located in [[Boulder, Colorado]], the program recognized the difficulty that students had in obtaining child care while attending tutoring sessions, and joined with the University of Colorado to provide reading buddies to the children of students. Reading Buddies matches children of adult literacy students with college students who meet with them once a week throughout the semester for an hour and a half. The college students receive course credit to try to enhance the quality and reliability of their time.&lt;ref name="Sherry, D."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherry | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = ["Providing reading buddies for the children of adult literacy students: One way to provide onsite child care while also addressing intergenerational illiteracy"] | url = | journal = Colorado Libraries | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 40–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Reading Buddies session focuses primarily on the [[college student]] reading aloud with the child. The goal is to help the child gain interest in books and feel comfortable reading aloud. Time is also spent on word games, writing letters, or searching for books in the library. Throughout the semester the pair work on writing and illustrating a book together. The college student's grade is partly dependent on the completion of the book. Although Reading Buddies began primarily as an answer to the lack of child care for literacy students, it has evolved into another aspect of the program.&lt;ref name="Sherry, D." /&gt; Participating children show marked improvement in their reading and writing skills throughout the semester.

===Hillsborough Literacy Council (HLC)===

Approximately 120,000 adults in Hillsborough County are illiterate or read below the fourth-grade level. Working since 1986, the HLC is "committed to improving literacy by empowering adults through education".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hillsboroughliteracy.org Hillsborough Literacy Council], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by the statewide Florida Literacy Coalition, HLC strives to improve the literacy ability of adults in [[Hillsborough County, Florida]]. The HLC provides tutoring for [[English as a second or foreign language|English for speakers of other languages]] (ESOL). Through one-on-one tutoring, the organization works to help adult students reach at least the fifth-grade level.

==Broader and complementary definitions==
Traditionally, literacy is the ability to use written language actively and passively; one definition of literacy is the ability to "read, write, spell, listen, and speak".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Moats, Louisa |title=Speech to print: language essentials for teachers |publisher=Paul H.

Some have argued that the definition of literacy should be expanded. For example, in the [[United States]], the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] and the [[International Reading Association]] have added "visually representing"{{clarify|date=July 2012}} to the traditional list of competencies. Similarly, in [[Scotland]], literacy has been defined as: "The ability to read, write and use numeracy, to handle information, to express ideas and opinions, to make decisions and solve problems, as family members, workers, citizens and lifelong learners".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/158952/0043191.pdf Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland]" (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued that literacy includes the cultural, political, and historical contexts of the community in which communication takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michele Knobel]] (1999). ''Everyday Literacies: Students, Discourse, and Social Practice'', New York: Lang&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gee, J.&amp;nbsp;P. (1996). ''Social Linguistics and Literacies: Ideologies in Discourses'' Philadelphia: Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic literacy standard in many places is the ability to read the newspaper. Increasingly, communication in commerce and in general requires the ability to use computers and other digital technologies. Since the 1990s, when the [[Internet]] came into wide use in the United States, some have asserted that the definition of literacy should include the ability to use tools such as [[web browser]]s, [[word processing]] programs, and [[text message]]s. Similar expanded skill sets have been called [[multimedia literacy]], [[computer literacy]], [[information literacy]], and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kress, Gunther R. |title=Literacy in the new media age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-415-25356-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/reviews/charlton/Kress.htm |title=Literacy in the New Media Age |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose the idea multiliteracies which includes Functional Literacy, [[Critical literacy|Critical Literacy]], and Rhetorical Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stuart Selber |title=Multiliteracies for a Digital Age |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8093-2551-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Arts literacy" programs exist in some places in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=McKenna, Michael C. |author2=Richards, Janet C. |title=Integrating multiple literacies in K-8 classrooms: cases, commentaries, and practical applications |publisher=L.&amp;nbsp;Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8058-3945-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visual literacy]] also includes the ability to understand visual forms of communication such as [[body language]], pictures, maps, and video.&lt;ref&gt;An inability to "read" body language is one of the features of [[autism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Evolving definitions of literacy often include all the symbol systems relevant to a particular community.

Other genres under study by academia include [[critical literacy]], [[media literacy]], [[ecological literacy]] and [[health literacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Zarcadoolas, C., Pleasant, A., &amp; Greer, D. (2006). ''Advancing health literacy: A framework for understanding and action''. Jossey-Bass: San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing emphasis on evidence-based decision making, and the use of statistical graphics and information, [[statistical literacy]] is becoming a very important aspect of literacy in general. The International Statistical Literacy Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/islp/|title=ISLP — Home|website=www.stat.auckland.ac.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dedicated to the promotion of statistical literacy among all members of society.

Given that a large part of the benefits of literacy can be obtained by having access to a literate person in the household, some recent literature in economics, starting with the work of Kaushik Basu and James Foster, distinguishes between a "proximate illiterate" and an "isolated illiterate". The former refers to an illiterate person who lives in a household with literates and the latter to an illiterate who lives in a household of all illiterates. What is of concern is that many people in poor nations are not just illiterates but isolated illiterates.

==Teaching literacy==
{{main article|Learning to read}}
{{globalize|section|date=April 2011}}
Teaching English literacy in the [[United States]] is dominated by a focus on a set of discrete decoding skills. From this perspective, literacy—or, rather, reading—comprises a number of subskills that can be taught to students. These skill sets include [[phonological awareness]], [[phonics|phonics (decoding)]], [[fluency]], [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]], and [[vocabulary]]. Mastering each of these subskills is necessary for students to become proficient readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|title = Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction: Reports of the Subgroups|publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office|year = 2000|ref = harv|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this same perspective, readers of [[alphabetic language]]s must understand the [[alphabetic principle]] to master basic reading skills. For this purpose a writing system is "alphabetic" if it uses symbols to represent [[phoneme|individual language sounds]],&lt;ref name="sedl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |publisher=Sedl.org |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages. [[Syllabary|Syllabic writing systems]] (such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]) use a symbol to represent a single syllable, and [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] (such as [[Written Chinese|Chinese]]) use a symbol to represent a [[morpheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Halsall |url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/chinlng4.html |title=Chinese Cultural Studies: Chinese Logographic Writing |publisher=Acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are any number of approaches to teaching literacy&lt;ref&gt;Carter, V. Elaine. (November 2000). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001257/125767eb.pdf “New approaches to literacy learning: A guide for teacher educators.”] UNESCO. www.un.org/ga/president/62/ThematicDebates/adn/crimeimpedimentsd.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;; each is shaped by its informing assumptions about what literacy is and how it is best learned by students. [[Phonics]] instruction, for example, focuses on reading at the level of the word. It teaches readers to observe and interpret the letters or groups of letters that make up words. A common method of teaching phonics is [[synthetic phonics]], in which a novice reader pronounces each individual sound and "blends" them to pronounce the whole word. Another approach is embedded phonics instruction, used more often in [[whole language]] reading instruction, in which novice readers learn about the individual letters in words on a just-in-time, just-in-place basis that is tailored to meet each student's reading and writing learning needs.&lt;ref name="sedl" /&gt; That is, teachers provide phonics instruction opportunistically, within the context of stories or student writing that feature many instances of a particular letter or group of letters. Embedded instruction combines letter-sound knowledge with the use of meaningful context to read new and difficult words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/glossary#E |title=Glossary |publisher=LD OnLine |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as [[directed listening and thinking activity|directed listening and thinking activities]] can be used to aid children in learning how to read and [[reading comprehension]].

In a 2012 proposal, it has been claimed that reading can be acquired naturally if print is constantly available at an early age in the same manner as spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Massaro | first1 = D. W. | year = 2012 | title = Acquiring Literacy Naturally: Behavioral science and technology could empower preschool children to learn to read naturally without instruction | url = http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2012/4/acquiring-literacy-naturally| journal = American Scientist | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 324–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If an appropriate form of written text is made available before formal schooling begins, reading should be learned inductively, emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. This proposal challenges the commonly held belief that written language requires formal instruction and schooling. Its success would change current views of literacy and schooling. Using developments in behavioral science and technology, an interactive system (Technology Assisted Reading Acquisition, TARA) would enable young pre-literate children to accurately perceive and learn properties of written language by simple exposure to the written form.

In Australia a number of State governments have introduced Reading Challenges to improve literacy. The Premier's Reading Challenge in South Australia, launched by Premier Mike Rann has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC, What States Can Do, 2 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-conflict settings===

Programs have been implemented in regions that have an ongoing conflict or in a post-conflict stage. The Norwegian Refugee Council Pack program has been used in 13 post-conflict countries since 2003. The program organizers believe that daily routines and other wise predictable activities help the transition from war to peace.  Learners can select one area in vocational training for a year-long period.  They complete required courses in agriculture, life skills, literacy and numeracy.  Results have shown that active participation and management of the members of the program are important to the success of the program. These programs share the use of integrated basic education, e.g. literacy, numeracy, scientific knowledge, local history and culture, native and mainstream language skills, and apprenticeships.&lt;ref name=Bernhardt/&gt;

===Teaching non-native users===
Although there is considerable awareness that language deficiencies (lacking proficiency) are disadvantageous to immigrants settling in a new country, there appears to be a lack of pedagogical approaches that address the instruction of literacy to migrant English language learners (ELLs). Harvard scholar Catherine Snow (2001) called for a gap to be addresses: "The TESOL field needs a concerted research effort to inform literacy instruction for such children ... to determine when to start literacy instruction and how to adapt it to the LS reader's needs".&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C. (2001). Learning to Read in an L2.TESOL Quarterly: 35:4 599-601&lt;/ref&gt; The scenario becomes more complex when there is no choice in such decisions as in the case of the current migration trends with citizens from the Middle East and Africa being relocated to English majority nations due to various political or social reasons. Recent developments to address the gap in teaching literacy to second or foreign language learners has been ongoing and promising results have been shown by Pearson and Pellerine (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Pearson and Pellerine (2010) Teaching for Understanding in Higher Education: A Framework for Developing Literacy within a TESOL Context. http://marifa.hct.ac.ae/2010/100&lt;/ref&gt; which integrates Teaching for Understanding, a curricular framework from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. A series of pilot projects had been carried out in the Middle East and Africa (see Patil, 2016).&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canadian-teacher-literacy-visual-arts-1.3635661|title=How an educator from Nova Scotia uses cameras to teach English in Ethiopia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work significant interest from the learners perspective have been noticed through the integration of visual arts as springboards for literacy oriented instruction. In one case migrant women had been provided with cameras and a walking tour of their local village was provided to the instructor as the women photographed their tour focusing on places and activities that would later be used for writings about their daily life. In essence a narrative of life. Other primers for writing activities include: painting, sketching, and other craft projects (e.g. gluing activities).

[[File:Sample_sketch_of_milestone.jpg|thumb|right|Sample milestone sketch]]

A series of pilot studies were carried out to investigate alternatives to instructing literacy to migrant ELLs,&lt;ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com/altlit|title=altlit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting from simple trials aiming to test the teaching of photography to participants with no prior photography background, to isolating painting and sketching activities that could later be integrated into a larger pedagogical initiative. In efforts to develop alternative approaches for literacy instruction utilising visual arts, work was carried out with Afghan labourers, Bangladeshi tailors, Emirati media students, internal Ethiopian migrants (both labourers and university students), and a street child.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elgazette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elgazette.com/item/296-why-every-picture-tells-a-story.html|title=Why every picture tells a story - EL Gazette|first=Andrea|last=Perez|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com"/&gt;

[[File:Migrant_Woman_Reviewing_Photography,_Making_Seletions_for_Writing.jpeg|thumb|left|Reviewing photos after photowalk]]
 
It should be pointed out that in such challenging contexts sometimes the teaching of literacy may have unforeseen barriers. The ''EL Gazette'' reported that in the trials carried out in Ethiopia, for example, it was found that all ten of the participants had problems with vision.&lt;ref name="elgazette.com"/&gt; In order to overcome this, or to avoid such challenges, preliminary health checks can help inform pre-teaching in order to better assist in the teaching/learning of literacy.

In a visual arts approach to literacy instruction a benefit can be the inclusion of both a traditional literacy approach (reading and writing) while at the same time addressing 21st Century digital literacy instruction through the inclusion of digital cameras and posting images onto the web. Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;https://calico.org/bookfiles/pdfs/DigitalLiteracies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; feel that the inclusion of digital literacy is necessary to include under the traditional umbrella of literacy instruction specifically when engaging second language learners. (Also see: [[Digital literacy]].)&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison and
Woodward (2013). A Planning Cycle for Integrating Digital Technology Into Literacy Instruction. TOC. Volume 67, Issue 6 March 2014 Pages 455–464&lt;/ref&gt; {{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

Other ways in which visual arts have been integrated into literacy instruction for migrant populations include integrating aspects of visual art with the blending of core curricular goals.

&lt;!-- (I'm commenting this out because it is poorly written, refers to images which aren't currently part of the page, and is getting way off topic.)  In the following images a student can be seen photographing, sketching, and estimating the volume of an area (V = l * w * h). In the other image a street walk photographing elements from the periodic table can be seen, sketches based on microscopy introduce basic biology as well as provide implicit opportunities to develop language for sequencing, and in another the pupil paints a landscape to approach geography.  Also see: [[:File:Going_in_to_the_field_to_sketch.jpg]], and [[:File:Process_Painting.jpg]] --&gt;

===Teaching migrant/immigrant language users===

A more pressing challenge in education is the instruction of literacy to Migrant English Language Learners (MELLs), a term coined by Pellerine. It is not just limited to English. “Due to the growing share of immigrants in many Western societies, there has been increasing concern for the degree to which immigrants acquire language that is spoken in the destination country” (Tubergen 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Tubergen, F. (2006). Immigrant Integration: A Cross National Study. Scholarly Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering that teaching literacy to a native in their L1 can be challenging, and the challenge becomes more cognitively demanding when in a second language (L2), the task can become considerably more difficult when confronted with a migrant who has made a sudden change (migrated) and requires the second language upon arrival in the country of destination. In many instances a migrant will not have the opportunity, for many obvious reasons, to start school again at grade one and acquire the language naturally. In these situations alternative interventions need to take place.

In working with illiterate people (and individuals with low-proficiency in an L2) following the composition of some artifact like in taking a photo, sketching an event, or painting an image, a stage of orality has been seen as an effective way to understand the intention of the learner.

[[File:Including_Orality.jpg|thumb|centre|Including orality]]

In the accompanying image from left to right a) an image taken during a phototour of the participant's village. This image is of the individual at her shop, and this is one of her products that she sells, dung for cooking fuel. The image helps the interlocutor understand the realities of the participants daily life and most importantly it allows the participant the opportunity to select what they feel is important to them. b) This is an image of a student explaining and elaborating the series of milestones in her life to a group. In this image the student had a very basic ability and with some help was able to write brief captions under the images. While she speaks a recording of her story takes place to understand her story and to help develop it in the L2. The third image is of a painting that had been used with a composite in Photoshop. With further training participants can learn how to blend images they would like to therefore introducing elements of digital literacies, beneficial in many spheres of life in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, Mark; Matuchniak, Tina (2010). "New Technology and Digital Worlds: Analyzing Evidence of Equity in Access, Use, and Outcomes". Review of Research in Education. 34: 179–225. doi:10.3102/0091732X09349791&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sample_of_alternative_process_writing_primed_with_visual_arts.jpg|thumb|right|Two sample scenarios]]

In the following image (see right) you can see two samples 1) One in Ethiopia from stencil to more developed composition based on a village tour, photography, and paintings. 2) In the Middle East at a tailor's shop focusing English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and in this example the writing has evolved from photography, sketching, and in situ exposure for the instructor (much like the village tour in sample one).

From the work based in Ethiopia, participants were asked to rate preference of activity, on a scale of 1-10. The survey prompt was: On a scale of 1 - 10 how would you rate photography as an activity that helped you get inspiration for your writing activities (think of enjoyment and usefulness). The following activities were rated, in order of preference - activities used as primers for writing:

* Photography 97%
* Oral presentations sharing your art 92%
* Process painting 84%
* Painting 82%
* Sketching 78% 
* Gluing activities 72%
* Stencil/tracing activities 60%

More research would need to be conducted to confirm such trends.

In bringing work together from students in culminating projects, authorship programs have been successful in bringing student work together in book format. Such artifacts can be used to both document learning, but more importantly reinforce language and content goals.

[[File:Covers_for_Authorship_Initiatives_to_Promote_Literacy_via_Visual_Art_with_ELLs.jpg|thumb|right|Sample covers of completed authorship created books]]

The culmination of such writings, into books can evoke both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Form feedback by students involved in such initiatives the responses have indicated that the healthy pressures of collective and collaborative work was beneficial.

===Importance===

Teaching people to read and write, in a traditional sense of the meaning (literacy) is a very complex task in a native language. To do this in a second language becomes increasingly more complex, and in the case of migrants relocating to another country there can be legal and policy driven boundaries that prohibit the naturalization and acquisition of citizen ship based on language proficiency. In Canada&lt;ref&gt;Pagtakhan (2016). Language requirement for citizenship unnecessary, Reis Pagtakhan writes: Immigrants must pass a language test to become Canadian citizens years after they arrive. CBC News, retrieved at: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/immigration-language-requirement-reis-pagtakhan-1.3568590 on 27 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; for example despite a debate, language tests are required years after settling into Canada.

The ''EL Gazette'' reviewed Pellerine's work with migrant English language learners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.elgazette.com/june-2017/the-art-of-teaching.html|title=The art of teaching - ELgazette|website=digital.elgazette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented: "Handing English language learners a sponge and some paint and asking them to ‘paint what comes’ might not appear like a promising teaching method for a foreign language. But Canadian EL instructor and photographer Steve Pellerine has found that the technique, along with others based around the visual arts, has helped some of his most challenging groups to learn". Visual arts have been viewed as an effective way to approach literacy instruction - the art being primers for subsequent literacy tasks within a scaffolded curricular design, such at Teaching for Understanding (TfU) or Understanding by Design (UbD).

==Literacy by continent==
===Literacy in Europe===
====United Kingdom====
Nearly one in ten young adult women has poor reading and writing skills in the UK in the 21st century.  This seriously damages their employent prospects and many are trapped in poverty.  Lack of reading skill is a social stigma and women tend to hide their difficulty rather than seeking help.  Girls on average do better than boys at English in school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45435973 Kate Winslet warns of 'shame' of illiteracy#] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  A quarter of British adults would struggle to read a bus timetable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/uk/357676-literacy-britain-adults-oecd/ Illiterate Britain: 1 in 20 adults have reading age of a 5-year-old]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=====England===== 
Literacy is first documented in the area of modern England on 24 September 54 BCE, on which day [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Quintus Cicero]] wrote to [[Cicero]] "from the nearest shores of Britain".&lt;ref&gt;R.S.O. Tomlin. Writing and Communication. In Artefacts in Roman Britain, their purpose and use. Lindsay Allason-Jones ed. Cambridge University Press 2011. page 133. {{ISBN|978-0-521-86012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy was widespread under Roman rule, but became very rare, limited almost entirely to churchmen, after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. In 12th and 13th century [[England]], the ability to recite a particular passage from the Bible in [[Latin]] entitled a [[common law]] defendant to the so-called [[benefit of clergy]]—i.e., trial before an [[ecclesiastical court]], where sentences were more lenient, instead of a secular one, where hanging was a likely sentence. Thus literate lay defendants often claimed the right to benefit of clergy, while an illiterate person who had memorized the psalm used as the literacy test, [[Psalm 51]] ("O God, have mercy upon me..."), could also claim benefit of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Baker, John R. |title=An Introduction to English Legal History |publisher=Butterworths LexisNexis |location=London |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=978-0-406-93053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lacking a system of free and compulsory primary schooling, England managed to reach near universal literacy in the nineteenth century as a result of shared, informal learning systems such as family members, fellow workers, and/or benevolent employers, to name a few. Even with near universal literacy rates, the gap between male and female literacy rates continued to persist until the early twentieth century. Many female readers in the West during the nineteenth century were able to read, but unable to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=98|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wales=====
Formal higher education in the arts and sciences in [[Wales]], from the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] to the 18th century, was the preserve of the wealthy and the [[clergy]]. As in England, Welsh history and archaeological finds dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] reveal not only reading and writing, but also [[alchemy]], [[botany]], advanced maths and science. Following the Roman occupation and the conquest by the English, education in Wales was at a very low ebb in the early modern period; in particular, formal education was only available in English while the majority of the population spoke only [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The first modern grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as [[Ruthin]], [[Brecon]], and [[Cowbridge]]. One of the first modern national education methods to use the native Welsh language was started by [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see [[History of Wales#Early modern period]]&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was the rector of [[Llanddowror]] from 1716 and remained there for the rest of his life. He organized and introduced a Welsh medium circulating school system, which was attractive and effective for Welsh speakers, while also teaching them English, which gave them access to broader educational sources. The circulating schools may have taught half the country's population to read. Literacy rates in Wales by the mid-18th century were one of the highest.
[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Dutch schoolmaster and children, 1662]]

====Continental Europe====
The ability to read did not necessarily imply the ability to write. The [[Swedish Church Law 1686|1686 church law]] (''kyrkolagen'') of the Kingdom of [[Sweden]] (which at the time included all of modern Sweden, [[Finland]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]) enforced literacy on the people, and by 1800 the ability to read was close to 100%. This was directly dependent on the need to read religious texts in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran faith]] in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. As a result, literacy in these countries was inclined towards reading, specifically.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=97|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as late as the 19th century, many Swedes, especially women, could not write. The exception to this rule were the men and women of [[Iceland]] who achieved widespread literacy without formal schooling, libraries, or printed books via informal tuition by religious leaders and peasant teachers.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; That said, the situation in England was far worse than in [[Scandinavia]], [[France]], and [[Prussia]]: as late as 1841, 33% of all Englishmen and 44% of Englishwomen signed marriage certificates with their [[Signature#Function and types of signatures|mark]] as they were unable to write (government-financed public education was not available in England until 1870 and, even then, on a limited basis){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Historian [[Ernest Gellner]] argues that [[Continental Europe]]an countries were far more successful in implementing educational reform precisely because their governments were more willing to invest in the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Ernest Gellner |title=Nations and Nationalism |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-8014-9263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government oversight allowed countries to standardize curriculum and secure funding through legislation thus enabling educational programs to have a broader reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literacy in early modern Europe : culture and education, 1500-1800|last=Houston|first=Rab|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780582368101|edition=2nd |location=Oxfordshire, England|pages=|oclc=884586117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the present-day concepts of literacy have much to do with the 15th-century invention of the [[movable type]] [[printing press]], it was not until the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the mid-19th century that paper and books became affordable to all classes of industrialized society. Until then, only a small percentage of the population were literate as only wealthy individuals and institutions could afford the materials. Even {{As of|2008|alt=today}}, the cost of paper and books is a barrier to universal literacy in some less-industrialized nations.

On the other hand, historian [[Harvey Graff]] argues that the introduction of [[Compulsory education|mass schooling]] was in part an effort to control the type of literacy that the [[working class]] had access to. According to Graff, literacy learning was increasing outside of formal settings (such as schools) and this uncontrolled, potentially critical reading could lead to increased radicalization of the populace. In his view, mass schooling was meant to temper and control literacy, not spread it.&lt;ref name="Graff1991"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Graff|first=Harvey J. |title=The literacy myth: cultural integration and social structure in the nineteenth century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AAj9sM99qekC|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-884-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AAj9sM99qekC&amp;pg=PR26 xxvi]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graff also points out, using the example of Sweden, that mass literacy can be achieved without formal schooling or instruction in writing.

====Canada====
=====Colonialism (1600s–1762)=====

Research on the literacy rates of Canadians in the colonial days rested largely on examinations of the proportion of signatures to marks on parish acts (birth, baptismal, and marriage registrations).  Although some researchers have concluded that signature counts drawn from marriage registers in nineteenth century [[France]] corresponded closely with literacy tests given to military conscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furet|first=François|title=Lire et écrire: l'alphabétisation des Français de Calvin à Jules Ferry|year=1977|publisher=Editions de Minuit|location=Paris|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; others regard this methodology as a "relatively unimaginative treatment of the complex practices and events that might be described as literacy" (Curtis, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;1-2).&lt;ref name="curtis1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Bruce|title=Beyond Signature Literacy: New Research Directions|journal=Historical Studies in Education / Revue d'Histoire de l'Éducation|year=2007|issue=Fall Special Issue|pages=1–12|url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/view/533/734|accessdate=23 October 2012|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But censuses (dating back to 1666) and official records of [[New France]] offer few clues of their own on the population's levels of literacy, therefore leaving few options in terms of materials from which to draw literary rate estimates.

In his research of literacy rates of males and females in New France, Trudel found that in 1663, of 1,224 persons in New France who were of marriageable age, 59% of grooms and 46% of brides wrote their name; however, of the 3,000-plus colony inhabitants, less than 40% were native born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnuson|first=Roger|title=Two myths in New France education|journal=McGill Journal of Education|year=1985|volume=20|issue=3|url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewArticle/7636|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signature rates were therefore likely more reflective of rates of literacy among French immigrants. Magnuson's (1985) research revealed a trend: signature rates for the period of 1680–1699 were 42% for males, 30% for females; in 1657-1715, they were 45% for males and 43% for females; in 1745-1754, they were higher for females than for males. He believed that this upward trend in rates of females’ ability to sign documents was largely attributed to the larger number of female religious orders, and to the proportionately more active role of women in health and education, while the roles of male religious orders were largely to serve as parish priests, [[Missionary|missionaries]], military chaplains and explorers. 1752 marked the date that Canada's first newspaper—the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]''—began publication.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Newspapers|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/newspapers|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====From the British Conquest (1763) to Confederation (1867)=====

The end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763 allowed two [[Philadelphia]] printers to come to [[Quebec City|Québec City]] and to begin printing a bilingual ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]'' in 1764, while in 1785 [[Fleury Mesplet]] started publication of the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', which is now the oldest continuing newspaper in the country.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1"/&gt;

In the 19th century, everything about print changed, and literature in its many forms became much more available.&lt;ref name=Aliaga-Buchenau&gt;{{cite book|last=Aliaga-Buchenau|first=Ana-Isabel|title=Dangerous Potential of Reading: Readers and the Negotiation of Power in Selected Nineteenth-Century Narratives|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-96833-1|page=202|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculbrock/docDetail.action?docID=10098857}}&lt;/ref&gt; But educating the Canadian population in reading and writing was nevertheless a huge challenge. Concerned about the strong [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] presence in the colony, the British authorities repeatedly tried to help establish schools that were outside the control of religious authorities, but these efforts were largely undermined by the [[Catholic Church]] and later the Anglican clergy.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Education|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/history-of-education|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 1820s in [[Lower Canada]], classical college curriculum, which was monopolized by the Church, was also subject to growing liberal and lay criticism, arguing it was fit first and foremost to produce priests, when Lower Canadians needed to be able to compete effectively with foreign industry and commerce and with the immigrants who were monopolizing trade (Curtis, 1985).&lt;ref name="curtis1"/&gt;  Liberal and lay attempts to promote parish schools generated a reaction from the Catholic and later the Anglican clergy in which the dangers of popular literacy figured centrally.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE" /&gt;  Both churches shared an opposition to any educational plan that encouraged lay reading of the Bible, and spokesmen for both warned of the evil and demoralizing tendencies of unregulated reading in general. Granted the power to organize parish schooling through the Vestry School Act of 1824, the Catholic clergy did nothing effective.&lt;ref name="curtis1"/&gt;

Despite this, the invention of the printing press had laid the foundation for the modern era and universal social literacy, and so it is that with time, "technologically, literacy had passed from the hands of an elite to the populace at large. Historical factors and sociopolitical conditions, however, have determined the extent to which universal social literacy has come to pass".&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Audrey M. Thomas, "[http://www.nald.ca/library/research/athomas/aduill/cover.htm Adult Illiteracy in Canada—A Challenge]" (Ottawa: Canadian Commission for UNESCO, Occasional Paper 42, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1868–1986=====
In 1871 only about half of French Canadian men in [[Canada]] self-reported that they were literate, whereas 90 percent of other Canadian men said they could read and write, but information from the Canadian Families Project sample of the 1901 [[Census in Canada|Census of Canada]] indicated that literacy rates for French Canadians and other Canadians increased, as measured by the ability of men between the ages of 16 and 65 to answer literacy questions.&lt;ref name="Green, A."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=A|author2=MacKinnon, M. |author3=Minns, C. |title=Conspicuous by their absence: French Canadians and the settlement of the Canadian West|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=2005|volume=65|issue=3|pages=822–849|jstor=3875019|doi=10.1017/S0022050705000306|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/staff/minnsc/research/jeh_galley_proofs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory attendance in schools was legislated in the late 19th century in all provinces but [[Quebec]], but by then, a change in parental attitudes towards educating the new generation meant that many children were already attending regularly.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt;  Unlike the emphasis of school promoters on character formation, the shaping of values, the inculcation of political and social attitudes, and proper behaviour, many parents supported schooling because they wanted their children to learn to read, write, and do [[arithmetic]].&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt; Efforts were made to exert power and religious, moral, economic/professional, and social/cultural influence over children who were learning to read by dictating the contents of their school readers accordingly. But educators broke from these spheres of influence and also taught literature from a more child-centred perspective: for the pleasure of it.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Sharon|title=Regaining Pleasure in the Teaching of Reading|journal=Language Arts|year=2012|volume=89|issue=5|pages=318–328|url=http://www.ncte.org/journals/la/issues/v89-5|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational change in Québec began as a result of a major commission of inquiry at the start of what came to be called the "[[Quiet Revolution]]" in the early 1960s.  In response to the resulting recommendations, the Québec government revamped the school system in an attempt to enhance the francophone population's general educational level and to produce a better-qualified labour force. Catholic Church leadership was rejected in favour of government administration and vastly increased budgets were given to school boards across the province.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt;

With time, and with continuing inquiry into the literacy achievement levels of Canadians, the definition of literacy moved from a [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] one (either a person could, or couldn’t write his or her name, or was literate or illiterate), to ones that considered its multidimensionality, along with the qualitative and quantitative aspects of literacy. In the 1970s, organizations like the Canadian Association for Adult Education (CAAE) believed that one had to complete the 8th grade to achieve functional literacy.  Examination of 1976 census data, for example, found that 4,376,655, or 28.4% of Canadians 15 years of age and over reported a level of schooling of less than grade 9 and were thus deemed not functionally literate.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; But in 1991, UNESCO formally acknowledged Canada's findings that assessment of educational attainment as proxy measure of literacy was not as reliable as was direct assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=Functional Literacy in Eastern and Western Europe|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000906/090661eo.pdf |publisher=UNESCO Institute for Education|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dissatisfaction manifested itself in the development of actual proficiency tests that measure reading literacy more directly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Direct systematic measures of literacy in Canada, 1987 to present=====

Canada conducted its first literacy survey in 1987 which discovered that there were more than five million [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]] adults in Canada, or 24 per cent of the adult population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Statistics Canada]] then conducted three national and international literacy surveys of the adult population — the first one in 1989 commissioned by the [[Employment and Social Development Canada|Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC) department.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This first survey was called the "Literacy Skills Used in Daily Activities" (LSUDA) survey, and was modeled on the 1985 U.S. survey of young adults (YALS).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada (2011)|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It represented a first attempt in Canada to produce skill measures deemed comparable across languages. Literacy, for the first time, was measured on a continuum of skills.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  The survey found that 16% of Canadians had literacy skills too limited to deal with most of the printed material encountered in daily life whereas 22% were considered "narrow" readers.

In 1994-95, Canada participated in the first multi-country, multi-language assessment of adult literacy, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). A stratified multi-stage probability sample design was used to select the sample from the Census Frame. The sample was designed to yield separate samples for the two Canadian official languages, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], and participants were measured on the dimensions of prose literacy, document literacy and quantitative literacy.  The survey found that 42.2%, 43% and 42.2% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy, Document Literacy and Quantitative Literacy, respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  The survey presented many important correlations, among which was a strong plausible link between literacy and a country's economic potential.

In 2003, Canada participated in the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALL). This survey contained identical measures for assessing the prose and document literacy proficiencies, allowing for comparisons between survey results on these two measures and found that 41.9% and 42.6% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy and document literacy respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Further, Canadians’ mean scores also improved on both the prose and the document literacy scales. Energy production:36%, transportation: 24%, homes and businesses: 12%, industry: 11%, agriculture: 10%, and waste: 7%.

The [[OECD]]'s [[Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies]] (PIAAC) is expected to produce new comparative skill profiles in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=4406&amp;lang=en&amp;db=imdb&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2 |title=Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) |publisher=3.statcan.gc.ca |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
In the last 40 years, the rate of illiteracy in [[Mexico]] has been steadily decreasing.  In the 1960s, because the majority of the residents of the federal capital were illiterate, the planners of the [[Mexico City Metro]] designed a system of unique icons to identify each station in the system in addition to its formal name. However, The INEGI´s census data of 1970 showed a national average illiteracy rate of 25.8%; the last census data puts the national average at 6.9%. Mexico still has a gender educational bias. The illiteracy rate for women in the last census was 8.1% compared with 5.6% for men. Rates differ across regions and states. [[Chiapas]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Oaxaca]], the states with the highest [[Poverty|poverty rate]], had greater than 15% illiteracy in 2010(17.8%, 16.7% and 16.3 respectively). In contrast, the illiteracy rates in the Federal District (D.F. / Mexico City) and in some northern states like [[Nuevo León]], [[Baja California]], and [[Coahuila]] were below 3% in the 2010 census (2.1%, 2.2%, 2.6% and 2.6% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/poblacion/analfabeta.aspx?tema=P|title=Analfabetismo.

Before the 20th century white illiteracy was not uncommon and many of the slave states made it illegal to teach slaves to read.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/education/docs1.html ''Acts against the education of slaves South Carolina, 1740 and Virginia, 1819''] Slavery Experience, PBS&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 the situation had improved somewhat, but 44% of black people remained illiterate. There were significant improvements for African American and other races in the early 20th century as the descendants of former slaves, who had had no educational opportunities, grew up in the post Civil War period and often had some chance to obtain a basic education. The gap in illiteracy between white and black adults continued to narrow through the 20th century, and in 1979 the rates were about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cultural and westernized literacy for Native Americans in the United States =====

[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|upright=1.7|right|thumb|Native youth in front of [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in Pennsylvania c.&amp;nbsp;1900]]

Before colonization, oral storytelling and communication composed most if not all [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] literacy. Native people communicated and retained their histories verbally—it was not until the beginning of [[American Indian boarding schools]] that reading and writing forms of literacy were forced onto Native Americans. While literacy rates of English increased, [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|forced assimilation]] exposed Native children to [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]], unsanitary living conditions, and even death.{{clarify|date=December 2014}} Many students ran away in an attempt to hold on to their [[cultural identity]] and literary traditions that were relevant to their community. While these formalized forms of literacy prepared Native youth to exist in the changing society, they destroyed all traces of their cultural literacy. Native children would return to their families unable to communicate with them due to the loss of their [[indigenous language]]. In the 20th and 21st century, there is still a struggle to learn and maintain cultural language. But education initiatives and programs have increased overall—according to the 2010 census, 86 percent of the overall population of Native Americans and Alaska Natives have high school diplomas, and 28 percent have a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month: November 2011 |publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]] | url= https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb11-ff22.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy in Africa===
The literacy rates in Africa vary significantly between countries. The highest registered literacy rate in the region is in [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Libya]] (both 94.2%), while the lowest literacy rate is in [[South Sudan]] (27%).&lt;ref name="Cwfbl"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html#xx|title=World |work=[[CIA Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poorer youth in sub-Saharan Africa have fewer educational opportunities to become literate compared with wealthier families.  They often must leave school because of being needed at home to farm or care for siblings.&lt;ref name="Bernhardt"/&gt;

[[File:Figure 2 Most illiterate persons in South Asia and Subsaharan Africa Reading the past writing the future.svg|thumb|Most illiterate persons now live in Southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.]]
In sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of literacy has not improved enough to compensate for the effects of demographic growth. As a result, the number of illiterate adults has risen by 27% over the last 20 years, reaching 169 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Information bulletin: School and teaching resources in sub-Saharan Africa, 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/ib9-regional-education-africa-2012-en-v5.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, out of the 775 million illiterate adults in the world in 2010, more than one fifth were in sub- Saharan Africa – in other words, 20% of the adult population. The countries with the lowest levels of literacy in the world are also concentrated in this region. These include Niger (28.7%), Burkina Faso (28.7%), Mali (33.4%), Chad (35.4%) and Ethiopia (39%), where adult literacy rates are well below 50%. There are, however, certain exceptions, like Equatorial Guinea, with a literacy rate of 94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital Services for Education in Africa|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 and over who can read or write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; The government of Mali and international organizations in recent years has taken steps to improve the literacy rate. The government recognized the slow progress in literacy rates and began created ministries for basic education and literacy for their national languages in 2007. To also improve literacy the government planned to increase its education budget by 3%, when this was purposed it was at 35% in 2007. The lack of literate adults causes the programs to be slowed. The programs need qualified female trainers is a major problem because most men refuse to send female family members to be trained under male teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mali: Still a long way to go to meet adult literacy targets|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/77803/mali-still-a-long-way-to-go-to-meet--liteadultracy-targets|accessdate=3 October 2014|work=IRIN|date=17 April 2008|ref=IRIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mauritius====
Free education in [[Mauritius]] didn't proceed beyond the primary level until 1976, so many women now in their 50s or older left school at age 12. The younger generation (below 50) are however extremely well educated with very high educational expectations placed upon pupils. Education is today free from pre-primary to tertiary (only admission fees remain at University level). Most professional people have at least a bachelor's degree. Mauritian students consistently rank top in the world each year for the Cambridge International [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Level]], International A and AS level examinations. Most Mauritian children, even at primary level, attend tuition after school and at weekends to cope with the highly competitive public school system where admission to prestigious public colleges (secondary) and most sought after university courses depend on merit based academic performance.

The adult [[literacy rate]] was estimated at 89.8% in 2011.&lt;ref name="census 2011"/&gt; Male literacy was 92.3% and Female literacy 87.3%.&lt;ref name="census 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|publisher=[[Statistics Mauritius]], [[Government Portal of Mauritius]]|title=2011 POPULATION CENSUS&amp;nbsp;— MAIN RESULTS|year=2011|accessdate=22 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223170840/http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niger====
[[Niger]] has an extremely low literacy rate at 28.7%. However, the gender gap between males and females is a major problem for the country, men have a literacy rate of 42.9% and women a literacy rate of 15.1%. The [[Government of Niger|Nigerien government]] defines literacy as anyone who can read or write over the age of 15.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; The Niass Tijaniyya, a predominate group of the [[Sufism|Sufi brotherhoods]], has started anti-poverty, empowerment, and literacy campaigns. The women in [[Kiota]] had not attempted to improve their education, or economic standing. Saida Oumul Khadiri Niass, known as Maman, through talking to men and women throughout the community changed the community's beliefs on appropriate behavior for women because the community recognized she was married to a leader of the Niass Tijaniyya. Maman's efforts has allowed women in Kiota to own small businesses, sell in the market place, attend literacy classes, and organize small associations that can give micro loans. Maman personally teaches children in and around Kiota, with special attention to girls. Maman has her students require instructor permission to allow the girls' parents to marry their daughters early. This increases the amount of education these girls receive, as well as delaying [[marriage]], [[pregnancy]], and having [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Shailly|title=RELIGION SOCIAL CAPITAL AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SAHEL: THE NIASS TIJANIYYA IN NIGER|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=2009|volume=62|issue=2|pages=209–221|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=1beab10b-5f42-4908-b98f-d353e358de2b%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=39764466|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senegal====
[[Senegal]] has a literacy rate of 49.7%; the government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 years of age and over who can read and write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; However, many students do not attend school long enough to be considered literate. The government did not begin actively attempting to improve the literacy rate until 1971 when it gave the responsibility to Department for Vocational Training at the Secretariat for Youth and Sports. This department and subsequent following departments had no clear policy on literacy until the Department of Literacy and Basic Education was formed in 1986. The government of Senegal relies heavily on funding from the [[World Bank]] to fund its school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordtveit|first1=Bjorn|title=Producing Literacy and Civil Society: The Case of Senegal.|journal=Comparative Education Review|date=May 2008|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1086/528761|pages=175–198|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=cie_faculty_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somalia====
There is no reliable data on the nationwide literacy rate in [[Somalia]]. A 2013 FSNAU survey indicates considerable differences per region, with the autonomous northeastern [[Puntland]] region having the highest registered literacy rate at 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Ties: Remittances and Livelihoods Support in Puntland and Somaliland|url=http://www.fsnau.org/downloads/Remittances-and-Livelihoods-Support-in-Puntland-and-Somaliland.pdf|publisher=FSNAU|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sierra Leone====
The [[Sierra Leone]] government defines literacy as anyone over the age of 15 who can read and write in [[English language|English]], [[Mende language|Mende]], [[Temne language|Temne]], or [[Arabic]]. Official statics put the literacy rate at 43.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|website=CIA|accessdate=3 October 2014|ref=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sierra Leone was the second country to use the Literacy, Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding project. However, due to fighting near the city where the project was centered causing the project to be delayed until an arms amnesty was in place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Uganda====
[[Uganda]] has a literacy rate of 66.8%.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt;

====Zimbabwe====
[[Zimbabwe]] has a high literacy rate of 86.5% (2016 est.).&lt;ref name="Cwfbl"/&gt;

====China====
{{main article|Education in the People's Republic of China}}
The [[China|PRC]] conducts standardized testing to assess proficiency in [[Standard Chinese]], known as "putonghua," but it is primarily for foreigners or those needing to demonstrate professional proficiency in the [[Beijing]] dialect. Literacy in languages like Chinese can be assessed by reading comprehension tests, just as in other languages, but historically has often been graded on the number of Chinese characters introduced during the speaker's schooling, with a few thousand considered the minimum for practical literacy. Social science surveys in China have repeatedly found that just more than half the population of China is conversant in spoken putonghua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More than half of Chinese can speak mandarin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=China View |date=7 March 2007 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm}} {{cite news |title=Beijing says 400 million Chinese cannot speak Mandarin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=BBC News |date=6 September 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23975037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}
{{main article|Literacy in India}}

Literacy is defined by the [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]], as "[the ability of] a person aged 7 years and above [to]... both write and read with understanding in any language."&lt;ref name="India 2011"&gt;2011 Census of India: Chapter 6: "State of Literacy of Rural Urban Population". Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Office of the Registrar and Census Commissioner, India, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Census of India, 2011|2011 census]], 74.04 percent.&lt;ref name="India 2011" /&gt;

====Laos====
[[File:Lao schoolgirls reading books.jpg|thumb|right|Three [[Lao people|Laotian]] girls sit outside their school, each absorbed in reading a book they received at a rural school book party.]]

[[Laos]] has the lowest level of adult literacy in all of [[Southeast Asia]] other than [[East Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/6.html hdrstats.undp.org], accessed 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Obstacles to literacy vary by country and culture as writing systems, quality of education, availability of written material, competition from other sources (television, video games, cell phones, and family work obligations), and culture all influence literacy levels. In Laos, which has a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] alphabet, reading is relatively easy to learn—especially compared to [[English language|English]], where spelling and pronunciation rules are filled with exceptions, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with thousands of symbols to be memorized. But a lack of books and other written materials has hindered functional literacy in Laos, where many children and adults read so haltingly that the skill is hardly beneficial.

A literacy project in Laos addresses this by using what it calls "books that make literacy fun!" The project, [[Big Brother Mouse]], publishes colorful, easy-to-read books, then delivers them by holding book parties at rural schools. Some of the books are modeled on successful western books by authors such as [[Dr. Seuss]]; the most popular, however, are traditional Lao fairy tales. Two popular collections of folktales were written by Siphone Vouthisakdee, who comes from a village where only five children finished primary school.&lt;ref name="tibor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Krausz|first=Tibor|title=Publishing Children's Books – And Delivering Them by Elephant| url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/2011/0221/Publishing-children-s-books-and-delivering-them-by-elephant| accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Brother Mouse has also created village reading rooms, and published books for adult readers about subjects such as Buddhism, health, and baby care.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Bonnie. "Picturing Laos". Amherst Bulletin, 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
In [[Pakistan]], the [[National Commission for Human Development]] (NCHD) aims to bring literacy to adults, especially women.
ISLAMABAD - UNESCO Islamabad Director Kozue Kay Nagata has said, "Illiteracy in Pakistan has fallen over two decades, thanks to the government and people of Pakistan for their efforts working toward meeting the [[Millennium Development Goals]]". "Today, 70 percent of Pakistani youths can read and write. In 20 years, illiterate population has been reduced significantly", she said while speaking at a function held in connection with [[International Literacy Day]].

However, she also emphasised on the need to do more to improve literacy in the country and said, "The proportion of population in Pakistan lacking basic reading and writing is too high. This is a serious obstacle for individual fulfillment, to the development of societies, and to mutual understanding between peoples." Referring to the recent national survey carried out by the Ministry of Education, Trainings and Standards in Higher Education with support of UNESCO, [[UNICEF]], and provincial and areas departments of education, Nagata pointed out that, in Pakistan, although primary school survival rate is 70 percent, gender gap still exists with only 68 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 71 percent for boys. Specifically in the case of Punjab, she said, primary school survival rate today is better with 76 percent, but not without a gender gap of 8 percent points with 72 percent girls’ survival rate compared to 80 percent for boys. She also pointed out that average per student spending in primary level (age 5-9) was better in Punjab: Rs 6,998, compared to the national average. In [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], although almost the same amount (Rs 6,985) as in Punjab is spent per child, the primary school survival rate is only 53 percent. Girls’ survival rate is slightly better with 54 percent than that of boys which is 52 percent. Literate Pakistan Foundation, a non-profit organization, which was established in 2003, is a case study, which brings to light the solutions for removing this menace from its roots. It works to improve rate of literacy in Pakistan.

The data of the survey shows that in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], primary school survival rate is 67 percent which is lower than the national average of 70 percent. Furthermore, gender gap also exists with only 65 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to that of boys which is 68 percent. Per-student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is Rs 8,638. In [[Sindh]], primary school survival rate is 63percent, with a gender gap of only 67 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 60 percent for boys. Per student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Sindh is Rs 5,019. Nagata made reference to the survey report and mentioned that the most common reason in Pakistan for children (both boys and girls) of age 10 to 18 years leaving school before completing primary grade is "the child not willing to go to school", which may be related to quality and learning outcome. She said, however, and sadly, for the girls living in rural communities the second highest reason for dropout is "parents did not allow" which might be related to prejudice and cultural norm against girls.

Early Filipinos devised and used their own system of writings from 300 BC, which derived from the [[Brahmic family of scripts]] of [[History of India|Ancient India]]. [[Baybayin]] became the most widespread of these derived scripts by the 11th century.

Early chroniclers, who came during the first Spanish expeditions to the islands, noted the proficiency of some of the natives, especially the chieftain and local kings, in [[Sanskrit]], [[Old Javanese]], [[Old Malay]], and several other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |title=The Laguna Copperplate Inscription |publisher=A Philippine Leaf |last=Santos |first=Hector |date=26 October 1996 |accessdate=23 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121194304/http://bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |archivedate=21 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergreen|first=Laurence|title=Over The Edge of The World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe|location=New York|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Spanish colonization of the islands, reading materials were destroyed to a far much less extent compared to the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Education and literacy was introduced only to the [[Peninsulars|Peninsulares]] and remained a privilege until the Americans came.

The Americans introduced the public schools system to the country which drove literacy rates up. English became the [[lingua franca]] in the Philippines. It was only during a brief period in the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] that the Japanese were able to teach their [[Japanese language|language]] in the Philippines and teach the children their written language.

After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], the Philippines had the highest literacy rates in Asia. It nearly achieved universal literacy once again in the 1980s and 1990s. Ever since then, the literacy rate has plummeted only to start regaining a few percentage years back.{{when|date=March 2017}}

The [[Department of Education (Philippines)|DepEd]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|CHED]], and other academic institutions encourage children to improve literacy skills and knowledge. The government has a program of literacy teaching starting in kindergarten. New reforms are being brought in shifting to a K-12 system which will teach children their regional languages before English, as opposed to the ten-year basic education program which teaches English and Filipino, the country's two official languages, from Grade 1.

Approximately 56% of Australians aged 15 to 74 achieve Level 3 literacy or above [http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4228.0Main+Features202011-12 Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011-2012] and 83% of five-year-olds are on track to develop good language and cognitive skills [http://www.aedc.gov.au/resources/detail/aedc-2012-summary-report Australian Early Development Census 2012 summary report]. In 2012-2013, Australia had 1515 public library service points, lending almost 174 million items to 10 million members of Australian public library services, at an average per capita cost of just under AU$45 [http://www.nsla.org.au/sites/www.nsla.org.au/files/publications/NSLA.Aust_Pub_Lib_Stats_2012-13.pdf Australian Public Library Statistics 2012-2013].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9136">'''Martin Barooshian''' (born 1929, [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]]) is an American painter and printmaker. He is known for his ability to weave a tapestry of art historical influences with modernist elements and a contemporary sensibility. His work frequently dances the line of [[Surrealism]] and [[Expressionism]], often with a [[pop art|pop]] and [[op art]] edge, incorporating aspects of primitive, [[Romanticism|Romantic]], and [[Renaissance art]]. He has worked in a wide variety of media from miniature etchings to oversized oils on canvas. These have included [[printmaking|woodcuts, lithographs, etchings and engravings with aquatint and soft ground]], [[monotyping|monotypes]], gouache and watercolor paintings, and oils. He is also known for his technical skill and innovation.&lt;ref name="Russo"&gt;Russo, Michael (2017) Martin Barooshian: The Complete Graphic Works from Adam to Zeus, 1948–1970. Wakefield, MA: Society for the Preservation of American Artistic Heritage. {{ISBN|978-0-9991899-9-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barooshian_etching_Love_Scene_from_Faust.tif|thumb|right|Martin Barooshian. ''Love Scene from Faust'', 1956. Engraving, aquatint, and soft ground. 12 x 15 3/8 in.]] 
Barooshian is a restless innovator with work that has moved through many periods with varying styles and transitions. However, Barooshian defines himself as a [[Biomorphism|Biomorphic]] Abstract Surrealist after his first personal artistic breakthrough and mature style. Cate McQuaid--art critic for [[The Boston Globe]]--dubbed Barooshian’s biomorphic surrealist style as “[[Pablo Picasso]] meets [[Stan Lee]],” recognizing the blend of the modern with the contemporary. Further, she recognized that Barooshian held firm to his own artistic vision and was “not a follower of fashions” but instead “has always defined his own style…against the grain of the art scene.”&lt;ref&gt; McQuaid, Cate. “Not a Follower of Fashions: Painter Barooshian Has Always Defined His Own Style.” Boston Globe 25 May 2006: E10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barooshian has enjoyed a 70-year career as an artist and continues to actively create new works. Susan Faxon, Associate Director and Curator of the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]], summed up her experience of reviewing Barooshian’s oeuvre: “It was clear that [Barooshian] had devoted a lifetime to the making of art and that he was still fully engaged on a daily basis in the creative process. So too it was clear that here was an artist whose sweep was wide, whose influences and interests were many, whose output was prodigious, and whose exuberance, inventiveness, imagination, and artistic commitment was boundless.“&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt; 

A catalogue raisonne of Barooshian’s prints from 1948-1970 has been completed.&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt;

==Exhibitions, collections, and awards==

Barooshian has participated in hundreds of shows around the world, including over 50 one-man shows. His work is in the permanent collection of many important museums around the globe including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection#!?q=Barooshian "Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Museum of Modern Art]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/artists/345?locale=en "MoMA Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/search?search_api_views_fulltext=Barooshian "MFA Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/artist-info.2972.html "National Gallery of Art Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://accessaddison.andover.edu/?sid=143994&amp;x=6493355 "Addison Gallery Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;. He has won several awards including the Albert H. Whitin Traveling Fellowship, the Print Prize from the [[National Academy of Design]], and the Dorothy Lathrop Award from the Print Club of Albany.&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt;

==Background==

Barooshian was born in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]] as the first of three children to Armenian immigrant parents, survivors of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Barooshian studied at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts|School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] (SMFA) with [[Karl Zerbe]], [[Ture Bengtz]], and Richard C. Bartlett. He studied lithography in Paris with Gaston Dorfinant and Jean Pons. Perhaps the greatest influence on Barooshian’s development was the time he spent in the early-1950s with [[Stanley William Hayter]] at his famed etching and engraving studio [[Atelier 17]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barooshian"&gt;Barooshian, Martin. “Reflections on Atelier 17 and Lithography Studios in 1950s Paris.” Journal of the Print World Summer 2004: 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the fourth and fifth year diplomas earned at SFMA, Barooshian also earned a Bachelor of Science in Education degree from [[Tufts University]] and a Master of Arts in Art History degree from [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name="Discovering"&gt; “Discovering the Art of Martin Barooshian: Surrealist Works of the 1950s.” Journal of the Print World Summer 2001: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Barooshian served in the United States Army, though he was never deployed.&lt;ref&gt;ancestry.com military records&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:My_Asia_Minor_by_Martin_Barooshian,_color_viscosity_etching.jpg|thumb|left|''My Asia Minor'', 1965. Color viscosity intaglio with aquatint and soft ground. 24 x 18 3/4 in.]]Barooshian enjoyed very early success following his “discovery” by famed American etcher [[John Taylor Arms]].&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt; This exposure directly led directly to the [[Library of Congress]] acquiring a complete portfolio of his woodcuts when Barooshian was only aged 22.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=barooshian "Library of Congress Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt; Childs Gallery in Boston held Barooshian’s first one-man show in 1951. &lt;ref name="Discovering" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; “One Man Show for Artist.” The Armenian Reporter-Spectator 13 Oct. 1951: 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barooshian was introduced by his then girlfriend Reba Stewart to the art community of Provincetown, MA where Barooshian found creative kinship throughout the 1950s&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt;. Barooshian is represented in Provincetown by The Julie Heller Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juliehellergallery.com/martin-barooshian "Julie Heller Gallery"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atelier 17 and color viscosity etching ==
While at Atelier 17, Baooshian was taught the [[Viscosity printing|color viscosity etching]] techniques developed by Hayter and his colleagues. Previous to this time in Paris, Barooshian’s graphics output was largely woodcuts and lithographs. However, with intaglio etching, he found the graphics medium that best allowed him to express his personal vision and that would dominate his printmaking for decades.&lt;ref name="Barooshian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Helen A. “Gorky’s Influences on a 40-Year Career.” The New York Times 9 May 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Barooshian continued to adapt the concepts of color viscosity etching to his own needs, becoming one of its most important masters. Of these works, critic Malcolm Preston wrote, “Barooshian’s prints enjoy a uniqueness. His heavily etched surfaces, which produce bold relief and strong textural areas, along with an interesting use of color, are contemporary elements that when joined to the past mark Martin Barooshian as a distinctly individual graphic artist.”&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Malcolm. “Borrowed Originals.” Newsday [New York] 24 May 1972: 6A.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] mounted a major exhibition of 45 of Barooshian's color viscosity etchings, purchasing three for their permanent collection.&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt;
==Professional commitment==

Barooshian served as president of the [[Society of American Graphic Artists]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/13/nyregion/long-island-guide-artist-in-wonderland.html "Artist in Wonderland NYT 1981"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the vice president of the U.S. Committee of the International Association of Art for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]].&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt;

Beginning in 1960 and for over a decade, Barooshian was the supervisor of the Graphics Workshop for Professionals at the [[Pratt Institute]] Graphic Art Center in Manhattan. During this period, the Pratt Workshop was a pioneering place of learning and innovation. While at Pratt, Barooshian had the opportunity to work with many of the major [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]] of the period, teaching lithography to [[Barnett Newman]].&lt;ref name="Russo" /&gt;

The '''Masdar Institute of Science and Technology''' (Masdar Institute) was a graduate level, research-oriented university focused on alternative energies, sustainability, and environmental research. In 2017 it merged with two other institutions in Abu Dhabi to create [[Khalifa University]], and its previous structure now hosts the research backbone of the new university, referred as the "Masdar City campus". It was located in [[Masdar City]] in [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]].

Masdar Institute was an integral part of the non-profit side of the [[Masdar Initiative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.masdar.ae/en/masdar/our-story |title=About Masdar |publisher=Masdar Initiative |accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first institution to occupy [[Masdar City]]. The Technology and Development Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] provided scholarly assessment and advice to Masdar Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mit-tdp/www/ |title=MIT-TDP - Technology and Development Program - Projects |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|04}}, the collaborative agreement between the two institutions is still in place and currently hosts several exchange students from the legacy cohorts.&lt;ref name="mit-mi-cp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/mit-mi-cp/ |title=Masdar Institute and MIT Collaborative Program |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Masdar Institute was established on February 25, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/111720.html ADFEC signs a cooperative agreement with The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210101525/http://www.ameinfo.com/111720.html |date=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, the Institute employed 85 faculty members and had an enrollment of 456 students.&lt;ref name="Fast facts" /&gt; The establishment of Masdar Institute was part of a resource diversification policy for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi's leadership views research and education in alternative energy as a keystone for the future development of the emirate and expressed their commitment through the establishment of [[Masdar Initiative]], [[Masdar City]] and the [[Zayed Future Energy Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Opening address of the World Future Energy Summit by H.H. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of The U.A.E. Armed Forces. Available at: [http://www.wfes08.com/files/hh_sheihk_mohammed_bin_zayed_al_nahyan.pdf WFES presentations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's interim provost, Behjat Al Yousuf, was appointed in May 2015. She previously served as the Dean of Students at Masdar.&lt;ref name="provost" /&gt; In 2017, Masdar Institute was merged with two other institutions to form [[Khalifa University]].&lt;ref name="wamae20170220"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302598855 |title=Khalifa bin Zayed issues Decree to establish Khalifa University of Science and Technology |publisher=Emirates News Agency |date=February 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mekong Institute''' (MI) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] (IGO) run by six governments in the [[Greater Mekong Sub-region]] (GMS): [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Lao PDR]], [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. MI delivers various programs and activities focusing on human resource development and capacity building for regional cooperation and integration.

==History==
Mekong Institute (MI) began implementing training programs in 1996 after Thailand signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with [[New Zealand]].

Initially, MI mainly conducted training activities for middle-senior level government officials in the [[Greater Mekong Sub-region]] (GMS) to assist them in moving towards a market economy. In 2003, with the creation and signing of the MI Charter, MI evolved into a non-profit autonomous organization. Since then, it has focused more on rural development, good governance, and trade and investment facilitation.

In 2009, after further development, the Bill for the Protection of the Operation of Mekong Institute was signed and a royal decree was issued by H.M. the King of [[Thailand]]. MI was thereby declared and acknowledged as an [[intergovernmental organization]] (IGO) providing human resource development programs as well as other capacity development learning programs.

As of 2015, MI has over 6000 alumni and accomplished over 80 research projects related to the development of the sub-region with the support of more than 40 national and international development and implementing partners. After more than 18 years of service, MI continues to take on multi-sector programs in collaboration with various partners, both in public and private sectors, to deliver effective programs.

==Programs==

===Agricultural Development and Commercialization (ADC)===
The Agricultural Development and Commercialization (ADC) concentrates on improving agricultural productivity and profitability. The program also provides knowledge and skills to facilitate linkages in agricultural development and commercialization to all relevant actors with the knowledge and skills needed to enhance agriculture production and marketing in the regional context.

===Trade and Investment Facilitation (TIF)===
Trade and Investment Facilitation (TIF) concentrates on establishing capacity and a supportive environment for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to address entire value chains through engaging with business associations, chamber of commerce and governmental agencies  involved  in  trade  and  SME development in the GMS countries.

===Innovation and Technological Connectivity (ITC)===
Innovation and Technological Connectivity (ITC) responds to the emergence and application of innovation and technological connectivity by developing initiatives to address issues in the GMS countries.

==Special Projects==

===Capacity Development for More Inclusive and Equitable Growth in the Greater Mekong Sub-region: East-West Economic Corridor (EWEC)===
EWEC, funded by the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]] (SDC), facilitates and provides capacity development programs to farmers, SMEs, government agencies, and business development service providers involved in agricultural value chains. The aim of the project is to further develop economic growth in the corridor.

==Residential Training Center==
Mekong Institute Residential Training Center is situated inside [[Khon Kaen University]] and includes the following training facilities:

*Three conference rooms fully equipped with 24-hour wireless internet service, audio-visual equipment and training materials
*GMS Resource Center
*Thirty-five standard hotel rooms (with 24-hour internet access)
*Two-storey annex with a VIP reception room

A '''reference work''' is a [[book]] or [[periodical literature|periodical]] (or [[electronic publishing|its electronic equivalent]]) to which one can refer for [[information]]. The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually ''referred'' to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. [[index (publishing)|Indices]] are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated [[edition (book)|edition]]s are usually published as needed, in some cases [[annual publication|annually]] (e.g. ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', ''[[Who's Who]]''). Reference works include [[dictionary|dictionaries]], [[thesaurus]]es, [[encyclopedia]]s, [[almanac]]s, [[bibliography|bibliographies]], and [[Library catalog|catalogs]] (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists).&lt;ref name=Library&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Santo Tomas Miguel de Benavides Library|title=The Reference Materials|url=http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|accessdate=3 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507153507/http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as [[application software]], [[CD-ROM]]s, [[DVD]]s, or online through the [[Internet]].

A reference work is useful to its users if they attribute some degree of [[trust (emotion)|trust]].

==Reference book==
In comparison, a '''reference book''' or reference-only book in a [[library]] is one that may only be used in the library and may not be borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense), which are, usually, used briefly or photocopied from, and therefore, do not need to be borrowed. Keeping reference books in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Some reference-only books are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from [[library circulation|circulating]] items. Some libraries consist entirely, or to a large extent, of books which may not be borrowed.

==Electronic resources==
An electronic resource is a piece of information that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information that is available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AllWords.com|title=Electronic Resources|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-electronic+resource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries offer numerous types of electronic resources, such as subject research guides, indices, electronic books and texts, electronic journals, library catalogs, reference sources, statistical sources, sound recordings, and image databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Chicago Library|title=Types of Electronic Resources|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/net/types.html|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sheema Kermani's dance.jpg|thumb|Kermani performing at the Sufi Conference in Sind]]
'''Sheema Kermani''' (born in 1951) is a Pakistani social activist, theater director and exponent of [[Bharatnatyam]] dance. 

Kermani was born into a middle-class educated family in [[Rawalpindi]], [[Pakistan]]. She went to the Convent of Jesus and Mary in Karachi. Later she went to London to earn a degree in arts and returned to Pakistan. She realized that women in the Pakistani society were not able to get equality in the society so she started a movement called 'Tehrik-e-Niswan' (Women's Movement) and raised her voice for their rights, health issues, education and equality.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

She studied [[Bharatanatyam]] under Leela Samson and [[Odissi]] under Aloka Panicker during her visits to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sheema Kermani|url = http://wikipeacewomen.org/wpworg/en/?page_id=2190/|website = Wiki Peace Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sheema Kermani|url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/the-unofficial-dancer/article6129963.ece|website = The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latest appearance==
Kermani recently appeared at the shrine of Sehwan Sharif after the barbaric suicide attack and performed [[dhamal]] (a Sufi dance form). She gave a passionate performance and told the media that nobody can stop music and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sehwan Sharif|url = https://tribune.com.pk/story/1334059/nobody-can-stop-dance-music-says-sheema-kermani-dhamaal-sehwan-sharif/|website = Nobody Can Stop Music &amp; Dance (by Sheema Kermani)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She performed at the Faiz Aman Mela, Lahore where she paid a tribute to Asma Jahangir. She said we can bring peace, harmony and equality by loving each other and by sharing the message of love with each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3538">A '''spelling test''' is an assessment of a person's (usually a student's) ability to spell words correctly. Spelling tests are usually given in school during language arts class, to see how well each student has learned the most recent spelling lesson.  Typical intervals for spelling tests are one per week throughout the school year, except for [[spelling bee]]s, which are generally held once per year.

== Types of spelling tests ==
There are generally four types of spelling tests. In an oral spelling test, the teacher pronounces each word out loud and the students write each word down.  In a spelling bee-type test (see ''[[spelling bee]]'' below), each student is asked individually one-at-a-time to spell a (different) specific word out loud.  In a proofreading-style test, sentences or paragraphs are given to the student on one or more sheets of paper, and the student must find the incorrectly spelled words and supply the correct spellings in the spaces provided.  In a multiple choice spelling test, two or more spellings are given for each word in the test, and the student must place a mark next to the one that is correct.  The main difference between most spelling tests at school and a spelling bee is that in a spelling bee the students do not get to know in advance which words will be tested, but for regular spelling tests they do.

=== Spelling bee ===
{{main article|Spelling bee}}

One very difficult kind of spelling test is the spelling bee: a competition where contestants, usually children, are asked to spell English words. The practice originated in the United States and has since spread to elsewhere in the English-speaking world, especially North America. It is not, however, a very familiar concept in the most Commonwealth nations, where, if the term is known at all, it is usually perceived as a peculiar American tradition.  Every year in the United States, there is a national spelling bee involving most primary and secondary schools in the country; in addition to being awarded a scholarship, the winners in each age group get to meet the President of the United States.

== Preparing for a Spelling Test ==
[[File:Experimental Spelling Test.png|thumb|[[Wide Range Achievement Test|WRAT]] pre- and post-test results for experimental and control groups]]

=== Repetition ===
In this method, the student typically writes out each word in the current spelling lesson a set number of times each, for example, 50 to 100 times.

=== Making mnemonics ===
{{main article|Mnemonic}}

One of the most effective ways to memorize spellings is to make up [[mnemonics]] to help remember them. A [[mnemonic]] is a memory trick which associates the thing that is to be remembered with something else to make it easier. For spelling, it can be the exaggerated pronunciation of a word, like ''indepenDENT''. Or it might be a silly sentence or visual image to help remember the word, like "the independents all '''dented''' their cars with sledgehammers". Or it might describe a key aspect of a word to help remember it, like "all the vowels in ''c'''e'''m'''e'''t'''e'''ry'' are the same: three little '''''e''''s'', each on its own little tombstone."

'''Student construction brigades''' ({{lang-ru|Студенческие строительные отряды (стройотряды, ССО,}} ''stroyotryad'', ''SSO'')) are temporary [[construction]] teams composed of students in [[universities]] and other institutions of higher education to work, usually during [[school holiday|vacation]]s.  This form originated under the control of [[Komsomol]] of the [[Soviet Union]].

The ''stroyotryad'' members had [[khaki]]/[[camouflage green]]-colored uniforms with [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s and [[badge]]s indicating the association.

There are efforts to revive the approach in modern [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]].

==Soviet Union==
Originated in 1959 at the Physics Department of the [[Moscow State University]]. From the mid-sixties they became an all-Union movement.

==Belarus==
In Belarus, the student brigades enjoy privileges by decree #222 of President [[Lukashenko]] by May 12, 2006: they are free from [[income tax]] and use higher [[wage]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brsm.bntu.by/strotr.html "Student Brigade"], a [[Belarusian Republican Youth Union]] webpage {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
The tradition of ''stroyotryads'' in Russia continued after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. Since 2003 there have been talks to revive the framework, with coordination and centralization. Expectations and attitudes are mixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhr.ru/index/jobmarket/russia/6970,0.html "''Stroyotryads'' Will Be Revived in Russia"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction brigades in Russia were revived by efforts of the [[Young Guard of United Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012254/http://mger2020.ru/nextday/2009/04/09/5678 Construction brigades: breakthrough!]. [[Young Guard of United Russia]] website. 13 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science]] of the [[Russian Federation]] and were active in preparation to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]].

'''''The Chronicle of Higher Education''''' is a [[newspaper]] and [[website]] that presents news, information, and jobs for college and [[Faculty (academic staff)|university faculty]] and [[student affairs]] professionals (staff members and administrators). A subscription is required to read some articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Education: The Candid Chronicle| journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date = May 13, 1974| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908614,00.html/| accessdate = March 29, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100217050652/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908614,00.html| archivedate = February 17, 2010| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Chronicle'', based in [[Washington, D.C.]], is a major news service in United States academic affairs. It is published every weekday online and appears weekly in print except for every other week in June, July, and August and the last three weeks in December (a total of 42 issues a year). In print, ''The Chronicle'' is published in two sections: section A with news and job listings, and section B, ''The Chronicle Review,'' a magazine of arts and ideas.

It also publishes ''[[The Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'', a newspaper for the nonprofit world; ''The Chronicle Guide to Grants'', an electronic database of corporate and foundation grants; and the [[Web portal]] [[Arts &amp; Letters Daily]].

== History ==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
[[Corbin Gwaltney]] was the founder and had been the editor of the [[alumni magazine]] of the [[Johns Hopkins University]] since 1949. In 1957, he joined in with editors from magazines of several other colleges and universities for an editorial project to investigate issues in higher education in perspective. The meeting occurred on the day the first [[Sputnik]] circled the Earth, October 4, 1957, so the "Moonshooter" project was formed as a supplement on higher education for the college magazines. The college magazine editors promised 60 percent of one issue of their magazine to finance the supplement. The first ''Moonshooter Report'' was 32 pages long and titled ''American Higher Education, 1958''. They sold 1.35 million copies to 15 colleges and universities. By the project's third year, circulation was over three million for the supplement.&lt;ref name="DEPASQUALE042000"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = De Pasquale| first = Sue| title = A Model of Lively Thought| journal = Johns Hopkins Magazine| publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University]]| date = April 2000| url = http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/0400web/corbin.html| accessdate = March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BALDWINJ2006"&gt;Cf. Baldwin, Joyce (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Gwaltney left ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'' to become the first full-time employee of the newly created "Editorial Projects for Education" (EPE, later renamed "Editorial Projects in Education") starting in an office in his apartment in [[Baltimore]] and later moving to an office near the Johns Hopkins campus.&lt;ref name="BALDWINPL1995"&gt;Cf. Baldwin, Patricia L. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; He realized that higher education would benefit from a news publication.&lt;ref name="DEPASQUALE042000"/&gt;

He and other board members of EPE met to plan a new publication which would be called ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;ref name="DEPASQUALE042000"/&gt;

''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' was officially founded in 1966 by Corbin Gwaltney.&lt;ref name="DEPASQUALE042000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BALDWINJ2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BALDWINPL1995"/&gt; and its first issue was launched in November 1966.&lt;ref name="EPEMISSIONANDHISTORY"&gt;[http://www.edweek.org/info/about/history.html "Editorial Projects in Education: Mission and History"], ''[[Education Week]]'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''AAUP Bulletin'', Vol. 52, No. 3 (September 1966), [[American Association of University Professors]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was meant for those involved in higher education, one of the founding ideas was that the general public had very little knowledge about what was going on in higher education and the real issues involved.&lt;ref name="BALDWINPL1995"/&gt; Originally, it didn't accept any advertising and didn't have any staff-written editorial opinions. It was supported by grants from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name="BRITANNICA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronicle of Higher Education|work= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=September 12, 2010 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1586347/Chronicle-of-Higher-Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in its history, advertising would be accepted, especially for jobs in higher education, and this would allow the newspaper to be financially independent.&lt;ref name="BALDWINPL1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BRITANNICA"/&gt;

By the 1970s, the ''Chronicle'' was attracting enough advertising to become self-sufficient, and in 1978 the board of EPE agreed to sell the newspaper to its editors.&lt;ref name="VIADERO2006"&gt;Viadero, Debra, [http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/09/06/02edweek-s2.h26.html Education Week: "A Media Organization With Many Faces"], ''[[Education Week]]'', September 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; EPE sold the ''Chronicle'' to the editors for $2,000,000 in cash and $500,000 in services that Chronicle would provide to EPE.&lt;ref name="BALDWINPL1995"/&gt; Chronicle went from a legal [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] status to a [[For-profit corporation|for-profit]] company.

This sale shifted the focus of non-profit EPE to K-12 education. Inspired by the model established by the ''Chronicle'', and with the support of the Carnegie Corporation and other philanthropies, EPE founded ''[[Education Week]]'' in September 1981.&lt;ref name="EPEMISSIONANDHISTORY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VIADERO2006"/&gt;

In 1993, the ''Chronicle'' was one of the first newspapers to appear on the Internet, as a [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] service. It released an [[iPad]] version in 2011.

The ''Chronicle'' grossed $33 million in advertising revenues and $7 million in circulation revenues in 2003.&lt;ref name="NYT02142005"/&gt;

== Awards ==
Over the years, the paper has been a finalist and winner of many journalism awards. In 2005, two special reports – on [[diploma mill]]s and [[plagiarism]] – were selected as finalists in the reporting category for a [[National Magazine Award]]. It was a finalist for the award in general excellence every year from 2001 to 2005.

In 2007, ''The Chronicle'' won an ''[[Utne Reader]]'' Independent Press Award for political coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Winners of the 2007 Utne Independent Press Awards | journal = [[Utne Reader]]| date = January–February 2008| url = http://www.utne.com/2008-01-01/Media/Winners-of-the-2007-Utne-Independent-Press-Awards.aspx?page=6/| accessdate = March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its award citation, ''Utne'' called ''The Chronicle Review'' "a fearless, free-thinking section where academia's best and brightest can take their gloves off and swing with abandon at both sides of the increasingly predictable political divide." ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', and ''[[The American Prospect]]'' were among the finalists in the category.

He was murdered at the age of 20 by members of a [[Radical nationalism in Russia|far right nationalist]] group in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/04/7519D643-4B94-4A1F-856C-83324E05520F.html Russia: A Timeline Of Recent Racial Incidents]. [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. April 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kacharava was born into the family of an army officer near [[Chernobyl]]. He studied at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and was involved in a student anti-fascist and anarchist group that organized anti-fascist demonstrations and philanthropic actions. In 2003, he founded the [[hardcore punk]] band Sandinista!, for which he played guitar. In 2005, he also played for the crust punk band Distress, which toured [[Sweden]].

On 13 November 2005, Kacharava was stabbed to death in St. Petersburg’s [[Vosstaniya Square]] after sharing meals for [[Food Not Bombs]], receiving five wounds in the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/reports/under_siege/2-framework.asp |title=Minorities Under Siege: Hate Crimes and Intolerance in the Russian Federation |accessdate=2008-06-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629145037/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/reports/under_siege/2-framework.asp |archivedate=June 29, 2007 |df= }}. [[Human Rights First]]. Retrieved on 2008-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; A companion was also stabbed and seriously wounded. Observers believed that the attack may have been motivated by his activism in the anti-fascist movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61671.htm Russia: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices – 2005]. [[United States Department of State]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]. March 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The response and the trial==
Over 3,000 St. Petersburg State University students petitioned the [[President of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]], to find and punish the murderers. In December 2005, police arrested seven suspects who eventually admitted to the crime. On 7 August 2007, Alexander Shabalin was sentenced to 12 years in prison on charges of a murder and [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred]]. Six other members of the gang, who held Kacharava and prevented him from resisting, were charged with inciting social hatred, and were given [[suspended sentence]]s.&lt;ref name="sptimes"&gt;
Stolyarova, Galina. [http://www.sptimes.ru/story/26018 Extremist Group Steps Up Pressure on Immigrants]. [[The St. Petersburg Times]]. Retrieved on 2008-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main defendant in the trial was 14 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfe.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/08/60fff88b-64af-4126-839b-741227a66b32.html Russia: Seven Sentenced In Killing Of Antiracism Campaigner], by Claire Bigg, [[RFE/RL]], August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian human rights association Agora considered the trial as the most important achievement of human rights defenders in Russian courts in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.newizv.ru/news/2008-01-16/82606/ Победная десятка: Правозащитники составили рейтинг прецедентных дел 2007 года], Евгения Зубченко, [[Novye Izvestiya]], 15 января 2008 г.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kacharava’s family, friends and colleagues remained convinced that Kacharava was the victim of an organized and well-armed [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group.  His friends testified that he had been followed, received threats by telephone, and been targeted before.  According to Galina Stolyarova citing the victim family's lawyer in [[Transitions Online]], the court accepted the scenario in which the murderer claimed he had spontaneously suggested beating up an anti-fascist activist, and did not charge the other assaulters as accomplices in the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://right.karelia.ru/eng/index.php?razdel=articles&amp;page=2007083050 Gangs: Vigilante Justice], Galina Stolyarova, [[Transitions online]], 2007-09-04. Retrieved on 2008-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Kacharava’s death led some of Russia’s young anti-fascists to change tactics and use violence against neo-Nazis and racists.&lt;ref name="sptimes"/&gt;

The '''University of Bristol admissions controversy''' refers to an historic dispute over the admissions process for the [[University of Bristol]] in the United Kingdom which occurred in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/mar/05/highereducation.accesstouniversity |title=Funding chief backs Bristol in access row &amp;#124; ''The Guardian''. |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-03-05|accessdate=2009-08-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2003 incident was caused by concerns over bias in the admissions system that were perceived as favouritism towards state school students&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In the United Kingdom a state school is a government funded school which provides education free of charge to pupils. In official literature they are known as maintained schools and include a wide variety of schools including faith based schools and grammar schools. All schools which are not state schools are independent schools. See [[State school]].&lt;/ref&gt; after the rejection of some students with strong academic records&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2798507.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Bristol denies admissions bias |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-02-26 |accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who attended  [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]]s.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In the United Kingdom a public school refers to a privately funded school funded by the payment of tuition fees. The terms "private school", "public school" and "independent school" are used fairly interchangeably to refer to fee paying school which operate free of the state although "public school" is usually reserved for the leading fee charging independent schools. In the United States the term "public school" refers to government funded schools. See [[Public school (government funded)|Public school]].&lt;/ref&gt; The University's widening participation policy allowed the awarding of slightly lower offers to promising applicants from schools with lower academic achievement. Controversy surrounding this policy resulted in a brief boycott of the University by some independent schools and intense media debate about the fairness of the admissions policy as well as praise and criticism of the policy and the boycott from politicians, student leaders and education groups. The boycott was lifted after two months when the Independent School's Council expressed satisfaction with the fairness of the admissions system.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/apr/29/publicschools.schools | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Private schools lift Bristol ban | date=2003-04-29 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later a survey of independent schools concluded that: "It is likely that rejections which may have seemed discriminatory to parents and schools have in fact, been due to a large rise in suitably qualified applicants"&lt;ref name="guardian2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/aug/17/schools.accesstouniversity |title=Private schools admit no bias in university selection &amp;#124; ''The Guardian''. |work=The Guardian |date= 2005-08-17|accessdate=2009-08-31 |location=London | first=Polly | last=Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independent evidence was compiled suggesting that claims of bias were wildly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bias-against-private-pupils-at-bristol-is-wildly-exaggerated-592296.html|title=Bias against private pupils at Bristol is 'wildly exaggerated' - Education News, Education |work=The Independent|date=2003-03-25 |accessdate=2009-08-25 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy has now been superseded by the reality that all British Universities have active 'widening participation' policies designed to increase University applications from lower-achieving schools which tend, de facto, to be state schools.


==Context==
[[Widening participation]] is a Government policy in the United Kingdom which attempts to widen access to higher education by increasing numbers of under-represented groups including ethnic minorities, disabled people and those from lower income families. Widening participation is a strategic aim of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/widen/ |title=Widening participation |publisher=HEFCE |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2010-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924065007/http://hefce.ac.uk/widen/ |archivedate=2010-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the body which allocates funding to Universities. The Bristol admissions dispute is one of two policial controversies over widening participation that occurred during the 2000s. In 2000 the [[Laura Spence Affair]] involved the rejection of a state school student who applied to study Medicine at Oxford University and resulted in similar debate about widening participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-21466/Laura-Spence-row-flares-again.html |title=Laura Spence row flares again  |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/lies-damned-lies--and-laura-spence-698277.html |title=Lies, damned lies - and Laura Spence - Education News, Education |work=The Independent |date=2000-06-08 |accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London | first=Lucy | last=Hodges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol University first introduced a widening participation scheme   in 1999 after the [[Dearing Report]],&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/does-bristol-pick-the-best-599673.html |title=Does Bristol pick the best? - Higher, Education |work=The Independent |date=2003-03-06 |accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a report which gave recommendations to the government on the expansion and funding of the British higher education  system. Bristol's policy was in part a result of this report as well as being a principled attempt by the University to attract applications from state schools, something Bristol has traditionally struggled to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Prof Eric Thomas, Bristol University |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1768564.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Elite uni aims to broaden its appeal |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-01-18 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/03/universities-admissions-social-mobility |title=White, middle-class families dominate top university places &amp;#124; Education |work=The Guardian |date= 2009-02-03|accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London|first=Jessica | last=Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aims of the 1999 Participation Strategy were to:

*Increase applications from students from under-represented groups&lt;ref name="Bristol strategy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xTsV_1RLpi0J:www.bristol.ac.uk/academicregistry/raa/wpur-office/strategy-documents-publications/wpstrategy.doc/+WIDENING+PARTICIPATION+STRATEGY+1999+BRISTOL&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk |title=University of Bristol |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Put in place an admissions system to enable admissions tutors to identify and make offers to applicants from under-represented groups who have the potential to complete our programmes successfully, with the aim of increasing the number of entrants from such groups&lt;ref name="Bristol strategy"/&gt;
*Ensure that students from under-represented groups are given the support they need to achieve the learning outcomes and feel comfortable at Bristol, and to encourage integration of students from all backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Bristol strategy"/&gt;

The University's widening participation policy was reviewed in 2001 when a report called ''The Way Forward'' set out how the University could meet [[HEFCE]] participation targets.&lt;ref name="Bristol strategy"/&gt; Under the access initiative each UCAS application&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In the United Kingdom, applicants apply to University through the [[Universities &amp; Colleges Admissions Service]]. Offers to study may be awarded and these are either conditional on exam performance (e.g. an offer of AAA at [[A-level]]) or unconditional. If an applicant does not meet their offer then a University may reject an applicant. A University need not make the same level of offer to all applicants. See [[UCAS]]&lt;/ref&gt; to Bristol was examined centrally before being passed to University Departments. Applications from schools where the average [[A-level]] grades were less than CCC were "flagged-up" to alert tutors to disadvantage.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt; Bristol's state intake increased from 49.3% in 1998 to 60% in 2003 under the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=175041&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Bristol 'proud' of state pupil surge|work=Times Higher Education |date=2003-02-28 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bristol has been described as "one of the most competitive universities to get into".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/education/1768564.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Elite uni aims to broaden its appeal | date=2002-01-18| accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the controversy the university had the third highest private school intake (only [[Oxbridge]] was higher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3022418.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Student hopefuls descend on Bristol | date=2003-06-26 | accessdate=2010-05-27 | first=Dickon | last=Hooper}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with only 57% of students coming from state school backgrounds.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1768564.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Elite uni aims to broaden its appeal | date=2002-01-18 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some to label it elitist.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In 2003 it was reported that the University has 39,000 applicants for its 3,300 undergraduate places each year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; In 2002 Bristol had 2,000 students were hunting 100 places in history, and 1,500 students of English chasing only 47 places, leading ''[[The Guardian]]'' to argue that many well qualified students would be disappointed.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

==Boycott==
Accusations of bias were first made in 2002 when the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] stated that the admissions procedures for [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[Durham University|Durham]], London School of Economics, Manchester, UCL and Edinburgh should be examined for bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2288265.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Private schools claim university bias | date=2002-09-30 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boycott of the University was announced on 4 March 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Smithers, education correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/mar/05/highereducation.politics |title=Private schools boycott Bristol over selection &amp;#124; UK news |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-03-05|accessdate=2010-09-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] and the [[Girls' Schools Association]] who expressed concern that the admissions policy could lead to the "apparently arbitrary rejection of well-qualified candidates".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/universityaccess/story/0,,907273,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bristol faces boycott over admissions row | date=2003-03-04 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint statement they said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In these circumstances, we must send a clear message to Bristol. We cannot recommend to our colleagues that they should encourage young people to apply to Bristol until such time as the university can assure us that its procedures are fully documented, fair, objective, transparent and consistently applied.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/education/story/0,,910012,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Whose university place is it anyway? | date=2003-03-09 | accessdate=2010-05-27 | first=Edward | last=Gibbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, as it is students who decide which Universities to apply to it was not possible for private schools to prevent their students from applying to Bristol. The "boycott" amounted to schools discouraging sixth formers from applying to Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2818263.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Private schools 'boycott' Bristol |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-03-04 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' described an academic boycott of this kind as "unprecedented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1423753/Private-schools-in-Bristol-boycott.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Private schools in Bristol boycott | first=Liz | last=Lightfoot | date=2003-03-05 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the rejected candidates cited as evidence of bias was Rudi Singh a student at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]]. Singh was rejected from Bristol yet accepted to the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;
Four students with 10A*s at [[GCSE]] and 4 As at [[A-level]] were rejected.

==Reaction==

===University of Bristol===
The University denied any discrimination in the admissions process but reserved the right to take the educational background of students into account when assessing their A-level grades.&lt;ref name="guardian3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/mar/04/highereducation.accesstouniversity |title=Bristol attacks admissions 'fallacy' &amp;#124; ''The Guardian''. |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-03-04|accessdate=2009-08-25 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a written response to the Independent Schools Council, Vice-Chancellor [[Eric Thomas (academic)|Eric Thomas]] stated that the University did not operate a quota system for students from any particular school or social background:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The university does not practice unfair discrimination, it [Bristol] does not operate quotas and it will continue to recruit exceptionally able students from all backgrounds through a selection process that is as fair and straightforward as we can make it. Pupils, not schools, make the decisions about which universities to apply to and we are confident that they will continue to want to study at Bristol.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2003/135 Bristol University | News from the University | Admissions policy]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The University highlighted the fact that it is one of the most popular in the country with over 39,000 students for 3,000 places in 2002.&lt;ref name="guardian3"/&gt; In History, English, Economics and Law competition is so fierce that over 30 students can be competing for one place.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In English there were 47 places and 1500 applicants of whom 500 had a perfect A-level score of AAA at A2, meaning that many top candidates were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/mar/20/highereducation.accesstouniversity |title=A silent revolution &amp;#124; ''The Guardian''. |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-03-20|accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London | first=Adam | last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Thomas (academic)|Eric Thomas]] also emphasised the work the University was doing to "reach out" beyond the middle-classes. In a BBC interview he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a huge raft of initiatives have been implemented. Things like summer schools in which we bring students to the university during the summer to see it, we have relationships with local schools and further education colleges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[University of Bristol]] stated that it is against any kind of discrimination in the admissions process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3014108.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Bristol remains firm on admissions |date=2003-06-23 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the policy of making lower offers to exceptional students from state schools and disadvantaged backgrounds was not to satisfy the government or gain funding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no question of the University attempting to widen participation in order to gain Government cash. Bristol agreed its widening participation strategy in 1998 - long before widening participation became part of Government policy. Work in this field is resource-intensive and funding from the Government helps to cover the costs. The University is not motivated by money but by the desire to recruit the best students and by the recognition that if it is to act fairly and avoid missing out on some of the most able people, it must have regard to factors in addition to predicted A-level grades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newspapers reported that the admissions controversy created tensions between state and private school pupils at the University. Gus Glover a candidate who lost that year's [[University of Bristol Union]] Presidential Election attributed his loss to supporting the admissions policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/09/highereducation.students | work=The Guardian| location=London | title=Inside a university challenged | first=Amelia | last=Hill | date=2003-03-09 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, residents of [[Wills Hall]] wrote letters to the newspaper defending the hall against accusations of [[classism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/16/letters.highereducation | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Positive discrimination? Don't insult me | date=2003-03-16 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Head teachers===
The [[National Association of Head Teachers]], a [[trade union]] which represents [[head teacher]]s in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/about-naht/ |title=NAHT About NAHT |publisher=Naht.org.uk |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815065228/http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/about-naht/ |archive-date=2009-08-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the "HMC and GSA are guilty of gesture politics of the worst kind... They are merely shooting themselves in the foot by pursuing a boycott".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Media commentators===
The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and the ''[[Daily Express]]'' criticised the admissions policies in their headlines.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/mar/04/leadersandreply.mainsection |title=Leader: Admission charges &amp;#124; Politics |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-03-04|accessdate=2009-08-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-230000/These-insidious-social-engineers-destroying-merit-aspiration.html |title=These insidious social engineers destroying merit and aspiration  |work=Daily Mail |date=2003-02-26 |accessdate=2009-08-25 | location=London | first=Melanie | last=Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mail'' greeted the story with the headline "Insidious social engineering destroying merit and aspirations"&lt;ref name="dailymail1"/&gt; and the ''Daily Express'' stated "More students being turned down for being middle class".&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; Journalist [[Simon Heffer]] wrote in the ''Daily Mail'' that he was pleased that "at last the middle-class are fighting back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-228972/Why-middle-classes-enough.html |title=Why we middle classes have had enough  |work=Daily Mail |date=2003-03-05 |accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Heffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He went on to state the controversy could damage Bristol's academic reputation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So some of Britain's top schools are going to 'black' Bristol University for the pernicious social engineering policies it has admitted pursuing. Although this news will probably be treated with glee by the tinpot Trotskyists who run Bristol's admissions policy, it can only bode ill for that university. Denied countless high-calibre students who will then go off to adorn rival establishments, Bristol can only decline,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The then-head of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] [[Trevor Phillips]] expressed surprise that his daughter had been rejected. In ''[[The Times]]'' he stated "Though I have no disagreement with greater access, I would have hoped universities and the government would have a slightly more sophisticated policy than simply 'blacklisting' independent schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/universityaccess/story/0,,911366,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bristol rebuts bias claims by CRE head | date=2003-03-10 | accessdate=2010-05-27 | first=Donald | last=MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politicians===
Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] commented on the controversy, stating that university should grant places on the basis of merit rather than class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/06/uk.highereducation |title=Clarke attacks Bristol boycott &amp;#124; Politics |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-03-06|accessdate=2009-08-25 | location=London | first=Rebecca | last=Smithers}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he wanted to see more working-class people in higher education&lt;ref name="thisislondon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-3667479-details/Blair+wades+into+university+row/article.do |title=Blair wades into university row |work=London Evening Standard |accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was forced to backtrack from comments made by [[Margaret Hodge]] which argued that Universities such as Bristol should be set formal targets for widening access.&lt;ref name="thisislondon1"/&gt;

[[Charles Clarke]], then the Education Secretary, described independent school criticisms as "ill-informed brouhaha"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/mar/05/highereducation.schools |title=Clarke dismisses 'brouhaha' over Bristol admissions &amp;#124; ''The Guardian''. |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-03-05|accessdate=2009-08-25 | location=London | first=Donald | last=MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told schools to ignore the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98448128.html |title=Ignore university boycott, heads told. - Daily Mail (London) |date=2003-03-06 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that it would be inappropriate for government to become too involved in university admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/universityaccess/story/0,,908148,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Clarke dismisses 'brouhaha' over Bristol admissions | first=Donald | last=MacLeod | date=2003-03-05 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then Shadow Education Secretary [[Damian Green]] accused the government of trying to "fiddle admissions for political ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/09/uk.highereducation | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Whose university place is it anyway? | first=Edward | last=Gibbes | date=2003-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[Phil Willis]] said that "social engineering is coming ahead of merit and the development of talent."&lt;ref name="thisislondon1"/&gt;

[[Sir Howard Newby]] chief-executive of the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE), the university funding body argued that Bristol's admissions policies were fair and accused sections of the media of becoming involved in a "moral panic" over [[positive discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=175152&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Update: 14:25 |work=Times Higher Education |date=2003-03-05 |accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
The controversy resulted in applications to Bristol falling for the first time in a decade in the 2004/05 admissions cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3326937/University-feels-pinch-after-boycott-by-schools.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=University feels pinch after boycott by schools | first=Roya | last=Nikkhah | date=2004-02-20 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application numbers fell by 5% although Bristol downplayed this attributing the decrease to random fluctuations in the level of applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3326937/University-feels-pinch-after-boycott-by-schools.html | work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London | title=University feels pinch after boycott by schools | first=Roya | last=Nikkhah | date=2004-02-20 |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentadviser.net/articles/bristol.htm |title=Is the Bristol boycott biting? |publisher=Studentadviser.net |date=2004-01-31 |accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott ended on 29 April 2003 when the chairman of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] expressed satisfaction with the admissions policy for Bristol.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; In response to the controversy the University introduced a new, more transparent admissions policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/20/highereducation.students |title=College to revise admissions policy &amp;#124; UK news |work=The Guardian |date= 2003-06-20|accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=London | first=Rebecca | last=Smithers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Independent Schools Council]] published a report which cleared Bristol of bias.&lt;ref name="guardian2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4161100.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; 'No bias' against private pupils |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-17 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=197933&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=No bias against independent sector applicants by elite institutions, survey finds |work=Times Higher Education |date=2005-08-19 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isc.co.uk/publication_4_0_0_26_80.htm |title=Independent Private Schools - Independent Schools Council |publisher=Isc.co.uk |date=2005-08-17 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120205739/http://www.isc.co.uk/publication_4_0_0_26_80.htm |archive-date=2008-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report surveyed applications by 20,000 private school pupils and found that in 60 of 300 courses surveyed 98% of private school pupils were offered a place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 2009 Bristol rejected giving a "head start" to applicants to disadvantaged backgrounds as part of a  scheme proposed by [[Lord Mandelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=kmccormick |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Bristol-University-won-t-change-admissions-policy/article-1485306-detail/article.html |title=Bristol University admissions &amp;#124; Bristol news |publisher=Thisisbristol.co.uk |accessdate=2010-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109022249/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Bristol-University-won-t-change-admissions-policy/article-1485306-detail/article.html |archive-date=2009-11-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Statistics available from the [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]] published in 2008 show that Bristol's state intake stood at 63.1% a decrease from 65.1% the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frean|first1=Alexandra|title=Fewer state school students at top universities despite costly campaigns|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article4069357.ece|accessdate=17 October 2015|work=Times|date=5 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202215407/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article4069357.ece|archivedate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 2009/2010 shows Bristol's intake from state schools and colleges to be 60.0%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/16/university-participation-hesa-state-school |title=How many people from state school go to your university? &amp;#124; ''The Guardian''. |work=The Guardian |date= 2010-04-16|accessdate=2010-09-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; an identical figure to 2003 when the controversy over admissions occurred.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=175041&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Bristol 'proud' of state pupil surge |work=Times Higher Education |date=2003-02-28 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the University introduced a points based admissions system whereby poorer students “will be given an automatic weighting to their total academic score”.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9450533/Universities-accused-of-socially-engineering-intakes.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Julie | last=Henry | title=Universities accused of socially engineering intakes | date=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the  2012/13 admissions cycle all undergraduate courses used some form of contextual data but the university has refused to state exactly how their scoring system works.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;

In 2013 the head of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] Chris Ramsay said that independent schools could consider a repeat of the 2003 'boycott' if access agreements agreed by the [[Office for Fair Access]] led to systematic discrimination against applicants from independent schools.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“We can influence [universities’] behaviour by advising good students to go or not to go to them, and that’s obviously something that I suspect is very relevant to them...There was a period just under a decade ago where we in independent schools advised students not to apply to Bristol and they didn’t like that. It definitely had an impact. If in the end we felt that a university was systematically operating its admissions in a way which was disadvantaging the candidates for whom in the end we speak, we might say that.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9580257/Public-schools-threaten-university-boycott.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Graeme | last=Paton | title=Public schools threaten university boycott | date=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Washback effect''' refers to the impact of testing on curriculum design, teaching practices, and learning behaviors.&lt;ref name="McKinley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKinley &amp; Thompson|title=Washback Effect in Teaching English as an International Language|journal=TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching|date=Feb 2018|volume=1|url=http://www.englishappliedlinguistics.com/uploads/2/4/1/9/2419477/washback_effect_in_teaching_english_as_an_international_language_author_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influences of testing can be found in the choices of learners and teachers: teachers may teach directly for specific test preparation, or learners might focus on specific aspects of language learning found in assessments. Washback effect in testing is typically seen as either negative, or positive (sometimes referred to as ''washforward'').&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; Washback may be considered harmful to more fluid approaches in [[language education]] where definitions of language ability may be limited; however, it may be considered beneficial when good teaching practices result. Washback can also be positive or negative in that it either maintains or hinders the accomplishment of educational goals. In positive washback, teaching the curriculum becomes the same as teaching to a specific test. Negative washback occurs in situations where there may be a mismatch between the stated goals of instruction and the focus of assessment; it may lead to the abandonment of instructional goals in favor of test preparation.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt;

The effect of a test on learning and teaching is a concept discussed as early as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; Research into washback can be traced back to the early 1980s, when the influence of tests on teaching and learning was first seen as a potential source of [[bias]] due to the accountability of test [[feedback loop|feedback loops]]. As the results of tests became more important to students ([[gatekeeper|gatekeepers]] to future prospects), teachers (evaluation), schools (funding), and states (lawsuits), test preparation as a function of teaching became essential. Tests were made to be economical, using [[multiple choice|multiple-choice questions]] and focusing on [[psychometrics|psychometric]] validity, but perhaps not measuring more complex abilities. Schools and teachers were accountable for student test performance, and thus focused on the skills and outcomes that the tests measured. Given the dynamic interaction between testing and education, the term systematic validity was used to refer to the ways in which a test leads to changes in instruction intended to develop cognitive skills that are being measured by a test.&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Research has shown the variable extent to which washback influences different individuals in different ways, and the difficulty of targeting washback. Significant variability has been noted in the ways that teachers respond to test changes and classroom assessments. Effects may be superficial, indirect, and unpredictable due to individual differences in the way that learning is mediated by teachers, textbook writers, and publishers.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrews, Fullilove, &amp; Wong|title=Targeting washback—a case study|journal=System|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|pages=207-223|doi=10.1016/S0346-251X(02)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washback effect in English language assessment==
With [[globalization]], the world has witnessed an increase in [[Internationalization of Higher Education]], which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of international students in the last 25 years. The prominence of English alongside this internationalization process has also seen the use of international tests of English such as [[TOEIC|Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC)]], [[TOEFL|Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)]], and [[IELTS|International English Language Testing System (IELTS)]] as standard tools in the wider learning community. The increasing weight of these tools in education raises questions about the impact of such tests on teaching and learning, with suggestions that language skills are suffering due to the impact of tests. As English as an International Language (EIL) continues to become more stable through the establishment of clearer features of context-driven English, it is inevitable that there will be significant debate on language norms and proficiency regarding teaching and assessment. The field of applied linguistics should expect to see more specific discussion on the recognition of the way language norms are influenced by use and context,&lt;ref name="McKinley" /&gt; but this remains an unsolved problem in the area of [[language assessment]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Şerif Yenen was born into a middle-class family in the town of [[Ödemiş]] near [[Izmir]] in 1963. After completing middle school in Ödemiş, when he was fourteen, he passed the entrance exams and became a military student at the [[Kuleli Military High School]] in [[Istanbul]], where the instruction was mainly in English. After high school he was accepted in the Department of English Literature and Linguistics at the [[University of Istanbul]] as a military student. After graduation from the university in 1985, he became an officer in the [[Turkish Armed Forces|Turkish Military Forces]], and taught [[English as a Second Language|English as a second language]] for four years at the Maltepe Military High School in Izmir. He left the Army in 1989 and attended tourist guide training programs offered by the Ministry of Tourism of Turkey and became qualified as a national tourist guide.

===Career===
While working as a tourist guide, he published his guidebook, ''Turkish Odyssey'' in English (turkishodyssey.com), in 1997. The content and the design of his website gained attention in the media and won numerous awards.&lt;ref name="atak"&gt;{{cite news
