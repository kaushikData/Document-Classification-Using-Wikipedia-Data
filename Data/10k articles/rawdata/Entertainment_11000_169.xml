'''2K Games (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.''', [[doing business as]] '''2K China''' (formerly '''2K Shanghai'''), was a Chinese [[video game developer]] based in [[Shanghai]].

== History ==
2K Shanghai was founded as a [[subsidiary]] of [[2K Games]] on 9 May 2006, in response to China's rapidly growing gaming market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/09/2k-games-shacks-up-in-shanghai |title=2K Games Shacks Up In Shanghai |first=Andrew |last=Burnes |date=9 May 2006 |website=ign.com |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial projects for the company included doing Chinese localisation for ''[[Civilization IV]]'', developing an original [[intellectual property]], and "serve as a hub for sales, marketing, development and outsourcing opportunities in China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/05/11/take-two-announces-2k-shanghai/ |title=Take-Two announces 2K Shanghai |author= |date= |website=engadget.com |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/take-two-interactive-software-inc-establishes-2k-shanghai |title=Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

Two additional studios, 2K Hangzhou and 2K Chengdu, were founded in 2007 and June 2011, respectively, and 2K Shanghai was renamed 2K China to reflect its overall management role.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On 6 November 2015, 2K Games' [[parent company]], [[Take-Two Interactive]], announced that they had closed down 2K China due to profitability concerns over their in-development title ''[[Borderlands Online]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-online-canceled-developer-shuttered/1100-6432074/ |title=Borderlands Online Canceled, Developer Shuttered |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=6 November 2015 |website=gamespot.com |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the closure, ''Borderlands Online'' was effectively cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development/2k-china-closed-as-borderlands-online-cancelled |title=2K China closed as Borderlands Online cancelled |author= |date= |website=mcvuk.com |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 150 people were made redundant at 2K China and its 2K Hangzhou studio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-11-06-take-two-cancels-borderlands-online-shuts-down-2k-china |title=Take-Two cancels Borderlands Online, shuts down 2K China |first=Jeffrey |last=Matulef |date=6 November 2015 |website=eurogamer.net |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 2K Chengdu was retained as a [[quality assurance]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-11-06-take-two-interactive-closes-2k-china |title=Take-Two Interactive closes 2K China |author= |date= |website=gamesindustry.biz |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alien Breed 2: Assault''''' is a [[video game]] in [[Team17]]'s ''[[Alien Breed (series)|Alien Breed]]'' series and is the second new title in the series since 1996 after ''[[Alien Breed Evolution]]''. It was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]], PlayStation Network  and [[Xbox Live Arcade]] on September 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/alien-breed-2-assault/ Metacritic - Alien Breed 2: Assault]&lt;/ref&gt; The follow-up ''[[Alien Breed 3: Descent]]'' was released November 17, 2010.

The game continues the story of ''Alien Breed Evolution'' (and consequently, ''Alien Breed: Impact'') of engineer Theodore J. Conrad fighting against aliens on the Leopold spaceship.

== Plot ==
''Assault'' is an immediate sequel to ''Alien Breed: Evolution''. Conrad, Chief Engineer of the starship ''Leopold'' , attempts to restart the engines of a hostile, alien-infested [[ghost ship]] that has crashed into his ship dragging them both towards the planet's surface. When this fails, the [[Android (robot)|android]] Mia boards the ghost ship, and Conrad must escort her to the bridge where she can hack into the ship's computers and restart the engines. Upon arrival, Mia finds that she must connect herself to the ship's main computer.

The ships [[artificial intelligence]] then kills Mia and possesses her corpse. It reveals itself to be the ships [[Chief scientific officer|chief science officer]], who became an AI to achieve immortality. It then reveals that the ship is a 300-year-old scientific research vessel from Earth that went missing and that the chief science officer is responsible for the creation of the aliens. Conrad then sets out to destroy the AI in order to restart the engines. The game ends here on a cliffhanger. Multiplayer co-op consists of players taking control of Barnes and Vance who have been sent by Mia to find and help Conrad. After finding him, they are separated by an alien attack, and both are presumed dead.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Alien_Breed_2_Assault_gameplay.jpg|thumb|''Alien Breed 2: Assault'' gameplay without [[GUI]].]]
''Alien Breed 2: Assault'' is a [[third person shooter]] set in a futuristic [[spacecraft]] and played from an [[Isometric view|isometric perspective]]. The player controls the main character Conrad across a series of levels and is tasked with a series of missions to progress in the story, and finish each level. Whilst accomplishing these missions, the player will find a variety of alien enemies who will attack on sight. To fight these aliens, the player is provided with a set of different weapons and tools, which can be improved. Ammunition and items such as med kits can only be optained through computer terminals, which also serve as save points.

Conrad can move freely in all directions; the camera can also be rotated at will by the player. Conrad can be affected by the environment, and he will receive damage if hit by explosions, fires, electrical disturbances, and enemy turrets. Every level has an amount of data pads, which contain relevant information about the game's story. ''Assault'' includes a survival mode that puts the player to fight as much aliens as possible before being taken down. It can be played in both single and multiplayer modes.

The '''Australian Screen Association''' (ASA) (formerly known as '''Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft''') is an [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]] lobby group that was established in 2004. Its aim is to protect the film and television industry and retailers from what it claims are adverse impacts of [[copyright infringement]] in Australia. The Australian Screen Association is affiliated with the United Kingdom organisation, [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] and the United States organisation [[MPAA]].

ASA actively works to reduce [[camcorder]] recording of films screened in cinemas. It is also dedicated to educating people about its own view of copyright infringement.

In mid-2011, the [[Pirate Party Australia]] accused AFACT of intimidating ISPs after they threatened unspecified actions if they didn't engage with the organisation in talks on [[file-sharing]].&lt;ref name="asaisps"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/afact-strong-arming-isps-pirate-party-339318464.htm |title=AFACT strong-arming ISPs: Pirate Party |author=Renai LeMay |accessdate=14 January 2012 |date=13 July 2011 |work=ZDNet Australia |publisher=CBS Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classified [[WikiLeaks]] cable revealed that AFACT was acting as the [[MPAA]]'s Australian subcontractor and that the MPAA wanted to avoid the view that the court case was about Hollywood trying to bully an Australian ISP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/31/afact_subcontractor_to_mpaa/ |title=Wikileaked cable: AFACT was MPAA’s cat’s-paw |author=Richard Chirgwin |accessdate=14 January 2012 |date=31 August 2011 |work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The organisation comprises [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Roadshow Entertainment]], [[Sony Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]], [[Warner Brothers]] and the [[MPAA]].&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afact.org.au/index.php/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=AFACT |accessdate=14 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court case==
{{main|Roadshow Films v iiNet}}

The organisation brought [[Roadshow Films v iiNet|a lawsuit]] to the [[Federal Court of Australia]] against Australian internet service provider, [[iiNet]], on 20 November 2008, alleging that iiNet had authorised copyright infringement on its network. AFACT had used Dtecnet, a company that tracks online copyright infringement to discover users sharing copyrighted content through [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].&lt;ref name="rthc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/iinet-vs-afact-the-road-to-high-court-339326983.htm |title=iiNet vs. AFACT: the road to High Court |author=Josh Taylor |accessdate=14 January 2012 |date=30 November 2011 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CBS Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Court decision cleared iiNet on 4 February 2010. Justice Cowdroy found that "mere provision of access to internet is not the means to infringement".

AFACT lost [[AFACT v iiNet Ltd|its appeal]] to the Federal Court on 24 February 2011.&lt;ref name="ivala"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/News/249218,iinet-vs-afact-australian-federation-against-copyright-theft-loses-appeal.aspx |title=iiNet vs AFACT: Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft loses appeal |author=Chris Jager |accessdate=14 January 2012 |date=24 February 2011 |work=PC &amp; Tech Authority |publisher=Haymarket Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ordered to pay iiNet's legal bills. 

AFACT lost a further appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]] on 20 April 2012.&lt;ref name="hcapp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/hcasum16_2012_04_20_iiNet.pdf |title=High Court Judgment Summary: Roadshow Films Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v iiNet Ltd |date=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Avex is an [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] of the English words Audio Visual Expert.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Since its foundation, its corporate name was Avex [[digital distribution|D.D.]], Incorporated, and ten years later it was changed to Avex, Incorporated.

The current name, Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated, was adopted in 2004 as part of reconstruction process after [[Tom Yoda]]'s resignation. Avex Group Holdings, Incorporated was used for the main subsidiaries, while the old name (Avex, Incorporated) was for entertainment components of the Group.

In 2005, Avex, Incorporated became Avex Entertainment, Incorporated, and stayed on as part of the Group.

==History==
[[File:Avex headquarters.jpg|thumb|The {{nihongo|Avex Building|エイベックスビル|Eibekkusu Biru}}, finished in 2002 and funded by Sumitomo Life, in Minami-Aoyama, Tokyo. It was vacated in October 2014 to give way to the move to [[Izumi Garden Tower]].]]

===1988–1999: The early years===
Avex was registered June 1, 1973 as {{Nihongo|Avex D.D. Incorporated|エイベックス・ディー・ディー株式会社|Eibekkusu Di Di Kabushiki Gaisha}}, although it did not become established until 1988. They began as a CD wholesaler based in [[Machida, Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="Avex Group"&gt;[[:ja:エイベックス・グループ]] Avex Group's article on the Japanese Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1990, they opened a recording studio and created [[Avex Trax]] as a music label. In the same year, they created "Musique Folio Inc.", a music publishing company, which became "Prime Direction Inc."

In 1993, they transferred to [[Aoyama, Tokyo]] and created a U.S. branch, called "AV Experience America Inc." The year also marked the first of Avex's yearly events. It was held in [[Tokyo Dome]] under the name "avex rave '93" and attracted 50,000 attendees. This marked the foundation of the [[Cutting Edge (record label)|Cutting Edge]] label.

In 1994, they formed two UK subsidiaries, "Rhythm Republic Limited" and "Avex U.K. Limited," to particularly distribute the parent label's music releases in what would later become the [[Special administrative regions of China|Chinese special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. Later that year, they opened a disco, claimed on their website to be "the world's largest scale disco", named [[Velfarre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/index.html |title=Avex Group |publisher=Avex Group |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, they opened a series of concert halls called "[[Zepp]]" with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]]. That same year, following [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Hong Kong's handover]] to the [[China|People's Republic of China]], "Rhythm Republic Limited" and "Avex U.K. Limited" were merged to form a new company, "Avex Asia Limited," which was re-branded as "Avex Hong Kong Limited" in September 2008 before being absorbed into "Avex Taiwan Incorporated" in January 2014.

In early 1999, they signed an agreement with [[Walt Disney Records]] and [[Hollywood Records]] to handle the companies' Japanese CD releases. Later that year "Avex Mode", an animation company, was established. In December, the company was listed on the 1st section of the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] under the [[ticker symbol]] 7860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=7860:JP |title=7860:Tokyo Stock Quote - Avex Group Holdings Inc |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–2009: Times of unity and divisiveness===
In 2001, Avex opened the "avex artists academy" music school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaa.avex.jp/index.html |script-title=ja:アーティストアカデミー |trans-title=Artist Academy |publisher=Avex Group |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, they released the "[[Copy control|CCCD]]", a type of copy-protected CD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avexnet.or.jp/cccd/right.htm |title=コピーコントロールCD |trans-title=Copy Control CD |publisher=Avex |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107103938/http://www.avexnet.or.jp/cccd/right.htm |archivedate=November 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened their building in Aoyama, paid for by [[Sumitomo Life]] and worth 205 billion yen.

In 2003, they opened a classical music business (named Avex Classics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avexnet.or.jp/classics/index.html |title=avex-CLASSICS |publisher=Avex Group |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110074538/http://avexnet.or.jp/classics/index.html |archivedate=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, they began selling Japanese music CDs in South Korea and Avex President [[Max Matsuura]] "spotted" former [[Japanese idol|idol]] [[Ami Suzuki]] performing live at the annual festival of their school, [[Nihon University]]. He subsequently signed her to the Avex label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theses.lub.lu.se/archive/2005/12/28/1135780974-26869-98/PooleMT.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329173818/http://theses.lub.lu.se/archive/2005/12/28/1135780974-26869-98/PooleMT.pdf|title=What Does The Development Of Independent Female Artists Mean For The Japanese Music Industry?|author=Robert Poole|year=2005|archivedate=March 2007|accessdate=Jan 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Avex acquired distribution rights for [[Aozora Records]]' catalogue including all future [[Hitomi Yaida]] releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/press/2006/050912.pdf |title=Start of Commission Sales of the Aozora Records Catalogue |publisher=Avex Group |date=September 15, 2005 |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203045/http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/press/2006/050912.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, Avex partnered with [[Victor Entertainment|Victor JVC]] to officially create the label [[D-topia Entertainment]] as a business partnership between the labels and its founder, Terukado Onishi, with the [[sales promotion]] handled by Victor while the area promotion handled by Avex. As part of the Avex Group's 20th anniversary celebration, a big project occurred with avex trax's "produced by avex trax" artists; the band [[Girl Next Door (band)|Girl Next Door]], formed and debuted in September 2008.

Avex Group launched its own [[IPTV]] service, [[BeeTV]], May 2009 in partnership with [[NTT DoCoMo]].

====2004: Internal feud : Max Matsuura v. Tom Yoda====
In August 2004, a feud between Max Matsuura and co-founder Tom Yoda almost ruined the group.&lt;ref name="JPZone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-zone.com/news/2004/08/index.shtml |title=Japan Entertainment News |publisher=Japan Zone |date=August 2004 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started because of Yoda's ambition to expand Avex into other entertainment-related ventures, especially producing [[movie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4371079-1.html]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he accused [[Ryuhei Chiba]], the company's executive director and president of Avex Inc. (now Avex Planning and Development), of pursuing personal profit from a few big artists.&lt;ref name="JPZone"/&gt;

'''July 30:''' In a board meeting, Yoda introduced a [[Corporate resolution|resolution]] calling on Chiba to resign because of an alleged [[conflict of interest]]. A source says the disagreement arose because Chiba had signed an artist managed by a member of his family. The board backed Yoda's resolution in a 6-1 vote. However, Matsuura — described by insiders as a close ally of Chiba — introduced a second resolution demanding that Yoda step down due to "a difference of opinion in management principles." Matsuura's motion was defeated 5-2. He and Chiba resigned the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4649125-1.html |title=Japanese Industry Awaits Avex Fallout |author=Peter Serafin |publisher=Billboard |date=September 4, 2004 |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |archivedate=April 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403044527/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4649125-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''August 2:''' Matsuura and Chiba announced their resignations in a meeting with employees of Avex. Chiba denied any fault, while Matsuura complained that Avex had lost its love of music and said he wanted to start over. They had the support of many staff who also said they would quit. More significantly, the label's top star, [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], said would leave.&lt;ref name="JPZone"/&gt; As a result, Avex's stocks in the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange|TSE]] fell by 16 percent that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificmediaexpo.com/2005/Yomiuri_20041223.pdf |title=Import-export issues mark J-pop year |author=Steve McClure |publisher=The Yomiuri Shimbun |date=December 28, 2004 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''August 3:''' Due to pressure by employees and artists and to save the company from bankruptcy, Yoda resigned and was replaced by Toshio Kobayashi.&lt;ref name="Avex Group"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JPZone"/&gt;

===2010–present===
AGHD is listed at the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] and [[Börse München]] of Germany under the ticker symbol AX8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=AX8:GR |title=AX8:Munich Stock Quote - Avex Group Holdings Inc |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More K-pop artists from other agencies continued to sign with Avex such as [[YG Entertainment]]'s [[2NE1]] (2010), S-plus Entertainment's [[SS501]] member [[Kim Hyung Jun]] (2011), [[Pledis Entertainment]]'s [[After School (band)|After School]] (2011), NH Media's [[U-KISS]] (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seoul Central District Court dismisses both of SME’s injunctions against JYJ|url=http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/5977874.html |publisher=OMona They Didn't|accessdate=December 31, 2012|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yejeon Media]]'s [[Shu-I]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shu-i.jp/index.html |title=Shu-I (シューアイ) - Japan Official Site |publisher=Shu-i.jp |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115121800/http://shu-i.jp/index.html |archivedate=January 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2011, it was announced that Avex had paired with Korean management label YG Entertainment to form YGEX Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neefa |url=http://www.allkpop.com/2011/07/yg-entertainment-and-avex-announce-the-creation-of-ygx |title=YG Entertainment and avex announce the creation of ‘YGEX’! |publisher=6Theory Media |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the group began offering limited releases for sale, DRM-free for the first time within Japan on [[Amazon MP3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=amb_link_61752369_10?ie=UTF8&amp;bbn=2129039051&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A2128134051%2Cn%3A!2129039051%2Cn%3A2129040051%2Cp_33%3Aavex&amp;sort=price&amp;pf_rd_m=AN1VRQENFRJN5&amp;pf_rd_s=hero-quick-promo&amp;pf_rd_r=1CNV7XQQH49S6KTZ2CFW&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_p=116091429&amp;pf_rd_i=B0087CMV64 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218191007/http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=amb_link_61752369_10?ie=UTF8&amp;bbn=2129039051&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n:2128134051,n:!2129039051,n:2129040051,p_33:avex&amp;sort=price&amp;pf_rd_m=AN1VRQENFRJN5&amp;pf_rd_s=hero-quick-promo&amp;pf_rd_r=1CNV7XQQH49S6KTZ2CFW&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_p=116091429&amp;pf_rd_i=B0087CMV64 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 18, 2013 |title=MP3ダウンロード |trans-title=MP3 Download |publisher=Amazon.co.jp |date= |language=Japanese |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Matsuura and Toshio Kobayashi, the company's top two individual shareholders, launched their own investment companies to anchor their shares in 2012.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

As a show of modernization, Avex Group moved to [[Izumi Garden Tower]] in [[Roppongi]] in October 2014. The company was designated to the 36th floor – the former address of [[Dwango (company)|DWANGO]].

On February 15, 2017, Avex Group discontinued all foreign exports of Blu-rays, DVDs, and CDs published under their Avex Pictures label. The company provided no official statement on the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aramajapan.com/news/avex-pictures-enforces-export-ban-on-blu-rays-dvd-and-cds/71087/|title=Avex pictures enforces export ban on Blu-rays, DVD, and CDs|publisher=Arama Japan|language=English|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==

===Subsidiaries===
In April 2010 – the Avex Group corporation was re-structured to establish Avex Music Publishing Inc. as a consolidated subsidiary, in a corporate spin-off of music publishing division of Avex Group Holdings Inc. Thus the Avex Group became a pure holding company, with a corporate structure as follows:&lt;ref name="avex.co.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avex.co.jp/e_site/group/history.html |title=Avex Group - History |publisher=Avex Group |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{further|List of Black Sails episodes}}
''Black Sails'' is set roughly two decades before the events of ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].&lt;ref name="zap2it.com"/&gt; Feared [[Captain Flint]] brings on a younger crew member as they fight for the survival of [[New Providence]] island. According to the first episode, "In 1715 [[West Indies]], the pirates of New Providence Island threaten maritime trade in the region. The laws of every civilized nation declare them ''[[hostis humani generis]]'', enemies of all mankind. In response, the pirates adhere to a doctrine of their own....war against the world." Real life pirates who are fictionalized in the show include [[Anne Bonny]], [[Benjamin Hornigold]], [[Jack Rackham]], [[Charles Vane]], [[Edward Low|Ned Low]], [[Israel Hands]] and [[Edward Teach|Blackbeard]].

The plot of the first season focuses on the hunt for the Spanish treasure galleon ''[[Urca de Lima]].'' At the beginning of the second season, the treasure from the Urca de Lima has been stranded on the shores of Florida with Spanish soldiers guarding it, but by the conclusion of the second season, the treasure has been taken by [[Jack Rackham]] and his crew and brought to New Providence Island. During the second season, the questions of how and why Flint—a man who was a navy officer and London gentleman—turned to piracy are answered. The third and the fourth seasons focus on the war for the control of New Providence between the pirates and the [[British Empire]], represented by Captain [[Woodes Rogers]].

==Production==
The series is filmed at Cape Town Film Studios in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], with local production company Film Afrika.&lt;ref name=sa&gt;{{cite press release|title=Starz Embarks on an Early Renewal for Second Season Order of the Original Series "Black Sails"| url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2013/07/26/starz-embarks-on-an-early-renewal-for-second-season-order-of-the-original-series-black-sails-929410/20130726starz02/|author= Starz| publisher=Futon Critic|date= July 26, 2013| accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Nick |last= Goundry |url= http://www.thelocationguide.com/blog/2012/10/south-africas-cape-town-studios-prepares-for-pirate-miniseries-black-sails/|title=South Africa's Cape Town Studios prepares for pirate miniseries Black Sails|website=TheLocationGuide.com| date= October 15, 2012| accessdate= January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening title sequence was made by Imaginary Forces and directors Michelle Dougherty and Karin Fong with the backing [[sea shanty]] inspired theme composed by ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' composer [[Bear McCreary]]. It accurately features an instrument of the period in the form of the [[hurdy-gurdy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hibberd|first=James|title='Black Sails': See the awesome opening credits with theme from 'Walking Dead' composer – EXCLUSIVE|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/12/30/black-sails-opening-credits/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date= December 30, 2013| accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the amount of detail that was added to the vessels, it took over 300 workers to build just one ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Sails: Building the Behemoth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9q6IcpGjlM&amp;feature=youtu.be|author=Starz|website=YouTube|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In real life, recurring actor [[Nick Boraine]] is [[Louise Barnes]]'s husband; [[Anna-Louise Plowman]] and [[Chris Larkin]] are, respectively, [[Toby Stephens]]'s wife and brother; and Guy Paul is [[Harriet Walter]]'s husband.

==Reception==
The first season of ''Black Sails'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the season holds a rating of 62%, based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Black Sails'' boasts visual appeal, but the show's bland characters aren't strong enough to keep the show from being dragged down into its murky depths of aimless exposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/black-sails/s01/|title=Black Sails: Season 1|date=January 24, 2015|work=rottentomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] season one has a score of 58 of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/black-sails|title=Black Sails|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Goodman of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "This ambitious pirate story is helped immensely by going beyond the pay cable freedoms that often bog down lesser shows in boobs, blood and sex. ''Black Sails'' steers itself out of that realm after a few episodes and makes a play for bigger, more complicated stories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Tim |date=January 21, 2014 |title=Black Sails: TV Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/starz-black-sails-is-ambitious-672893 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Lloyd of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "''Black Sails'' is a pirate treasure. The Starz series vividly depicts the daily life of pirates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lloyd |first=Robert |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-black-sails-review,0,4807559.story#axzz2rX7W1mH5 |title=Review: 'Black Sails' is a pirate treasure |publisher=latimes.com |date=January 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Jensen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "Not even a guilty pleasure, ''Black Sails'' is arrrrrr-estingly good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20779458,00.html |title=Black Sails TV Review &amp;#124; TV Reviews and News |publisher=EW.com |date=February 19, 2014 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Long of the ''Detroit News'' commented "Alliances are made and broken, power shifts go this way and that, blood is spilled, and wenches keep wenching. It's oddly addictive, and the cast—made up mostly of British, Australian, and Canadian actors—is as sharp as you'd expect from pay cable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/black-sails/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for Black Sails Season 1 - Metacritic|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "''Black Sails'' never quite takes off, developing into a tired treasure hunt with indifferent casting and stock characters. Counting Michael Bay among its producers, this South Africa–lensed production might tempt adventure-seeking viewers to plunge into its crystal-blue waters, but despite some handsome aspects, the show ultimately proves as hollow as its CGI-rendered ships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=January 23, 2014 |title=TV Review: 'Black Sails' |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/reviews/tv-review-black-sails-1201059718/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd VanDerWerff of [[The A.V. Club]] said, "''Black Sails'' is a handsome illusion at times, but it rarely finds its way beyond that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=VanDerWerff |first=Todd |date=January 23, 2014 |title=Black Sails is a tale of a bloodthirsty pirate bureaucracy |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/black-sails-is-a-tale-of-a-bloodthirsty-pirate-bur-200913 |publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season of the show currently holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/black-sails/s02/|title=Black Sails: Season 2|date=January 24, 2015|work=rottentomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neil Genzlinger]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Starz knows the formula for these costume-heavy action dramas from experience with shows like ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'' and ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]''. And that formula is executed with particular skill in 'Black Sails,' thanks to some strong performances and an exploration of the consequences of greed that could have come out of modern-day Wall Street".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = In 'Black Sails' From Starz, Pirate's Booty Is at Stake|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/arts/television/in-black-sails-from-starz-pirates-booty-is-at-stake.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = January 23, 2015|access-date = August 18, 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Neil|last = Genzlinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book-and-record sets''' are a form of entertainment for children, consisting of a picture storybook (often in [[comic book]] format, with drawings or photos) and an accompanying recording (originally in the form of a [[vinyl record]]; later in [[cassette tape]] and [[compact disc]] formats) to be played while following along with the book. The record and book complement one another, with the record usually a [[radio theater]]-style version of the story or a [[soundtrack]] recording, and the book providing visuals and text to the story. Often a tone or other kind of cue in the recording will prompt the reader to turn pages.

Book-and-record sets are popular as teaching tools and aids to reading, and as a simple form of [[multimedia]] entertainment. [[Cartoon characters]] are common subjects (or stars) of the stories, as are comic book [[superhero|superheroes]] and other [[Franchise (media)|media franchises]], characters and personalities. Occasionally popular children's or family movies are adapted for book and record; the stories may either be re-presented by a new cast of performers, members of the movie cast, or the audio taken directly from the movie, with narration added.

[[Disneyland Records]] and related companies produced several such works, as did [[Peter Pan Records]] (and its offshoot [[Power Records (Peter Pan records)|Power Records]]) and others, from the dawn of [[long-playing records]] and the [[45rpm single]] until the digital age. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Capitol Records]] produced many book-and-record sets for children, ranging from everything from [[Bozo the Clown]] to the classical music fantasy ''[[Sparky's Magic Piano]]''. A "picture storybook" of the 1982 movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' narrated by [[Michael Jackson]] became a highly prized [[collectible]], after it went out of print. Newer sets may still be found among recordings for children.

India as per [[2001 census of India|2011 census of India]] has over 4.35 million working children between of age of five to 14 years.&lt;ref name=hin/&gt;

== History ==
Childline was first established as an experimental project in June 1996, by [[Jeroo Billimoria]], a professor at the [[Tata Institute of Social Sciences]] (TISS), Mumbai at the department of Family and Child Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.childlineindia.org.in/1098/history.htm |date= |publisher=Childline |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Government of India, established the Childline across India in 1998-99, under [[Ministry of Women and Child Development]], as an umbrella organisation to support and monitor services across India, while also serving as link between the ministry and various NGOs working the field. The Secretary of the Ministry functions as the chairperson of the Governing Board of the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Childline Service |url=http://wcd.nic.in/childlineservice.htm |date= |publisher=Ministry of Women and Child Development |accessdate=8 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517151210/http://wcd.nic.in/childlineservice.htm |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, a Childline Advisory Board in the [[West Garo Hills district]] of Meghalaya state, as a part of joint programme by [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment]] and Child Line India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Childline Advisory Board formed for Garo Hills' |url=http://www.morungexpress.com/regional/94474.html |publisher=[[The Morung Express]] |date=25 Apr 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629215314/http://www.morungexpress.com/regional/94474.html |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, [[Ahmedabad]] Childline, rescued 16 children aged between 14 and 17 years working various parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 children rescued from city eateries |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/1830204/report-16-children-rescued-from-city-eateries |publisher=DNA India |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corporate media''' is [[mass media]] production, distribution, ownership, and funding which is dominated by [[corporation]]s and their [[CEO]]s. It is sometimes used as a [[pejorative]] term in place of ''[[mainstream media]]'', which tends to also be used as a derisive term, to indicate a media system that does not serve the [[public interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, David and Hoynes, William (2006).

Herman]], [[Amy Goodman]] and [[Bernie Sanders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Sanders|first=Bernie |date=January 26, 2017 |title=How Corporate Media Threatens Our Democracy |url=http://inthesetimes.com/features/bernie-sanders-corporate-media-threatens-our-democracy.html|newspaper=[[In These Times]] |location= |access-date=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that such a media system, especially when allowed to dominate the [[Mass media|mainstream media]], inevitably will be manipulated by these same [[corporation]]s to suit their own interests. These critics point out that the main national networks, [[NBC]], [[CBS]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], as well as most if not all of the smaller cable channels, are owned, funded, and controlled by an interconnected network of large corporate conglomerates and international banking interests, which may manipulate and filter out news that does not fit their corporate agenda. Media companies are slowly understanding how to accelerate the fluidity of media content across delivery channels to "expand revenue opportunities, broaden markets and reinforce consumer loyalties and commitments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|date=2008|title=Convergence Culture|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1354856507084415|journal=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies|volume= 14(1)|pages=5–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users are then understanding how to master these various media technologies to bring the flow of media more fully under their control and to interact/co-create with other users. Sometimes, these two forces reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding, relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes the two forces conflict, resulting in constant renegotiations of power between these competing pressures on the new media ecology.

== Propaganda model ==

[[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] have established a [[propaganda model]] which purports to explain this bias. The common misinterpretation of this model is that all bias is conscious and centralized. The hypothesis is that the process is decentralized and operates as a confluence of factors, that includes the overt pressure from owners and advertisers, but also by the [[Ian Kershaw#The "Working Towards the Führer" concept|gradual internalization]] of the biases and values of the corporate owners, leading to self-censorship.

[[Pulitzer Prize]] winning American journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] accused mainstream U.S. media of "spreading patriotic state propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://theintercept.com/2017/05/02/trumps-support-and-praise-of-despots-is-central-to-the-u-s-tradition-not-a-deviation-from-it/ Trump’s Support and Praise of Despots Is Central to the U.S. Tradition, Not a Deviation From It]". ''The Intercept''. May 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other factors include the tendency of journalists to avoid doing original research, instead obtaining news from the same few wire services, such as [[Reuters]] and [[Associated Press]], which themselves tend to cover the same news under the same perspective. Due to the desire to reduce operation costs, the mainstream media favor news pieces that are pre-made by these news agencies instead of conducting their own reporting.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Impact  ==

=== On social justice ===
Critiques have pointed to the ownership of major news outlets in USA by corporations. [[Bernie Sanders]], an American [[anti-establishment]] politician contends that media are an arm of the ruling class. In his view, "corporate media by definition has conflict of interests." He points to alleged low pay of workers in media companies such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] which biases them against publishing specials on minimum wage and wealth and income equality. There have been allegations of corporate media's manipulation of presidential campaign facts against Bernie Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-hanley/bernie-sanders-is-exactly_b_9559188.html|title=Bernie Sanders Is Exactly Right: The Media Is an Arm of the Ruling Class of This Country|last=Hanley|first=Brian|date=|website=[[Huffington Post]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public relations on news and public affairs programming ===
This same economic pressure makes media susceptible to manipulation by government and other corporate sources through the widespread use of [[press release]]s, often created by industry-funded [[public relations]] firms.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Impact on world events and society ===

{{cleanup|date=April 2011}}

The point of view and statements made by governments, officials, military, police, national security organizations (such as the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]]), as well as various other political offices are regularly reported as facts and are published without any (or very little) fact checking by the corporate media. Perhaps the most infamous current example of the impact of the propaganda model on world events and societies was during the two-year period following the [[2001 US attacks]]. During this time, according to a five year in-depth research project conducted by the [[Centre for Public Integrity]]; the President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] and seven high-ranking officials in his administration made at least 935 false statements about the threat posed to the world and to US national security by [[Saddam Hussein]]. These false statements were virtually uncontested by the corporate media and presented as a sound rationale for both the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the "[[War on Terror]]". [https://web.archive.org/web/20080127142002/http://www.publicintegrity.org/WarCard/Default.aspx?src=home&amp;context=overview&amp;id=945] 

In ''Buying the War'' on PBS, [[Bill Moyers]] noted 27 ''Washington Post'' editorials supporting George W. Bush's ambitions to invade Iraq. National security correspondent [[Walter Pincus]] reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/transcript1.html|title=Transcript: "Buying the War"|date=April 25, 2007|work=PBS|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author and journalist [[Greg Mitchell]], "By the ''Post''{{'s}} own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information 'got lost', as one ''Post'' staffer told [[Howard Kurtz|Kurtz]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/eleven-years-how-washington-post-helped-give-us-iraq-war/ |title=Eleven Years On: How 'The Washington Post' Helped Give Us the Iraq War |date=March 12, 2014|work= [[The Nation]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304190318/https://www.thenation.com/article/eleven-years-how-washington-post-helped-give-us-iraq-war/ |archive-date=March 4, 2017 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was the "manufacturing of consent" for the invasion of Iraq and "The Global War on Terror/ism" in which hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives to date. As an example, [[Jessica Yellin]] on [[Anderson Cooper 360]] admitted being pressured by corporate executives to present positive stories during the run up to the Iraq war.

ANDERSON COOPER 360 Transcript of Jessica Yellin reporting:&lt;blockquote&gt;COOPER: Jessica, McClellan took press to task for not upholding their reputation. He writes: "The National Press Corps was probably too deferential to the White House and to the administration in regard to the most important decision facing the nation during my years in Washington, the choice over whether to go to war in Iraq. The 'liberal media' -- in quotes -- didn't live up to its reputation. If it had, the country would have been better served." Dan Bartlett, former Bush adviser, called the allegation "total crap." What is your take? Did the press corps drop the ball?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I wouldn't go that far. I think the press corps dropped the ball at the beginning. When the lead-up to the war began, the press corps was under enormous pressure from corporate executives, frankly, to make sure that this was a war that was presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fever in the nation and the president's high approval ratings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And my own experience at the White House was that, the higher the president's approval ratings, the more pressure I had from news executives—and I was not at this network at the time—but the more pressure I had from news executives to put on positive stories about the president. I think, over time...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;COOPER: You had pressure from news executives to put on positive stories about the president?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;YELLIN: Not in that exact—they wouldn't say it in that way, but they would edit my pieces. They would push me in different directions. They would turn down stories that were more critical and try to put on pieces that were more positive, yes. That was my experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Factcheck.org]] ([http://Factcheck.org Factcheck.org]), created by the Annenberg school of Public Policy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], found hundreds of misrepresentations in political ads that were never corrected by the mainstream media.  Studies also show that those who rely on the media for their information have a poor understanding of the issues and are unable to discern misrepresentations in political advertising.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

As documented by authors [[Sheldon Rampton]] and [[John Stauber]], it is becoming increasingly common for [[video news releases]] (VNR) to be created by government and corporations, mimicking TV news story-format, to be used straight into broadcasting in a newscast.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Other factors include the cost of litigation. Large corporations tend to sue over any news that are against their interests, causing great expense for the news editors. Even if the litigation is lost, the cost of time and pressure will certainly bias a reporter towards avoiding such possibility.

In March 2018, American documentary filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] criticized the "corporate media", saying "You turn on the TV, and it's 'Russia, Russia, Russia!' These are all shiny keys to distract us. We should know about the [[2018 West Virginia teachers' strike|West Virginia strike]]. What an inspiration that would be. But they don't show this".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.salon.com/2018/03/20/michael-moore-blasts-corporate-media-for-only-talking-about-russia-russia-russia/ Michael Moore blasts “corporate media” for only talking about “Russia, Russia, Russia”]". ''Salon.'' March 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interlocking corporations, corporate power, and its social influences==
{{See also|Media bias in the United States#Corporate control}}
To illustrate the growing problem of monocracy, Bagdikian notes that in the 1980s, "less than 1 percent of all corporations, have 87 percent of all sales. [The corporates] are the aristocrats of the American Industrial economy; the remaining 359,500, in terms of their national power, are the peasantry." This conflict continues to arise as "dominant media companies are further [integrating] into the ruling forces of the economy." The directorates of major companies interlock with others and control the content of multiple dominating media and information distribution (i.e., newspapers, magazines, radio and television companies, book publishers, film industries, and even multinational banking investors). They become directly influenced by still other powerful industry, creating the "Endless Chain" of mass media and economic aristocracy (Wardrip-Fruin, 479).

In 1993, 90% of media was owned by 50 companies. Today, starting in 2011,the same 90% is controlled by 6 companies. These 6 companies include Comcast, News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. These 6 media companies are broken down into sub companies, for example, News-Corp is broken down into Fox, Wall Street Journal, and New York Post. Disney is broken down into ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Miramar, and Marvel Studios. Viacom is broken down into MTV, Nick Jr, BET, CMT, and Paramount Pictures. Time Warner cable is broken down into CNN, HBO, Time, and Warner Bros. Lastly, CBS is broken down into Showtime, Smithsonian channel, NFL.com, Jeopardy, and 60 minutes. 232 media executives control what media 277 million Americans consume. To put that into perspective, thats 1 media executive to 850,000 media consumers. These six big companies control 70% of cable and can make up to 275.9 billion revenue (2010 revenue for the big six). The media we receive by these 6 companies include movies which in 2010, their box office sales hit 7 billion, which is double what 140 smaller movie studios made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6|title=These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America|last=Lutz|first=Ashley|date=14 June 2012|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several issues arise from the fusion; under law and business ethics, the director of a firm is obligated to act in best interest of the company he or she is involved in, and failure to oblige under some circumstances can be a federal crime. This creates a dilemma in the governance of mass media: the same person may be trapped in a situation where working for the best interest for one may damage the other corporation. Another problem which arises is that the same person can abuse his or her power to get away with injustice as exemplified by Bagdikian: "When Sears was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of dishonest advertising and promotion, the Tribune was one of the major papers that failed to carry a word of it... (Wardrip-Fruin, 481)." Here, a market industry was able to conceal their crime of fraud since it was also interlocked with the news media, one of the main distributors of such significant information.

In summary, the concentration of massive media firms that control American public information is troublesome for the potential for deception misleads the public away from reality. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs state that these facts raise fundamental issues as they can bear on social issues and possibly control the shape and direction of the nation's economy. It is further derived that "the summits of American business now control or powerfully influence the major media that create American public opinion" (Wardrip-Fruin, 483).

Formally, feminist poetry often seeks to challenge assumptions about language and meaning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It usually foregrounds women's experiences as valid and worthy of attention, and it also highlights the lived experiences of minorities and other less privileged subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sometimes feminist poems seek to embody specific women's experiences, and they are often [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] registering specific forms of oppression depending on identities related to race, sexuality, gender presentation, disability, or immigration status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has led to feminist writing journals like [http://sotospeakjournal.org/about-so-to-speak/ So To Speak] providing a statement of intention to publish the work of women and [[Genderqueer|nonbinary]] people in particular.

Kim Whitehead states that feminist poetry has "no identifiable birth date," but there are a few key figures identified as early proponents of feminist ideas, and who convey their politics through poetry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Poetry Movement|last=Whitehead|first=Kim|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=1996|isbn=|location=Jackson MI|pages=3, ix-x, xii, xv, xvi, xviii, xviii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of first feminist poet is often given to [[Sappho]], at least in part because she seems to write about female [[homosexuality]] in [[Ancient Greece]], a culture and time when [[lesbian]] sexuality was usually ignored or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43477494|title=Reading Sappho : contemporary approaches|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|others=Greene, Ellen, 1950-|isbn=9780520918061|location=Berkeley|oclc=43477494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jannerson|first=Deb|date=2011|title='ADVENTURES IN FEMINISTORY: SAPPHO'|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/adventures-in-feministory-sappho|journal=Bitch Media|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalano|first=Gabby|date=|title=How This Historic Icon Influenced Feminist Writers Today|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/fbomb/how-this-historic-icon-influenced-feminist-writers-today|journal=Women's Media Centre|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist Aspects of Sanskrit Writing ===

The beginning of works categorised as literature in India began with the [[Sanskrit]] term ''[[kāvya]]'', a discourse separate from science or from the purely oral, and specific literary style that included works thought to contain a kind of soulfulness.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70701869|title=The language of the gods in the world of men : Sanskrit, culture, and power in premodern India|last=Pollock|first=Sheldon I.|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520932029|location=Berkeley|pages=3, 16, 19, 126|oclc=70701869}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this early period, men were often posed as poets, and women as a kind of muse, as in the tenth century explanation for the origins of Indian literary culture:  Poem Man's wife ("Poetics") chases him across [[South Asia]] creating varying kinds of literature across the region.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Poetry was certainly an important part of political cultural life in the [[Sanskrit]] cosmopolis, and some women contributed; for example the poet [[Rajashekhara|Rajasekhara]] tells of women in different regions who entertain with songs.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The early civilisation of [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] country in modern-day Cambodia cultivated a literature in [[Sanskrit]], and diverged from its neighbours in creating a strain of poetry from the fifth century to the thirteenth century in which women were a source of praise and admiration.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Take for example the Mebon Inscription of [[Rajendravarman II|Rājendravarman]], which features eulogies for specific women of note, and which is, according to Sheldon I. Pollock, "without obvious parallel in South Asia," and may be related to "specific kinship structures in the region."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth Century Feminist Poets in India ===

Early anglophone women poets in India blended native traditions and literary models from Europe.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/739722886|title=Anglophone poetry in colonial India, 1780-1913 : a critical anthology|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Ohio University Press|others=Gibson, Mary Ellis, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780821443576|location=Athens|pages=287–288, 294–297, 363–371|oclc=739722886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst these early feminists, the Dutt Sisters - [[Toru Dutt]] (1856-1877) and Aru Dutt (1854-1874) stand out, and are sometimes compared to the [[Brontë family|Brontë Sisters]] in England.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Dutt sisters came from a family of poets, including their father Govind Chandra Dutt, and their access to education was unprecedented.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The mother of the family Kshetramoni Mitter Dutt along with all three children - Toru, Aru, and their brother Abju Dutt, had received an education in English, and to some extent, in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The family had a reformist bent, and some members had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Both sisters visited England in the 1870s, and attended the higher lectures for women at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Toru Dutt's poetry in particular has been labelled extraordinary, because her writing "created a new idiom in Indian English verse."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Spanning the turn from the nineteenth to twentieth century, [[Sarojini Naidu]] (1879–1949) represents a figure for whom politics and poetry are intertwined.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Like the Dutt Sisters, Naidu was allowed access to all the educational resources she desired, and she passed the [[University of Madras|Madras University]] matriculation examination at age 12. She came from a large and free-thinking family.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Her father, [[Aghorenath Chattopadhyay]], was a well-regarded doctor, known for his educational reforms, and her mother, Barada Sundari Devi, was educated at a [[Brahmo]] school.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Naidu had seven siblings all of whom made contribution to Indian life, for example her brother [[Virendranath Chattopadhyaya|Virendranath Chattopadhyay]] was an Indian revolutionary.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Naidu studied at [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], Cambridge, which brough her into contact with writers of the day, including [[Arthur Symons]], and [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Ultimately, Naidu's unconventional upbringing and education were catalysts for her intellectual powers, since as she writes in her roman-de-clef 'Sulani,' ""Unlike the girls of her own nation, she had been brought up in an atmosphere of large un-convention and culture and absolute freedom of thought and action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Sunalini," ms.|last=Naidu|first=Sarojini|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=British Library.|pages=EUr.A.95}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her marriage to Govindarajulu Naidu - controversial because of his age and class - Naidu began publishing poetry to international acclaim, and in parallel with this literary art, she maintained her nationalist efforts, eventually becoming the first Indian woman to serve as president of the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry ===

Anthologies were an important part of foregrounding women's writing in volumes like [[Eunice de Souza|Eunice De Souza]]'s ''Nine Indian Women Poets'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bethala|first=Melody|date=February 2017|title='The battle is to validate the material': A brief history of Eunice de Souza's anthologies of Indian literature.|url=https://humag.co/features/the-battle-is-to-validate-the-material|journal=Honest Ulsterman|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Poetry in North America ==

[[File:Joy harjo 3271646.JPG|thumb|Poet Joy Harjo's argument for the centrality and importance of native poetry in North America is significant for feminist literary histories.]]

=== Early Feminist Poets in North America ===

Though they lived in an era before an organised feminist movement, certain American poets have been lauded by [[feminist literary criticism]] as early examples of feminist writers. Feminist poetry in the United States is often thought of as beginning with [[Anne Bradstreet]] (1612-1672), the first poet of the [[New World]]. There were also, however, native poetic traditions before colonialism, which continue to the present day, and represent an important strand of American poetry. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native]] traditional verse has included "lyrics, chants, anecdotes, incantations, riddles, proverbs, and legends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Preface to Colonial American Poetry: A Study in the Poetry of the Age in Relation to American History and Literature|last=Jabbar|first=Wisam Abdul|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is difficult to ascertain from these oral traditions whether the authors of early texts were male or female, precolonial native poetry certainly addresses issues relevant to women in a sensitive and positive way, for example the [[Seminole]] poem, 'Song for Bringing a Child Into the World.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/865473325|title=Native American songs and poems : an anthology|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Swann, Brian,|year=|isbn=9780486112138|location=Mineola, New York|pages=1|oclc=865473325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, native poetry is a separate but relevant tradition in the United States; as poet [[Joy Harjo]] comments, "The literature of the aboriginal people of North America defines America. It is not exotic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/144560/native-american-poetry-and-culture|title=Native American Poetry and Culture|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of Canada, Anne Marie Dalton argues that at least some indigenous communities in North America (though not all) have lived by practicing [[ecofeminism]] with regard to women's roles, and the sustainability of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/671640200|title=The Cambridge history of Canadian literature|last=|first=|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Howells, Coral Ann., Kröller, Eva-Marie.|year=|isbn=9780511862243|location=Cambridge|pages=78–80|oclc=671640200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When colonialism did arrive, Anne Bradstreet was one of the first poets to win acclaim, and many of her poems are thought to have feminist themes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mother of eight children, Bradstreet sometimes found herself in conflict with her domestic circumstances and her role as a [[Puritans|Puritan]] woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-bradstreet|title=Anne Bradstreet|last=Martin|first=Wendy|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist literary criticism defined Bradstreet in retrospect as a "protofeminist," because of her "gender awareness," and her treatment of domestic concerns of importance in women's lives.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/785576747|title=Feminist writings from ancient times to the modern world : a global sourcebook and history|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|others=Wayne, Tiffany K., 1968-|year=|isbn=9780313345814|location=Santa Barbara|pages=106|oclc=785576747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[Alicia Ostriker]] describes Bradstreet's style as "a combination of rebellion and submission," a pattern that Ostriker also sees in poets to come like [[Phillis Wheatley|Phyllis Wheatley]] and [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/92110/a-change-of-world-episode-1-the-wilderness|title=A Change of World, Episode 1: The Wilderness|last=Fox|first=Curtis|date=2018|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phillis Wheatley|Phyllis Wheatley]] (1753-1784) was brought to the United States from Africa as a slave, and sold to the Wheatley family of Boston in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/phillis-wheatley|title=Phillis Wheatley|last=O'Neale|first=Sondra A.|date=|website=Poetry Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prodigy as a child, Wheatley was the first black person to publish a book of poems in the American colony, and though her poems are sometimes thought of as expressing "meek submission," she is also what [[Camille Dungy]] describes as "a foremother," and a role model for black women poets as "part of the fabric" of American poetry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Involved in the abolitionist movement, Wheatley became "a spokeswoman for the cause of [[American independence]] and the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/316827798|title=The right to write : the literary politics of Anne Bradstreet and Phillis Wheatley|last=Seidler.|first=Engberg, Kathrynn|date=2010|publisher=University Press of America|year=|isbn=9780761846093|location=Lanham, MD|pages=xvi|oclc=316827798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth century poet [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830-1886) is often thought of as feminist, though she never wrote for public audiences. Not necessarily recognized in her own lifetime, Dickinson offers powerful female speakers. Engaging with male writers like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] or [[William Wordsworth]], her work is praised for developing "others ways of representing the position of a female speaking subject" in particular romantic and psychological dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22490475|title=Dickinson and the boundaries of feminist theory|last=1958-|first=Loeffelholz, Mary,|date=1991|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=0252017897|location=Urbana|pages=22–25|oclc=22490475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See for example the declaration of desire and longing in [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44087/wild-nights-wild-nights-269 'Wild nights - Wild nights!.']&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the 1970s, [[feminist literary criticism]] articulated Dickinson's feminism through groundbreaking studies by [[Margaret Homans]], [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]], and Suzanne Juhasz. Critics point in particular to Dickinson's expression of anger at women's confinement, to her re-gendering of external and internal realities, to her use of feminist motifs, and to her articulation of her particular position in Puritan, patriarchal culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/185033031|title=Approaching Emily Dickinson : critical currents and crosscurrents since 1960|last=1943-|first=White, Fred D.,|date=2008|publisher=Camden House|year=|isbn=9781571133168|location=Rochester, N.Y.|pages=65–70|oclc=185033031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson also proves that confinement to domestic life does not dictate an inability to create great poetry.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As the poet [[Adrienne Rich]] writes, "Probably no poet ever lived so much and so purposefully in one house; even, in one room."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4195229|title=Shakespeare's sisters : feminist essays on women poets|last=|first=|date=1979|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Gilbert, Sandra M., Gubar, Susan, 1944-|year=|isbn=0253112583|location=Bloomington|pages=99|oclc=4195229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 1900s North American Feminist Poets===

[[File:Alice Dunbar Nelson cropped.jpg|thumb|Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson]]
Feminist poets of the early twentieth century harnessed the new opportunities and rights which came as a result of coeducational resources now afforded to women.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/928779869|title=A history of twentieth-century American women's poetry|last=Kinnhan.|first=Linda|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristianne Miller goes so far as to say that 'In no period before and rarely since have women poets had greater success and influence than in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.'&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Living through the turn of the century was [[Alice Dunbar Nelson|Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson]](1875-1935), a poet often thought of in relation to her marriage to [[Paul Laurence Dunbar|Paul Dunbar]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/alice-moore-dunbar-nelson|title=Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar-Nelson, however, is an accomplished writer in her own right, praised by poet [[Camille Dungy]] for breaking out of writing only about "black women's things," instead addressing "the theater and war of life."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Born in New Orleans, Dubar-Nelson's family had a heritage of African American, Anglo, Native American, and Creole roots.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; [[Camille Dungy]] suggests that bringing black women writers like Dunbar-Nelson into the feminist canon alongside Bradstreet and Dickinson is of great importance in rediscovering literary foremothers for black women writers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The early twentieth century was also a significant moment for feminism, because it saw the rise of the [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]] movement, and poets responded to the political moment by writing poems regarding the debate as to whether or not women should have the right to vote. In her collection ''Suffrage Songs and Verses,'' [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] criticises wealthy women, who because they live a life of ease, deny other women their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/gilman/suffrage/suffrage.html#anti|title=Suffrage Songs and Verses.|website=digital.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Duer Miller]] (1874-1942) wrote poems mocking [[Anti-suffragism|anti-suffragist]] advocates, which were published in the [[New-York Tribune|New York Tribune]], a popular news outlet of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aliceduermiller.com|title=Alice Duer Miller|website=www.aliceduermiller.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/01/are-women-people-the-suffragist-poems-of-alice-duer-miller|title=Are Women People?

While some poets have been embraced by the feminist canon, others are seen as awkward additions in spite of their success, for example [[Gertrude Stein]] (1874-1946) is often defined more as a poet involved in modernist experimentation than feminist discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/gertrude-stein|title=Gertrude Stein|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of modernism's tenets seem incompatible with some kinds of feminism, like the repression of emotion, and avoidance of domesticity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nevertheless, second wave feminists found modernist women poets like [[H.D.]] (1886-1961) to be a powerful example, unfairly overlooked by male critics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/h-d|title=H.

By the time of the 1940s, magazines were being set up which, though perhaps not obviously feminist, certainly in their practices were very different to male-run publications: take for example [[Contemporary Verse 2|Contemporary Verse]] (1941–52) published in Canada by a group of women writers, including [[Dorothy Livesay]], [[P. K. Page|P.K. Page]], and [[Anne Marriott]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/969538355|title=The making of modern poetry in Canada : essential commentary on Canadian poetry in English|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Gnarowski, Michael, 1934-, Dudek, Louis, 1918-2001,|year=|isbn=9780773549609|edition= Third|location=Montreal|pages=xxix, xxv|oclc=969538355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 1960 North American Feminist Poets===

[[File:Audre Lorde.jpg|thumb|Audre Lorde]]
Historian [[Ruth Rosen]] describes the mainstream poetry world before 1960 as "an all boy's club," adding that poetry was not "women's place," and explains that in order to get a poetry book published, writers would have to overcome their gender and race.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/101723/books-that-broke-down-barriers|title="A Change of World, Episode 2: Books that Broke Down Barriers"|last=Fox|first=Curtis|date=|website=Poetry Foundation.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest of American feminist poets in the rights of minorities have often put them in conflict with American institutions like the [[Academy of American Poets|American Academy of Poets]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the strategies of feminist poets is to demonstrate "their opposition to a dominant poetry culture that does not recognize the primacy of gender and other oppressions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[1960s]] feminist poetry provided a useful space for [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] American feminist politics.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/146073/poetry-and-feminism|title=Poetry and Feminism|last=|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poets, however, were not necessarily unified in their themes or formal techniques, but had links to specific movements and trends, such as the New York Poets, the [[Black Mountain poets]], the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], or the [[Beat poets|Beat Poets]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Denise Levertov]] (1923-1997), for example, refined and built upon poetics from the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] School.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levertov|first=Denise|date=1965|title=Some Notes on Organic Form|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69392/some-notes-on-organic-form-56d249032078f|journal=Poetry|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/denise-levertov|title=Denise Levertov|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women like [[Sylvia Plath]] (1932-1963) and [[Anne Sexton]] (1928-1974) provided a feminist version of the [[Confessional poetry|Confessional Poets]]' poetics, which worked alongside feminist texts of the day, like [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', to "address taboo subjects and social limitations that plagued American women" (although Plath died before ''The Feminine Mystique'' was published)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/09/confessionalism-feminism-at-coldfront|title=Confessionalism and Feminism at Coldfront|last=Harriet|first=Staff|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anne-sexton|title=Anne Sexton|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/sylvia-plath|title=Sylvia Plath|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucille Clifton]] (1936-2010) also borrowed from [[Confessional poetry|Confessional]] poetics, a strategy that was key according to [[Adrienne Rich]] for avoiding being trapped between "misogynist black male critics and white feminists still struggling to unearth a white woman's tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coldfrontmag.com/confessionalism-birthed-from-feminism-jd/|title=Confessionalism Birthed from Feminism|last=Wilson|first=Merida|date=|website=http://coldfrontmag.com/confessionalism-birthed-from-feminism-jd/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/lucille-clifton|title=Lucille Clifton|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confessional poetry|Confessionalism]] lent to feminist poetry the possibility of agency for the female speaker, and the refusal to present well-behaved women, though it was troubling that the Confessional women poets who committed suicide tended to be foregrounded and promoted in poetry circles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

[[Muriel Rukeyser]] (1913-1980) was a generation older than Plath and Sexton, and rejected the suicidal poetics of the Confessional writers.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Rukeyser also wrote frankly about the body and sexuality, inspiring later poets like [[Sharon Olds]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/144891/a-change-of-world-episode-4-a-place-of-permission|title=A Change of World, Episode 4 : A Place of Permission - Poetry Off the Shelf|date=2018-09-26|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Rukeyser's leftist politics and militant writing style proved to be a model for poet [[Adrienne Rich]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Both poets also contributed to the [[Anti-Vietnam War Movement|anti-Vietnam War movement]]: for example [[Muriel Rukeyser|Rukeyser]] and [[Adrienne Rich|Rich]] took part in readings as part of the event series, the Week of the Angry Arts Against the War in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Adrienne Rich]] (1929-2012) also became a key feminist poet, praised by [[Alicia Ostriker]] for bringing "intellect" to poetry, "something that women were not supposed to have," as well as "a leftward leaning sensibility in which coming out as lesbian was just one part."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/adrienne-rich|title=Adrienne Rich|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich's [https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/diving-wreck 'Diving into the Wreck'] is an important feminist poem, as it describes moving down as an act of triumph, where the wreck might be history, literature, or human life, and the poem itself is a kind of "battlecry."&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Famously, when Rich received the National Book Award for her collection, ''Diving into the Wreck,'' she accepted it on behalf of all the female nominees, including [[Audre Lorde]] and [[Alice Walker]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;We, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and Alice Walker, together accept this award in the name of all the women whose voices have gone and still go unheard in a patriarchal world, and in the name of those who, like us, have been tolerated as token women in this culture, often at great cost and in great pain. We believe that we can enrich ourselves more in supporting and giving to each other than by competing against each other; and that poetry— if it is poetry— exists in a realm beyond ranking and comparison.

=== Feminist Anthologies in North America in the 1970s and 80s ===

In the 1970s and 80s, feminist poetry evolved alongside the feminist movement, becoming a useful tool for activist groups organised around [[radical feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[lesbian feminism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Poetry readings became spaces for feminists to come together in cities and in rural communities, and talk about sexuality, women's roles, and the possibilities beyond heteronormative life.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Figures like [[Judy Grahn]] were figureheads for the women's movement, providing electrifying readings that enlivened and inspired audiences.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Often the poems were political, and sometimes the writers tried to use language that "ordinary women" could read and understand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Countering tokenism was also an important aspect of the feminist poetry project.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/143653/shattering-the-blue-velvet-chair|title=A Change of World, Episode 3: Shattering the Blue Velvet Chair - Poetry Off the Shelf|date=2018-09-26|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carolyn Forché]] describes the "blue velvet chair" effect, inspired by group portraits of canonical poets, in which one - but only one - woman writer was allowed to join the men, often sat in a Victorian blue velvet chair.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;

As poetry took on a new significance for the feminist movement, so a number of new poetry anthologies were published which emphasised women's voices and experiences.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585915|title=The Oxford handbook of Canadian literature|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Sugars, Cynthia Conchita, 1963-|year=|isbn=9780199941865|location=New York, NY|pages=853|oclc=907585915}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthologies played an important role generally in opening up the political consciousness of poetry, an important example being [[Raymond Souster]]'s volume, ''New Wave Canada: The Explosion in Canadian Poetry'' (1966).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;[[Louis Dudek]] and Michael Gnarowski describe the anthology's embracing of counterculture, including new ideas about sexuality and the role of women.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Other anthologies began to focus specifically on women's writing, such as:

*''[[Sisterhood Is Powerful|Sisterhood is Powerful]]'' (1970) edited by [[Robin Morgan]];
*''[http://msmagazine.com/blog/2018/05/15/no-masks-celebrating-landmark-anthology-womens-poetry-45-years-later/ No More Masks!]'' (1971) edited by [[Florence Howe]] and [[Ellen Bass]];
*''[https://www.pacificaradioarchives.org/recording/bc1738 The World Split Open]'' (1972) edited by [[Louise Bernikow]];
*''Psyche'' (1973) edited by Barbara Segnitz and Carol Rainey;
*''New Poets, Women'' (1976) edited by Terry Wetherby;
*''Contemporary Women Poets'' (1977) edited by Jennifer McDowell and Milton Leventhal;
*''Open to Sun'' (1979) edited by Nora Jacquez Wieser;
*''[[Lesbian Poetry: An Anthology|Lesbian Poetry]]'' (1982) edited by Elly Bulkin and [[Joan Larkin]];
*''Daughters of the Sun, Women of the Moon: Poetry by Black Canadian Women'' (1990) edited by Ann Wallace.

Other anthologies created new canons of women's writing from the past, such as ''Black sister: poetry by black American women, 1746-1980'' (1981) edited by Erlene Stetson; or ''Writing Red: An Anthology of American Women Writers, 1930-1940'' (1987) edited by Paula Rabinowitz and Charlotte Nekola. Such anthologies "established solid ground for the communication and circulation of feminist ideas" in the American and Canadian Academies.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Conferences also provided important spaces for feminists to share and discuss ideas about the possibilities of poetry: for example a key moment for Canadian feminist poetry was the "Women and words / Les femmes et les motes" conference in 1983.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beverley|first=Andrea|date=2017|title='Women and Words'|url=https://champlainsociety.utpjournals.press/findings-trouvailles/2017/11/women-and-words-1983-visual-traces|journal=The Champlain Society - Findings|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Vancouver convention brought together women writers, publishers, and booksellers to discuss the issues of the Canadian literary world, including gender inequity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Modern Feminist Poetry in North America ===
One change in the writing of women poets after the 1960s and 1970s was the possibility of writing about women's lives and experiences.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; To give authority to women's voices, writers like [[Honor Moore]] and [[Judy Grahn|Judy Graun]] held workshops specifically for women in order to overcome women's inner critics exacerbated by sexism.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; These networks of mentorship sprang up in feminist communities, and in universities.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

The work at this time was focussing on "images of women," and this often meant broadening representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Juhasz|first=Suzanne|date=1977|title=The critic as feminist: Reflections on women's poetry, feminism, and the art of criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F00497878.1977.9978438|journal=Women's Studies|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=113–127|doi=10.1080/00497878.1977.9978438|issn=0049-7878|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodology eventually began to be criticised, however, because it failed to recognise the complications of violence embedded in the very structure of language.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sojka|first=Eugenia|date=2001|title=Canadian Feminist Writing and American Poetry|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1128&amp;context=clcweb|journal=CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture|volume=3.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers influenced by the [[avant-garde]] and by [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry]] sought to challenge the idea of language's neutrality.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; US feminist language poets like [[Lyn Hejinian|Lynn Hejinian]] or [[Susan Howe]], or Canadian writers like [[Daphne Marlatt]] looked back to the legacy of experimentalist modernists like [[Gertrude Stein]], or [[Mina Loy]], and also to diverse sources of inspiration like [[Denise Levertov]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Nicole Brossard]], [[Phyllis Webb]], [[Louky Bersianik]], and [[Julia Kristeva]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  They also reframed the language poetics from male mentors like [[Charles Olson]], [[Robert Creeley]], [[Gary Snyder]], or [[Allen Ginsberg]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Poets also sought to intervene in spheres traditionally dominated by men. Take for example [[Eileen Myles]]' intervention into politics in her 1992 "Write-in Campaign for President."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eileenmyles.net/howto.htm|title=1992 Write-in Campaign for President:  Eileen Myles|website=www.eileenmyles.net|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

By the time of the 1990s, and the rise of [[intersectionality]] as a key feminist term, many feminist poets resisted the term "woman poet," because it suggested "too confining a collective identity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also sought to undermine "the assumption that has sometimes structured feminist political organizing and even feminist literary publishing and criticism—that gender can be separated from race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality, and that white middleclass women first and foremost have the tools and the knowhow for the enterprise of analyzing gendered experience and literary production."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Present day feminist poetry in North America holds space for a great variety of poets tackling identity, sexuality, and gender issues. Key writings in the recent past include [[Claudia Rankine]]'s careful skewering of race related [[microaggression]]s in ''Citizen,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/04/23/claudia-rankine-new-way-writing-about-race/|title='A New Way of Writing About Race'|last=Laird|first=Nick|work=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothea Laskey's "ferocious confession" in Rome for example,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://feministing.com/2014/07/31/feministing-readz-dorothea-laskys-rome/|title=Feministing Readz: Dorothea Lasky's Rome|work=Feministing|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bhanu Kapil's challenge the violent inherent in structures of language and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/laying-down-banlieue|title=L(a)ying Down in the Banlieue {{!}} Mute|website=www.metamute.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteenth century advocate for women's rights [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraf]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (1797-1851), put great emphasis on the power of the poetic imagination as a liberator tool, and many nineteenth century British women writers were inspired by Wollstonecraft to use poetry to enter public debates about gender roles, poverty, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wollstonecraft|first=Mary|date=1797|title="On Poetry and Our Relish for the Beauties of Nature"|url=|journal=Monthly Magazine|volume=April|pages=279–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/mary-wollstonecraft-shelley|title=Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The verse-novel ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856) by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] (1806-1861) is one such feminist work, which challenged a prevailing attitude that women's lives were incompatible with writing poetry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/elizabeth-barrett-browning|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|date=2018-09-17|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aurora Leigh'' had a very public impact, for example influencing the views of American social reformer [[Susan B.

Levy is often thought of as prefiguring or representing an early version of the New Woman, a stereotypical image of an independent woman who often worked rather than relying on her menfolk, and was associated with [[Gender bender|gender bending]] and deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Dolores|date=1991|title=The "New Woman" as Prometheus: Women Artists Depict Women Smoking|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1358183|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3–9|doi=10.2307/1358183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/20661/|title=Amy Levy: her life, her poetry and the era of the new woman|last=Christine|first=Pullen,|date=2000|website=eprints.kingston.ac.uk|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century was an era of surplus women, who had to work to survive: by 1911, 77 per cent of women workers in the UK were single.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=V.|last2=Marland|first2=H.|date=2009-01-01|title=From Danger and Motherhood to Health and Beauty: Health Advice for the Factory Girl in Early Twentieth-Century Britain|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/20/4/454/1690021|journal=Twentieth Century British History|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=454–481|doi=10.1093/tcbh/hwp027|issn=0955-2359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the struggle of [[suffragette]]s campaigning for votes for women, many British feminist poets sought to emulate the example of Victorian women writers, often expressing their radical political beliefs through poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://britlitsurvey2.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/mary-wollstonecraft-influence-beyond-the-grave/|title=Mary Wollstonecraft: Influence Beyond the Grave|last=|first=|date=|website=British Literature 1700-1900, A Course Blog|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the writers were not professional poets, but wrote out of necessity, including satirical portraits of politicians, or writings from prison, as in ''Holloway Jingles'', a collection of writing from imprisoned women collated by the Glasgow Branch of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54206569|title=Literature of the women's suffrage campaign in England|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Broadview Press|others=Nelson, Carolyn Christensen.|year=|isbn=1551115115|location=Peterborough, Ont.|pages=153|oclc=54206569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Feminist Poets and Modernism ===

In the inter-war years, British women poets associated with modernism began to find themselves public figures, though their feminist ideas sometimes came into conflict with the literary establishment which remained a kind of "exclusive male club."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, Modernism and British Poetry, 1910–1939: Resisting Femininity|last=Dowson|first=Jane|publisher=Ash gate|year=2002|isbn=9780754604631|location=Burlington, VT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often these writers are difficult to categorize in relation to literary groups traditionally used, like the [[avant-garde]] or [[Modernism|modernists]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was also a period when American women poets living in Britain made an important contribution to the writing of the day: writers like [[H.D.]], [[Mina Loy]], and [[Amy Lowell]] all combined radical poetic content with experimentation of form, allowing them to explore feminist polemic and non-heteronormative sexualities in innovative new modes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other British feminist poets of the time like [[Anna Wickham]], [[Charlotte Mew]], and [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]], receive less critical attention, but also sought to challenge and reevaluate tropes of femininity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Post 1960s Feminist Poetry in Britain ===

During the 1960s, the Women's Liberation Movement in the UK had a great influence on the literary world.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/sisterhood/articles/feminist-literature|title=Feminist literature|last=Sisterhood and After Research Team|first=|date=|website=The British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist publishers, [[Virago Press|Virago]] (founded in 1973), [[Onlywomen Press|Onlywomen]] (1974), The Women's Press (1978), and Sheba (1980), were established, alongside magazines like [https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib Spare Rib].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Like their counterparts in the US, British feminist editors in the 1970s and 80s created landmark anthologies of women's poetry, which foregrounded the variety and strength of women's writing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; These included Lilian Mohin's ''One Foot on the Mountain'' (1979), [[Jeni Couzyn]]'s ''The Bloodaxe Book of Contemporary Women Poets'' (1985), Moira Ferguson's ''First Feminists: British Women Writers 1578-1799'' (1985), Kate Armstrong's ''Fresh Oceans'' (1989), Jude Brigley's ''Exchanges'' (1990), and Catherine Kerrigan's ''An Anthology of Scottish Women Poets'' (1991).

}}
''G.S.N.T. 3: The Troubled Times of Brian Carenard'' received mixed reviews from [[music criticism|music critic]]s. Brandon Matthews of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' gave the album an L, saying "True hip-hop fans will appreciate his new body of work as it counteracts the contemporary formula of heavy bass driven tracks that seem to have saturated radio. His features solidify his reputable status by having tracks with legends such as Big Daddy Kane, Kool G Rap, Papoose and even features Omar Epps (whom can actually rap!). He also grabs 2014 XXL Freshman Lil Bibby and fellow New York lyricist Memphis Bleek, who both shine on “Mechanical Animals (4 generations).” His beat selection identifies his desire to be a staple in the industry as opposed to a novelty, tapping the services of DJ Premier and Clev Trev."&lt;ref name="XXL"/&gt; Jay Balfour of [[HipHopDX]] gave the album three out of five stars, saying "While he’s developed himself into a recognizable Hip Hop pundit outside of his music, Saigon has struggled to maintain his voice inside of it. There’s consolation in the fact that he’s still a talented emcee, but he’s tried too much while staying safe at the same time. Saigon fans will find plenty to pick through on ''GSNT3'' but they may be the most alienated listeners as well, more aware than anyone that he is capable of better."&lt;ref name="HHDX"/&gt;

A '''[[gossip]] columnist''' is someone who writes a '''gossip column''' in a [[newspaper]] or [[magazine]], especially a [[gossip magazine]]. Gossip columns are material written in a light, informal style, which relates the gossip columnist's opinions about the personal lives or conduct of  [[Celebrity|celebrities]] from [[show business]] ([[film|motion picture]] [[movie star]]s, [[theater]], and [[television]] actors), [[politician]]s, [[professional sports]] stars, and other [[wealth]]y people or public figures. Some gossip columnists broadcast segments on [[radio programming|radio]] and [[television program|television]].

The columns mix factual material on arrests, divorces, marriages and pregnancies, obtained from official records, with more speculative gossip stories, [[rumor]]s, and [[innuendo]] about romantic relationships, affairs, and purported personal problems.

Gossip columnists have a reciprocal relationship with the celebrities whose private lives are splashed about in the gossip column's pages. While gossip columnists sometimes engage in (borderline) [[defamation|defamatory]] conduct, spreading innuendo about alleged [[Morality|immoral]] or illegal conduct that can injure celebrities' reputations, they also are an important part of the "Star System" publicity machine that turns movie actors and musicians into celebrities and [[superstar]]s that are the objects of the public's obsessive attention and interest. The [[press agent|publicity agents]] of celebrities often provide or "leak" information or rumors to gossip columnists to publicize the celebrity or their projects, or to counteract "bad press" that has recently surfaced about their conduct.

==Libel and defamation==
While gossip columnists’ "bread and butter" is rumor, innuendo, and allegations of scandalous behavior, there is a fine line between legally acceptable spreading of rumor and the making of defamatory statements, which can provoke a lawsuit. Newspaper and magazine editorial policies normally require gossip columnists to have a source for all of their allegations, to protect the publisher against lawsuits for [[defamation]] (libel).

In the United States, celebrities or public figures can sue for libel if their private lives are revealed in gossip columns and they believe that their reputation has been defamed — that is, exposed to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or [[money|pecuniary]] loss. Gossip columnists cannot defend against libel claims by arguing that they merely repeated, but did not originate the defaming rumor or claim; instead, a columnist must prove that the allegedly defaming statement was truthful, or that it was based on a reasonably reliable source.

In the mid-1960s, rulings by the [[United States Supreme Court]] made it harder for the media to be sued for libel in the U.S. The court ruled that libel only occurred in cases where a publication printed falsehoods about a celebrity with “reckless disregard” for the truth. A celebrity suing a newspaper for libel must now prove that the paper published the falsehood with actual [[malice (legal term)|malice]], or with deliberate knowledge that the statement was both incorrect and defamatory.

Moreover, the court ruled that only factual misrepresentation is libel, not expression of opinion. Thus if a gossip columnist writes that they “...think that Celebrity X is an idiot,” the columnist does not face a risk of being sued for libel. On the other hand, if the columnist invents an allegation that “...Celebrity X is a wife beater,” with no supporting source or evidence, the celebrity can sue for libel on the grounds that their reputation was defamed.

There is however circumstances where gossip columnist may not be fact checking the information they are receiving from their sources before publishing their stories. Not to mention that there are gossip columnist that are not reputable themselves to be posting articles about celebrities. As a result of this there is a chance that there are stories that have been publish that could lead to the defamation of celebrities.

==History==
[[File:Louella-Parsons-1937.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Louella Parsons]] (1937)]]
The first gossip columnist, dominating the 1930s and 40s, was [[Walter Winchell]], who used political, entertainment, and social connections to mine information and rumors, which he then either published in his column ''On Broadway'', or used for trade or blackmail, to accumulate more power. He became "the most feared journalist" of his era.

In [[Hollywood]]'s "[[Classical Hollywood cinema|golden age]]" in the 1930s and 1940s, gossip columnists were courted by the [[movie studio]]s, so that the studios could use gossip columns as a powerful publicity tool. During this period, the major film studios had "stables" of contractually obligated actors, and the studios controlled nearly all aspects of the lives of their movie stars. From the 1930s through the 1950s, the two best-known - and competing - Hollywood gossip columnists were [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Louella Parsons]].

Well-timed [[News leak|leaks]] about a star's purported romantic adventures helped the studios to create and sustain the public's interest in the studios' star actors. As well, the movie studios' publicity agents acted as unnamed "well-informed inside sources" who provided misinformation and rumors to counteract whispers about celebrity secrets — such as [[homosexuality]] or an [[Legitimacy (family law)|out-of-wedlock]] child —  that could have severely damaged not only the reputation of the movie star in question, but the movie star's box office viability.

Having fallen into ill-repute after the heyday of Hopper and Parsons, gossip columnists saw a comeback in the 1980s. Today, many mainstream magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' which would once have considered the idea of hiring gossip columnists to pen articles to have been beneath their stature, have sections titled "People" or "Entertainment". These mainstream gossip columns provide a light, chatty glimpse into the private lives and misadventures of the rich and famous. At the other end of the journalism spectrum, there are entire publications that deal primarily in gossip, rumor, and innuendo about celebrities, such as the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|'red-top' tabloids]] in the UK and [[Gossip magazine|celebrity 'tell-all' magazines]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3612">{{Music of Haiti}}
'''Haitian hip hop''' or '''rap kreyòl''', is music originating from [[Haiti]] and sung by artists of Haitian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wildermuth |first=Erin |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/apr/21/us-hip-hop-haiti-musical-fusion-cultural-conquest/ |title=American hip-hop in Haiti: Musical fusion or cultural conquest? |publisher=Washington Times |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, hardcore beats are used while the artist raps in [[Haitian Creole]]. Rap kreyòl has been part of Haitian culture since the early 1980s with groups such as Original Rap Staff, King Posee, Rap Kreyòl S.A., Masters of Haiti, Fighters, Blackdo, Fam-Squad, Supa Deno, Prince Berlin and Muzion attaining prominence, but lately has become very popular with Haitian youth.&lt;ref name="google156"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/booksid=_7NIe_I298MC&amp;pg=PA156 |title=Caribbean Currents: Caribbean Music from Rumba to Reggae |author=Manuel, Peter with Kenneth Bilby, Michael Largey |page=156 |year=2006 |accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notable group from the 1990s is Black Leaders.  The impact of Black Leaders and its members is lasting.  Though known primarily for his role in Black Leaders, Don Roy is still an active contributor to Haitian music across many genres.  Since the peak of his notoriety, Don Roy has chosen to create in other genres.  While still working in a production capacity in genres such as Rap Kreyòl and Reggae, Don Roy has chosen to create and work with prominent artists of the modern roots/Rasin movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambafrance-ht.org/L-Institut-francais-chaque-jour&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Haitian rap artists have had rough childhoods and difficult living conditions producing rappers who address socio-economic topics in their lyrics.&lt;ref name="google156"/&gt; Though similar to mainstream American [[hip hop]] in that materialistic imagery is portrayed or lyricized, the negative aspects of less fortunate Haitian society, such as topics concerning slum life, gang warfare, the drug trade, and poverty, are much more common.

The most well-known exports of Haitian hip hop are two members of the legendary [[Grammy Award]]-winning hip hop group, the [[Fugees]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and his cousin [[Pras Michel]]. Most recently, Christopher ''Freedom'' Laroche released his inspirational debut album ''Liberation 1804'', Kerns (Mr OK) Olirice released his first EP (Men Mwen) while acts like [[Barikad Crew]], Rockfam, Brimad, Topson, Chale Republic, Pick Up Click, BriganDie, Team Lobey, Dezod Beats and G Bobby Bon Flo, Steves J. Bryan have gained popularity among the Haitian population. However, the godfather of hip hop in Haiti is the late [[Master Dji]], who not only released the first Haitian rap song in the early 1980s, formed the group Rap Kreyòl S.A., but was also the first Haitian DJ and also influential in encouraging other young Haitians such as Supa Deno, DJ Fanfan and DJ Live to become rappers, [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s, and [[B-boying|breakdancers]].

This article details the appearance of '''Harry Potter theming in amusement parks'''. In the late 1990s, [[Universal Parks and Resorts]] began discussing the possibility of purchasing the license for Harry Potter to create and theme amusement park rides. As Time Warner owns the license, a small walkthrough attraction was constructed at [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] called the [[Harry Potter Movie Magic Experience]] in 2001. This attraction was removed two years later. In 2010, Universal's [[Islands of Adventure]] park opened [[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Orlando Resort)|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter]]. Similar attractions are destined for [[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios Hollywood)|Universal Studios Hollywood]] and  [[Universal Studios Japan]].

[[File:WWOHP Coming Soon Billboards.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Themed billboards were located around the Wizarding World during the two year construction period.|Themed billboards were located around the Wizarding World during the two year construction period.]]

Construction of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter began seven months after the official announcement, in January 2008. By July, the [[Flying Unicorn]] and Enchanted Oak Tavern were closed. The Flying Unicorn then began an almost two year refurbishment which transformed it into the Flight of the Hippogriff. The Enchanted Oak Tavern was later demolished. A bridge was built to connect [[Islands_of_adventure#The_Lost_Continent|The Lost Continent]] with [[Islands_of_adventure#Jurassic_Park|Jurassic Park]] allowing guests to avoid the construction zone that was to be the Wizarding World. Construction progressed with the Hogwarts castle slowly taking shape. By September 2008, the Dueling Dragons entrance was moved to Jurassic Park to make room for construction of Hogsmeade. One month later, the old entrance was demolished. By September 2009, the top shell of Hogwarts castle was completed. On September 15, an announcement was made as to what exactly was going to be included in the Wizarding World. In early 2010, Universal increased the marketing of the area which included newspaper advertisements, billboards and television commercials. The [[Dueling Dragons]] were closed for some maintenance before being transformed into the Dragon Challenge.&lt;ref name="Construction timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wizarding World of Harry Potter timeline|url=http://www.fox5sandiego.com/sports/os-harry-potter-timeline-20100618,0,7082546.story|work=Timeline|publisher=Fox 5 San Diego|accessdate=2010-09-03|date=2010-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724014906/http://www.fox5sandiego.com/sports/os-harry-potter-timeline-20100618%2C0%2C7082546.story#|archive-date=2011-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was complete by June 1, 2010 when the area began soft openings.&lt;ref name="The Leaky Cauldron Wizarding World of Harry Potter Soft Open Report RoundUp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2010/6/1/wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-soft-open-report-roundup |title=Wizarding World of Harry Potter Soft Open Report RoundUp|date=2010-06-01 |work= |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[soft opening]] weekend was held for the media and reserved guests, starting on May 28, 2010. The park had two opening ceremonies that took place on June 16 and June 18, 2010. The first opening was reserved for the cast and crew of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], J.K. Rowling (author of the [[Harry Potter|novels]]), [[Universal Orlando Resort]] officials, as well as representatives from the media. The ceremony concluded with a fireworks display and a performance by the [[Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra]], led by [[John Williams]] (composer of the music for the first three films). On June 18, the second ceremony occurred which officially opened The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to the public. Universal Orlando representative Bill Davis introduced the area to the audience which included actors from the films including [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Rupert Grint]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Warwick Davis]], [[Tom Felton]], [[Matthew Lewis (actor)|Matthew Lewis]], [[Bonnie Wright]] and [[James and Oliver Phelps]].

A '''home shopping host''' is the on-air host that partners with guests on [[television]] [[shopping channel]]s, such as [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]], [[QVC]], [[Jewelry Television]] and [[ShopHQ]].  The job of a [[home shopping]] host is to introduce new presenters and guests to the television audience, and help these guests explain the values and features of the product being showcased.

==History==
Back in 1977, [[Clearwater, Florida]] radio station owner [[Lowell 'Bud' Paxson]] was collecting [[money]] from local companies that advertised on his station.  One local company, a [[hardware store]] owner, refused payment, insisting that not one single customer had heard the [[broadcast]] of his radio advertisements.  Paxson and the store owner argued back and forth, eventually coming to a compromise: Instead of a financial payment, the store owner gave Paxson a box filled with electric [[can opener]]s.  Paxson took the box, and returned to the radio station.

When the station's [[talk radio]] host, [[Bob Circosta]], was on a [[newsbreak]], Paxson asked Circosta to sell these can openers to his audience.  Circosta initially objected, but soon complied with his Paxson's wishes.  "I looked at him like he had three heads," Circosta said, recalling the moment. "I thought it would be unethical because I was trying to be a serious host."  When Circosta returned to the airwaves, he began describing the can openers and asking listeners to buy them.

All 112 can openers were purchased in under an hour.

Sensing the sales potential of live, on-air product selling, [[Lowell 'Bud' Paxson]] and financier [[Roy Speer]] co-founded a local cable TV channel (channel 52 on Vision Cable) in 1982 that sold products directly to Florida viewers, and then launched nationwide in 1985. The channel was the Home Shopping Club, later [[Home Shopping Network]], and Paxson's former radio man Bob Circosta was tapped as the network's first-ever host. HSN soon became a billion dollar juggernaut and began the home shopping / electronic retailing industry. In 1996, the two sold HSN to Hollywood executive Barry Diller.

In addition to [[Bob Circosta]], other early home shopping hosts were [[Alice Cleveland]], [[Bobbi Ray Carter]], [[Tina Berry]], [[Dan Dennis]], [[John Cremeans]], [[Maven Huffman]] and Lisa Robertson.

==Job requirements==
On all the major [[television]] [[shopping channels]], the [https://bestdeal.in.nf/ home shopping] [[Television presenter|host]] will stay on the air for one to three hours at a time, welcoming several new guests and demonstrating many new products.  Since products and guests are often only given 10 or 15 minutes to sell their product in the world of [[home shopping]], it's not uncommon for a host to be required to introduce 20 or more different products and inventions during their shift.  Being quick-witted, personable, and [[likeable]] is essential for a host, as well as being able to make quick transitions from one product to another.  Additionally, with networks like [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]] and [[QVC]] routinely debuting brand new inventions and products, the host must also quickly [[:wikt:articulate|articulate]] to the audience why the item is worth purchasing.

==Job difficulties==
All the national [[United States|American]] home [[shopping channels]] are broadcast live, 24 hours a day, so mistakes and errors cannot be edited out.  This has led to some memorable on-air [[home shopping]] [[bloopers]], such as a [[QVC]] demonstrator falling from a [[ladder]] and getting injured, or a Shop at Home host insisting that a [[moth]] in a photograph is actually a [[horse]].

Many of the guests who accompany the [[home shopping]] host on-air are not particularly TV-savvy or experienced, so the host must help guests better define the attributes and value of the items being showcased.

Because of the large influx of guests and products, hosts often lack the [[time]] to study the product beforehand, which increases the need for an effective host to possess sufficient verbal skills to mask this lack of direct product knowledge.

In media terms, an '''interview disc''' is a recorded disc with spoken word recordings in an [[interview]] style format, with a specific person or group of people, as opposed to the usual music features.  The source of the recording can vary.

==Description==
Some of them feature recordings of a standard [[interview]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/search/?q=interview%20disc&amp;type=all|title=Searching for "interview disc" within on Discogs|last=|first=|date=|work=discogs.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; others may feature recordings of a [[press conference]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/search/?q=press%20conference&amp;type=all|title=Searching for "press conference" within on Discogs|last=|first=|date=|work=discogs.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however these are still often referred to as an interview disc as they would feature questions and answers in the usual format, with the main difference only there would be more than one interviewer.  In both instances, such discs seldom contain actual music.

The term Interview disc started referring to vinyl discs of such recordings but the term can also be used to refer to CDs of the same nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/search/?q=unofficial%20release%20interview&amp;format_exact=CD&amp;type=all|title=Searching for "unofficial release interview" within CD on Discogs|last=|first=|date=|work=discogs.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of them are limited edition release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/search/?q=limited%20edition%20interview%20disc&amp;type=all|title=Searching for "limited edition interview disc" within on Discogs|last=|first=|date=|work=discogs.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of them are released on lesser known record labels &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/weirdo/interview.html|title=Interview Albums|work=lukpac.org|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[bootleg recording]], these are usually not recorded in studio conditions and as a result are not always of good sound quality.

==Distribution forms==
Interview discs can often be distributed in many forms including [[picture disc]], [[flexi disc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/search/?q=interview%20flexi&amp;type=all|title=Searching for "interview flexi" within on Discogs|last=|first=|date=|work=discogs.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shaped Compact Disc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/search/?q=shaped%20interview%20disc&amp;type=all|title=Searching for "shaped interview disc" within on Discogs|last=|first=|date=|work=discogs.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Unusual types of gramophone records#Unusual appearance|other types of unusual appearances]].

'''Joseph Evans Brown''' (July 28, 1891&amp;nbsp;– July 6, 1973) was an American actor and comedian, remembered for his amiable screen persona, comic timing, and enormous elastic-mouth smile.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; He was one of the most popular American comedians in the 1930s and 1940s, with films like ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935), ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936), and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). In his later career Brown starred in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), as Osgood Fielding III, in which he utters the famous punchline, "Well, nobody's perfect."

==Early life==
Brown was born on July 28, 1891, in [[Holgate, Ohio]], near Toledo, into a large family largely of Welsh descent. He spent most of his childhood in Toledo. In 1902, at the age of ten, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvelous Ashtons, who toured the country on both the [[circus]] and [[vaudeville]] circuits. Later he became a professional [[baseball player]]. Despite his skill, he declined an opportunity to sign with the [[New York Yankees]] to pursue his career as an entertainer. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into [[Vaudeville]] and finally starred on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the [[musical comedy]] ''Jim Jam Jems''.

==Film career==
[[File:Earthworm Tractors (1936) 1.jpg|thumb|left|with [[June Travis]] in ''[[Earthworm Tractors]]'' (1936)]]
In late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with [[Warner Bros.]] He quickly became a favorite with child audiences,&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy ''[[On with the Show (1929 film)|On with the Show]]'' (1929). He starred in a number of lavish [[Technicolor]] [[Warner Brothers]] musical comedies including: ''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929), ''[[Hold Everything (1930 film)|Hold Everything]]'' (1930), ''[[Song of the West]]'' (1930), and ''[[Going Wild]]'' (1930). By 1931, Joe E. Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.

He appeared in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], and in ''[[Elmer, the Great]]'' (1933) with [[Patricia Ellis]] and [[Claire Dodd]] and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935) with [[Olivia de Havilland]], in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the [[Chicago Cubs]].

In 1933 he starred in ''[[Son of a Sailor (film)|Son of a Sailor]]'' with [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] and [[Thelma Todd]]. In 1934, Brown starred in ''[[A Very Honorable Guy]]'' with [[Alice White]] and [[Robert Barrat]], in ''[[The Circus Clown]]'' again with Patricia Ellis and with [[Dorothy Burgess]], and with Maxine Doyle in ''Six-Day Bike Rider''.

Brown was one of the few [[vaudeville]] comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played [[Francis Flute]] in the [[Max Reinhardt]]/[[William Dieterle]] film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935) and was highly praised for his performance.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt; He starred in ''[[Polo Joe]]'' (1936) with [[Carol Hughes (actress)|Carol Hughes]] and [[Richard "Skeets" Gallagher]], and in ''[[Sons o' Guns]]''. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top ten earners in films. He was sufficiently well known internationally by this point to be depicted in comic strips in the British comic ''[[Film Fun]]'' for twenty years from 1933.

He left Warner Brothers to work for producer [[David L. Loew]], starring in ''[[When's Your Birthday?]]'' (1937). In 1938, he starred in ''[[The Gladiator (1938 film)|The Gladiator]]'', a loose film adaptation of [[Philip Gordon Wylie]]'s 1930 novel ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]'' that influenced the creation of ''[[Superman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book''. New York: Basic Books, 2004 ({{ISBN|0465036562}}), p.80. Also see Moskowitz, Sam ''Explorers of the Infinite: Shapers of Science Fiction'', Cleveland, Ohio: The World Publishing Co., 1963 ({{ISBN|0-88355-130-6}}), pp.278–295&lt;/ref&gt; He gradually switched to making "B" pictures.

==World War II - USO tours==
[[Image:ressbrown.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Brown and [[Irving Leroy Ress]] (right) c. 1950]]
In 1939, Brown testified before the House Immigration Committee in support of a bill that would allow 20,000 [[Germans|German]] Jewish refugee children into the US.  He later adopted two refugee children.&lt;ref&gt;''The Holocaust Chronicle''.  Publications International Ltd., 2000 ({{ISBN|0-7853-2963-3}}), p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

During WWII, he spent a great deal of time entertaining troops, spending many nights working and meeting servicemen at the [[Hollywood Canteen]].&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;  He wrote of his experiences entertaining the troops in his book ''Your Kids and Mine''.

Joe E. Brown's other two sons were in the military service. In 1942 Brown's son, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his A-20 Havoc crashed near [[Palm Springs, California]].&lt;ref name=cdt&gt;{{cite news |coauthors= |title=Capt. Don Brown, Actor's Son, Dies In Bomber Crash. |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/468627642.html?dids=468627642:468627642&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Oct+09%2C+1942&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&amp;desc=CAPT.+DON+BROWN%2C+ACTOR'S+SON%2C+DIES+IN+BOMBER+CRASH&amp;pqatl=google |quote= |work=Chicago Tribune |date=October 9, 1942 |accessdate=April 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 50, Brown himself was too old to enlist, but he traveled thousands of miles at his own expense to entertain American troops. He was the first to do so, traveling to both the Caribbean and Alaska before [[Bob Hope]] had, and before the [[USO]] was organized.

"While big USO names like Bob Hope did not visit the Leyte, Philippine area my father was in (housing was not good), Leyte received any number of entertainers during the war.  Dad said the entertainers were all just a bunch of nice people.  One group in particular was the top actors from a very popular and large musical of the times.  Dad and a few of his buddies would walk back to the tents that housed the USO performers and would visit with them.  Mostly, the USO performers were curious about the events on the islands and how the men were handling things.  One performer, a "wonderful comedian" named Joe E. Brown, would commandeer a military vehicle and be driven around the island.  The entertainer would stop military pedestrians, "ream" them for some inconsequential matter, start laughing, then invite them into the cab so they could be driven to their destinations.  Joe E. Brown was greatly appreciated."  (Memories of Capt. Donald Courtright, told to his daughter Mary in 2011.){{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

On his return to the States, he brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office Department.  He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier.  He would sign autographs for everyone.  Brown was one of only two civilians to be awarded the [[Bronze Star]] in WWII.

==Postwar work==
His concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the US and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' titled "Deluge".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638293/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, he was awarded a Special [[Tony Award]] for his work in the touring company of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1948|title=1948 Tony Award Winners (BroadwayWorld.com)|work=broadwayworld.com|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), as the [[Fort Kearney]] [[stationmaster]] talking to Fogg ([[David Niven]]) and his entourage in a small town in [[Nebraska]]. In the similarly epic film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), he cameoed as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' during the January 11, 1953, episode.

His best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1959 comedy, ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by [[Jack Lemmon]] in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds; "well, nobody's perfect", one of the most celebrated punchlines in film history.

Another of his notable postwar roles was that of "Cap'n Andy Hawkes" in [[MGM]]'s 1951 [[remake]] of ''[[Show Boat]]'', a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 [[New York City Center]] revival of the musical and on tour. The musical film version included such prominent costars as [[Ava Gardner]], [[Howard Keel]], and [[Kathryn Grayson]]. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer [[Gower Champion]] appeared along with first wife [[Marge Champion|Marge]].  Brown's final film appearance was in ''[[The Comedy of Terrors]]'' (1964). Weeks earlier, he had appeared as Diamond "Dimey" Vine in an episode of [[Jack Palance]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] circus drama ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]''.

[[File:Buster Keaton Joe E Brown Route 66 1962.JPG|thumb|180px|Brown with [[Buster Keaton]] in the "Journey to Ninevah" episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' from 1962.]]

Brown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the "baseball trilogy" which consisted of ''Fireman, Save My Child'' (1932), ''Elmer the Great'' (1933) and ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' (1935). He was also a television and radio broadcaster for the [[New York Yankees]] in 1953. His son, [[Joe L. Brown]], inherited an interest in baseball, becoming the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for more than twenty years. Brown also spent [[Ty Cobb|Ty Cobb's]] last days with him before he died, discussing his life.

Brown's sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of [[PONY Baseball and Softball]] (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people. He was also a fan of [[Thoroughbred horse racing]], a regular at [[Del Mar Racetrack]] and the races at [[Santa Anita Racetrack|Santa Anita]].

==In popular culture==
He was caricatured in the [[Disney]] cartoons ''[[Mickey's Gala Premiere]]'' (1933), ''[[Mother Goose Goes Hollywood]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Autograph Hound]]'' (1939); all of them contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide. According to the official autobiography ''Daws Butler: Characters Actor'', [[Daws Butler]] used Joe E. Brown as inspiration for the voices of two [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon characters: [[Lippy the Lion]] (1962) and [[Peter Potamus]] (1963{{ndash}}1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=1593930151|title=Daws Butler, Characters Actor: Ben Ohmart, Joe Bevilacqua: 9781593930158: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and family==
Brown married Kathryn Francis McGraw in 1915. The marriage would last until his death in 1973. The couple had four children: two sons, Don Evan Brown (December 25, 1916 {{ndash}} October 8, 1942; Captain in the [[United States Army Air Force]], who was killed in the crash of an [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20B Havoc]] bomber while serving as a ferry pilot)&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Flying Son Of Film Star Crash Victim", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Friday 9 October 1942, Volume 49, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joe L. Brown|Joe LeRoy "Joe L." Brown]] (September 1, 1918 {{ndash}} August 15, 2010), and two daughters, Mary Katherine Ann (b. 1930) and Kathryn Francis (b. 1934). Both daughters were adopted as infants.

Joe L. Brown shared his father's love of [[baseball]], serving as general manager of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] from 1955 to 1976, and briefly in 1985, also building the 1960 and 1971 [[World Series]] champions. Brown's '71 Pirates featured baseball's first all-black starting nine.

==Death and legacy==

Brown began having heart problems in 1968, after suffering a severe [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and underwent [[cardiac surgery]]. He died from [[arteriosclerosis]] on July 6, 1973,&lt;ref&gt;California Deaths, 1940–1997 [http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/caldeaths?c=search&amp;first=Joe&amp;last=Brown&amp;spelling=Exact&amp;5_year=&amp;5_month=0&amp;5_day=0&amp;6_year=1973&amp;6_month=0&amp;6_day=0&amp;4=&amp;7=&amp;8=&amp;SubmitSearch.x=0&amp;SubmitSearch.y=0&amp;SubmitSearch=Submit Joe E.

'''Leyendas''' was a [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] [[Fan convention|convention]] focusing on all kinds of [[comics]], [[cartoon]]s, [[anime]]/[[manga]] and other popular forms of art, as well as [[card game|card]], [[strategy game|strategy]] and [[role-playing game]]s, held annually in [[Rosario, Argentina]], since 1999. It was hosted at the ''Centro de Expresiones Contemporáneas'' (CEC), a large, austere brick building formerly part of the [[port of Rosario|port]]'s facilities.

The convention was organized by the [[Asociación de Historietistas Independientes]] (Spanish for Association of Independent Comic Creators) ([http://www.ahiros.com.ar/ ''Asociación de Historietistas de Rosario]'', AHI) and by a local comics store (''[http://www.milenariocomics.com.ar Milenario Comics]''), and it was supported by several other organizations, including the [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Municipality of Rosario]].

The convention featured exhibitions of art by professional and amateur graphic artists, introductory role-playing sessions, film projections, talks and lectures, etc. In addition to these, ''Leyendas'' traditionally ends with performances by [[cover band]]s and/or [[karaoke]], and with a [[costume]] [[competition|contest]] (Japanese-style [[cosplay]] or otherwise).

Leyendas held its last edition in 2008 (the convention's 10th anniversary). After that and for two years there was no other likewise event, until famous Argentine artist [[Eduardo Risso]] inaugurated the annual convention [[:es:Crack Bang Boom|Crack Bang Boom]], which has the same outline and purpose as Leyendas. Crack Bang Boom resumes Leyendas basic form (an outlet for North and South American comics as well as, fantasy, science fiction, anime and a famous Cosplay contest) and uses its legacy to push forward as the new event which gathers an increasingly big size of attendees every year since its first edition in 2010.

'''''Mahabharata''''' (also known as '''''[[Amar Chitra Katha]]'s Mahabharata'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-life-of-uncle-pai/912158 |title=The Life of Uncle Pai |publisher=Indian Express |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a comic adaptation of the [[India]]n [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The 42-issue best-selling series by [[Amar Chitra Katha]], [[Mumbai]] was illustrated by Dilip Kadam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-17150952 Comic life: Remembering India's master storyteller Anant Pai] BBC News, 24 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The team of script writers (who took turns to complete the 42 issues) included Kamala Chandrakant, TMP Nedungadi, Subba Rao, Yagya Sharma, Lopamudra, Mihir Lal Mitra, Sumona Roy, Mohan Swaminathan, Shubha Kandhekar and Margie Sastry.&lt;ref name="comicology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicology.in/2009/07/amar-chitra-katha-mahabharata-3-volumes.html |title=Amar Chitra Katha – Mahabharata &amp;#124; 3 Volumes &amp;#124; 2007 - Comicology |publisher=Comicology.in |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mahabharata'' is often regarded as one of the most popular titles in the history of Amar Chitra Katha. It is also the longest series (42 issue run on an alternative title schedule; from 329-441 [1985-89] in over more than 1300 pages) to have been produced by the ACK. The series was originally planned for 60 albums, but it was later cut short to 42.&lt;ref name="comicology1"/&gt;

== Concept and creation ==
Amar Chitra Katha had a strong commitment to the ''Mahabharata'' from the very beginning. Many of its titles were from based on particular events or characters from the ''Mahabharata''. In March 1985, the new project began, "in response to a persistent demand from our readers for a comprehensive account of the epic." The ambitious series by [[Anant Pai]] was initially decided as a 60 volume project, with one issue in every fortnight. However, in 1988, Amar Chitra Katha issued only one issue a month, so that Mahabharata numbers came out only in every two months.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgDHFFe7YM8C&amp;dq=Mahabharata+Amar+Chitra+Katha&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Media And The Transformation Of Religion In South Asia - Lawrence A Babb, Susan S. Wadley - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mahabharata'' comics was based on,&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

* A [[Sanskrit]] text with [[Hindi]] translation by Pundit Ramnarayan Dutt Shastri Pandey ([[Gita Press]], [[Gorakhpur]])
* A [[Malayalam]] verse version by [[Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran|Kunjikkuttan Tampuram]] (SPCS, [[Kottayam]])
* Pratap Chandra Roy's English prose version ([[Munshiram Manoharlal|Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers]], [[New Delhi]])
* Pune critical edition ([[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]], [[Pune]])

== Structure ==
The comics does not include the ''[[Harivamsha]]'' (a supplement to the ''Mahabharata''), the romance of [[Damayanti]], the legend of [[Savitri and Satyavan|Savitri]] and the abbreviated version of the [[Ramayana]]. It also omits the character [[Ugrasrava Sauti]] and the first issue ("Veda Vyasa") begins with sage Vyasa acquiring the elephant god [[Ganesha]] as his scribe and starting the dictation. It soon moves on to [[Vaisampayana]] narrating the epic to [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]]. This latter pair persist till the last panel of the series, appearing from time to time in panels colored differently.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

The comics also included various footnotes explaining the meaning Sanskrit terms, and the few issues also consisted a pronunciation guide and glossary. Issues usually start with a page containing a summary of the last few issues, and in the backdrop illustrations of the Gita setting, with [[Arjuna]] kneeling before [[Krishna]] in the battlefield.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

== Influences and conflicts ==
Amar Chitra Katha series on ''Mahabarata'' (1985–89) coincided with [[BR Chopra|Baldev Raj Chopra]]'s famous television drama series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' (1988–90). Although, some fans took great pleasure in encountering Mahabharata in both mediums, the television series spelled big trouble for the comic book series. Amar Chitra Katha and the state-run [[Doordarshan]] television channel ([[DD National]]) competed for the same [[Urban sociology|urban]] [[middle class]] audience.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4-Su0whKa0C&amp;dq=india's+Immortal+Comic+Books:+Gods,+Kings,+and+Other+Heroes&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=India's Immortal Comic Books: Gods, Kings, and Other Heroes - Karline McLain - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely accepted that visual and narrative "homogenization" occurs between the ACK'S ''Mahabharata'' and Baldev Raj Chopra's ''Mahabharat''. Television producers have repeatedly turned to the Amar Chitra Katha series as reference material for costume design, set production, and subject matter.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

{{Quotation|"When the ''Mahabharat'' television series was made, I had friend who was a cameraman at the set. And he told me that they often brought the ACK ''Mahabharata'' series onto the set and used it as reference material-for dress, the building, and also for the episodes, the content. It is Kamala Chandrakant who deserves credit for this. She was thorough and very, very careful with regards to authenticity."&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;| Yagya Sharma, ACK author|on Mahabharata comics |}}

The advertisements of the comic series contained the exhortation "Read it to enjoy your Sunday viewing [of the BR Chopra's ''Mahabharat'']!". It seems possible that the comic series was hastened to 42 issues from 60 to take advantage of the television series.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

== Collected formats ==
* The late 1980s saw the first of the collected format of the ''Mahabharata'' with a 7 volume "Library Edition".&lt;ref name="comicology1"/&gt;
* A 14 volume special edition was published in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="comicology1"/&gt;
* A hard-bounded 3 volume edition in 1998 (reprinted in late 2007, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarchitrakatha.com/ack/retail/product/601-601-AmarChitraKatha-AMARCHITRAKATHA-SPECIALS-Mahabharata%283VolumeHardboundSet%29 |title=ACK |publisher=Amarchitrakatha.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muslim Youth Helpline''' (often abbreviated as '''MYH''') is a national award-winning [[charitable organisation|charity]] [[helpline]] that provides free and confidential faith and [[cross cultural sensitivity|culturally sensitive]] support services targeted at vulnerable young people in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Youth Helpline [http://www.myh.org.uk/content/about-us About Us] (Accessed: 27 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim Youth Helpline has stated that it does not propagate any religious or political beliefs and seeks only to provide relief to and improve the social condition of vulnerable young people in the UK.

==History==

===2001-2003: Foundation===
'''MYH''' was founded in August 2001 by [[Mohammed Sadiq Mamdani]], who at the time was 18, in response to the social problems endured by Muslim youth in the UK. It was at college that Mohammed first realised the extent of isolation that today's young Muslims experience; while problems such as drug misuse, depression and sexuality are issues common among many young people, he believed that young Muslims often need advice that takes into account broader religious and social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/may/25/10 Mohammed Mamdani]: Article on why he created MYH. (25 May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===2004-2008: Recognition and expansion===
By 2004, MYH has expanded nationwide and is the only telephone helpline of its kind in the UK; it now also runs a befriending scheme through which volunteers meet up with young Muslims on a social basis or provide practical help such as accompanying them to job centres, or helping fill in application forms whenever friendly guidance is needed.

===2005-2012: Campaigns and Advocacy===
In 2004, MYH released a Prison Campaign on muslimyouth.net and was called ‘Behind Bars’. After the huge success of the initial campaign it was adopted by MYH as an annual campaign. In 2005 they launched its ‘Doing a Runner’ campaign to raise awareness within the community of the many young Muslims who run away from home, and may at various times in their life find themselves vulnerable, alone and homeless. The campaign concluded with ‘2 Dayz of Street Life’, an event involving members of the public who stayed in shelters and on the streets for two days to experience what a homeless person may go through. In February 2006 MYH was awarded with the CSV Award for the ‘Most Heart Warming Project’ of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myh.org.uk/content/advocacy Campaigns and Advocacy of MYH] 2005-2006 (Accessed: November, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013-present===
Mamdani had also founded the organisation with an annual dinner, which takes place once a year in May. In May 2014, special guests included [[Jemima Khan]], [[Asad Ahmed]], [[Mishal Husain]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myh.org.uk/node/255 Special guests of MYH Annual Dinner] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">'''Nervous laughter''' is [[laughter]] evoked from an audience's expression of embarrassment, alarm, discomfort or confusion, rather than [[amusement]].  Nervous laughter is usually less robust in expression than "a good belly laugh", and may be combined with confused glances or awkward silence on the part of others in the audience.  Nervous laughter is considered analogous to a '''courtesy laugh''', which may be rendered by more of a conscious effort in an attempt to move a situation along more quickly, especially when the comedian is pausing for laughter.

Nervous laughter is a physical reaction to stress, tension, confusion, or anxiety. Neuroscientist [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] states "We have nervous laughter because we want to make ourselves think what horrible thing we encountered isn't really as horrible as it appears, something we want to believe." Those are the most embarrassing times, too, naturally.
Psychologist and neuroscientist Robert Provine, from the University of Maryland, studied over 1,200 "laughter episodes" and determined that 80% of laughter isn't a response to an intentional joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert R.|last=Provine|title=Laughter|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Provine_96.html|work=American Scientist|series=Jan-Feb 1996|year=1996|accessdate=8 May 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67VExLQDj|archivedate=8 May 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unhealthy or "nervous" laughter comes from the throat. This nervous laughter is not true laughter, but an expression of tension and anxiety. Instead of relaxing a person, nervous laughter tightens them up even further. Much of this nervous laughter is produced in times of high emotional stress, especially during times where an individual is afraid they might harm another person in various ways, such as a person's feelings or even physically.&lt;ref name="lickerman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lickerman|first=Alex|title=Why We Laugh|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201101/why-we-laugh|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People laugh when they need to project dignity and control during times of stress and anxiety. In these situations, people usually laugh in a subconscious attempt to reduce stress and calm down, however, it often works otherwise. Nervous laughter is often considered fake laughter and even heightens the awkwardness of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balandis|first=M.|title=Psychology studies| url=http://loreskinaite.blogspot.com/2010/04/types-of-laughter.html|work=Nervous Laughter|year=2010|location=Lithuania }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People may laugh nervously when exposed to stress due to witnessing others' pain. For instance, in [[Stanley Milgram]]'s obedience experiment, subjects ("teachers") were told to shock "learners" every time the learners answered a question incorrectly.  Although the "learners" were not actually shocked, the subjects believed they were. As they were going through the study, many of the "subjects showed signs of extreme tension and conflict".&lt;ref name="Hockenbury 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hockenbury|first=Don|title=Discovering Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milgram observed some subjects laughing nervously when they heard the "learners'" false screams of pain. In ''A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness'', neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran suggests that laughter is used as a defense mechanism used to guard against overwhelming anxiety. Laughter often diminishes the suffering associated with a traumatic event.&lt;ref name="lickerman" /&gt;

If the individual is shy or bashful and appears nervous when talking, they are likely to exhibit nervous laughter. Individuals who are shy and introverted who find themselves the center of conversational attention often become "giddy" with nervous laughter; this is a subconscious response caused by the brain over-thinking due to [[social anxiety]] or inexperience.&lt;ref&gt;What Causes Inappropriate Laughing After Every Sentence?&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Kathy H. is a student at Hailsham, a [[boarding school]] in England, where the teachers are known as ''guardians''. The children are watched closely and they are often told about the importance of producing art and of being healthy (smoking is considered a taboo, almost on the level of a crime, and working in the vegetable garden is compulsory). The students' art is then displayed in an exhibition, and the best art is chosen by a woman known to the students as ''Madame'', who keeps their work in a ''gallery''. Kathy develops a close friendship with two other students, Ruth and Tommy. Kathy develops a fondness for Tommy, looking after him when he is bullied and having private talks with him. However, Tommy and Ruth form a relationship instead.

In an isolated incident, Miss Lucy, one of the guardians, tells the students that they are clones who were created to donate organs to others, and after their donations they will die young. Miss Lucy is removed from the school as a result of her disclosure, but the students passively accept their fate.

Ruth, Tommy and Kathy move to the ''Cottages'' when they are 16 years old. This is the first time they are allowed in the outside world, yet they keep to themselves most of the time. Ruth and Tommy are still together and Kathy has some sexual relationships with other men. Two older housemates, who had not been at Hailsham, tell Ruth that they have seen a "possible" for Ruth, an older woman who resembles Ruth and thus could be the woman from whom she was cloned.  As a result, the five of them go on a trip to see her, but the two older students first want to discuss a rumour they have heard: that a couple can have their donations deferred if they can prove that they are truly in love. They believe that this privilege is for Hailsham students only and so wrongly expect that the others will know how to apply for it. They then find the possible, but the resemblance to Ruth is only superficial, causing Ruth to wonder angrily whether they were all cloned from "human trash".

During the trip, Kathy and Tommy separate from the others and look for a copy of a music tape that Kathy had lost when at Hailsham. Tommy's recollection of the tape and desire to find it for her make clear the depth of his feelings for Kathy. They find the tape, and then Tommy shares with Kathy a theory that the reason Madame collected their art was to determine which couples were truly in love, citing a teacher who had said that their art revealed their souls. After the trip, Kathy and Tommy do not tell Ruth of the found tape, nor of Tommy's theory about the deferral.

When Ruth finds out about the tape and Tommy's theory, she takes an opportunity to drive a wedge between Tommy and Kathy. Shortly afterwards she tells Kathy that, even if Ruth and Tommy were to split up, Tommy would never enter into a relationship with Kathy because of her sexual history. A few weeks later, Kathy applies to become a carer, meaning that she will not see Ruth or Tommy for about ten years.

After that, Ruth's first donation goes badly and her health deteriorates. Kathy becomes Ruth's carer, and both are aware that Ruth's next donation will probably be her last. Ruth suggests that she and Kathy take a trip and bring Tommy with them. During the trip, Ruth expresses regret for keeping Kathy and Tommy apart. Attempting to make amends, Ruth hands them Madame's address, urging them to seek a deferral. Shortly afterwards, Ruth makes her second donation and completes, an implied euphemism for dying.

Kathy becomes Tommy's carer and they form a relationship. Encouraged by Ruth's last wishes, they go to Madame's house to see if they can defer Tommy's fourth donation, bringing Tommy's artwork with him to support their claim that they are truly in love. They find Madame at her house, and also meet Miss Emily, their former headmistress, who lives with her. The two women reveal that ''guardians'' tried to give the clones a humane education, in contrast to other institutions. The gallery was a place meant to convey to the outside world that the clones are in fact normal human beings with a soul and deserve better treatment. It is also revealed however that this experiment has failed and that this is the reason Hailsham was closed. When Kathy and Tommy ask about the deferral they find out that such deferrals never existed.

Tommy knows that his next donation will end his life. Kathy resigns as Tommy's carer and does not see him again. She will soon start her own donations.

== Title ==
The novel's title comes from a song on a cassette tape called ''Songs After Dark'', by fictional singer Judy Bridgewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A quest for the mystery pop singer of Never Let Me Go follows a winding path that leads to Bob Dylan, Atom Egoyan and Guy Maddin.|url = https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2010/09/30/howell_the_hunt_for_the_elusive_judy_bridgewater.html|newspaper = The Toronto Star|date = 2010-09-30|access-date = 2016-01-20|issn = 0319-0781|first = Peter|last = Howell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathy bought the tape during a swap meet-type event at Hailsham, which she often used to sing to and dance to the chorus: "Baby, never let me go." On one occasion, while dancing and singing, she notices Madame watching her and crying. Madame explains the encounter when they meet at the end of the book. While Kathy reveals to the reader that she was simply thinking about holding a child, Madame connects the dancing and the song to what they are doing to the children. She is overwhelmed by guilt and sadness and thus starts to cry when she sees Kathy. 

In another section of the book, Kathy refers to the three main characters "letting each other go" after leaving the cottages.

== Characters ==
*'''Kathy''' – The protagonist and narrator of the novel. A clone raised to be a donor whose organs will later be harvested until she dies. During her childhood, Kathy is free-spirited, kind, loving, and stands up for what is right. At the end of the novel, Kathy is a young woman who doesn't show much emotion when looking back on her past. As an adult, she criticises people less and is accepting of the lives of her friends.
*'''Tommy''' – A male donor, and a friend of Kathy's. He is introduced as an uncreative and isolated young boy at Hailsham. He has a bad temper and is the object of many tricks played on him by the other children because of his short temper. Initially, he reacts by having bad temper tantrums, until Miss Lucy, a Hailsham guardian, tells him something that, for the short term, positively changes his life: it is okay if he’s not creative. He feels great relief. Years later, Miss Lucy tells him that she shouldn't have said what she did, and Tommy goes through another transformation. Once again upset by his lack of artistic skills, he becomes a quiet and sad teenager. As he matures, Tommy becomes a young man who is generally calm and thoughtful.
*'''Ruth''' – A female donor from Hailsham, described by Kathy as bossy. At the start of the novel, she is an [[extroversion and introversion|extrovert]] with strong opinions and appears to be the center of social activity in her cohort; however, she is not as confident as the narrator initially perceived. She had hope for her future, but her hopes are crushed as she realises that she was born to be a donor and has no other future. At the Cottages, Ruth undergoes a transformation to become a more aware, thoughtful person who thinks about things in depth. She is constantly trying to fit in and be mature, repudiating things from her past if she perceives those things will negatively affect her image. She threw away her entire collection of art by fellow students, once her prized possessions, because she sensed that the older kids at The Cottages looked down on it. She becomes an adult who is deeply unhappy and regretful. Ruth eventually gives up on all of her hopes and dreams, and tries to help Kathy and Tommy have a better life.
*'''Madame (Marie-Claude)''' – A woman who visits Hailsham to pick up the children's artwork. Described as a mystery by the students at Hailsham. She acts professional and stern, and a young Kathy describes her as distant and forbidding. When the children decide to play a prank on her and swarm around her to see what she will do, they are shocked to discover that she seems disgusted by them. In a different circumstance, she silently watches Kathy dance to a song called "Never Let Me Go" and weeps at the sight. The two do not talk about it until years later; while Kathy interpreted the song's meaning as a woman who cannot have a baby, Madame wept at the thought of clones not being permitted to live long, happy and healthy lives as humans do.
*'''Miss Emily''' – Headmistress of Hailsham. Can be very sharp, according to Kathy. The children thought she had an extra sense in that allowed her to know where a child was if he or she was hiding.
*'''Miss Lucy''' – A teacher at Hailsham that the children feel comfortable with. She is one of the younger teachers at Hailsham, and tells the students very frankly that they exist only for organ donation. She feels a lot of stress while at Hailsham and is fired for what she tells the students.
*'''Chrissie''' – Another female donor, who is slightly older than the three main characters and was with them at the Cottages. She and her boyfriend, Rodney, were the ones who found Ruth's possible (i.e. the person from whom Ruth might have been cloned), and took Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth to Norfolk. She completes (i.e. dies because of her organ donations) before the book ends.
*'''Rodney''' – Chrissie's boyfriend, he was the one who originally saw Ruth's possible. He and Chrissie are mentioned to have broken up before she completed.

== Reception ==
Critics disagree over the genre of the novel. Writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Louis Menand]] describes the novel as 'quasi-science-fiction', saying, 'even after the secrets have been revealed, there are still a lot of holes in the story [...] it's because, apparently, genetic science isn’t what the book is about.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Menand | first = Louis | title = Something About Kathy| newspaper=New Yorker | location =New York | date =28 March 2005 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/03/28/050328crbo_books1| accessdate =26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' book reviewer Sarah Kerr wondered why Ishiguro would write in, what she dubs, the 'pop genre—sci-fi thriller', claiming the novel to 'quietly upend [the genre's] banal conventions.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Kerr | first = Sarah| title = 'Never Let Me Go': When They Were Orphans| newspaper=New York Times| location =New York | date =17 April 2005 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/books/review/17KERRL.html?_r=1| accessdate =14 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror author [[Ramsey Campbell]] labelled it as one of the best horror novels since 2000, a 'classic instance of a story that's horrifying, precisely because the narrator doesn’t think it is.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Joseph O'Neill from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' suggested that the novel successfully fits into the [[Bildungsroman|coming of age]] genre. O'Neill wrote that 'Ishiguro's imagining of the children's misshapen little world is profoundly thoughtful, and their hesitant progression into knowledge of their plight is an extreme and heartbreaking version of the exodus of all children from the innocence in which the benevolent but fraudulent adult world conspires to place them.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =O'Neill | first =Joseph | title =Never Let Me Go | newspaper=The Atlantic | pages =123 | date =May 2005 | url =https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/05/new-fiction/3918/ | accessdate =14 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theo Tait, in a review for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', has a more general perspective of story: 'Gradually, it dawns on the reader that ''Never Let Me Go'' is a parable about mortality. The horribly indoctrinated voices of the Hailsham students who tell each other pathetic little stories to ward off the grisly truth about the future – they belong to us; we've been told that we're all going to die, but we've not really understood.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Tait | first = Theo | title = A sinister harvest| newspaper=The Telegraph | location =London | date =13 March 2005 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3638242/A-sinister-harvest.html| accessdate =26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptations ==

[[Mark Romanek]] directed a British film adaptation titled ''[[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|Never Let Me Go]]'' in 2010.  In Japan, the [[Horipro]] agency produced a stage adaptation in 2014 called ''Watashi wo Hanasanaide'' ({{lang|ja|私を離さないで}}), and in 2016 under the same title [[TBS Television]] aired a television drama adaptation set in Japan starring [[Haruka Ayase]] and [[Haruma Miura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Never let Me Go Cast (in Japanese)|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/never-let-me-go/cast/|website=Never Let Me Go (Programme Site)|publisher=TBS.co.jp|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NotationsCage.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
{{Italics title}}
'''''Notations''''' is a book that was edited and compiled by American [[avant-garde]] [[composer]] [[John Cage]] (1912–1992) with [[Alison Knowles]] and first published in 1969 by Something Else Press.{{Sfn|Cage|Knowles|1969}}{{Sfn|John Cage Collection}} The book is made up of a large collection of [[graphical scores]], [[facsimile]]s of [[holograph]]s, from the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts|Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts]], with text by 269 [[composer]]s, which are presented in alphabetical order, with each score allotted equal space, and in which the editor has no more authority than the reader in assigning value to the work.{{Sfn|Kostelanetz}} The book includes the manuscript for the Beatles song "The Word" (song lyrics, but no musical notation) from the ''Rubber Soul'' album (1965).

The text of the book was created using chance procedures to determine which of the 269 composers would be asked to write about their work, and how many words each entry was to consist of. These pieces of writing, which contain from one to sixty-four words, are proceeded by paragraph signs. The typesetting was done by Alison Knowles using chance-derived mixtures of typefaces and sizes. There are also comments by Cage and other writers included throughout the book, typeset using similar procedures.

In 2009, Mark Batty Publisher released ''Notations 21''. Inspired by the work of Cage and Knowles, it contained illustrated musical scores from more than 100 composers along with commentary from each composer.

The history of '''opera in Latin America''' dates back to at least the early 18th century. Opera arrived in Latin America as a consequence of European colonization. On October 19, 1701, ''[[La púrpura de la rosa]]'' premiered in Lima in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], the first opera known to be composed and performed in the Americas. It is an opera in one act by [[Spain|Spanish]] composer [[Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco]] with a [[libretto]] by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], and is the only surviving opera by Torrejón y Velasco. It tells the myth of the love of Venus and Adonis, which provoked Mars's jealousy and his desire for vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Louise K. (1999), [http://www.mundoclasico.com/articulos/verarticulo.aspx?id=0015763 ''La púrpura de la Rosa''] (Introduction to the critical edition of the score and libretto), Ediciones Iberautor Promociones culturales S.R.L. / Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales, 1999, {{ISBN|8480482923}} (reprinted with permission of the publisher on Mundoclasico.com). Accessed 5 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Opera]] performances were performed also in the country of [[Mexico]]. It is within that nation that the first indigenous opera composers of [[Latin America]] emerged, with [[Manuel de Zumaya]] (c. 1678–1755) being considered the first and most important early opera composer. Outsider of Perú and Mexico, opera was slower to gain a foothold, and it wasn't until the early to mid-19th century that other nations in Latin America began producing their own opera composers. Many of these 19th-century operas focus on the historical conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples and were influenced by [[zarzuela]], a form of [[Spanish opera]] .

In the 20th century many nationalist operas were composed across Latin America, with particularly thriving opera scenes in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Today, there are numerous active opera houses throughout Latin America and composers continue to write new operas. We also have organizations such as the [[International Brazilian Opera Company|International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC)]] and Opera Hispanica who are promoting new Latin American operatic repertoire internationally.

==18th-century opera==
In 1711, the opera ''[[Partenope (Zumaya)|Partenope]]'' premiered in [[Mexico City]]. Its music was by [[Manuel de Zumaya]], the most important Mexican baroque composer. This opera is particularly important because it was the first opera composed in North America and the first opera composed in the Americas by someone from the Americas.

==19th-century opera==
The first opera composed and premiered in Brazil was [[José Maurício Nunes Garcia]]'s ''I Due Gemelli''; the text has since been lost. ''A Noite de São João'' may be considered the first truly Brazilian opera, with a text in Portuguese by [[Elias Álvares Lobo]]. The most famous Brazilian composer was [[Antônio Carlos Gomes]]. Many of his operas premiered in [[Italy]], with texts in Italian. However, Gomes often used typically Brazilian themes in his work, such as in his operas ''[[Il Guarany]]'' and ''[[Lo schiavo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Volpe, Maria Alice, "Remaking the Brazilian Myth of National Foundation: Il Guarany" (Autumn-Winter 2002). Latin American Music Review/Revista de Música Latinoamericana, 23 (2): pp. 179–194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Béhague, Gerard (1992), "Schiavo, Lo" in ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', Vol. 4, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

The nineteenth-century opera ''[[Guatimotzin]]'' by Mexican composer [[Aniceto Ortega]] was the first conscious attempt to incorporate pre-Hispanic elements into the formal characteristics of opera.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams Weigel (2003) p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important 19th-century Mexican operas are ''Agorante, rey de la Nubia'' by [[Miguel Meneses]] (premiered during the commemorative festivities for the birthday of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]), ''Pirro de Aragón'' by [[Leonardo Canales]], and  ''Keofar'' by [[Felipe Villanueva]]. The operatic works of [[Melesio Morales]] are the most important in Mexico in the 19th century. His operas ''Romeo y Julieta'', ''Ildegonda'', ''Gino Corsini'', and ''Cleopatra'' were very successful among the public of Mexico City, and premiered in Europe. The last opera by Melesio Morales, ''Anita'', which was composed in 1908, did not premiere until 2000.

Morales's last period of composition coincided with the creation of operas in Mexico by his son [[Julio Morales (composer)|Julio Morales]], and the operas of [[Felipe Villanueva]], [[Ricardo Castro]], and [[Gustavo E. Campa]]. The work of Ricardo Castro is a part of the tradition of historic, nationalist operas, such as ''Guatimotzin'' by [[Aniceto Ortega]], ''[[Il Guarany]]'' by [[Antônio Carlos Gomes]], ''Ollanta'' and ''Atahualpa'' by [[José María Valle Riestra]], ''Huémac'' by [[Pascual de Rogatis]], and ''Quiché Vinak'' by [[Jesús Castillo (composer)|Jesús Castillo]]. This tradition formed part of a turn-of-the-century operatic movement, in which other important figures included [[Eliodoro Ortiz de Zárate]] (Chile), [[José María Ponce de León]] (Colombia), [[Augusto Azzali]] (Colombia), [[León Ribeiro]] (Uruguay), [[Francisco Hargreaves]] (Argentina), Miguel Rojas (Argentina), and [[Edoardo Torrens]] (Argentina).

The first Venezuelan opera was ''El maestro Rufo Zapatero'', an [[opera buffa]] composed by [[José María Osorio]] in 1847. (However, many have called ''[[Virginia (Montero)|Virginia]]'', by [[José Ángel Montero]], the first Venezuelan opera, though it premiered in 1877 under the auspices of the president [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]]) . Earlier, various [[zarzuelas]] has been composed, but the first to premiere is believed to be ''Los alemanes en Italia'' by José Ángel Montero in the 1860s. Montero also premiered the one-act zarzuelas ''El Cumpleaños de Leonor'', ''El Charlatán Mudo'', ''La Modista'', and many others. Another major Venezuelan composer was [[Reynaldo Hahn]], his operas include ''Le Merchand de Venise'' and ''Ciboulette''. Hahn's work was greatly influenced by his teacher [[Jules Massenet]]. In zarzuela, another important figure was [[Pedro Elías Gutiérrez]], who incorporated typically Venezuelan rhythms into his work.

[[Tomás Giribaldi]]'s ''La Parisina'' is considered the first Uruguayan opera. It premiered in September 1878. The work was very successful and awakened public interest in operas written by Uruguayan composers. Because of this success, the Uruguayan [[Oscar Camps y Soler]] wrote his opera ''Esmeralda, la gitana'', based on the [[Victor Hugo]] novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''; the opera premiered in [[Montevideo]] in 1879. Other Uruguayan composers that wrote opera in this era, motivated by the success of ''La Parisina'', include [[León Ribeiro]] and [[Alfonso Broqua]]. [[León Ribeiro]] premiered his opera ''Colón'' in 1892 during the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. [[Alfonso Broqua]] wrote one opera, ''[[Tabaré (opera by Alfonso Broqua)|Tabaré]]'', based on the [[Tabaré (poem)|eponymous 1888 poem]] by [[José Zorrilla de San Martín]].

In the 19th and 20th century, a number of operas were produced in Latin America in which conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples was a theme. Among the most important operas of this type are ''[[Liropeya]]'' by [[León Ribeiro]] (Uruguay); ''Guatimotzin'' by [[Aniceto Ortega]] (Mexico); ''[[Il Guarany]]'' by [[Antonio Carlos Gomes]] (1836–1896), based on a novel by the Brazilian [[José Martiniano de Alencar]]; ''Atzimba'' by [[Ricardo Castro]] (Mexico, 1864–1907); the three eponymous operas based on the ''Tabaré'' by [[José Zorrilla de San Martín]], written, respectively, by [[Arturo Cosgaya Ceballos]] (Mexico, 1869–1937), [[Heliodoro Oseguera]] (Mexico), and [[Alfonso Broqua]] (Uruguay); ''Los Martirios de Colon'' written by Federico Ruiz (Venezuela) and the three Ecuadorian operas based on the novel ''Cumandá o un drama entre salvajes'' by [[Juan León Mera]], namely ''Cumandá'' by [[Luis H. Salgado]] (1903–1977), ''Cumandá o la virgen de las selvas'' by [[Pedro Pablo Traversari Salazar]] (1874–1956),  and ''Cumandá'' by [[Sixto María Durán Cárdenas]] (1875–1947).

'''Argentina'''

In [[Argentina]], opera developed with the massive European (mainly Italian) immigration at the beginning of the century and with the opening of the [[Teatro Colón]] in 1908 where most of those world premieres took place. The most influential Argentinian opera composers include [[Ettore Panizza]] (whose opera [[Aurora (opera)|''Aurora'']] was commissioned for the Colón inaugural season and ''Bizancio'' from 1939), [[Felipe Boero]] (''El Matrero'' from 1929 his most famous opera, also ''Tucumán'' 1918, ''Ariana y Dyonisos'', 1920, ''Raquela'', 1923 and ''Siripo'', 1937), [[Juan José Castro]] (composer of ''Bodas de sangre'' and ''La zapatera prodigiosa'', both after [[Federico Garcia Lorca]]'s plays and ''Proserpina y el extranjero'', 1952), [[Carlos López Buchardo]] (''El sueño de Alma'', 1914), Pascual De Rogatis (''Huemac'', 1916 and ''La novia del hereje'', 1934), Eduardo Garcia Mansilla (''La angelical manuelita'',1917), Constantino Gaito (''Petronio'', 1919; ''Ollantay'', 1926, ''La sangre de las guitarras''), 1927, Floro Ugarte (''Saika'', 1920), Gilardo Gilardi (''Ilse'', 1923;'' La leyenda del urutaú'', 1934), Athos Palma (''Nazdah'', 1924), Hector Iglesias Villoud (''El Oro del Inca'', 1953), Virtú Maragno and [[Alberto Ginastera]] composer of ''[[Don Rodrigo]]'', ''[[Beatrix Cenci]]'' and ''[[Bomarzo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Teatro Colón]]. [http://www.operas-colon.com.ar/index1.htm Performance archives] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years other Argentinean opera composers include Roberto Garcia Morillo (''El caso Maillard'', 1977) Mario Perusso (''La voz del silencio''), Claudio Guidi-Drei (''[[Medea]]'', 1973), Juan Carlos Zorzi (''Antigona Velez'', 1991 and ''Don Juan'', 1993), Pompeyo Camps (''La hacienda'', 1987, ''Marathon'', 1990 and ''La oscuridad de la razón'', 1996), Gerardo Gandini (''La ciudad ausente'', 1995 and ''Liederkreis'', 2000), [[Ástor Piazzolla]] (''[[Maria de Buenos Aires]]'') and [[Osvaldo Golijov]] (''[[Ainadamar]]'’). ''In 2006 Centre for Experimentation (CETC) of Teatro Colón, proposed that national poet [[Rodolfo Enrique Fogwill]] work with the composer of his choice. He chose [[Oscar Edelstein]] who went on to make the script for "Eterna flotación: Los Monstruito’" from two poems of Fogwill, "Contra el Cristal de La Pecera de Acuario" (Against the Glass of the Aquarium) " and "El Antes de los Monstruito" from the book "Lo Dado", to transform them into a continuous discourse that functions as a dramatic text. The opera dealt with the presidency of Menem and the era of decadency, leading to the headline by music critic, Juan Carlos Montero, "The Poetic versus Social Degradation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/841587-poetica-sobre-la-degradacion-social|title=Poética sobre la degradación social|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

'''Brazil'''

Important Brazilian opera composers in the first half of the 20th century include [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], the composer of operas such as ''Izath'', ''[[Yerma (opera)|Yerma]]'', and ''Aglaia''; and [[Camargo Guarnieri]], composer of ''Um Homem Só'' and ''Pedro Malazarte''. Contemporary Brazilian opera continues these avant-garde tendencies, as is the case with works like ''Olga'' by [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], ''A Tempestade'' by [[Ronaldo Miranda]], ''O Cientista'' by [[Silvio Barbato]], and "Tamanduá (The Anteater) – A Brazilian Opera" by [[Joao MacDowell]], founder of the [[International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brazilianopera.com/|title=International Brazilian Opera|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York-based non-profit with a mission to create new repertoire based on collaboration of Brazilian and international artists.

''' Ecuador'''

Recent Ecuadorian operas include ''Los Enemigos'' by [[Mesías Maiguashca]], based on the story ''The Secret Miracle'' by [[Jorge Luis Borges]]; [[Manuela y Bolívar]] by [[Diego Luzuriaga]]; and the instrumental opera ''El árbol de los pájaros'' by [[Arturo Rodas]].

'''Mexico'''

Another interesting group is those composers that have tried to develop a [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatecan]] operatic tradition based on Mayan legends. These composers typically work in [[Mérida, Yucatán]], and have been scorned by Mexican nationalist historians. These composers include [[Cosgaya Ceballos]], [[Ríos Escalante]], [[Ricalde Moguel]], [[Rivera Velador]], [[Cárdenas Samada]], and [[Jebe Halfdan]]. In the first half of the 20th century, composer [[Julián Carrillo]] was an important figure in Mexican opera, along with composers similar to him, including [[Antonio Gomezanda]], [[Juan León Mariscal]], [[Julia Alonso]], [[Sofía Cancino de Cuevas]], [[José F. Vásquez]], [[Arnulfo Miramontes]], [[Rafael J. Tello]], [[Francisco Camacho Vega]], and [[Efraín Pérez Cámara]]. All of these composers have been relegated by official musical historiography, which only recognizes the work of nationalist composers. 
Since the end of the 20th century in Mexico (and in all of Latin America), composers are increasingly interested in writing opera. Important Mexican opera composers in the early 21st century include [[Federico Ibarra]], [[Daniel Catán]], [[Leandro Espinosa]], [[Marcela Rodríguez (composer)|Marcela Rodríguez]], [[Víctor Rasgado]], [[Javier Álvarez (composer)|Javier Álvarez]], [[Roberto Bañuelas]], [[Luis Jaime Cortez]], [[Julio Estrada]], [[Gabriela Ortiz]], [[Enrique González Medina]], [[Manuel Henríquez Romero]], [[Leopoldo Novoa]], [[Hilda Paredes]], [[Mario Stern]], [[René Torres]], [[Juan Trigos]], [[Samuel Zyman]], [[Mathias Hinke]], [[Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon]], [[Isaac Bañuelos]], [[Gabriel de Dios Figueroa]], [[Enrique González-Medina]], [[José Carlos Ibáñez Olvera]], [[Víctor Mendoza]] and [[Emmanuel Vázquez]].

'''Venezuela'''

In contemporary Venezuela, there are great lyrical composers, including [[María Luisa Escobar]], whose works include ''Kanaime'', ''Orquídeas Azules'', and ''Princesa Girasol''. Other important composers include [[Hector Pellegatti]] (author of the ''[[verismo]]'' opera ''El Negro Miguel'' with lyrics by [[Pedro Blanco Vilariño]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.el-carabobeno.com/|title=Noticias de Valencia, Carabobo, Venezuela y el mundo|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexis Rago]] (author of ''El Páramo'', ''Miranda'', and ''Froilán el Infausto''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caronimusic.com/pagesEspagnol/alexis.php?idsession=&amp;pagec= |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301184509/http://www.caronimusic.com/pagesEspagnol/alexis.php?idsession=&amp;pagec= |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Federico Ruiz (composer)|Federico Ruíz]] (author of the famous opera buffa ''[[Los Martirios de Colón]]'', with a libretto by [[Aquiles Nazoa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministeriodelacultura.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2247&amp;Itemid=134 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304144336/http://www.ministeriodelacultura.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2247&amp;Itemid=134 |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most operatic activity in Venezuela takes place at [[Teatro Teresa Carreño]]. Here, operas such as ''El Páramo'' by [[Alexis Rago]] and ''Los martirios de Colón'' by [[Federico Ruiz (composer)|Federico Ruiz]] have recently premiered.

Other recent premieres include the opera ''Gertrudis'' by [[Gerardo Gerulewicz]], with a libretto by [[Xiomara Moreno]], work premiered in concert and in full stage production in Caracas, Venezuela.

Venezuelan-American composer [[Sylvia Constantinidis]] who has written both, music and libretto for several lyrical works: two Dramatic Contemporary Operas, ''Araminta'' and ''Afrodita''; one Experimental Short Opera, ''Aurora''; and three Children Operas, ''Lincoln'', ''Ponce de Leon'', and ''The First ThanksGiving''.

'''''Opportunity Knocks''''' is a [[British television]] and radio [[talent show]] originally hosted by [[Hughie Green]], with a late-1980s revival hosted by [[Bob Monkhouse]], and later by previous winner [[Les Dawson]].

The original [[radio]] version started on the [[BBC Light Programme]], where it ran from 18 February to 29 September 1949, but moved to [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/whenwillibefamous/funstuff/trivia.shtml
 |title = ''Press Your Buttons Now! - We look back at talent shows of yesteryear''.
 |publisher = BBC
 |accessdate = 13 May 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 20 June 1956 to 29 August 1956, produced by [[Associated Rediffusion]]. A second run commenced on 11 July 1964 and lasted until 20 March 1978, produced first by [[Associated British Corporation|ABC]] and then by [[Thames Television|Thames]]. Hughie Green presented a single episode of Opportunity Knocks for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] in 1979. It was revived by the [[BBC]] from 21 March 1987 to 2 June 1990, hosted initially by [[Bob Monkhouse]] from 1987 to 1989 (under the title ''Bob Says Opportunity Knocks!'') and subsequently by [[Les Dawson]] in 1990.

==Voting system==
Unlike its rival ''[[New Faces]]'', the winning acts on ''Opportunity Knocks'' were decided not by a panel of experts but by the viewing public.  In the ITV version this took the form of a postal vote, the winner of which was announced the following week.  The BBC revival was notable for being the first TV show to decide its winner using the now-standard method of a telephone vote. In both versions the studio audience reaction to each act was measured by a [[clap-o-meter]], but this did not count towards the final result.

The programme was recorded the Friday before transmission, so votes had to be in by Thursday. They also, according to host Hughie Green, largely to ensure fairness, had to be in "your own handwriting".

Although ''Opportunity Knocks'' did produce a number of talented acts, the method of putting the contest to a public vote did sometimes result in victories for novelty acts, in particular those involving children or animals. On one notorious occasion, the young [[Su Pollard]] was beaten into second place by a singing dog.

For the Monkhouse-fronted revival, the voting system was radically changed, making it the first British TV show to use [[telephone voting]] in order to get a more immediate result (although an updated electronic "clap-o-meter-style" on-screen indicator, using stars, was used during the show). The telephone voting system is now common on British TV.

==Famous alumni==
Entertainers who appeared included [[Freddie Starr]] and the Delmonts, [[Su Pollard]], [[Paul Daniels]], [[Darren Day]], Pete the Plate Spinning Dog, Los Caracas, later to become [[Middle of the Road (band)|Middle of the Road]],  [[Mary Hopkin]], [[Bonnie Langford]], [[Les Dawson]], Maureen Myers, Barry Cummings, Royston Vasey (later to find fame as [[Roy 'Chubby' Brown]]), [[Little and Large]], [[Bobby Crush]],  [[Berni Flint]], [[Tony Holland (bodybuilder)|Tony Holland (The Muscle Man)]], [[Millican &amp; Nesbitt]], [[Neil Reid]], [[Peters and Lee]], [[Lena Zavaroni]], [[Frank Carson]], [[Max Boyce]], [[Pam Ayres]], Juniper Green, [[Gerry Monroe]], [[Debra Stephenson]], [[Tammy Jones]], [[Paper Lace]], [[The Chuckle Brothers|Barry and Paul Elliott]] and [[Tony Monopoly]]. Several winners of Opportunity Knocks (notably Tammy Jones, Champagne, Tony Monopoly) later attempted to represent the UK at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], taking part in the [[A Song for Europe]] competition. [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] appeared in 1986 but was rejected and did not make it past the initial audition. [[Kaz Hawkins]] appeared in the 1980s' revival as a child.

==Influence==
Today, most of the elements of this show are visible on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] talent search ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', which was created by record company executive [[Simon Cowell]].  The method of deciding a winner by telephone is used on that show and many other similar programmes around the world. ''Britain's Got Talent'' can be said to be an evolution of the original ''Opportunity Knocks''.

A reference to the show can be heard on [[the Beatles]]' first live performance of "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" at Blackpool Night Out. [[George Harrison]] introduces the song, saying "For Paul McCartney of Liverpool, opportunity knocks!". This version appears on ''[[Anthology 2]]''.

It is the sequel to 2009's {{nowrap|''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]''}}, and stars James as the eponymous mall cop, Paul Blart, along with [[Neal McDonough]], [[David Henrie]], and [[Daniella Alonso]].

Filming began in April 2014 at the [[Wynn Las Vegas]] casino resort. It was released the following year on April 17, 2015. ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2'' was the first film shot on the [[Steve Wynn]] property. It was also the first film to receive Nevada's [[Movie production incentives in the United States|film tax credit]] enacted in 2013, receiving a $4.3 million break after spending $40.49 million in the state. The film grossed $107 million worldwide at the box office and has a 5% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

==Plot==
Paul Blart ([[Kevin James]]) narrates his several misfortunes and his hard recovery. His wife Amy ([[Jayma Mays]]) divorced him six days into their marriage and to feel better, Paul takes pride in patrolling the West Orange Pavilion Mall. Two years later, his mother Margaret ([[Shirley Knight]]) was killed after being hit by a milk truck. Four years after that, as Paul narrates "he had officially peaked", he receives an invitation to a security officers' convention in Las Vegas and begins to believe his luck is about to change. His daughter Maya Blart ([[Raini Rodriguez]]) discovers that she was accepted into [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and plans to move across the country to Los Angeles, but in light of her father's invitation, she decides to withhold the information for now.

After arriving in Las Vegas, Paul and his daughter meet the general manager of [[Wynn Las Vegas|Wynn Hotel]], a pretty young woman named Divina Martinez ([[Daniella Alonso]]), to whom Paul is instantly attracted. He later learns that she's dating the hotel's head of security, Eduardo Furtillo ([[Eduardo Verástegui]]). Meanwhile, Maya and the hotel's valet, Lane ([[David Henrie]]) become instantly attracted to each other. A security guard from the [[Mall of America]] attending the convention, Donna Ericone ([[Loni Love]]), is aware of Paul's earlier heroics in the West Orange Pavilion Mall incident and believes Paul will be the likely keynote speaker at the event. However, Paul discovers that another security guard, Nick Panero ([[Nicholas Turturro]]), is giving the speech.

In the midst of the convention, a criminal named Vincent Sofel ([[Neal McDonough]]) and a gang of accomplices disguised as hotel employees are secretly plotting to steal priceless works of art from the hotel and replace them with replicas, then sell the real ones at auction. In the meantime, Paul has become overprotective of Maya after discovering her flirting with Lane and spies on their conversations. He is later mocked by Eduardo for his lack of professionalism in an event where hotel security was notified when Maya turns up missing. In an ensuing argument with her father, Maya boldly claims she's attending UCLA despite Paul's wishes that she remain close to home at a junior college.

At the convention, Paul, Donna, and three other security guards, Saul Gundermutt ([[Gary Valentine]]), Khan Mubi (Shelly Desai), and Gino Chizzeti ([[Vic Dibitetto]]) check out the non-lethal security equipment on display. Later, Paul finds Panero drunk hitting on a woman at the bar. Paul attempts to defuse the situation and Panero passes out, giving Paul a chance to be the event's speaker. He contacts Maya asking her to attend, but he learns that she's at a party with Lane. As Paul prepares his speech, Vincent and his cohorts put their plan into motion. Maya absentmindedly walks into the midst of the heist and is taken hostage. Lane is kidnapped as well while searching for her. After a brief fight with an ill-tempered bird in the hotel garden, Paul gives a rousing speech that moves everyone at the convention, as well as Divina, who inexplicably finds herself becoming more attracted to Paul with each passing moment. Following the speech, Paul learns about Maya and Lane's situation and rushes to help but passes out due to his [[Hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] condition that has plagued him for years.

After recovering, Paul is able to take down several of Vincent's thugs and gathers intel on the group's intentions. Using non-lethal equipment from the convention, he is able to take out more of Vincent's crew. Meanwhile, Maya and Lane overhear Vincent adamantly refusing an oatmeal cookie due to a severe oatmeal allergy. Working with a team – Donna, Saul, Khan, and Gino – Paul is able to clumsily dismantle Vincent's operation, with Maya severely incapacitating Vincent by rubbing oatmeal-infused concealer on his face. Afterward, Paul convinces Divina that her attraction for him is misplaced, and Eduardo is whom she should really be with. Paul also accepts Maya going to UCLA, funding her tuition with the reward money he obtained from [[Steve Wynn]] for stopping Vincent. After dropping off Maya at UCLA, Paul falls in love with a passing Mounted Police Officer who reciprocates his advances.

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received a rating of 5% based on 57 reviews and an average score of 2.5/10. The site's consensus reads, "Bathed in flop sweat and bereft of purpose, ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2'' strings together fat-shaming humor and Segway sight gags with uniformly unfunny results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paul_blart_mall_cop_2/ | title=Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 13 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paul-blart-mall-cop-2 | title=Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B-" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sara Stewart of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film one out of four stars, saying "This wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over: Bluster, then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No, it's not never funny. It's just not funny nearly often enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart |first=Sara |url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/16/paul-blart-mall-cop-2-is-lame-james/ |title=‘Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2’ is lame James &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date= April 17, 2015|accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "James tries hard, very hard, to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor, propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/paul-blart-mall-cop-2/review/789533 |title='Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2': Film Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date= |accessdate=2015-04-18 |first=Frank |last=Scheck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "Kevin James keeps falling on his face and colliding with heavy objects, this time in Vegas, in this tacky, numbingly inane sequel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Justin Chang |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/paul-blart-mall-cop-2-review-kevin-james-1201474644/ |title=‘Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2′ Review: Kevin James Heads to Vegas |publisher=Variety |date= April 17, 2015|accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soundwave''' is the name of a fictional character appearing in the various ''[[Transformers]]'' continuities in the Transformers robot superhero franchise. His most well-known transformation is that of a microcassette recorder. Throughout most of his incarnations, he is an undying loyal lieutenant of the [[Decepticon]] leader [[Megatron]]. He is Megatron's eyes and ears and, in some interpretations, only speaks when mocking the [[Autobot]]s.

}}
'''Soundwave''' is one of the most recognizable characters from the original Transformers line, because of his alternate mode – a [[microcassette]] recorder – and his distinctive monotone, computerized voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=J.D. Reed;Sara White/Boston |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,954424,00.html |title=Living: Hot Toys with a Special Twist - Printout |publisher=TIME |date=1984-10-01 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave is able to detect and [[Radio jamming|jam]] transmissions across the entire energy spectrum, a talent that makes him suited to his position as Decepticon Communications Officer. Additionally, he has a [[photographic memory]] thanks to the vast data storage capacity of the magnetic disks in his chest compartment, and he is armed with a shoulder-mounted laser cannon and hand-held concussion blaster. Soundwave is physically strong compared to most Transformers. His alternative form - which involves an apparent loss of mass - is that of an Earthly [[microcassette]] [[Cassette deck|deck]]. Within the tape compartment, which becomes his chest in robot mode, he stores a variety of Decepticon spies, all of which take the alternative form of a microcassette. These spy characters include [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], [[Laserbeak]], [[Buzzsaw (Transformers)|Buzzsaw]], [[Ratbat]], [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], [[Slugfest (Transformers)|Slugfest]], and [[Overkill (Transformers)|Overkill]], all of whom are under Soundwave's command in the original television series. [[Squawktalk]] and [[Beastbox (Transformers)|Beastbox]] were additional cassette characters under Soundwave's control in the US toyline, who were never shown in the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seibertron.com |url=http://www.seibertron.com/database/character.php?view=&amp;char_id=6 |title=Soundwave (Decepticon Communications, Transformers G1) |publisher=Seibertron.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave's cassettes are quick to serve and defend Soundwave in a crisis, and generally relate to him as servants or even pets. However, when his cassette [[Ratbat]] became leader of the Decepticons in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics series]], Soundwave fully shifted his trademark loyalty from [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] to him. In the Dreamwave comics, Ratbat led the [[Ultracons]] faction, while Soundwave remained with the Decepticons led by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], although within that continuity these events occurred before Ratbat took up a cassette form. In the IDW comics, on pre-war Cybertron Soundwave functioned as personal assistant to Ratbat, who was a Senator at the time, however Soundwave's true loyalty lay with Megatron. When the time came for him and [[Starscream]] to massacre the Senate, he enslaved Ratbat by bestowing the smaller, weaker cassette body upon him.

===Reception===
According to X-Entertainment Soundwave was the 8th top Transformers figure of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121217204414/http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/364.html X-E - The Top 8 Transformers Figures Of All Time!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
[[Image:soundwave-alternate.jpg|left|thumb|Soundwave as a microcassette recorder]]
In the original ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|Transformers]]'' cartoon—his most prominent role in ''Transformers'' fiction—Soundwave was Megatron's right-hand mech, frequently sent on important [[reconnaissance]] missions with his cassettes, and often playing a key role in many schemes against the Autobots. On [[Cybertron]], he used his ability to transform into a roadside fixture to spy on the Autobot city of [[Iacon]], learning of the Autobots' plan to search for energy on other worlds. Joining in Megatron's attack on the Autobots' craft (known as [[Ark (Transformers)|the ''Ark'']] in the Marvel Comics series at the time), Soundwave fell to the same fate as the rest of the ship's occupants when the craft crashed on prehistoric Earth, entombing everyone within stasis. Immediately after the Transformers awakened on Earth in 1984, Soundwave played an essential role in the generation of energon cubes and the formation of plans for a new space cruiser to return the Decepticons to Cybertron.

Later, he used his mind-reading talents to acquire an [[antimatter]] formula for the Decepticons from the brain of [[Chip Chase]]. He and his cassette minions were often on spying missions against the Autobots.

One of Soundwave's most notable misadventures came in 1985, when, operating a plan conceived by [[Starscream]], he [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] humans with [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] vibrations, leading to a confrontation with his Autobot Communications Officer counterpart, [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], and to a lasting rivalry between the two.

Soundwave rarely displayed much emotion, infrequently exhibiting any traits that could be considered to be in line with his [[tech spec]]. However, he showed distress when one of his cassettes were hurt in battle, and he always came across as extremely loyal to Megatron, even going so far as to recover his body after beaten close to death by [[Optimus Prime]] at the battle of [[Autobot City]] in 2005. But while Soundwave was loyal, he was far from outspoken, and kept silent when Megatron's body was subsequently ejected into space, and although he did suggest himself as a replacement leader ("''Soundwave: superior. Constructicons: inferior.''"), Soundwave again loyally served Megatron when he was reformatted as [[Galvatron]].

In the year 2006, although operating in a less prominent capacity for most of the time, Soundwave played a prominent role in Galvatron's attempt to learn the secret of a sonic weapon on the planet Eurythma, where sound and music were the way of life, leaving Soundwave entranced by the planet's perfect melodies. Recording each piece of the harmony that formed the devastating sonic effect, Soundwave was defeated when the Eurythmans countered the harmony with white noise, and was again pulled into a confrontation with Blaster, who erased his recordings.

Soundwave was performed by [[Frank Welker]], whose voice was heavily modulated by a [[vocoder]] to achieve Soundwave's distinctive, metallic [[Pitch (music)|monotone]]. However, Welker's voice was left unmodulated at certain points during the episodes "Roll for It" and "Webworld" due to production errors.

Although Soundwave only appeared as a background character in the American cartoon series finale, the three-part ''The Rebirth'', he returned to the forefront in the new Japanese-exclusive series, ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]'', which was created to replace ''The Rebirth''. Reborn as '''Soundblaster''' ('''New Soundwave''' in the [[English language|English]] version and '''Vizar''' in Italy) Soundwave's new toy incarnation was, like the series, available only in [[Japan]].

In the year 2011, Soundwave and Blaster's rivalry had increased dramatically. In the opening cut and thrust of ''Headmasters'', Soundwave and Blaster engaged in their final clash in the [[Arctic Circle]] as the Autobots and Decepticons were in the process of searching for the missing [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]]. The two opponents inflicted fatal damage to each other, and Soundwave's body exploded even as Blaster collapsed. Soundwave's fragments were recovered by his cassettes. Using reconstructive technology from the planet Master, the leader of the Decepticon Headmasters, [[Scorponok|Zarak]] successfully rebuilt and resurrected Soundwave and renamed him Soundblaster—essentially identical to his former self, except for his predominantly black color scheme. As Soundblaster, he served the same role as he had as Soundwave under the leadership of Galvatron and later [[Scorponok]], frequently embarking on spying missions with Ratbat.

He also had a father-son relationship with the cassettes, as it was hinted on his resurrection as 'Soundblaster'.

A flashback in episode 5 of [[Beast Machines]], "Forbidden Fruit", showed ''Generation 1'' Soundwave (or a close likeness of him) being gunned down while helping the Maximal [[Nightscream]] escape the [[Vehicon]] [[tankor|tank drones]]. His appearance in this series is somewhat unclear since Autobots and Decepticons were replaced by [[Maximals]] and [[Predacon|Predacons]], 300 years after The Great War.

===Books===

===Comics===

====3H Enterprises====
He also appeared in the Furman written ''Reaching the Omega Point'', as one of the Transformers legends (alongside [[Optimus Prime]], Megatron and [[Grimlock]]) who came to the aid of the forces of [[Optimus Primal]] against the [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]]/[[Unicron]] hybrid [[List of BotCon characters#Shokaract|Shokaract]], distracting him long enough for [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] to deal the fatal blow.

====Devil's Due Publishing====
In Devil's Due's run of ''[[G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers]]'' comic book miniseries, Soundwave was among the Transformers captured by the ruthless terrorist [[Cobra Organization]], when they discovered the Ark. Refitted by [[Destro]], Soundwave was intended to become a battlefield communications station, but when he and the other Decepticons eventually broke free of their control he was damaged in a battle with the Autobots and his parts were captured by the US Government for study. From his data banks, the [[android (robot)|android]] [[Serpentor|SerpentO.R.]] downloaded information on the history of Cybertron, using it to further the Decepticon goal of conquest. It is indicated that his pre-Earth form was similar to his Dreamwave War Within form.

====Dreamwave Productions====
In [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]]'s 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 continuity, Soundwave was recruited to the Decepticons 9 million years ago through Megatron's underground gladiatorial games, and made head of communications. When a new Autobot leader, [[Optimus Prime]], was chosen, Soundwave was sent along with the [[Insecticons]] and [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], to attempt to kill him and recover the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]] for Megatron, but they failed, forcing Megatron to confront Optimus personally.

Even in the face of failures such as this, and later the loss of Megatron in an early space bridge experiment, Soundwave's loyalty to the Decepticon cause never wavered, as he remained true to the faction under [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]'s leadership.

As in most other continuities, the story continues in the traditional manner, with Soundwave a member of the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]'' crew who attacked the ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'' and was sent into stasis when the craft crashed on Earth, awakening again in 1984. After years of fighting on Earth, eventually the combined forces of the Autobots and their human allies were able to defeat and capture the Decepticons. The intent was for the Autobots to take their enemies back to Cybertron aboard a new craft named the ''Ark II'', but just as the ship cleared the atmosphere, it exploded, the victim of machinations by Shockwave, who did not want Prime and Megatron to return to Cybertron yet.

Soundwave's body crashed back to Earth in the [[Arctic]], where he lay inactive for several years, until rogue military scientist Adam Rook, calling himself "Lazarus," recovered and reactivated him, putting him under his control with a program he had developed while studying the Transformers before their explosive departure. Several other Autobots and Decepticons fell to the same fate, and were to be sold on the black market—Soundwave himself was put on display by being sent to attack the Smitco Oil Refinery alongside several other Transformers—but when Megatron liberated himself, Soundwave was soon freed by his leader and assumed his position at his side.

When Shockwave arranged for the capture and extradition of Prime and Megatron's forces as [[war crime|war criminal]]s, Soundwave was among the captives, but when Starscream jettisoned Megatron into space on the return trip to Cybertron, Soundwave made the best of a bad lot and teamed with Starscream to return to Earth and conquer it, being reunited with [[Ratbat]] in the process. Heading back to Earth in a kidnapped [[Sky Lynx]] and with the [[Combaticons]] now added to their ranks, the Decepticons attacked the ''Ark'' in hopes of acquiring parts to make the ''Nemesis'' spaceworthy again, however Soundwave, [[Skywarp]] and [[Thundercracker]] were defeated and thrown in the ''Ark'''s brig. When the Combaticons, combined as [[Bruticus]], laid into the vessel, they were freed.

It was not much later that the surviving Megatron made contact with Soundwave from space, and Soundwave was all too willing to return to his service, setting up Starscream to fall before Megatron when he returned. And return, Megatron did—but the bankruptcy and subsequent closure of Dreamwave left the rest of the story untold.

Soundwave also appeared in the Dreamwave Transformers/G.I. Joe series as one of the Decepticons uncovered by [[Cobra Command|Cobra]] at the start of the [[World War II]]. Transforming into a radio, he was deactivated at the series' close by [[Grimlock]]. Although Dreamwave's collapse precluded the completion of the second series, released art and information revealed that Soundwave would have been involved in the conclusion of that series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seibertron.com |url=http://www.seibertron.com/comics/view.php?comic_id=774 |title=Transformers/GI Joe Vol 2: Divided Front #5: "Transformers/GI Joe Vol 2: Divided Front" |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fun Publications====
Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and Generation 2 comics). [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] survived the crash of the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form and now leads [[Astrotrain]], Laserbeak, [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], Ravage, [[Skywarp]], Soundwave, [[Starscream]] and the [[Constructicons]]. [[Optimus Prime]] has also returned to Earth commanding [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Grimlock]], [[Jetfire]], [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Rodimus]] (formerly [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]]). When the Cybertronians [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] and [[Landquake]] arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.

Soundwave was among Megatron's troops when Megatron defeated Deathsaurus in combat for leadership of the Decepticons and when Megatron attacked Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Pete Sinclair &amp; Jesse Wittenrich | title = Battle Lines Part 5 | journal = Transformers Collectors Club Magazine| volume = 1 | issue = 41 | page= 3 |date = October–November 2011|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IDW Publishing====
Soundwave's first chronological appearance in the rebooted [[IDW Publishing]] Generation One universe was in the prequel miniseries, ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]''. In the story, Soundwave works for Senator [[Ratbat]], who takes an interest in the rising gladiator, [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]. Ratbat sends Soundwave to offer weaponry to Megatron and his followers. Soundwave also assists Megatron with the interrogation of Autobot soldier, [[Bumper (Transformers)|Bumper]]. Soundwave is later jailed along with Megatron and other when [[Sentinel Prime]]'s forces capture them, but is released by Ratbat. When Megatron's plan is sprung, Soundwave helps Starscream massacre the Autobot Senate. He later confronts Ratbat and forcibly extracts his Spark for implantation in one of his Cassette bodies. Soundwave's alternate mode appears to be a communication vehicle with tank treads.

Sometime later, Soundwave was part of the conference of scientists called by [[Thunderwing]] in ''[[The Transformers: Stormbringer]]'', where he refuses to accept Thunderwing's findings that Cybertron was dying. In around the same time period he had [[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]] captured and implanted with a cerebro-shell, having the unwilling traitor eject his opposite number [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] into space (in ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight Blaster]]'') in order to demoralize the Autobots prior to a Decepticon offensive.

Soundwave's story was later continued in his own ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' one-shot, where he was a self-serving and duplicitous Decepticon [[internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] agent. Soundwave was dispatched by Megatron to keep an eye on [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon's]] investigation of [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]'s lab. However, he kept quiet about Bludgeon's obsession with the Regenesis project, thinking he could turn it to his advantage. Following him to Earth in 1984, Soundwave monitored Bludgeon's attempts to harvest Ultra Energon and confronted him after he'd acquired it. Horrified to discover they were not planning to use it in a power-play but instead to reanimate [[Thunderwing]] (who previously devastated Cybertron), Soundwave attempted to stop them but was trapped in [[stasis-lock]] in cassette player mode. It was revealed in the epilogue that two young humans considered buying him at a pawn shop in 2007.

In ''[[The Transformers: Escalation]]'' #1, Optimus stated there was evidence that Soundwave had been present in Earth's history. Despite this, he did not reappear until issue #4 of ''[[The Transformers: Devastation]]'', where, still trapped in cassette player mode, he interfered with Skywatch's control of Laserbeak and Ravage.

Soundwave also appeared as one of the Decepticon forces, serving under [[Starscream]] in the out-of-continuity ''[[The Transformers: Evolutions]]'' tale "Hearts of Steel". He appeared as one of Starscream's lieutenants. He was presumably destroyed when [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] diverted the Decepticon train convoy into a [[rift|chasm]].

====Marvel Comics====
Like much of the original 1984 cast of Decepticons, Soundwave played a much smaller role in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] book series than he did in the cartoon. He quietly and efficiently served loyally, first under Megatron (even sending [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] and the [[Insecticons]] to derail talks between the Autobots and [[Ronald Reagan]] at one point in the 1985 Transformers UK annual), then under Shockwave, attacking an aerospace construction plant whose facilities were used to build the [[Constructicons]], who then built a massive radio dish that Soundwave used to beam a message back to Cybertron.

Continuing to operate under Shockwave, Soundwave then moved to serving Ratbat, and co-led the defense of [[Buenos Aires]] against the [[Underbase]]-empowered Starscream alongside Fortress Maximus, only to wind up deactivated by the villain.

Unlike many of the others deactivated by Starscream, Soundwave would appear again, under [[Scorponok]]'s command. Throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] comic, Soundwave was colored purple instead of his more trademark blue, and additionally was frequently drawn with a visible mouth.

Meanwhile, across the [[Atlantic]] in the UK, a sister title to the American series was also in production. It reprinted the American stories, but as it was released on a weekly (as opposed to monthly) schedule, it soon began to run out of material to reprint. It opted to create its own original stories at that point, which deftly weaved in and out of the ongoing American storyline. Under writer [[Simon Furman]], Soundwave—coloured-blue was a fairly major player, portrayed in a manner much more consistent with his profile - that of a manipulator and blackmailer, reading others' minds and using their secrets to his own ends, always working towards his own goals.

When Megatron and Shockwave were both briefly believed deceased, he assumed leadership of the Decepticons during [[Optimus Prime]]'s ''Crisis of Command'' and then the ''Dinobot Hunt'' story arcs, manipulating events to weaken the Autobot leadership and cause maximum casualties. When the two commanders returned and vied for leadership of the Decepticons, he turned the situation to his own advantage by working both sides of the field. He also enjoyed a rare victory in this period when he, [[Dirge (Transformers)|Dirge]] and [[Kickback (Transformers)|Kickback]] took over a [[NASA]] complex in an attempt to contact Cybertron with the facility's deep space radio equipment. The Autobots arrived, but a series of miscommunications between [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] and [[Jetfire]] resulted in the transmission being sent, allowing the Decepticons to claim victory.

Towards the end of the UK series, a storyline began which separated from the regular ongoing American continuity, covering the exploits of the proactive Autobot ''Earthforce''. In these stories, Soundwave sold Decepticon secrets to both the Autobots and Shockwave's group of Decepticons. Wildrider was blamed for this intelligence leak, and Soundwave silently allowed him to be killed rather than be discovered. After Starscream successfully removed Megatron and Shockwave from power, he and Soundwave entered into joint leadership of the Decepticons.

Issue #279 of the Marvel UK Transformers comic featured a story called "Divide and Conquor!" where Soundwave lead the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer lead the Autobot Survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream.

Soundwave attained leadership of the Decepticons in the future world of 2008, following the death of Shockwave (who had seized power when Galvatron traveled back in time). Soundwave led his era's Decepticons back to 1989 to participate in the Time Wars when the fabric of reality began to crumble, but as the conflict came to a head they fled back to their own time. Since it was later established that the damage done to the time stream may have resulted in their future being erased from the timeline, the final fate of the future Soundwave is unknown.

Soundwave returned to the pages of the US ''Transformers'' comic books for the relaunch of the series as ''[[Transformers: Generation 2]]''. He participated in the Decepticon attack on Earth, and oversaw the reconstruction of the damaged [[Dreadwing|Darkwing]] into a new, more powerful form.

Like many of the other Generation 1 Decepticons, Soundwave seemed to return to a command position on Megatron's return (killing [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] in the process).

Soundwave made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel ''Generation 2'' comic series, in a story called "New Dawn." Megatron lead his Decepticons against [[Jhiaxus]]' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seibertron.com |url=http://www.seibertron.com/comics/view.php?comic_id=113 |title=Transformers: Generation 2 #7: "New Dawn" |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=1994-05-01 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was aboard the [[Warworld (Transformers)|Warworld]] when [[Jhiaxus]]' forces attacked, but managed to evacuate. His fate within the Generation 2 comic series beyond this point is unknown.

Soundwave would also play a brief but important role in the text-only novel, ''Alignment'', writer [[Simon Furman]]'s take on what happened after the ''[[Transformers: Generation 2]]'' comic series ended. He was the one who recovered Megatron's broken body after his duel with [[Galvatron]]. Subsequently, he was the ringleader of the conspirators (along with Ravage, [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]] and Direwolf) who gave some of their [[Spark (Transformers)|spark energy]] to resurrect Megatron in a more powerful body, allowing him to defeat the forces of the [[Liege Maximo]]. After Megatron executes the Decepticon High Council save [[Shrapnel (Transformers)|Shrapnel]], Soundwave once again acted as Megatron's second in command and coordinated the strike against the Maximo with [[Ultra Magnus (Transformers)|Ultra Magnus]]. His fate beyond this is unknown, save for a brief cameo in ''[[Beast Machines]]''.

Soundwave as depicted in the Marvel Universe tends to be the most intellectual and philosophical of the Decepticons. He is appalled by the barbarity of Megatron and Shockwave battling in hand to hand combat for leadership of the Decepticons, especially as the entire spectacle is being broadcast on live television for human entertainment by Robo-Master. When the future Autobots and Decepticons join forces and repel an alien invasion of Cybertron he begins to propose a lasting truce to Ultra Magnus but stops himself, observing that too much has occurred between the 2 factions and their differences are irreconcilable.

====TFcon comics====
Soundwave appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play ''Bee for, Bee now''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBTlU6PT9LA&amp;feature=relmfu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===
A parody of the Generation 1 Transformers was aired in the December 23rd 2008 episode of ''[[Frank TV]]'', called "Frank the Halls". In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots ([[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] and [[Wheeljack]]) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot [[Prius]] Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doinkamation.blogspot.com/2008/12/transformers-satire-for-franktv.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708033321/http://doinkamation.blogspot.com/2008/12/transformers-satire-for-franktv.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-08 |title=Animation Corner: Transformers Satire For FrankTV |publisher=Doinkamation.blogspot.com |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2010-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Toy Meets Girl" voiced by [[Seth Green]]. He is portrayed as having retired from the Decepticon army and obtained honest employment as a transformable [[portable toilet]]. [[Frank Welker]] reprises his role of Soundwave (as well as Megatron but not Rumble) when he appears again in another ''Robot Chicken'' episode "Werewolf vs. Unicorn" where in the current years it's revealed that because the [[audio cassette tape]] and [[cassette player]]s have long become obsolete and therefore no longer widely used, that his spy tactics now do not work (the people who discovered him in the skit were laughing at his [[mixtape]] which was [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]] being killed by them puling his tape out). He is later found by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] to be on sale on [[eBay]] with options to place a bid for 500 dollars or "Buy it now" for 1000 dollars, whereupon Shockwave exclaims "''Request permission to buy it now!''" The Commemorative Soundwave figure was used in "Werewolf vs. Unicorn."

Soundwave made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[The Courtship of Stewie's Father]]" as [[Peter Griffin|Peter's]] new supervisor. In it, Soundwave releases a framed photograph from his cassette deck cavity, of himself and a human woman named Denise, who Soundwave proclaims is his wife, whom he met in a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[chat room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174616/http://www.tfw2005.com/news/data/upimages/1132547698.jpg|archivedate=September 27, 2007|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/news/data/upimages/1132547698.jpg|title=Soundwave cameo on Family Guy|publisher=www.tfw2005.com|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soundwave also appears in the ''[[Sealab 2021]]'' episode "[[List of Sealab 2021 episodes|Hail, Squishface]]" as a toy on an Asian girl's cart, who sells Capt. Murphy Gloop, from the show ''[[The Herculoids]]''.

A music video featuring Soundwave and a robot similar to Rumble and Frenzy named Lazer (though purely white in colour) breakdancing has surfaced throughout the Internet since 2000. The video contains audio clips from both the animated series and ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' alongside music.

In 2007, shortly before the release of the live-action [[Transformers (film)|''Transformers'' film]], Soundwave appeared in the viral comedy short "Soundwave: The Touch."

===Toys===
* '''''Generation 1'' Soundwave''' (1984)
:The original Soundwave toy (and his cassettes) began life as part of [[Takara]]'s [[Micro Change]] line, designed by Satoshi Koizumi, featuring household objects that transformed into accurately-scaled robots. Incorporated into the ''Transformers'' toy line by Hasbro, the figure was packaged with Buzzsaw in the US, and with Rumble in Japan (also including a set of non-functional headphones). The tapes could fit into Soundwave's opening chest door (released by a push of his shoulder-mounted "eject" button), while the interaction level was maintained by his two guns, which turned into AA-sized batteries that could store in a compartment in his back. Cassette tapes that could interact with Soundwave were released regularly until 1988. The Soundwave toy was reissued in Japan in 2004, and in the U.S. in 2006 using the Soundblaster mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Generation 1'' Soundblaster''' (1987)
:A re-mold of the Soundwave toy exclusive to Japan, Soundblaster is cast in black plastic where Soundwave was blue, with a retooled chest door, now made of translucent red plastic and able to hold two cassettes at once. Soundblaster came with a variant edition of Buzzsaw, who had a special sticker on his body that, when viewed through Soundblaster's door, would reveal the weak spots of Fortress Maximus. Soundblaster was reissued in Japan in 2005.
* '''''Generation 1'' Action Master Soundwave''' (1990)
:The non-transforming Action Master incarnation of Soundwave came packaged with a transforming partner named [[Wingthing]], who could become a gun for Soundwave to wield.
* '''''Generation 2'' Go-Bot Soundwave''' (1995)
:The Marvel Comics ''Generation 2'' series concluded before it could feature the Generation 2 toy line's new, distinctly different version of Soundwave from 1995 - a fluorescent yellow, blue and pink [[Ford Thunderbird]] stock car [[Gobots (Transformers)#Transformers: Generation 2 (Team)|Go-Bot]], a re-deco of an earlier figure named Gearhead. The figure was later recolored into W.A.R.S. for ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''.
* '''''Generation 2'' Laser Cycle Soundwave''' (unreleased)
:Plans existed to repaint the Laser Cycle, Road Pig, into a version of Soundwave featuring his classic color scheme, but the figure was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laser Cycle Road Pig|url=http://www.transformersaction.com/action-figures/transformers-generation-2-decepticon-laser-cycles-road-pig/|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Machine Wars'' Soundwave''' (1997)
:1997's [[Machine Wars]] toy line, released exclusively in KB Toy stores, featured Soundwave as a repaint of the 1992 European and Canadian exclusive figure, Stalker. The toy transforms into a missile tank and, colored in shades of black, gray and maroon, resembled Soundwave only through a similar head sculpt, and a shoulder-mounted weapon, in this case, an electron rocket. His tech spec, however, was clearly based on that of the original Soundwave toy's, with an additional mention of a new nickname for this version of the character: "The Terror Tank."
* '''''Transtech'' Soundwave''' (unreleased)
:With the conclusion of the ''[[Beast Machines]]'' toy line, the initial plan for a follow-up was through the futuristic ''[[Transtech]]'' series. Although the idea was scrapped in favor of ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'', [[Toronto]]-based design studio [[Draxhall Jump]] produced several designs for characters, including Soundwave.
* '''''Smallest Transformers'' Soundwave with Jaguar''' (2003)
:Part of the first wave of the Japan-only ''Smallest Transformers'' toy line. Despite the small size (roughly 2 inches in robot height), the toy is virtually faithful to the original G1 toy in design and transformation. Soundwave also comes with a micro cassette that transforms into Ravage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/takara-wst-destrons-358/soundwave-with-jaguar-2550/ TFW2005.com - WST Soundwave with Jaguar]&lt;/ref&gt;
:In 2006, this toy was to be released with a redeco of ''Energon'' Megatron as a [[Target Corporation|Target]] exclusive in the U.S., but plans to release the toy were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/energon-decepticons-167/megatron-with-mini-soundwave-unreleased-4080/ TFW2005.com - Megatron with Mini Soundwave (Unreleased)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Universe'' Soundwave with Space Case''' (2004)
:A redeco of Soundwave's ''Machine Wars'' figure, this toy was rendered in shades of blue and yellow, and packaged with fellow Decepticon [[Space Case (Transformers)|Space Case]].
* '''''Classics'' Commemorative Soundwave''' (2007)
:A [[Toys "R" Us]] exclusive is said to be near identical to the original toy. This however has one difference from that of the 1984 figure, being that the chest compartment (tape deck door) has been re-molded to hold two cassette Transformers as opposed to one. This version of Soundwave is actually a 'reverse repaint' of the Japanese-exclusive Soundblaster, himself a retooling of the original Soundwave. Commemorative Soundwave includes both Ravage and Laserbeak, two cassettes seen prominently in the original series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2475393&amp;cp#prod_prodinfo |title=Toys"R"Us/Babies"R"Us |publisher=Toysrus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205131952/http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2475393&amp;cp#prod_prodinfo |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Titanium'' 6&amp;nbsp;inch Soundwave with Laserbeak''' (2007)
:Two versions of Generation 1 Soundwave were released in the [[Transformers: Titanium]] toy line. One was a 3-inch non-transforming version in robot mode. The other is a transformable 6-inch version that transforms into a cassette deck. Both Soundwave's feature die cast metal and plastic parts, and the 6-inch version also includes a transformable Laserbeak. It is also rumored that the larger version would be repainted and released as Soundblaster along with Ravage.
* '''''Attacktix'' Soundwave''' (2007)
:Series 2 of the [[Transformers Attacktix]] figures included a Generation 1 Soundwave figure.
* '''''Music Label'' Soundwave''' (2007)
:An MP3 player designed to look like the Generation 1 Soundwave figure. [[Secure Digital|MiniSD]] cards fit inside his chest compartment, and comes with the shoulder gun, blaster, and alternate hands for holding the gun, making fists, and his "eject" finger. Uses 1 AAA battery. Despite the claim on the box, it can use at least up to a 2 GB memory card and play songs over 128kbit/s. In robot mode, he is the same size as Titanium Soundwave, though in "Cassette" mode he is longer and slightly taller. There are also headphones that are sold separately designed to look like Soundwave's minions [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]] and [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]].
:Soundwave is available in three colors: Sonic White, Spark Blue (which closely resembles his original G1 incarnation) and Blaster Black (an homage to Soundblaster).
:This figure was voted the 43rd top toy released in the last 10 years by ''ToyFare'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;ToyFare Magazine issue #122&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Transformers'' Encore Reissue Soundwave''' (2007)
:A release by Takara Tomy in Japan that is nearly identical to the original 1984 toy. Unlike the original 1984 release that was packaged with Buzzsaw, the Encore figure was packaged with Laserbeak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrstoyworld.com/product_info.php?cPath=95_32&amp;products_id=1307 |title=JRS Toyworld |publisher=JRS Toyworld |date=2004-06-11 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character named Soundwave—but with no relation to the original character—was released as part of the ''Beast Wars Mutants'' sub-line in 2000. As a Mutant, this Soundwave transforms from bat to alligator, with no humanoid mode. Due to his in-built radar in bat mode, and crushing jaws in alligator mode, he excels at a variety of missions. However, due to his situation, Soundwave is a dark and bitter character. He has an ultra-sensitive internal radar in bat mode, and in alligator mode, his tail can send seismic shockwaves through the ground.

===IDW Publishing===
This version of Soundwave also appeared in [[IDW Publishing]]'s [[Beast Wars: The Gathering]] miniseries. Activated on Earth by [[Magmatron]] and a group of Predacons from the future, Soundwave and the mutants emerged from their stasis pods and took up residence in a swamp that they quickly made their own. When a group newly activated [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacons]] led by [[Transquito]] ventured through the swamp on a mission they were attacked by the Mutants. Poison Bite attacked [[Retrax]], Soundwave attacked [[Powerpinch]] and Icebird attacked Transquito. Deciding the swamp was not worth their lives, [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] and [[Insecticon]] fled. However, in "The Ascending" it is revealed that Powerpinch, Transquito and Retrax survived.

IDW's [[Beast Wars Sourcebook]] series identifies the mutant Soundwave as a former warrior who may have been a veteran of the Great War, though the details are ambiguous at best. Sourcebook #4 states that Soundwave became an actor/entertainer after the ratification of the Pax Cybertronia, developing a "dramatic flair in everything from his movements to his speech paterns".

In ''Transformers: Universe - The Wreckers'' the Mutants traveled to Cybertron and sought the guidance of the Oracle computer, seeking a cure for their condition. What they did not know is that the Oracle was under the influence of the Quintessons. The Mutants were sent to the outer Orion Cluster. Once there they were captured by the Quintessons, found in contempt by the five-faced aliens, and destroyed in an attack by a swarm of Sharkticons.

:Although the ''Beast Wars'' toy line had concluded in 1998, this sub-line was released during the ''[[Beast Machines]]'' era. Although the figures lack robot modes, they all feature vestigial robotic components—such as Soundwave's robot head, concealed within his bat mouth. A re-deco of the figure known as '''Leatherneck''' was intended for release in ''Transformers: Universe'', but did not come to fruition.

In ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', Soundwave's origins are altered. He is the second Transformer from the mysterious [[Planet X (Transformers)|Planet X]]. He transforms into a Planet X Jet (bearing a resemblance to a stealth bomber) and is partnered with a smaller robot called [[Laserbeak]] ''('''Killer Condor''' in Japan)''. In the English dub of this series, he has a synthesized voice, albeit more human than his G1 counterpart, which is counterbalanced by his tendency to speak like a modern [[disc jockey]]—using terms like "''He got served''" and "''Peace out, bots''" and calling the battlefield, "''The Floor''", giving him more of a personality than his G1 counterpart.

The package bio for Soundwave mentions that Planet X itself may be a total deception, and that it is actually a term the agents use to refer to their service to [[Unicron]]. Although he and Sideways are the survivors of a dead civilization, they actually serve Unicron throughout space and time as his [[Heralds of Unicron|heralds]] in taking over new worlds to replace his loss of previous forms.

Soundwave is armed with two cannons, and can hide himself behind [[hologram]]s when working in conjunction with Laserbeak.

===Animated series===
Soundwave first makes his appearance in the episode ''Titan'', offering to lead [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] and his minions to the planet [[Gigantion]], however in a scene featuring Sideways and Starscream aboard the Atlantis a purple cassette player with the Decepticon symbol is on board playing music to ease the tension between the two evil robots. It is not clear if this is Soundwave or not, but it is interesting that he appeared in "Titan" just a few episodes later. In his first encounter with the Autobots he fought Optimus Prime and Wing Saber in their Sonic Wing mode and was able to hold his own in combat until Megatron was defeated by Metroplex and the Decepticons retreated.

Shortly after they arrived on Gigantion and there Megatron was upgraded into Galvatron, Soundwave abandoned the Decepticons, and joined up with his counterpart, [[Sideways (Transformers)|Sideways]]. During a battle with the Autobot Cybertron Defense Team, he revealed the history of his world, and how they desired the [[Cyber Planet Key]]s to get revenge on the inhabitants of Gigantion.

Later, he and Sideways attempted to intervene in the epic battle between Galvatron and [[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)|Starscream]] in order to claim the Planet Keys and [[Omega Lock]], only to be sent into another universe by the distortion caused by the two fighters' conflict.

However, Soundwave would appear later, when Starscream reached out to Galvatron across dimensions, seemingly trapped along with him and Sideways. However, Starscream seemed to have returned by the series' end, which meant that the same possibility existed for both Sideways and Soundwave.

Soundwave is the only major transformer in the series who never summons his Cyber Key. In his toy version, his Cyber Key opens his chest compartment to store Laserbeak or one of his two cannons. In his first appearance to the Autobots, Soundwave demonstrates the ability to do this without the aid of a Cyber Key.

G1 Soundwave makes a cameo appearance in the animated series as a blue boombox that Sideways used to hear music.

===Fun Publications===
The ''Cybertron'' incarnation of Soundwave was among the characters to appear in the comic strip published exclusively through the Transformers Collectors Club, arriving on the planet itself to observe [[Vector Prime (Transformers)|Vector Prime]], [[Sentinel Maximus]] and [[Omega Prime]] after their defeat of Unicron's heralds, Nemesis Prime and [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], and capture of the [[Matrix of Leadership|Dead Matrix]]. Dispatching Laserbeak to recover the Dead Matrix from its place in storage, Soundwave threw the talisman into the black hole that had been created by the collapse of Unicron, allowing the Chaos Bringer's [[Spark (Transformers)|Spark]] to escape and infiltrate the planet Yst, which he corrupted and transformed into his new body. Soundwave would link up with his master, and watch the unfolding carnage of a [[Mini-Con]] civil war. However, when Unicron chose that moment to attack, Soundwave was attacked by several Mini-Cons, including [[Scythe (Transformers)|Scythe]] and [[Perceptor]]. Unable to hit the smaller Mini-Cons, Soundwave fled with Unicron when [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] awoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer =[[Forest Lee]] and [[Dan Khanna]] | penciller =[[Forest Lee]] | inker = | story = | title = [[Transformers: Cybertron: Balancing Act]]| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = April 2007| publisher = IDW Publishing| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys===
* '''''Cybertron'' Voyager Soundwave''' (2005)
:The first actual homage to the original Soundwave in modern times, the ''Cybertron'' toy transforms not into a tape deck, but a sleek alien stealth fighter. Beyond this, however, the nods to the original character are many, from his head design, his multi-barreled shoulder cannon to his opening chest door, activated by his [[Cyber Planet Key|Cyber Key]]. Soundwave comes with a new incarnation of Laserbeak, who transforms into a battery bomb that can store within Soundwave's chest compartment. This toy was recolored into ''Universe'' [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]]. This toy was based on a [[F-117 Nighthawk]].
* '''''Galaxy Force'' Voyager Soundblaster'''
:A black repaint of Soundwave, predictably named Soundblaster, was released exclusively in Japan through Takara's "Toy's Dream Project" series. However this Soundblaster is a separate character from Soundwave.
* '''''Cybertron'' Legends Soundwave''' (2006)
:A Micro class Soundwave was released in the third wave of the Legends of Cybertron toy line. It came without Laserbeak. In 2007 a Target store exclusive value pack of four Voyager class Cybertron toy was released. It included Jetfire, Megatron, Optimus Prime and Soundwave. All identical to their original releases.

Almost from the moment the [[live action]] ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' movie was announced in 2007, producer [[Don Murphy]] and the production team made it clear they did not want to feature mass/size shifting in transformation (excluding the [[AllSpark#2007 Transformers movie|Allspark]]), due to concerns over realism. With this process an inherent part of Soundwave's [[tape deck]] alternate mode, there was some discussion over whether or not to change it due to its obsolescence, or to include the character in the film at all. It was announced by Hasbro at SDCC 2004 that movie Soundwave would be a helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seibertron.com |url=http://www.seibertron.com/news/view.php?id=5436 |title=SDCC Hasbro Panel Speak, New Alternators, The End of Universe and more! |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=2005-07-15 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early leaked movie scripts proposed that his alternate mode would be a [[helicopter]], but animatics shown at the 2005 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic Con]] were poorly received. This led to a rethink, with the eventual helicopter character rechristened as [[Vortex (Transformers)|Vortex]], then finally [[Blackout (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Blackout]]. 2006 script reviews named Soundwave as a spying [[boombox]] on [[Air Force One]], able to transform into a small robot, but eventually, this character was amended to being [[Frenzy (Transformers)#2007 Transformers movie|Frenzy]], with [[Don Murphy]] stating that Soundwave will be reserved for a future sequel, until they can "do him right". When the film was released on DVD a special on-line content from Best Buy showed early animation footage of Blackout as a blue helicopter with a head that resembled Soundwave.

In a ''[[USA Today]]'' online fan poll, Soundwave was one of the 10 Transformers that the fans wanted in the sequel, winning with 20% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breznican |first=Anthony |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-18-Transformers_N.htm |title='Transformers' fans make some noise for Soundwave |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave appears in ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''. Soundwave is a satellite in the film, and he is also a Triple changer as he has the form of a Cybertronian jet as well. Soundwave is not seen in his robot form in the film. Frank Welker reprised his voicing role, and used his Doctor Claw voice from ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', which, when run through a vocoder, gives Soundwave his unique voice from the original animated series. The lack of this vocoder in the 2009 film left the voice sounding more like [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Doctor Claw]] than the original Soundwave. He has his minion Ravage to do his bidding in the film.

Soundwave also appears in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', this time transforming into a [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]] and with Laserbeak to serve him. Soundwave is armed with sonic cannons.

His Hasbro Battle Bio states that he is 22 feet tall and that his main weapon is a sonic cannon which can only be used in the atmosphere, as sound waves will not travel in vacuum.

===IDW Publishing===
In issue #4 of ''[[Transformers: Defiance]]'', it is revealed that the reason for Soundwave to have believed to have been dead is because he was on the Decepticons ship that ''[[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]]'' was commanding, and that all of its crew were missing by the time Megatron noticed the emergency signal emitting from the ship while he was chasing the Allspark.

Soundwave first appeared in issue #2 of ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'' where he arrived at the crash site of the ''Nemesis'' on Mars. There he found [[Dreadwing]]'s head, as well as the body of Frenzy, then contacted Starscream and told him to rally to his signal. Starscream was surprised to hear from Soundwave, as he had been believed dead for years. Soundwave deployed a number of his forces on Earth, leaving others on his ship.

In ''Tales of the Fallen'' #5 Soundwave, still in orbit after the events of the 2009 film, notices someone has reactivated Ravage.

Soundwave appears in ''[[Transformers: Nefarious]]'' #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)|Bumblebee]], [[Breakaway (Transformers)|Breakaway]], [[Jolt (Transformers)|Jolt]], Knock Out and [[Dune Runner]] are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first Breakaway is warned by Soundwave to leave, but unwilling to give in the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes. In "Nefarious" #2, Soundwave sent [[Dirt Boss]], [[Reverb (Transformers)|Reverb]], and [[Brakedown]] to Wendover, Utah to find an "Initiative" facility. Soundwave then contacted Ravage in order to discover how he was resurrected. Then, he proceeded to assist Reverb, Dirt Boss, and Brakedown, in a fight with the Autobots. After a battle with Optimus Prime, Soundwave convinces the Autobot leader to join forces temporarily, in order to find "the Initiative".

===Movie plots===
In ''Revenge of the Fallen'', Soundwave spends his time hovering above Earth in orbit. He receives a message from [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]] about Mikaela Banes possessing a shard of the Allspark and orders him to retrieve it. Docking onto a satellite and hacking it, Soundwave intercepts information on the location of [[Megatron (Transformers)#Role in the films|Megatron]]'s corpse and the [[AllSpark#2007 Transformers movie|Allspark]] shard. He deploy his servant [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] to retrieve the shard and sent the [[Constructicons]] to rendezevous at Megatron's resting place. After the death of Optimus Prime, Soundwave carried out Megatron's orders to prepare the Decepticons for the invasion of Earth. While coordinating attacks, Soundwave located [[Sam Witwicky]]'s parents in [[Paris]], France, and called [[Witwicky family#Judy Witwicky|Judy Witwicky]] via her cell phone. He demanded she tell him where Sam was, but Judy did not take him seriously, believing him to be a pervert caller, and hung up. He later intercepted calls from the Egyptian government on Sam's location, and informed the other Decepticons. Soundwave did not take part in the last battle, although Ravage did and was killed by [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)|Bumblebee]].

In ''Dark of the Moon'', Soundwave is revealed to have been on Earth since the 1970s. He discovered the Autobot spaceship, the ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'' on the Moon, and recruited various human servants from the U.S. and Russian space agencies to prevent further exploration of it following the initial Moon landings, while he ordered an army of Decepticons to steal most of the pillars onboard and hide under the moon's surface. In the modern day he appears at Megatron's base in [[Africa]], where he and [[Laserbeak]] report the Autobot's recovery of [[Sentinel Prime]] and the remaining pillars from the crashed ''Ark''. Megatron praises Soundwave's initiative in the decades-long plan and orders Laserbeak to kill their human allies. The only human ally they don't kill, Dylan Gould, has Soundwave disguise himself as a [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]] that belonged to Sam's girlfriend, Carly, in order to get close to the Autobots. He reveals himself and captures Carly once the two humans learn of Gould's alliance with the Decepticons, and threatens her in order to convince Sam to discover the Autobot's plans. During the battle in [[Chicago]], Soundwave and [[Barricade (Transformers)|Barricade]] lead several Decepticons in capturing some of the Autobots. Gould convinces Soundwave not to take prisoners, and Soundwave orders the others to execute their "trophies". Once [[Wheeljack|Que]] is dead, Soundwave prepares to kill Bumblebee himself, but a Decepticon battle-cruiser hijacked by Wheelie and [[Brains (Transformers)|Brains]] drops fighters near Soundwave, distracting him and allowing the Autobots to fight back. Bumblebee attacks Soundwave who tries to shoot him, but is confused among the crushing ships and shoots the other Decepticons. He throws Bumblebee, but Bumblebee then slays Soundwave by sticking his cannon into Soundwave's chest and shooting upwards. This causes Soundwave's head to disintegrate, killing him instantly.

===Cyber Missions===
In ''Cyber Missions #1'', Soundwave successfully infiltrates the NEST command base (in his satellite mode, oddly), which is guarded by Bumblebee. Soundwave transforms and smashes the screen projecting Optimus Prime and engages the Autobot. Bumblebee fires a shot, but Soundwave sends it back to Bumblebee as a sonic boom. Bumblebee then fires several more rounds with Soundwave frantically trying to absorb all the bullets, but is finally blown backwards. In ''Cyber Missions #2'', Bumblebee trapped Soundwave in a vacuum-sealed electromagnetic bubble, rendering his abilities useless.

===Video games===
Like the movie, Soundwave coordinates the mission to the playable Decepticon. His voice is now a similar Vocoder fashion of his G1 counterpart.

In Dark of the Moon, Soundwave is a playable character. He is ordered by Megatron to destroy a Sector 7 nest base that contains information about Sentinel Prime. Soundwave is among the Decepticons that greet Shockwave at the end of the game in South Africa. He shows Shockwave a 3D hologram of Chernobly and the artifact he must recover. He transforms into a Modified white SUV similar to a [[Cadillac SRX]]

In the [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Decepticons|Revenge of the Fallen: Decepticons]]'', Grindor, Sideways, Soundwave and Starscream greet a new Decepticon protoform and send him on a mission. Soundwave directs the new protoform to survive on Earth.

In the downloadable content pack for the Xbox 360 and PS3, Soundwave is confirmed to be a playable character. He is probably based on the Deluxe toy.

In ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon (video game)|Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Stealth Force Edition]]'' for the Wii and 3DS Soundwave is a playable character, and (like with the PS3/360 version) transforms into a heavily modified [[Cadillac SRX]]

In ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'', Soundwave is a playable character taking the alternate form of a cybertronian truck. He is playable in levels 3, 4 and 5 of the decepticon campaign and is a boss that players have to fight in the autobot level 2. Like all characters within the game he is playable in escalation mode, and players have to have their decepticon leader look like him in multiplayer mode. In the game his default weapon is a neutron assault rifle, although he does have an energon repair ray in level 5 of the decepticon campaign.

===Books===
In the ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'' coloring book Soundwave is depicted hacking into a military satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-movie-toys--products-30/revenge-of-the-fallen-coloring-book-preview-167057/ |title=Revenge Of The Fallen Coloring Book Preview - Transformers News |publisher=Tfw2005.com |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave appears in ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' as a modular music-based [[Decepticon]], who specializes in sonic interference. Whilst his robot mode still retains elements of his original tapedeck incarnation, more so in his toy form, his alt-mode is now a [[loudspeaker]]-equipped [[Scion xB]]. He also possesses two supporters: [[Laserbeak#Transformers Animated|Laserbeak]], who transforms into an [[electric guitar]] he uses for a sonic boom attack, and [[Ratbat#Transformers Animated|Ratbat]], which becomes a [[keytar]] for use in sonic hypnosis. His voice, now provided by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]] in the United States and [[Nobuo Tobita]] in Japan, once again requires a [[vocoder]] to create Soundwave's trademark robotic monotone voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Transformers Animated: The Allspark Almanac]] |author=[[Jim Sorenson]] &amp; [[Bill Forster (writer)|Bill Forster]]| publisher=Idea &amp; Design Works Llc |date=August 15, 2009 |ISBN=978-1-60010-487-9 | pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
Soundwave was originally a simple robotic toy that [[Sari Sumdac|Sari]] got for her birthday, built by Megatron as a part of a plan to take advantage of Sari's careless and repeated use of her [[Allspark]] key to continuously upgrade the toy until it serves as a suitable body for [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Megatron]] to host. However, the excessive usage of the key to enhance Soundwave caused an unexpected side-effect: Developing almost [[Cybertron]]ian sophistication at an alarmingly increasing rate to the point of becoming self-aware to the point where he refuses to take orders from Sari (or any other human) any more. It was by observing the common labor-robots in the city that he concluded that not only robots are superior to humans in every way, but that it's illogical that robots are forced to succumb to their human masters, and it should be the other way around. By then, Megatron introduced himself to Soundwave through televisions in a nearby electronics store as his creator "of sorts" to impose unto him his plan to crush the [[Autobot]]s. At first, Soundwave declared this illogical to fight robot-kind until Megatron insisted that they were traitors that upheld the human race's slavery of all robot-kind, convincing Soundwave to ultimately side with the Decepticons with the intent to overthrow all humans and obliterate the robots that protect them. He used his technology-manipulating speakers to summon all nearby labor-robots to convert them into his new Transformer body while using his stereo-system to spark a robot-revolution against their "human-oppressors." All automated forms of public transportation stopped and the city's labor robots jumped the [[Autobot]]s when they appeared on the scene. After failing to convince [[Bulkhead (Transformers)|Bulkhead]] into joining him and killing Sari in the name of all robot-kind, it appeared that Bulkhead destroyed Soundwave with a single blow of his powerful wrecking-ball arm, shattering his body into hundreds of pieces. However, unknown to the Autobot, his core survived, in the form of a small, almost-invisible media player.

Soundwave regenerated at [[Christmas]] time as ex-Sumdac Systems Vice President Porter C. Powell, who had acquired Soundwave's original patents while he was in charge of the company, was distributing multiple Soundwave toys during the Christmas season. Soundwave managed to reprogram some of the toys, using one of them to spike the Autobots' [[eggnog|oil nog]]. With the Autobots now sedated and out of commission, Soundwave proceeded to take them to the basement where he attempted to brainwash them into taking on his ideology as [[Decepticon]]s by placing them in a [[virtual reality|virtual]] program in human form. However, the plan was briefly halted by the attempted intervention of Sari as well as the Autobots learning the truth of where they are. Soundwave had a backup plan, using Laserbeak to force Sari into a retreat, then using Ratbat in keytar mode to complete the Autobots' reformat. Soundwave succeeded in placing the Autobots under his control, and used the numerous toy replicas of himself to take control of the humans in Detroit. However, since Sari was techno-organic, she was immune to the mind-control waves. Soundwave was defeated when Sari recruited the help of [[Scrapper (Transformers)|Scrapper]], [[Snarl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Snarl]] and [[Wreck-Gar#Transformers Animated|Wreck-Gar]] to fight the brainwashed Autobots, and was smashed apart along with Ratbat by Optimus using Laserbeak's guitar mode as a makeshift axe. Though Soundwave's core still remained intact, it was eventually turned off by Sari before being rescued by Laserbeak. It is unknown what became of Soundwave after that.

:A Deluxe sized figure that transforms into a [[Scion xB]]-like vehicle. Soundwave's bio describes his alternate mode as an SUV, although the Scion xB is actually a station wagon that resembles a small [[minivan]]. Its most notable feature is that one of his "minions", Laserbeak, is present in the form of a [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V-style]] electric guitar that transforms into a bird. It can also be attached to the top of his vehicle mode or held like a guitar in robot mode. His upper torso has the look of an old cassette player door, set up as a nod to his G1 toy.

This Soundwave is an alternate good version of the Generation 1 character from the BotCon exclusive "Shattered Glass" comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots on the side of evil. His appearance is based on the white music label Soundwave MP3 player, while Buzzsaw seems to be based on Steeljaw in appearance.

===Fun Publications===
Soundwave first appears as a member of Megatron's forces in the ''Transformers: Timelines'' story "Shattered Glass" story by [[Fun Publications]]. He helps in the attack on the Autobot's Ark launching platform, working with Buzzsaw.

Soundwave makes a cameo in the fiction "[[Dungeons &amp; Dinobots]]", a text based story. When the Autobots are gaining the advantage in an attack on the Arch-Ayr fuel dump he calls in the [[Mayhem Suppression Squad]] to help the Decepticons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S. Trent Troop]] and [[Greg Sepelak]]|title=Dungeons &amp; Dinobots|publisher=[[Fun Publications]]|others= Illustrator [[Evan Gauntt]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave appears in the story "[[Do Over (Transformers)|Do Over]]". He is among the crew of the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]'', which follows the Autobot's [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] to Earth. When the ship is damaged in battle with the Ark he escapes in a stasis pod to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S. Trent Troop]] and [[Greg Sepelak]]|title=Do Over |publisher=[[Fun Publications]]|others= Illustrator [[Yuki Oshima]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave is spotlighted in the story ''[[The Desert Heat!]]''. In this story, having crashed to Earth in an escape pod, Heatwave recovers Soundwave and helps his fellow Decepticon get back online and assume an Earth-style alternate mode.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transformersclub.com/_images/DHpage1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave appears in the story ''Eye in the Sky''. Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to [[Burpleson Air Force Base]] to stop the Autobots from controlling the GODS defense system. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.

Soundwave is spotlighted in the story ''[[Blitzwing Bop]]''. The Elite Guardsman Thunderwing intercepts a radio signal from Earth which mentions Soundwave. Finding Soundwave is wanted for a minor offense from long ago he heads to Earth. Thunderwing finds Soundwave involved in a battle the Autobot [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] for the possession of the malfunctioning Decepticon [[Blitzwing]]. Although not interested in the dispute, Soundwave convinces Thunderwing that Soundwave cannot leave Earth for trial on Cybertron until his commanding officer can be notified, and the only way to get Starscream online is to rescue Blitzwing. Thunderwing is still unwilling to takes sides in the battle against Blaster, merely following the Decepticon, but Soundwave tricks Blaster into mentioning a crime he committed on Cybertron while Thunderwing is in nearby. Thunderwing immediately goes into arrest mode and tries to capture Blaster, but Blaster escapes in a malfunctioning [[Stellar Spanner]]. With Starscream back online Soundwave confesses to his minor crimes and Thunderwing passes a sentence of community service on him.

===Toys===
An official toy exists, as part of the SG Blaster Vs SG Soundwave box-set, and is a repaint of the G1 Soundblaster toy (itself, a retool of the G1 Soundwave toy). In addition, the white Music Label Soundwave figure matches his colors almost exactly, save for the Decepticon symbol on his chest, and has been officially repurposed as one of this character's forms.

Soundwave was a gladiator around the same time as Megatron. He has many pet Mini-Cons who work for him, particularly [[Laserbeak]].

Soundwave is one of the main group of Decepticons in the 2011 computer animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-prime-39/botcon-2010-transformers-prime-panel-coverage-170054/ TFW2005.com - BotCon 2010 ''Transformers: Prime'' Panel Coverage]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his previous incarnations, Soundwave chooses not to speak with his own voice, but instead records archive audio and video from other sources and repeats it when needed, displaying it on his face, which is composed entirely of an electronic screen. The fact that Soundwave does not speak by choice is indicated in an interview with producer Jeff Kline. He is armed with two cables that extend from his chest that have an electrical appendage on each end that have a variety of uses, and he has integrated ground bridge/space bridge controls. He is rarely seen in combat, spending most of his time supporting the Decepticons as communications officer and technical specialist, but has shown himself to be a very proficient fighter when circumstances demand it, displaying not only extraordinary fighting skills, but also the expert use of Laserbeak, his electric cables, and even his ground bridge/space bridge controls as effective weapons against his enemies.

When Soundwave speaks, he sounds like his G1 counterpart, only with his voice distortion slightly less enhanced, thus sounding more human than robotic.

===Prime series===
In the ''Darkness Rising'' 5 part mini-series, Soundwave detects the presence of [[Arcee]], so Starscream sends a pair of Decepticons to attack her. Later, Soundwave detects a signal from deep space, which he is certain is Megatron, so the Space Bridge is opened, and Megatron returns. Later, Soundwave deploys Laserbeak at Starscream's orders to capture Fowler in order to locate the Autobot base. He is later assigned to highjack an Earth bond radio telescope array to location of Cybertron, as part Megatron's plan to use their Space Bridge to transport Dark Energon to Cybertron. However the Autobot's young human allies figure out the Decepticons have highjacked the array and go to the array to shut it down. The young computer wiz Raf hacks into the array computer system, and Soundwave attacks them. He cuts the array's main line locking the dishes in place. While preparing to leave, the Autobots human ally Miko takes a picture of Soundwave with her cell phone, Soundwave responds to this by taking a picture of Jack, Miko, and Raf (possibly with the intention of passing it along with information of their connection with the Autobots onto his fellow Decepticons).

Soundwave is well aware of Starscream's treachery against Megatron, and on several occasions saved Megatron from his treacherous lieutenant. In "Masters &amp; Students", Soundwave sent Laserbeak to make sure that Starscream retrieved the incapacitated Megatron from the Space Bridge wreckage while he witnesses Optimus' battle with Skyquake. In "Sick Mind" when Starscream and Knock Out conspire to euthanize the comatose Megatron, Soundwave at first appears to consider agreeing with the two, but points out the cord of Bumblebee's cortical psychic patch Bumblebee is hooked up to, and orders Megatron be put back online so that he will not have fallen by an Autobot's hand.

In "Rock Bottom" Megatron reveals he is aware of Starscream's ongoing treachery due to Soundwave having constant surveillance on the traitor and relaying his attempts of usurping him.

In "One Shall Rise" Pt. 3, Airachnid is placed in temporary command of the Decepticons when Megatron leaves to aid Optimus in defeating Unicron. In an attempt to secure her power for good, and to escape Unicron's wrath, Airachnid suggests that the Decepticons leave Megatron to continue their efforts on another world. Soundwave, being eternally loyal to Megatron, vetoed her orders and displayed unexpected combat skills to secure the ship for when Megatron returned. It is implied that, although Megatron is made aware of Airachnid's attempted grab for power, he does not punish her until Soundwave reminds him of her treachery in the season 2 episode "Crossfire".

In "Orion Pax" Pt. 1, Megatron orders Soundwave to remove Arcee from the ship after she broke in to try to rescue Optimus Prime. Soundwave manages to open a ground bridge to bridge her off, right before Orion saw her.

In "Triage", Soundwave hunts for an ancient Cybertronian relic. Having lost his minion Laserbeak, he continues the search on his own, fighting Wheeljack to claim the relic, the Resonance Blaster and defeat Wheeljack before he reclaims Laserbeak. He returns to the Nemesis with Megatron's prize, and is highly praised for it by Megatron, putting Knock Out and Dreadwing to shame who lost their relics to Arcee, Bumblebee and Starscream.

In "Hard Knocks", Soundwave captured Smokescreen and brought him on board the ''Nemesis'' after the Decepticons learned that Smokescreen was a clue to finding the final Omega Key.

In "Regeneration" and "Darkest Hour", Soundwave, along with Starscream and Knock Out, captured the children and held them for ransom unless the Autobots gave the Omega Keys to the Decepticons. However, when Optimus Prime destroyed the Omega Lock (and the Keys with them), Soundwave retreated back to the ''Nemesis'' with the other Decepticons.

In "Darkmount, NV", when Jack and Arcee were spotted in Jasper following the destruction of the Autobot base, Soundwave sent Laserbeak, along with two Vehicons, to terminate them. However, after Laserbeak was destroyed, Soundwave was unable to retrieve any surveillance footage from his remains.

In "Scattered" and "Prey", Soundwave was present when Shockwave presented Predaking to Megatron.

In "Rebellion", when Starscream sent out members of his armada to investigate a number of Autobot signals, Soundwave pointed out to him that their army was thinly spread and suggested that the Autobots were using the ''Harbinger'' as a base of operations. He later retreated with the other Decepticons as Darkmount was destroyed by Optimus Prime, aided by Agent Fowler and several Air Force pilots.

In "Thirst", he oversees the destruction of the mutant Terrorcons and is confronted by a newly freed Airachnid and her army of minions. When she charges him he opens a space bridge to one of Cybertron's moons stranding her and her minions.

In "Minus One", Soundwave is taken captive by the Autobots and questioned for information regarding Megatron's motives. However, Soundwave erases all the data of Megatron's plans before Optimus gives Ratchet approval to crack him open. The normally mute Decepticon then taunts the Autobots in his own voice before deactivating. Later, Laserbeak attacks the Autobot base and hooks up with Soundwave, reactivating him and giving him a new copy of Megatron's plans. He then proceeds to incapacitate Bulkhead and Smokescreen before kidnapping Ratchet and bringing him to the Nemesis.

In "Deadlock", Soundwave fights Jack and Miko (who is in the Apex armor) on the bridge of the Nemesis. With help from Raf, Jack and Miko trap Soundwave in the Shadowzone.

===Robots in Disguise (2015)===
Soundwave returns from the Shadowzone in the tenth episode of the second season of the stand-alone sequel series ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''. He escapes, trapping Bumblebee in the Shadowzone. Then, he quickly immobilizes most of the Autobots before getting tricked by Fixit and the humans into letting Bumblebee back in. The Autobots corner Soundwave and throw him back into the Shadowzone.
However, he returns in the third and final season, subtitled ''Combiner Force'', as a major antagonist, with a new body armor. In "Collateral Damage", his plan failed when he was defeated by Optimus Prime who was upgraded with Hi-Test.

===Books===
Soundwave appears in the novel ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]''. He was one of Megatronus's opponents and nearly defeated him, however this instead brought respect between the two. Soundwave commanded the [[Mini-Con]]s [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], and [[Laserbeak]], and joined Megatron as one of the Decepticons.

Soundwave appears in the short story "Bumblebee at Tyger Pax" by [[Alex Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/06/22/exclusive-learn-how-bumblebee-lost-his-voice-in-this-short-story-from-exodus-author-alex-irvine/ MTV.com - Learn How Bumblebee Lost His Voice in This Short Story from ''Exodus'' Author Alex Irvine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soundwave appears in the novels ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]''.

===Video games===
Soundwave appears in the 2010 video game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'' as a playable character in the last three chapters of the Decepticon campaign. While [[Shockwave (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Shockwave]] is established as [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Megatron]]'s [[second-in-command]], Soundwave is shown acting as Megatron's right hand during the campaign in Shockwave's absence.

Soundwave assists Megatron and Breakdown into infiltrating Iacon, defeating Zeta Prime, and hunting down Omega Supreme. He is also a boss in the Autobot campaign, being the warden of Kaon Prison in the Decepticons' capital city and using his tape cassettes Frenzy, Rumble and Laserbeak to attack. The Autobots manage to defeat him, but not before he delivers a fatal blow to Zeta Prime, absorbing what remained of his life force energy in order to regenerate his own strength, and then manages to escape before Optimus can finish him.

Aside from transforming into a Cybertronian truck, Soundwave can also turn into a [[boombox]], as shown right before his boss battle, in the game's ending credits and a [[GameStop]] promotional commercial for the game featuring Shockwave.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtyYt7oRMhs GameSpot Video Transformers War for Cybertron Storyline Movie2.flv - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this mode, he plays the [[Stan Bush]] songs "[[The Touch (Stan Bush song)|The Touch]]" and "Till All Are One".

In the sequel game ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]''; Soundwave is playable in two levels. The first time is in Chapter 9 in which he rebuilds Megatron after he was destroyed by Metroplex. The other level is the final one in which Soundwave boards the ''Ark'' and helps destroy the Ark's defenses. [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]] and [[Laserbeak]] assist Soundwave in these tasks. He pops up throughout the rest of the game as an NPC.

'''Televisión Boliviana''' (TV Bolivia) is the first television channel of [[Bolivia]] and serves the only means of television communication from the government. The channel was established in August 1969 under the government of [[Luis Adolfo Siles]] after years of planning by the government of then-recently deceased [[René Barrientos]].&lt;ref name=Gobierno1&gt;[http://www.bolivia.gov.bo/BOLIVIA/paginas/historia6.htm "Época Republicana (1900-2000)" – Gobierno de Bolivia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050919141849/http://www.bolivia.gov.bo/BOLIVIA/paginas/historia6.htm |date=2005-09-19 }} {{es icon}} (Retrieved on September 27, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; It's a state-owned broadcasting network.

==Criticism==
The channel was established with the aim of serving as an independent, public service channel, but has served throughout its history as a [[propaganda]] tool for all the running governments according to studies on its programming.&lt;ref name=TVHistory1&gt;[http://estructurabolivia.wordpress.com/2006/06/03/television/ "Los inicios de la televisión en Bolivia (1969–1984)", Estructura Bolivia, WordPress] {{es icon}} (Retrieved on September 27, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

TV Boliviana was the only nationwide TV channel until [[Paceña de Televisión]] was established on October 24, 1984.

==First performance==
The London Coliseum programme for the first week of the performance&lt;ref&gt;The London Coliseum programme, week commencing Monday, 11 March 1912&lt;/ref&gt; shows that ''The Crown of India'' masque was the most important of the eleven acts in the show.  There were two ''[[Tableau vivant|Tableaux]]'': "The Cities of Ind" and "Ave Imperator!".&lt;ref&gt;Ave Imperator! (Latin): Hail the Emperor!&lt;/ref&gt; The programme listed the cast, who personified 'India' herself, England represented by 'St. George', and various Indian cities. There were also attendant performers, in elaborate costumes, personifying other roles. Elgar attended the daily rehearsals for two weeks, then conducted the hour-long show two performances a day for a further two weeks.

==Extracts==
Elgar later extracted five of the pieces – 1(a), 2, 5, 8 and 4 – and added an [[intermezzo]] for solo violin to create '''The Crown of India Suite'''. The first performance was at the Hereford Festival on 11&amp;nbsp;September 1912, by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by the composer. The Suite gained immediate popularity: during Elgar's lifetime, there were 102 live performances of it on the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Richards: Imperialism and Music, Manchester University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crown of India March''' from the incidental music for the masque is also performed separately.

==Complete score==
The complete score for the ''Crown of India'' incidental music was only published in a piano-vocal version by Elgar's friend [[Hugh Blair (composer)|Hugh Blair]]. The remaining orchestral parts were destroyed in the 1960s. In 2007 the [[Elgar Society]] commissioned the composer [[Anthony Payne]] to complete the orchestration of the music for ''The Crown of India''. Payne is to "complete the scoring of the piano-vocal version and combining this, where appropriate, with the orchestral suite and march."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elgar.org/1news.htm Elgar Society: Composer Anthony Payne agrees to complete the orchestration of the music for Elgar’s Crown of India]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mask of Diijon''''' is a 1946 American [[black-and-white]] [[film noir]] suspense film released from PRC Studios, directed by [[Lew Landers]] and featuring [[Erich von Stroheim]], [[Jeanne Bates]] and William Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{AFI film|id=24872|title=The Mask of Diijon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Diijon, a tired magician, gives up his act to study the power of the mind.  His wife Victoria, once supportive, now is struggling to pay bills.  She urges her stubborn and older husband to return to the magic field where Diijon was considered one of the greats.  He refuses but does reluctantly agree to do a hypnotism nightclub act at Victoria's urging.  The act goes bad and he's laughed off the stage.  He's convinced this is the handiwork of Victoria's ex-lover Tony Holliday.   Later, Diijon finds that he does indeed have the power to control men's minds and begins to take revenge on the people he felt made him look like a fool.  He hypnotizes his young wife to kill the man.  Unfortunately for Diijon, things go horribly wrong.

The opening of the film features a memorable scene depicting a woman being beheaded, with a [[guillotine]]—then revealed to be a man.

==Cast==
* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Diijon
* [[Jeanne Bates]] as Victoria
* William Wright as Tony Holiday
* [[Denise Vernac]] as Denise
* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Sheffield
* Hope Landin as Mrs. McGaffey
* Mauritz Hugo as Danton

==Reception==
[[TV Guide]] rated it 1/4 stars and wrote, "Except for von Stroheim, the acting was barely adequate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-mask-of-diijon/review/105771/|title=The Mask Of Diijon|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''Horror Noir'', author Paul Meehan said the film "manages to transcend its humble origins primarily through the star power of von Stroheim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Horror Noir: Where Cinema's Dark Sisters Meet|last=Meehan|first=Paul|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|date=2010|isbn=9780786462193|pages=111–112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ADpBeeOK4EC&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Euro Truck Simulator''===
{{Main|Euro Truck Simulator}}
The first ''Euro Truck Simulator'' was released on 29 August 2008 for Microsoft Windows and OS X and the first European-developed truck simulation of the games. Players choose their starting country from [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] (versions 1.2 and 1.3 only).&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly |first=Andy |url=https://www.vice.com/read/i-played-a-truck-simulator-for-30-hours-389 |title=I Played a Truck Simulator Video Game for 30 Hours and Have Never Felt More at Peace |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Ben |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/feature/a562137/6-weird-simulator-games-from-london-underground-to-street-cleaning.html |title=6 weird Simulator games: From London Underground to street cleaning |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idigitaltimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Craft |first=Scott |url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-scandinavia-dlc-release-date-teaser-trailer-and-screenshots-430699 |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2: Scandinavia DLC Release Date, Teaser Trailer And Screenshots Released By SCS |publisher=IDigitalTimes.com |date=7 April 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409072702/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-scandinavia-dlc-release-date-teaser-trailer-and-screenshots-430699 |archivedate=9 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, players only have access to their starting country, except if it contains less than three cities, in which this case one or more adjacent countries will be accessible as well. For example, if a player starts the game in Italy or Switzerland, they get connection to the other for free. From there, players choose their first truck with a budget of €100,000.

After this, players can start taking jobs from various fictitious companies and delivering cargo to various cities in their starting country to earn money. This money can then be spent on a new truck, upgrading the current truck, expanding the business to other countries, and obtaining a license to drive flammables and chemicals.

The game features European truck models with working instruments such as flashing indicators, temperature and low fuel warning lights, wipers, and gauges. The trucks included are fictionalized variants of the [[Mercedes-Benz Actros]] (known as Majestic), the [[Renault Magnum]] (known as Runner), the [[Scania R-series]] (known as Swift), and the [[Volvo FH16]] (known as Valiant).

=== ''Euro Truck Simulator 2'' ===
{{Main|Euro Truck Simulator 2}}
The direct sequel to the ''Euro Truck Simulator'', ''Euro Truck Simulator 2'', was released on 19 October 2012 for Microsoft Windows and in 2013 for [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=SCS Software |url=http://blog.scssoft.com/2013/03/scania-tds-on-mac-app-store.html |title=SCS Software's blog: Scania TDS on Mac App Store |publisher=blog.scssoft.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 for the Mac |url=http://www.paulthetall.com/index_files/f95563f7cb8bd757bbec493268b18f15-1389.html |publisher=PaultheTall.com |accessdate=7 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908172255/http://www.paulthetall.com/index_files/f95563f7cb8bd757bbec493268b18f15-1389.html |archivedate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players choose their starting city from various locations in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]] (in the ''[[Euro Truck Simulator 2#Downloadable content.23Going East.21|Going East!]]'' extension), [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil |last=Savage |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-heads-east-for-its-first-dlc-expansion/ |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 heads east for its first DLC expansion |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=4 September 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamer-Scand"&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil |last=Savage |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-screenshots-show-upcoming-scandinavia-dlc/ |title=Euro Truck Simulator 2 screenshots show upcoming Scandinavia DLC |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=9 January 2015 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the player can only take what are known as quick jobs. These quick jobs involve the delivery of trailers and goods from one factory (garage) to another (usually involves delivery between different town and states). This quick jobs are offered by logistics and delivery companies in the game and all fuel, servicing, and highway toll fees and costs are paid by the employer (the delivery companies). Therefore, when doing quick jobs, no paying of tolls, fuel, and servicing fees are required. As the player earns money or takes out bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, which they can buy from truck dealers and truck showrooms (note that the truck dealers and showrooms must be 'discovered' first). With enough money, players can acquire a home garage, and start making more money by delivering cargo using their own truck instead of just being a driver for hire (freight market). Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring [[Non-player character|NPC]] drivers to take on deliveries (relevant employment agency must be 'discovered' first), buying more garages, and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and bus.

The player gains experience points after each delivery which increases the player's level, and a skill point is awarded after each level-up. Skill points can be used to unlock deliveries that require different [[ADR (treaty)|ADR]] classes, longer distance deliveries, special cargo loads, fragile cargo loads, urgent deliveries, and eco-driving. This progression allows the player to take on better-paying jobs.

The game features seventy-seven cities in thirteen countries, over twenty types of cargo, and over fifteen fictional European companies.

The game included two new truck companies, [[Scania AB|Scania]] and [[Renault Trucks]], with [[MAN Truck &amp; Bus|MAN]] returning from the [[German Truck Simulator|original game]]. [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], [[Iveco]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and [[Volvo Trucks|Volvo]] trucks were not officially licensed and had their names changed to DAV, Ivedo, Majestic, and Valiant, respectively. Later updates included the official license for DAF, Iveco, and Volvo, and the official branding for the [[DAF XF]], Volvo FH16, and [[Iveco Stralis]].&lt;ref name="DAF"&gt;{{cite web |title=DAF Trucks coming to Euro Truck Simulator 2! |url=http://blog.scssoft.com/2012/10/daf-trucks-coming-to-euro-truck.html |work=SCS Software's Blog |publisher=SCS Software |accessdate=25 January 2013 |date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volvo"&gt;{{cite web |title=A New ETS2 Patch Almost Here |url=http://blog.scssoft.com/2013/01/a-new-ets2-patch-almost-here.html |work=SCS Software's Blog |publisher=SCS Software |accessdate=25 January 2013 |date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013 [[SCS Software]] announced a downloadable content package called ''Going East!'', expanding the game map into [[Eastern Europe]]. The DLC saw the introduction of thirteen new cities across [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]], and a new country, [[Hungary]], and was released in September 2013. Unusually, Mercedes-Benz did not want their name to be in ''Euro Truck Simulator 2'',{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and are still referred to as "Majestic". The Mercedes-Benz license was added to the game with version 1.18.1.

=== ''American Truck Simulator'' ===
{{Main|American Truck Simulator}}
''American Truck Simulator'' takes place in North America, and will feature over 100 cities. The game features American-style [[conventional truck]]s, instead of the European [[cab over]] trucks found in the previous two games, and was released on 2 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/americantrucksimulator/announcements/detail/988906849502891396|title=American Truck Simulator Releasing Today|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the term "turkey" in the general sport of bowling|Strike (bowling)#Consecutive strikes}}
'''Turkey bowling''' is a [[sport]] which is based on ordinary [[bowling]]: a [[frozen foods|frozen]] [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] serves as a [[bowling ball]] and 10 plastic bottles of [[soft drink]]s or water are the [[bowling pin]]s. The turkey is bowled down a smooth surface, for example, ice or a soap covered sheet of painters plastic (using a bar of soap).&lt;ref name=men3-11-03&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/71/71914_protestors_cry_foul_at_turkey_bowling.html "Protestors cry foul at turkey bowling"], ''[[Manchester Evening News]],'' 3/11/2003&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated with [[Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losalamosnm.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B942433DE-4B1B-4DF9-826E-379B5E464E9A%7D&amp;DE=%7BCCD085E5-D37A-4AB7-AD20-F90412773255%7D]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/Public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=39856 "It's a Strike, a Spare. It's Turkey Bowling"], November 24, 2008 ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey bowling is popular in [[minor league]] [[ice hockey]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=men3-11-03/&gt;

The original variant involves turkey bowling in an aisle of a [[grocery store]]. A Derrick Johnson claims to have invented turkey bowling in 1988 when he worked as a grocery clerk at a [[Newport Beach]] [[Lucky's]] branch, while observing a manager slide a frozen turkey across the floor and accidentally topple a soda bottle.&lt;ref name=people&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118874,00.html "Derrick Johnson's Unique Bowling Style Is Pure Poultry in Motion"], ''[[People Magazine]],'' October 01, 1990 Vol. 34 No. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrick became a self-appointed [[commissioner]] of the "[[Poultry]] Bowlers Association" and codified the rules and terminology, such as "the [[fowl]] line" (cf. "[[Ten-pin bowling|foul line]]"), "the [[gobbler]]" (three strikes in a row; cf. [[turkey (bowling)]]), "the [[Butterball]]" (a gutterball) and "the [[Furcula|wishbone]]" (a [[7-10 split]]).&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

==Notable occurrences==
Turkey bowling was featured in the 1995 novel ''[[Bloodsucking Fiends]]: A Love Story''  by [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]], where it was the favorite sport of "The Animals", a wild group of night grocery stockers (continued in the sequels ''[[You Suck]]: A Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2007-01-22-you-suck-fangland_x.htm "'You Suck,' 'Fangland' take vampires in new directions"], a ''[[USA Today]]'' book review&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Bite Me: A Love Story|Bite Me]]'').

[[List of 10 Items or Less episodes|Episode 14]] of ''[[10 Items or Less (TV series)|10 Items or Less]]'' TV series was "Turkey Bowling".&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1307081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Guy's Grocery Games]]'' episode "Frozen Food Fight" featured a round where two contestants bowled a frozen turkey at nine soda bottles; the combined number knocked down was the number of non-frozen items each was allowed to use in their next dish.

Every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] morning, Cleveland's Fox affiliate [[WJW-TV]] does its annual Turkey Bowl from a [[Giant Eagle]] store in the Greater [[Cleveland, Ohio]] area. The WJW version of turkey bowling uses 15 cans of [[Canning|canned]] [[cranberry sauce]], [[cup stacking|stacked]] in a pyramid shape, and uses a one-bowl-per-round [[single-elimination tournament|knockout tournament]] format. In the 2010 edition it was hosted by morning features and man about town reporter Kenny Crumpton and morning meteorologist Angelica Campos. In WJW-TV's version people win prizes anything ranging from Giant Eagle Gift Cards to monetary prizes. The contest is broadcast on WJW live and streamed around the world on WJW's Web site, with the contests taking up the full closing segment (around 7 minutes) of each half-hour of WJW's [[Breakfast television|morning newscast]]. The broadcast began in 1999.

==Controversy==
[[Animal rights]] proponents, who oppose the use of animals in sports, claim that turkey bowling is disrespectful to animals and sends mixed messages which may encourage violence to animals or people.&lt;ref name=cjo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/111898/kan_turkeybowling.shtml |title=Group hopes to stuff turkey bowling |publisher=Cjonline.com |date=1998-11-18 |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another objection is perceived disrespect to the central attribute of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=cjo/&gt;    In 2003, an upcoming event for the title of [[UK]] Great Turkey Bowling Champion at [[Manchester Arena|Manchester Evening News Arena]] was protested against by animal rights campaigners; as a result, plastic turkeys were used instead of real frozen turkeys.&lt;ref name=men3-11-03/&gt; In 2007 an animal sanctuary rescued a live turkey, which was in a cage, from a turkey bowling event in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2007/11/22/regional%20news/19048960.txt |title=Norman the turkey will live past Thanksgiving, rescue group says |publisher=Dailyfreeman.com |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27248">'''Variety shows''', also known as '''variety arts''' or '''variety entertainment''', is entertainment made up of a variety of acts including [[musical theatre|musical]] performances, [[sketch comedy]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], and [[ventriloquism]]. It is normally introduced by a [[Master of Ceremonies|compère (master of ceremonies)]] or [[Television presenter|host]]. The variety format made its way from [[Victorian era]] stage to radio and then television. Variety shows were a staple of [[English language|anglophone]] television from the late 1940s into the 1980s.

While still widespread in some parts of the world, such as in the United Kingdom with the ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'', the proliferation of multichannel television and evolving viewer tastes have affected the popularity of variety shows in the United States. Despite this, their influence has still had a major effect on [[late night television]] whose [[late night talk show]]s and [[NBC]]'s variety series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (which originally premiered in 1975) have remained popular fixtures of North American television.

==History==

===Stage and radio===
[[File:London 2745.JPG|thumb|right|First performed in 1912, the ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' was first held at the [[London Palladium]] (''pictured'') in 1941. Performed infront of members of the Royal Family, many [[List of Royal Variety Performances|famous acts have performed]] over the century.]]
The live entertainment style known as [[music hall]] in the United Kingdom and [[vaudeville]] in the United States can be considered a direct predecessor of the "variety show" format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1513870/Television-in-the-United-States/283603/Variety-shows?anchor=ref1053883 "Television in the United States". ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 2011. Web. 06 Jun. 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; Variety in the UK evolved in theatres and music halls, and later in [[Working men's club|Working Men's Clubs]]. British performers who honed their skills in music hall sketches include [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Stan Laurel]], [[George Formby]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Dan Leno]], [[Gertrude Lawrence]] and [[Marie Lloyd]].&lt;ref name="McCabe"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=John|title=The Comedy World of Stan Laurel|date=2004|publisher=Robson|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the early top performers on [[British television]] and radio did an apprenticeship either in stage variety, or during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] in [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA). In the UK, the ultimate accolade for a variety artist for decades was to be asked to do the annual [[Royal Command Performance]] at the [[London Palladium]] theatre, in front of the monarch. Later known as the ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' (from 1919), it continues today. In the 1940s, Stan Laurel revisited his music hall days when he performed at the ''Royal Variety'' show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949 "Stan at Queen's first Royal Variety Show"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201221344/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949 |date=1 February 2014 }}. ''North West Evening Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, former vaudeville performers such as the [[Marx Brothers]], [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], [[W.&amp;nbsp;C. Fields]], and [[Jack Benny]] honed their skills in the [[Borscht Belt]] before moving to [[talkies]], to [[radio]] shows, and then to [[television]] shows, including variety shows.

===1931-1960===
Variety shows were among the first programs to be featured on television during the experimental [[mechanical television]] era. Variety shows hosted by [[Helen Haynes]] and [[Harriet Lee (TV series)|Harriet Lee]] are recorded in contemporary newspapers in 1931 and 1932; because of technical limits of the era, no recordings of either show have been preserved. The genre proliferated during the [[Golden Age of Television]], generally considered to be roughly 1948 to 1960. Many of these Golden Age variety shows were spinoffs of previous radio variety shows.

From 1948 to 1971, ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' was one of [[CBS]]'s most popular television series. Using his no-nonsense approach, host [[Ed Sullivan]] was instrumental in bringing many acts to prominence in the United States, including [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]]. ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' (1955-1982) would go on to become one of U.S. television's longest-running variety shows; based on the concept of the [[big band remote]] from the old-time radio era, it was already one of the last shows of its kind when it debuted and far outlasted all other big-band centered broadcast series by the end of its run.

Other long-running American variety shows that premiered during this time include ''[[Texaco Star Theatre]]'' (1948-1956), ''Cavalcade of Stars'', later titled ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' (1949-1955), ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' (1950-1967, in various incarnations), ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' (1950-1955), ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' (1950-1954), ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' (1951-1971), ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]'' (1951-1957), ''[[The George Gobel Show]]'' (1954-1960) and ''[[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]'' (1956-1963). [[Perry Como]] also hosted a series of variety shows that collectively ran from 1948 to 1969, followed by variety specials that ran until 1994.

Shorter-lived variety shows during this period include ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (1950 TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' (1950-1952), ''[[The Jimmy Durante Show]]'' (1954-1956) and a different ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (1957 TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' (1957-1958).

In the UK, ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''—which ran from 1953 to 1983—featured modern artists performing dressed in late [[Victorian era|Victorian]]/Early [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] costume, either doing their own act or performing as a music hall artist of that period. The audience was also encouraged to dress in period costume in a similar fashion. Other long-running British variety shows that originated in the 1950s include ''[[Tonight at the London Palladium]]'' (1955-1969), ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]'' (1958-1978), ''[[The White Heather Club]]'' (1958-1968) and ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' (an annual event televised since the 1950s).

===1960s===
Popular American variety shows that began in the 60s include a revival of ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' (1960-1970), ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' (1962-1971), ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]'' (1963-1967), ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'' (1964-1970), ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (1965-1974), ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967-1978) and ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' (1967-1969). 1969 saw a flurry of new variety shows with rural appeal: ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'' (1969-1971), ''[[The Jim Nabors Hour]]'' (1969-1971), ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'' (1969-1972) and ''[[Hee Haw]]'' (1969-1992).

Entertainers with less successful variety shows in the 1960s include [[Judy Garland]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]]

===1970s===
In 1970 and 1971, the American TV networks, CBS especially, conducted the so-called "[[rural purge]]", in which shows that appealed to more rural and older audiences were cancelled as part of a greater focus on appealing to wealthier demographics. Many variety shows, including long-running ones, were cancelled as part of this "purge," with a few shows (such as ''Hee Haw'' and ''The Lawrence Welk Show'') surviving and moving into first-run [[broadcast syndication|syndication]]. Variety shows continued to be produced in the 1970s, with most of them stripped down to only music and comedy.

Popular variety shows that ran in the 1970s include ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'' (1970-1974), ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'' (1971-1976, in various incarnations), ''The [[Bobby Goldsboro]] Show'' (1973-1975), ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' (1973-1981), ''[[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]'' (1973-1981), ''[[The Mac Davis Show]]'' (1974-1976), ''[[Tony Orlando and Dawn (TV series)|Tony Orlando and Dawn]]'' (1974-1976), ''[[Donny &amp; Marie (1976 TV series)|Donny &amp; Marie]]'' (1976-1979) and ''[[Sha Na Na (TV series)|Sha Na Na]]'' (1977-1981).

Entertainers with weekly variety shows that ran for one season or less in the 1970s include [[Captain &amp; Tennille]], [[The Jacksons]], [[The Keane Brothers]], [[Bobby Darin]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Shields and Yarnell]], [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[Starland Vocal Band]], and the cast of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.

Entertainers with variety-based TV specials in the 70s include [[The Carpenters]], [[John Denver]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Diana Ross]].

By the late 1970s, nearly every variety show had ended production, in part because of audience burnout;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Bill (May 12, 2014). [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/business/media/overextended-music-tv-shows-fade.html?_r=0 Overextended, Music TV Shows Fade]. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved May 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the highest-rated variety show of 1975, ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]'', was only the 22nd-most watched show of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=1463}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===1980s-present===
{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}

By the early 1980s, the few new variety shows being produced were of remarkably poor quality (see, for instance, the infamous ''[[Pink Lady and Jeff]]''), hastening the format's demise. Since ''Pink Lady'', only a few traditional variety shows have been attempted by major networks: these include ''[[Dolly (TV series)|Dolly]]'' (starring [[Dolly Parton]]), which ran for 23 episodes on the ABC during the 1987–'88 season; a revival of ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' from 1988 to 1989; a revival of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', which was broadcast by CBS for nine episodes in 1991; and the first incarnation of ''[[The Wayne Brady Show]]'', which was telecast by ABC in August 2001.

By the 21st century, the variety show format had fallen out of fashion, due largely to changing tastes and the fracturing of media audiences (caused by the proliferation of cable and satellite television) that makes a multiple-genre variety show impractical. Even reruns of variety shows have generally not been particularly widespread; [[TV Land]] telecasted briefly some variety shows (namely ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'') upon its beginning in 1996, but within a few years, reruns of most of those shows (with the notable exception of ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]'') stopped. Similarly, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] held the rights to ''[[Hee Haw]]'' but telecast very few episodes, opting mainly to hold rights to allow them to air performance videos from the show in its video blocks. The current rights holder of ''Hee Haw'', [[RFD-TV]], has been more prominent in its telecasts of the show; RFD-TV also airs numerous other [[country music|country]]-style variety shows from the 1960s and 1970s up through the present day, in a rarity for modern television. Another notable exception is ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', which has been telecast continually in reruns on the [[Public Broadcasting System]] (PBS) since 1986. ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]'' returned to television in 2017 with reruns on [[Jewish Life Television]] (and, in the case of a one-off Christmas special, the Christian-leaning network [[INSP (TV channel)|INSP]]); JLTV also carries other classic comedy/variety series by Jewish comics in its schedule. Digital multicast network [[getTV]] shows variety shows on an irregular basis. The Spanish language variety show ''[[Sabado Gigante]]'', which began in 1962, and then moved from [[Chile]] to the United States in 1986, continued to produce and broadcast new episodes on [[Univision]] until its cancellation in September 2015.

At least one national variety show continues on national radio: ''[[Live from Here]]'', a musical variety series hosted by [[Chris Thile]]. It has followed three formats over the course of its history, the first and longest being that of ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''; founding host [[Garrison Keillor]] created the series in 1974 as an homage to rural radio variety shows, featuring sketch comedy based on [[radio drama]]s of the [[old-time radio]] era, complete with faux commercials. (The other format, ''The American Radio Company of the Air'', also hosted and created by Keillor, was set in a more urban environment and likewise was based on old-time radio; its short run in the late 1980s eventually morphed into a revival of ''A Prairie Home Companion''). ''Live from Here'', which was established in its current format in 2016 and took on its name a year later after losing the rights to the ''A Prairie Home Companion'' name, focuses mainly on musical acts.

Fox's ''[[Osbournes Reloaded]]'', a variety show featuring the family of rocker [[Ozzy Osbourne]], was canceled after only one episode had been telecast in 2009. More than two dozen affiliates refused to telecast the first episode of the show. This series had been slated for a six-episode run.

NBC has made repeated attempts at reviving the variety format since the late 2000s (its last successful series in this genre, ''[[Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters]]'', left the network's schedule in 1982) . A pilot episode for ''[[Rosie Live]]'' was telecast the day before [[Thanksgiving Day]] in 2008 and, after receiving middling ratings and extremely poor reviews, was not picked up for its originally planned run in January 2009. In May 2014, NBC aired ''The Maya Rudolph Show'', a variety show starring ''SNL'' performer [[Maya Rudolph]]. Like ''Rosie Live'', the broadcast was intended to be a one-off special, but with the possibility of additional episodes depending on its performance.&lt;ref name=guardian-rudolph&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya Rudolph is reviving the variety show – but is there still a place for it?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/may/19/maya-rudolph-variety-show-nbc-revival-success|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/can-maya-rudolph-and-nbc-revive-tvs-variety-show-1201184248/ "Forget Donny &amp; Marie.

===Christmas and other variety specials===
{{see|List of United States Christmas television specials#Celebrity-hosted and variety shows}}

Starting in the 1950s, some entertainers became associated with variety [[television special]]s that would reoccur on a regular basis, in some cases for decades. Such entertainers included [[Bob Hope]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Perry Como]], [[Andy Williams]] and [[Mitzi Gaynor]]. Many of these were [[Christmas]] variety specials, which often showed the star in a set meant to look like their home, welcoming singers and other guests to perform duets of [[Christmas song]]s. The popularity of these Christmas shows outlasted that of weekly variety shows. In 1973, for example, even as variety shows were starting to fade in popularity, variety Christmas specials hosted by Williams and Como both attracted an enormous 40% of the American television audience.&lt;ref name="out of season"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Christmas variety TV special is out of season |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/24/entertainment/la-et-1224-holiday-special-tv-20111224 |date=December 24, 2011 |authors=Scott Collins and Joe Flint |publisher=''Los Angeles Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas variety specials' popularity continued into the 1990s, before starting to wane in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="out of season" /&gt; Nevertheless, the tradition has continued. Entertainers who have hosted Christmas variety specials in the 21st century include [[Kid Rock]], [[Nick Lachey]] and [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Michael Buble]], [[Bill Murray]] and [[Gwen Stefani]].

===Talk shows===
Though the format faded in popularity in prime time, it thrived in [[late night television|late night]]. Night-time variety shows eventually evolved into [[late-night talk show]]s, which combine variety entertainment (primarily comedy and live music) with the aspects of a [[talk show]] (such as interviews with celebrities). The [[Emmy Awards]] academy considers the two genres to be related closely enough that, until 2015, the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series]] was open to any of these types of show; in 2015, the academy separated late-night talk shows and sketch comedy series into separate categories.

During [[Johnny Carson]]'s tenure on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on NBC from 1962 to 1992, the show dominated late night ratings, and the other networks attempted late-night talk shows only sporadically. This changed with Carson's retirement, and other networks began to air their own talk show competitors, starting with ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on CBS in 1993. As of 2014, late-night talk shows vary widely on their resemblance to the original variety format, with [[Jimmy Fallon]]'s incarnation of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|The Tonight Show]]'' putting heavy emphasis on sketches and stunts, while shows such as ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' put more emphasis on desk chat.

''[[The Richard Bey Show]]'' combined the variety show with the [[tabloid talk show]], not only having its guests talk about their problems but also having them participate in absurdist games, and ''[[Sally (1983 TV series)|Sally Jesse Raphael]]'' was known for occasionally having music and fashion in the show, especially [[drag queen|drag]] and gender-bending performances.

===Sketch comedy shows===
[[Sketch comedy]] series such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[In Living Color]]'', ''[[Almost Live!]]'' (and its successor ''[[Up Late NW]]''), ''[[MADtv]]'', and ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' also contain variety show elements, particularly musical performances and comedy sketches. The most obvious difference between shows such as ''Saturday Night Live'' and traditional variety shows is the lack of a single lead host (or hosts) and a large [[ensemble cast]]. ''SNL'' has used different guest hosts ever since its inception.

===Talent shows===
Televised [[talent show]]s have a variety show element, in that they feature a variety of different acts. Examples of talent shows that feature entertainers from a broad variety of disciplines include ''[[Star Search]]'', which had a run in the 1980s in syndication and a run on [[CBS]] in the early 2000s during the reality television boom; ''[[The Gong Show]]'', which reached its peak in the 1970s but has had occasional revivals since then; and the worldwide ''[[Got Talent]]'' franchise.

===Telethons===
The variety show format also continued in the form of the [[telethon]], which feature variety entertainment (often music) interspersed with appeals for viewers to make donations to support a charity or cause. The ''[[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]]'' was one of the best known telethons in the US, but it too was eventually canceled after several years of shortening (originally over 21 hours, by the time of its last telecast in 2014, by which point Lewis had been gone from the telethon several years, it was down to two hours). Another popular telethon, for [[United Cerebral Palsy]], ended its run in 1998 shortly after the death of its founder and figurehead, [[Dennis James]]. Likewise, only a handful of long-established local telethons remain.

==Other countries or regions==
===Australia===
The prime time variety show format was popular in the early decades of Australian television, spawning such series as ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'', ''[[The Graham Kennedy Show]]'', ''The Don Lane Show'', and ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'', which ran for 27 years. Recent prime time variety shows include the short lived ''[[Micallef Tonight]]'' and ''[[The Sideshow]]''.

===Taiwan===
Another of today's variety shows in Asia is [[Taiwan]]'s ''[[Guess (variety show)]]'' and ''[[100% Entertainment]]''. East Asian variety programs are known for its constant use of sound effects, on-screen visuals and comedic bantering. Many of the shows are presented in a live-like presentation in a fast-paced setting, with scenes repeating or fast forwarded.

Another popular variety show in Taiwan is [[Kangxi Lai Le]], a talk show with variety show elements. The hosts and guests were associated with variety shows. Famous for its bantering, which was written before tapings.

===Hong Kong===
The first Chinese variety show to become a major success was Hong Kong's ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', which first aired in 1967 and ran for 27 years. In Hong Kong, variety shows are often combined with elements of a cooking show or a talent competition but end in various results.

===Japan===
{{Main|Japanese variety show}}
Variety programming has remained one of the dominant genres of television programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gerow | first = Aaron | contribution = Kind Participation: Postmodern Consumption and Capital with Japan's Telop TV | year = 2010 | title =  Television, Japan, and Globalization | editor-last = Yoshimoto | editor-first = Mitsuhiro | volume = | pages = 117–150 | place = Ann Arbor| publisher = Center for Japanese Studies, University of Michigan | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Japanese variety shows are famous abroad for their wild stunts, they vary from talk shows to music shows, from tabloid news shows to skit comedy. The prominent use of [[telop]] on screen has created a style that has influenced variety programming across Asia. One of the most popular variety shows in Japan includes ''[[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Downtown no Gaki No Tsukai]]''.

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], the hugely popular show ''[[Infinite Challenge]]'', has been broadcast by [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] from 2005 to 2018, was a new model of this, called "Real Variety Show". It combined comedy and variety scenes including unscripted stunts. Although many variety shows have existed in Korea long before the broadcast of ''Infinite Challenge'', this program has given a rise to a new page in the history of Korean variety shows by introducing unscripted stunts. As a result, other broadcasting channels such as [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] and [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]] have followed its path and introduced programs such as ''[[2 Days &amp; 1 Night]]'' and ''[[Running Man (TV series)|Running Man]]''. These types of Korean variety shows are grabbing foreign interest of countries such as Japan, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and even the United States bringing on a new type of the Korean wave globally.

===Philippines===
Variety shows are a huge part of daily life in the Philippines, with all of the major networks running their own variety shows usually during lunchtime and can be on the air for between one and a half hours to three hours. The most notable Philippine variety show is the longest-running ''[[Eat Bulaga]]'', which premiered in 1979 and has aired on [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[ABS-CBN]], and [[GMA Network]] in the succeeding years. Recently many other TV networks are different formats of variety. [[It's Showtime (variety show)|''It's Showtime'']] has shown great popularity and interest to Filipino viewers.

===Mexico===
''[[Siempre en Domingo]]'' premiered in 1969 with [[Raúl Velasco]] hosting.  It became Mexico's longest-running variety series, remaining on [[Televisa]] until 1998.  Other long-running variety shows, most of which have been Televisa productions, have included ''[[La Carabina de Ambrosio]]'', ''[[Anabel Ferreira|Anabel]]'', ''Al Fin de Semana'', ''[[Silvia Pinal|Silvia]] y [[Enrique Guzmán|Enrique]]'', ''La Parodia'', ''Muevete'', ''Desmadruga2'', and ''Sabadazo.''.  Most, if not all, of Televisa's variety shows have aired in other countries, including the Univision networks in the United States.

===Venezuela===
In [[Venezuela]], the best known variety show is ''[[Súper Sábado Sensacional]]''. Originally established in 1968 (as ''Sábado Espectacular'') on [[Radio Caracas Television]], the show moved to [[Venevision]] in 1970 and was renamed ''Sábado Sensacional''. In 1990, "Súper" was added to the title, and is how the show is currently known today.

===Chile===
The [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] variety show known as ''[[Sábado Gigante|Sábados Gigantes]]'' (forerunner of the U.S. ''Sábado Gigante'') began in 1962 with [[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]] and lasted into the 1990s. His daughter, Vivianne Kreutzberger, currently hosts the program under the title ''Gigantes con Vivi'', while Don Francisco has hosted the U.S. version since April 12, 1986 until the end of the show's run on September 19, 2015.

Ski tournaments take place every winter in [[Gulmarg]], [[Kashmir]] and [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]]. Winter sports are generally more common in the northern states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, [[Uttarakhand]] (formerly Uttaranchal), Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. [[Skiing]], snow rugby, snow cycling and snow football are few of the common sports played in India. Skiing is more popular although India has taken part in Luge in [[Winter Olympics]] since 1998.

[[Category:Sport in India]]
[[Category:Winter sports in India|*]] Ski-mountaineering is another form of skiing, usually conducted in remote areas. It is sort of wilderness skiing. It is also called back country skiing. It was introduced in Kashmir in 1979 when two local skiers Muhammad Yusuf and Mehraj Din undertook a ski - touring expedition to Lidder Valley.
