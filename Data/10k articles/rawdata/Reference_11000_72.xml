[[File:Atrio del philadelphia museum of art.JPG|thumb|200px|''International Mobile'' (1949), by Alexander Calder, Philadelphia Museum of Art]]
'''3rd Sculpture International''' was a 1949 exhibition of contemporary sculpture held inside and outside the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], USA. It featured works by 250 sculptors from around the world, and ran from May 15 to September 11, 1949. The exhibition was organized by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the [[Association for Public Art]]) under the terms of a bequest made to the Association by the late Ellen Phillips Samuel.

Ellen Phillips Samuel was a member of the Fairmount Park Art Association and a supporter of many cultural activities in Philadelphia. When she died in 1913, she left the bulk of her estate in trust to the Art Association, specifying that the income be used to create a series of sculptural monuments “emblematic of the history of America.” When these funds became available upon the death of her husband in 1929, the Art Association appointed a planning committee, which decided that the Samuel Memorial should express major ideas and spiritual forces as well as chronological developments in American history.

To identify sculptors, the committee organized three international exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. These Sculpture Internationals, in 1933, 1940, and 1949, brought together the works of hundreds of sculptors from the United States and abroad. The exhibitions contributed not only to the Samuel Memorial but also to the general awareness of contemporary sculpture throughout the Philadelphia area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen Phillips Samuel Memorial|url=http://www.associationforpublicart.org/artwork/ellen-phillips-samuel-memorial/|website=associationforpublicart.org|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The photograph==
The June 20, 1949, issue of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] featured the photograph "[[70 Sculptors]]" by Herbert Gehr. It showed 70 of the sculptors seated on the staircase of the museum's Great Hall and surrounded by a number of their works. Gehr took the photograph on May 14, 1949, the day before the exhibition's opening. An intensive search has been underway since 2002 to identify all 70 sculptors in the photograph.

'''''Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus''''' was a monumental work by [[Olaus Magnus]] on the [[Nordic countries]], printed in Rome 1555.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O9lEAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Olaus%20Magnus%22&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus, Rome, 1555] (available free at Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; It was a work which long remained for the rest of Europe the authority on Swedish matters. Its popularity increased by the numerous woodcuts of people and their customs, amazing the rest of Europe. It is still today a valuable repertory of much curious information in regard to Scandinavian customs and folklore.

It was translated into Italian (1565), German (1567), English (1658) and Dutch (1665). Abridgments of the work appeared also at Antwerp (1558 and 1562), Paris (1561), Basel (1567), Amsterdam (1586), Frankfurt (1618) and Leiden (1652).

[[Image:Auchinleck Manuscript - Reinbroun.jpg|thumb|250px|An illustration from the Auchinleck manuscript.]]

The '''Auchinleck Manuscript''', NLS Adv. MS 19.2.1, currently forms part of the collection of the [[National Library of Scotland]]. It is an [[illuminated manuscript]] copied on [[parchment]] in the 14th century in London.  The manuscript provides a glimpse of a time of political tension and social change in England.  The English were continuing to reclaim their language and national identity, and to distance themselves from the [[Normans|Norman]] conquerors who had taken over the country after the [[Battle of Hastings]] 300 years before.

==History of possession==
[[Image:LordAuchinleck.jpg|thumb|150.px|Lord Auchinleck, who discovered the manuscript, and after whom it is named.]]
The manuscript is named after [[Alexander Boswell (judge)|Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck]], who was a lawyer and supreme court judge in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland.  Lord Auchinleck lived from 1706 to 1782, and was the father of [[James Boswell]] who wrote The ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]''.  It is not known how Lord Auchinleck came to possess the manuscript, but it is believed he acquired it in 1740 and gave the book to the [[Advocates Library]] in Edinburgh in 1744.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/history.html "History and Owners"]}} It is a mystery who owned the book in the four hundred years from the time it was completed to when Lord Auchinleck first laid hands on it, but there are clues within.  On some of the pages are names that have been added in, which are presumed to be previous owners and their family members.  One of the [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the manuscript is a list of Norman aristocracy, now assumed to be a version of the [[Battle Abbey Roll]], and at the end of this list has been entered, in a different hand, the list of members from a family named Browne.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=107r Auchinleck MS f. 107rd]}} Also sprinkled throughout the text, others have entered their names individually for posterity, such as Christian Gunter{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=205r Auchinleck MS f. 205ra]}} and John Harreis.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/view/?jp2=247r Auchinleck MS f. 247ra]}} These names have never been researched against church or town records.{{sfn|Burnley|Wiggins|2003|loc=[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/editorial/history.html "History and Owners"]}}

==Production==
[[Image:Auchinleck MS f.34r.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from the manuscript.]]
Auchinleck is believed to have been produced in London around 1340, by professional [[scribe]]s, who were [[layman|laymen]], not monks as was usually the case. The number of scribes involved in the production is a source of debate with scholars of [[Middle English]]. The controversy involves not only the number of scribes who actually wrote the text out, but if they, in fact, only copied the work from the [[exemplar (manuscript)|exemplar]], the original, or translated the works from French or [[Latin]], inadvertently into their own Middle English dialects.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=11}}

Through the use of [[palaeography]], or the study of ancient handwriting, it has been determined that there had to be at least four, perhaps five, different scribes.  Some scholars have argued that there were six scribes, yet most agree that the majority of the manuscript is in the hand of one man, who it is believed translated most of the literature.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=10}} With this knowledge, when one looks at the photographs of the manuscript found on the website of the [[National Library of Scotland]], it is easy to see the discrepancies in the actual handwriting of the scribes.  Some is tight and regimented, attributed to Scribe 1, while some more loose, as if the scribe did not make the correct adjustments for space and repeatedly ran out of room at the ends of the lines.  While this makes for fun visual entertainment when looking at the [[Folio (printing)|folio]]s, or pages, the historical importance is that it gives clues into how the book might have been produced in a time when the commerce of making books for private clients in a secular bookshop began to flourish.{{sfn|Hanna|2005|p=76}}

==Language==
The Auchinleck, in its present state, consists of forty-three pieces of literature.  All of these works are in [[Middle English]] but the language used has been determined to be several differing dialects that would have been used in different parts of England.{{sfn|Sisam|1955|p=265}} These dialects further serve to determine the origins of the scribes, such as London as opposed to south-west [[English Midlands|Midlands]], as they would have written the language in the manner they spoke as well as the spelling they were taught, which furthers the question of translation.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=12}}

Since the language is consistent within each text, it is surmised the scribes worked independently on each whole story as opposed to the manner more commonly used in monasteries in which the monks would copy text directly from the exemplars, only one page at a time, with a [[catchword]] inscribed at the bottom corner for later collation. Although there are catchwords in the manuscript, each scribe would have been responsible for all of the pages of each of his assignments. This newer method of production suggests that one production manager was responsible for contracting the work, gave each scribe assignments that included whole stories, while overseeing the project, and being the contact person to the client if the book was indeed [[bespoke]], or special order.{{sfn|Wiggins|2004|p=12}}

Also of significance is that the Auchinleck manuscript is the first known anthology of English literature, particularly the largest collection of English romances up until that time.  Previously the use of Latin or French had been almost exclusive in books, but English was beginning to be an acceptable language for [[pamphlet]]s and literature.{{sfn|Loomis|1962|p=15}} It was during this time that the English were beginning to shift away from French and to form a separate identity, socially and politically, so it would follow that the use of "Inglisch", as it is referred to in the manuscript, in the written word would be a source of national unification.{{sfn|Calkin|2005|p=8}}

==Illumination==
[[Image:NLS Adv MS 19.2.1 Auchinleck Manuscript 176r.jpg|thumb|200px]]
The Auchinleck manuscript was [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]], although not as ornately as the religious books of the era, such as [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]]. Unfortunately, many of the miniatures in the manuscript have been lost to thieves or people peddling the images for profit. The four remaining miniatures and the [[Historiated initial|historiated]] letters suggest it was beautifully, yet modestly, decorated at one time. It has been determined through comparing artistic styles that the illustration was done by a handful of artists who illuminated other manuscripts commercially produced in the London area. This points to a group of illuminators, who it is believed collaborated on other works that have been preserved from the Middle Ages, who have been studied independently, and whose work is now being seen in a new light as a collective community.{{sfn|Hanna|2005|p=80}}

==Assessment==
The Auchinleck manuscript is not well known outside of scholarly circles, yet it is one of the most important English documents surviving from the Middle Ages. Within its folios, it tracks not only the literature of the period, reflecting the tastes of readers in [[Chaucer]]'s time and how its subjects were increasingly diverging from religious topics, but also the development of a language as part of a national self-image.{{sfn|Sisam|1955|p=x}} It speaks to us of the independence of spirit with which the English people wanted to identify themselves as separate from their French cousins by claiming their own language in a fundamental expression, in their literature.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed, there are multiple interpretations of the Auchinleck MSS and this is but one of them|date=March 2013}} As such, the manuscript is important in scholarship of the medieval romances, of London codicology (manuscript studies), of dialect and linguistic studies, and for the possibility (though unproven) that Chaucer himself may have had personal use of Auchinleck, based on claimed correspondences to his writings.

==Contents==

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry in the museum.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] in its museum in [[Bayeux]], [[France]].]]

The '''Bayeux Tapestry tituli''' are captions embroidered on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] describing events leading up to the [[Norman conquest of England]] concerning [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The ''[[tituli]]'' are in [[Medieval Latin]].

==Description==

[[File:Bayeux tapestry stitches detail..jpg|thumb|Detail of embroidered lettering]]

The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by William the Conqueror's half-brother, [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop Odo]], possibly at the same time as [[Bayeux Cathedral]]'s construction in the 1070s, and completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.&lt;ref name=stenton&gt;[[#Stenton|Stenton (1961)]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is embroidered in [[wool]] [[yarn]] on a [[plain weave|tabby-woven]] [[linen]] ground using [[backstitch|outline or stem stitch]] for detailing and lettering.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coatsworth|Coatsworth (2005)]], p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A dark blue wool, almost black, is used for most of the tapestry's lettering but towards the end other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The content of the hanging is primarily pictorial but ''tituli'' are included on many scenes of the action to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.&lt;ref name=musset&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The text is in Latin (which for the most part is grammatically correct), and is extremely direct, with each statement being closely tied to the scenes depicted in a given section.&lt;ref name=musset35/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is frequently abbreviated as indicated by [[tilde]]s placed over words at the place of omission of a letter. The words themselves are often demarcated by two points (which Lucien Musset likens to colons); sometimes, more important section breaks are demarcated by three points. Many personal names, mostly in English, are not Latinised and the same applies for names of places in England and for Beaurain "Belrem" in France. In places the spelling shows an English influence, such as the phrase "at Hestenga ceasrta", which in proper Latin would be "ad Hastingae castra").&lt;ref name=musset35&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French names are either archaic ("Rednes") or anglicised ("Bagias").&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], pp. 35{{en dash}}6.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes "Franci" is used to describe the Normans who at that time certainly did not regard themselves as French.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mussetb|Musset (2011)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final ''titulus'' "Et fuga verterunt Angli" is said by Lucien Musset to be "entirely spurious", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.&lt;ref name=spurious2/&gt; The first word on the tapestry "Edward" is also a restoration.&lt;ref name=spurious1/&gt;

==Latin text with English translation==

The English translation provided here is of a literal nature, to reflect the simplicity of the captions themselves. The numbering scheme uses the scene numbers on the tapestry's backing cloth, which were added sometime around 1800.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

Perhaps the dovecot and the doves in the upper border have an erotic significance, and the whole episode may possibly refer to some scandal, then notorious, but now advantageously forgotten".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Douglas|Douglas (1961)]], p. 234, plate XVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Theories on the woman and her relationship with the cleric abound, ranging from being an embroidress to receiving anger, lewdness or affection on part of the clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2014/08/aelfgyva-mysterious-lady-bayeux-tapestry/|title=Aelfgyva: The Mysterious Lady of the Bayeux Tapestry|date=August 24, 2014|work=Medievalists.net|access-date=April 12, 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413074101/http://www.medievalists.net/2014/08/aelfgyva-mysterious-lady-bayeux-tapestry/|archivedate=April 13, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}|| [[File:BayeuxTapestryScene15.jpg|200px]]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[:File:Aelfgyva.jpg|Higher resolution detail]]&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7016">[[File:Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US (August 2001).pdf|thumb|The briefing]] 
'''Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US''' was the [[President's Daily Brief]] prepared by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and given to U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] on Monday, August 6, 2001.  The brief warned, 36 days before the [[September 11 attacks]], of [[terrorism]] threats from [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al-Qaeda]], including "patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]" of US [[aircraft]].&lt;ref name="Blanton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanton|first=Thomas S. |date=2004-04-12|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/index.htm|title=The President's Daily Brief|publisher=''[[National Security Archive]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== President's Daily Brief (2001) ==
The President's Daily Brief (PDB) is a brief of important [[classified information]] on [[national security]] collected by various [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence agencies]] given to the president and a select group of senior officials.  On August 6, 2001, the Central Intelligence Agency delivered a President's Daily Brief to President Bush, who was vacationing at [[Prairie Chapel Ranch|his ranch]] in [[Crawford, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=DIpEwGmSsmM|title="Condoleezza Rice asserts 'Bin Laden Determined To Attack' wasn't a warning. sickhorses.com"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bush's reaction ==
President Bush did not appear to take particular interest in what he had been told, telling his CIA briefer: "All right. You've covered your ass, now."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Suskind]], "The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11," (New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2006), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leak (2002) ==
The existence of the memo was secret until it was leaked in 2002.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Paul|year=2004|title=[[The Terror Timeline]]|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-078338-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' reported on the document on May 15.&lt;ref name="Blanton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=KIz_4D5vli0|title="911 Foreknowledge - Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''9/11 Commission Report'' (2004) ==
The PDB was declassified and approved for release to the [[9/11 Commission]] on April 10, 2004, and reported in the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]'' on July 22, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|authorlink=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|year=2004|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/fullreport.pdf|chapter=The System was Blinking Red|title=The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]|isbn=0-16-072304-3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423032225/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/fullreport.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Security Archive]],  President Bush was the first sitting president to release a PDB to the public.&lt;ref name="Blanton"/&gt;

== Analysis ==
In an attempt to excuse the Administration's failure to act in any way on the contents of the brief, Bush-appointed U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] and General [[Richard Myers]] have claimed that contrary to repeated statements,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, {{cite news|last=Jehl|first=Douglas|date=2004-04-11|title=A Warning, but Clear? White House Tries to Make the Point That New Details Add Up to Old News|publisher=''The New York Times''|page=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CIA's PDB did not warn the President of a specific new threat but "contained historical information based on old reporting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Myers|year=2009|title=Eyes on the Horizon: Serving on the Front Lines of National Security|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1-4165-6031-9|page=186}}  See: {{cite book|last=Felix|first=Antonia|year=2005|title=Condi: The Condoleezza Rice Story|publisher=Newmarket Press|isbn=1-55704-675-1|pages=228–229}} According to Felix, at the 9/11 Commission, "Condi stressed that the administration did not anticipate any strikes within the country, but was focused on terrorist activities in other parts of the world.  Commission member Richard Ben-Veniste brought the subject back to the memo, however, to point out that its very title pointed to a domestic attack."  &lt;blockquote&gt;BEN-VENISTE: Isn't it a fact, Dr. Rice, that the Aug. 6 P.D.B. warned against possible attacks in this country? [...]&lt;br&gt; RICE: You said did it not warn of attacks.  It did not warn of attacks inside the United States.  It was historical information based on old reporting.  There was no new threat information.  And it did not, in fact, warn of any coming attacks inside the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush later claimed that if he had "had any inkling whatsoever that the people were going to fly airplanes into buildings we would have moved heaven and earth to save the country."&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, 14 Apr. 2004, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/14/politics/transcript-of-bushs-remarks-on-iraq-we-will-finish-the-work-of-the.html Transcript of Bush's Remarks on Iraq: 'We Will Finish the Work of the Fallen']"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) conducted a training exercise in the two years prior to September 11, 2001, in which it simulated a civilian airliner being hijacked and used as a missile to crash into buildings in the United States, including the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001) | World Trade Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[[USA Today]], 18 Apr. 2004, "[https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-04-18-norad_x.htm NORAD Had Drills of Jets as Weapons]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[CNN]], 19 Apr. 2004, "[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/04/19/norad.exercise/ NORAD Exercise Had Jet Crashing into Building]"&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense had conducted exercises rehearsing a plane crashing into the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press International]], [[The Washington Times]], 22 Apr. 2002, "DOD Rehearsed Plane Hitting Pentagon," archived at: http://web.archive.org/web/20050211062128/http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/20040422-090447-8354r.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Reconnaissance Office]] had scheduled an exercise for September 11, 2001 simulating the crash of a jet into one of its own buildings in northern [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], Boston, "[http://archive.boston.com/news/packages/sept11/anniversary/wire_stories/0903_plane_exercise.htm Agency planned exercise on Sept. 11 built around a plane crashing into a building]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Chronica Gallica of 452''''', also called the '''''Gallic Chronicle of 452''''', is a Latin chronicle of [[Late Antiquity]], presented in the form of annals, which continues that of [[Jerome]]. It was edited by [[Theodor Mommsen]] in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' as ''Chronica Gallica A. CCCCLII'', along with another anonymous Gallic chronicle, the ''[[Chronica Gallica of 511]]''.

The chronicle begins in 379 with the elevation of [[Theodosius I]] as co-emperor, and ends with the attack of [[Attila]], king of the [[Huns]], on Italy in 452. The contents focus on [[Gaul]], the emperors and the popes, while events in the eastern part of the empire find little mention. It is the oldest preserved historical work from Gaul. The place of origin is controversial, but most likely somewhere in the [[Rhône]] Valley or, as some suggest, specifically [[Marseilles]].

The ''Chronica Gallica of 511'', edited in the same MGH volume, also begins with Theodosius, but covers the period up to 511.

The '''City Hall''' in [[Haarlem]] is the seat of the city's government. It was built in the 14th century replacing the Count's castle.

==History==
[[Image:Haarlem stadhuis Master-of-Bellart.JPG|thumb|left|150px|City Hall of Haarlem, detail from 1460 painting by the [[Master of Bellaert]].]]

Around 1100 a wooden building was constructed on the location of the current ''Gravenzaal'' of the City Hall. Traces of this building were found in 1955.

After large fires in 1347 and 1351, [[William II, Count of Holland]] donated the remains of the Gravenzaal to the city's municipality. A new building was built there. The central square building dates from the Middle Ages, but the distinctive façade of the building was designed by architect [[Lieven de Key]] and built from 1602-1604. The way it originally looked can be seen in a painting from 1460 by the Master of Bellaert. Originally the city hall was just the front of the building, and the rear cloister belonged to the Dominican brotherhood. After the Protestant Reformation this came into the possession of the city council and it is now a large complex with offices and meeting rooms. Both the [[Frans Hals Museum]] and the [[Haarlem Public Library]] originally were located in the city hall.
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Haarlem - Stadhuis 1900.jpg|In this photograph from c.1900 the tower is gone, the stairs have their railing, the balcony is gone, and on the right a large clock can be seen that served until after WWII.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The town hall is still used for civic weddings and nearly every Friday in Spring, brides can be seen entering and leaving by the main stairway. All year on Saturdays and Mondays there is a big market in front of the City Hall, where on Saturdays mainly flowers, household goods, and food is sold, though on Mondays the products are mainly cloth, sewing accessories and clothing. Although the market is frequented by the local population, it is also a tourist attraction and worth a visit, if only to try the raw herring from the fish stand, or ''stroop wafels'' from the stroop wafel stand. The town hall is also still used for state visits, most recently when the King and Queen paid a visit to Haarlem on 14 June 2013. They heard the local choir ''Zang en Vriendschap'' sing and received a book about all the previous royal state visits to Haarlem. 
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The town hall was traditionally a gathering place for various gentlemen, and the [[Dutch Society of Science]] started meeting there in 1752, which was the beginning of a municipal museum for natural history, that today no longer exists, though its "competitor" founded in 1781 still does; namely the [[Teylers Museum]].&lt;ref name="maatschappij"&gt;[[Johannes Abraham Bierens de Haan]], De geschiedenis van een verdwenen Haarlemsch museum van natuurlijke historie.

Bohn, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; When they moved out, the paintings stayed and they became the Haarlem municipal museum, which moved out in 1913 to become the Frans Hals museum.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Inside==
A large number of paintings and objects from Haarlem's rich history can be found inside the building. One series of paintings depict the various [[Count of Holland|counts of Holland]], starting from [[Dirk I, Count of Holland|Dirk I]] to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian from Austria]]. In the Middle Ages these paintings were hanging in the Carmelieten Cloister in Haarlem; they were painted between 1486 and 1491. In 1570 it is mentioned in city archives that the paintings were hanging in the City Hall; possibly they were moved there in 1566 to protect them from the [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic riots]]. Other paintings and objects are either part of the original interior, or too big to fit in the Frans Hals Museum.

{{Programming paradigms|state=collapsed}}
[[Programming language]]s can be grouped by the number and types of [[Programming paradigm|paradigms]] supported.

==Paradigm summaries==
A concise reference for the programming paradigms listed in this article.

* [[Concurrent programming language|Concurrent programming]] – have language constructs for concurrency, these may involve multi-threading, support for distributed computing, message passing, shared resources (including shared memory), or futures
** [[Actor model|Actor programming]] – concurrent computation with ''actors'' that make local decisions in response to the environment (capable of selfish or competitive behavior)
* [[Constraint programming]] – relations between variables are expressed as constraints (or constraint networks), directing allowable solutions (uses constraint satisfaction or [[simplex algorithm]])
* [[Dataflow|Dataflow programming]] – forced recalculation of formulas when data values change (e.g. [[spreadsheet]]s)
* [[Declarative programming]] – describes what a computation should perform, without specifying detailed state changes c.f. imperative programming (functional and logic programming are major subgroups of declarative programing)
* [[Distributed computing|Distributed programming]] – have support for multiple autonomous computers that communicate via computer networks
* [[Functional programming]] – uses evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data
* [[Generic programming]] – uses algorithms written in terms of to-be-specified-later types that are then instantiated as needed for specific types provided as parameters
* [[Imperative programming]] – explicit statements that change a program state
* [[Logic programming]] – uses explicit mathematical logic for programming
* [[Metaprogramming]] – writing programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data, or that do part of the work at compile time that would otherwise be done at runtime
** [[Template metaprogramming]] – metaprogramming methods in which templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code, which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled
** [[reflection (computer programming)|Reflective programming]] – metaprogramming methods in which a program modifies or extends itself
* [[Object-oriented programming]] – uses data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions (objects) to design programs
** [[class (computer science)|Class-based]] – object-oriented programming in which inheritance is achieved by defining classes of objects, versus the objects themselves
** [[prototype-based programming|Prototype-based]] – object-oriented programming that avoids classes and implements inheritance via cloning of instances
* [[Pipeline programming]] – a simple syntax change to add syntax to nest function calls to language originally designed with none
* [[Rule-based programming]] – a network of rules of thumb that comprise a knowledge base and can be used for expert systems and problem deduction &amp; resolution
* [[Visual programming language|Visual programming]] – manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually (e.g. [[Simulink]]); also termed ''diagrammatic programming''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=381508 |title=Diagrammatic-graphical programming languages and DoD-STD-2167A |last=Bragg |first=S.D. |last2=Driskill |first2=C.G. |date=20–22 September 1994 |work=IEEEXplore |publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Confused.com''', part of the [[Admiral Group]], is a British [[Price comparison service|financial services comparison]] website specialising in comparison of insurance and financial services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Little |first=Stephen |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/car-insurance-comparison-sites-charge-more-same-policy-channel-4-investigation-gocompare-a8073721.html |title=Car insurance: Going to the wrong comparison site could cost you over £300 more for same policy |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=27 November 2017 |accessdate=8 September 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website enables consumers to compare prices on a range of insurance and financial products, including [[car insurance]], [[home insurance]] and [[life insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/press/2018/01/car-insurance-premiums-see-8-percent-annual-rise |title=UK car insurance premiums see 8% annual rise |publisher=[[Willis Towers Watson]] |date=January 22, 2018 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Confused.com launched in 2002, becoming the UK’s first car insurance comparison site. It is based in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] with offices located near the headquarters of the Admiral Group. The Admiral Group floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in September 2004, it is currently the only FTSE100 listed company headquartered in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7473032.stm|title=Insurance firm creates 400 jobs|date=25 June 2008|work=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confused.com is regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.confused.com/about-us |title=Confused.com - About Us |website=Confused.com |accessdate=August 30, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://register.fca.org.uk/ShPo_FirmDetailsPage?id=001b000000MfOvoAAF |title=The Financial Services Register - Inspop.com, Ltd (Confused.com) |publisher=[[Financial Conduct Authority]] |date=14 January 2005 |accessdate=30 August 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Confused.com has undergone a high degree of management [[churn rate|churn]] in recent years. At the top level, founding Managing Director Kate Armstrong, an IT consultant originally from Sydney, retired from the business in 2005, following the successful flotation of the Admiral Group. She was succeeded by Deborah Williams who took the reins from 2005 to 2007. The business underwent expansive growth in this period with profit hitting £36 million in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiralgroup.co.uk/press/pressreleases/04_03_08.php |title=Admiral Group plc - Press Release |publisher=Admiralgroup.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011071221/http://www.admiralgroup.co.uk/press/pressreleases/04_03_08.php |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was with some degree of surprise therefore that the industry received news of Williams' departure to join a relatively unknown insurance broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barry |first=Sion |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2008/06/11/debra-williams-quits-confused-com-91466-21054272/ |title=Debra Williams quits Confused.com |work=WalesOnline |date= |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was succeeded by Carlton Hood in the newly created position of CEO. The sector was shaken up by the ground breaking [[Compare the Meerkat|Compare the Market]] campaign in 2009; Confused.com, along with other established competitors, lost market share. Hood resigned abruptly in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sion Barry |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/business/business-news/chief-executive-quits-admirals-confusedcom-1878745 |title=Chief executive quits Admiral's Confused.com |work=WalesOnline |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by Group FD Kevin Chidwick as an interim measure.

Chidwick remained in place until January 2012 and was succeeded by [[Admiral Group]] senior manager Nic Weng Kan followed by Martin Coriat. Coriat was MD of Admiral-owned French comparison site LeLynx.fr&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admiralgroup.co.uk/business/our_companies.php |title=Admiral Group PLC - Our Companies |publisher=Admiral Group PLC |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he took up the position of Confused.com CEO in October 2013.

The marketing department came under new management in July 2010 when Mike Hoban formally passed a six-month probation period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Brownsell |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/sectors/financialservices/article/1006385/Directgovs-Mike-Hoban-join-Confusedcom-CMO/ |title=Directgov's Mike Hoban to join Confused.com as CMO |publisher=Marketingmagazine.co.uk |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stepped into the role of marketing director. Prior to joining Confused.com, he spent 18 months as the Communications Director of [[Directgov]], helping to position their website as the ‘nation’s official website'.

In August 2012, Mike Hoban stepped down as marketing director&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Brownsell |first= Alex |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/mike-hoban-leaves-confusedcom/1146903 |title=Mike Hoban leaves Confused.com |work=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group]] |date=23 August 2012 |access-date=3 September 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joby Russell stepped into the role. After overseeing the launch of the 'Brian the Robot' campaign and later toy promotions, Russell left the role in May 2015 to take up the role of CMO at online estate agents Purplebricks.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/confusedcom-marketing-chief-joby-russell-moves-purplebrickscom-cmo/1348903|title=Confused.com marketing chief Joby Russell moves to Purplebricks.com as CMO|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015 Paul Troy was appointed the CMO role at Confused.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketingweek.com/2015/12/07/confused-com-plots-marketing-resurgence-with-new-cmo-role/|title=Confused.com plots marketing resurgence with new CMO role - Marketing Week|website=www.marketingweek.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Troy had previously worked for Moneysupermarket between 2011 and 2013 where he created the 'You're so money supermarket' campaign.

In September 2017, Louise O'Shea was appointed as CEO of Confused.com taking over from Martin Coriat who himself was appointed as chief executive of Admiral-owned French comparison website LeLynx. O'Shea was promoted to the CEO position from her role as finance director at Confused.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Symcox |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.businesscloud.co.uk/news/confusedcom-appoints-new-chief-executive |title=Confused.com appoints new chief executive |website=UKFast |date=12 September 2017 |access-date=22 September 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Confused.com announced the appointment of Sam Day as chief marketing officer, replacing Troy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/05/21/confusedcom-appoints-chief-marketing-officer-after-paul-troy-exits|title=Confused.com appoints chief marketing officer after Paul Troy exits|work=The Drum|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Advertising==
In early years, Confused.com achieved success with a simple, repetitive direct response advertising format, in which a man with a megaphone shouted about exactly what Confused.com was offering. This led to the longest running of Confused.com’s campaigns, featuring simple cardboard props on a white background, later with a man and later a youth with out megaphones saying they were "So confused.com!" by the depicted marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NqVm5uHo-g|title=Confused.com (2002, UK)|first=|last=The Hall of Advertising|date=5 January 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years as competitors [[Moneysupermarket.com]], [[Gocompare.com]] and [[Comparethemarket.com]] have entered the market, Confused.com has tried numerous different advertising vehicles. None have emulated the success of the initial campaign and Confused.com has slipped from the position of market leader to being the fourth largest car insurance comparison website in the UK. The popularity of the company's slogan 'Confused.com' rose to prominence after the success of the 2001 campaign. A 2002 study by Webster showed that the slogan was the third most used phrase of the year behind 'Hey you' and 'Naughty Soldier'.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Later adverts containing real life testimonials, featuring customers and prolific social media users talking about their experiences while using the website, as well as showcasing the website’s simplicity by explaining how it works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noel Bussey |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/861739/Farm-lands-25m-Confusedcom-task/ |title=Farm lands £25m Confused.com task - advertising news - Campaign |publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adverts in early 2010 focused on the concept of regret and featured members of the public lamenting that they could have purchased something they wanted if they had purchased their car insurance through Confused.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anne Cassidy |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1015388/Confusedcom-splits-BMB/ |title=Confused.com splits with BMB - advertising news - Campaign |publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Confused.com introduced the character of "Cara Confused"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4QPRi4yFwk|title=Confused.com - Interweb (2010, UK)|first=|last=The Hall of Advertising|date=1 June 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cara1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parsons |first=Russell |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/disciplines/digital/confusedcom-introduces-animated-logo-in-fresh-push/3018087.article |title=Confused.com introduces animated logo in fresh push &amp;#124; News |publisher=Marketing Week |date= |accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a wild-haired animated version of the original company [[mascot]] that was present on the former Confused.com logo.&lt;ref name="cara1"/&gt; The inspiration for the creation of Cara came from Kate Armstrong, the [[Founder (company)|founder]] and former [[managing director]] of Confused.com.&lt;ref name="cara2"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/business/newsandevents/aspire/issue10autumnwinter2011/katearmstrong/|title=Kate Armstrong: profile of a PhD student|publisher=[[University of Glasgow]] [[Adam Smith Business School]]|date=Autumn–Winter 2011|accessdate=8 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805214720/http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/business/newsandevents/aspire/issue10autumnwinter2011/katearmstrong/|archivedate=5 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign used the [[tagline]], "it pays to be Confused.com".  In February 2011 an advert started featuring Cara (voiced by [[West End theatre|West End]] star [[Louise Dearman]]) singing the [[Diana Ross]] track "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]".&lt;ref name="cara_sings_chain_reaction"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.tvadmusic.co.uk/2011/02/confused-com-cara-sings-chain-reaction/ |title=Confused.com – Cara Sings Chain Reaction |publisher=TV Ad Music |date= 15 February 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing Director Mike Hoban claimed that this campaign gained Confused.com 2 million customers since launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://todayinsurance.co.uk/new-confused-com-ad-campaign-featuring-cara-launched/ |title=New Confused.Com ad campaign featuring Cara launched |publisher=todayinsurance.co.uk |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=8 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828233845/http://todayinsurance.co.uk/new-confused-com-ad-campaign-featuring-cara-launched/ |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2013 a campaign launched featuring a robot named Brian, depicted as being on a mission to help people to "save pounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brownsell |first=Alex |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1183890/confusedcom-overhauls-brand-search-expert-positioning |title=Confused.com overhauls brand in search of 'expert' positioning |publisher=Marketing Magazine |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December 2014, an advert was launched where scrap dealers kidnap Brian. Instead of melting him down straight away, they leave him hanging through the night on a magnet. However, his robot friends at headquarters receive his distress call and go to help him. A couple of weeks later the succeeding advert shows the same five co-robots, known as the Herberts (Chief Herbert, Miss Herbert, Stunt Herbert, Clever Herbert and Baby Herbert), go to help Brian. They stop the incinerator at the last moment, saving Brian and continuing the 'Brian' advertising campaigns after they repair him. In 2015, an advert was launched featuring Brian and the Herberts dancing to "[[Jump on It!]]" promoting the brand new Brian toy available by buying insurance through Confused.com. In early 2016, two more toys were launched, Miss Herbert and Stunt Herbert, with a corresponding campaign showing both characters competing with each other.

On 1 August 2016, the adverts featuring the Robots were scrapped in favour of a new advertisement featuring [[James Corden]].&lt;ref name="James Corden advert"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.confused.com/press/releases/2017/james-corden-is-drivers-hero-in-confused-coms-sheep-whisperer |title=James Corden is drivers' hero in Confused.com's sheep whisperer |publisher=Confused.com |date=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17 August 2018, following a run of 6 adverts, James Corden was replaced in favour of a new direction and new frontman [[Timothy V. Murphy|Timothy Murphy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/08/17/confusedcom-s-new-cmo-drops-james-corden-ads-and-restructures-marketing-team|title=Confused.com’s new CMO drops James Corden from ads and restructures marketing team|work=The Drum|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The advert features Murphy driving a car through a busy mass of confusing messaging and advertising before ending with Murphy driving down a clear road.

'''Contemporary hit radio''' (also known as '''CHR''', '''contemporary hits''', '''hit list''', '''current hits''', '''hit music''', '''top 40''', or '''pop radio''') is a [[radio format]] that is common in the United States, Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, and the Philippines, that focuses on playing current and recurrent popular music as determined by the [[top 40]] [[Music chart|music charts]]. There are several subcategories, dominantly focusing on [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], or [[urban music]].  Used alone, ''CHR'' most often refers to the CHR-pop format. The term ''contemporary hit radio'' was coined in the early 1980s by ''[[Radio &amp; Records]]'' magazine to designate [[top 40]] stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into [[adult contemporary]], [[urban contemporary]] and other formats

The term "top 40" is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs, and, by extension, to refer to [[pop music]] in general. The term has also been modified to describe '''top 50'''; '''top 30'''; '''top 20'''; '''top 10'''; '''hot 100''' (each with its number of songs) and '''hot hits''' radio formats, but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with [[Todd Storz]] as further refined by [[Gordon McLendon]] as well as [[Bill Drake]].  The format became especially popular in the sixties as radio stations constrained disc jockeys to numbered play lists in the wake of the [[payola]] scandal.

==Variations==
===Mainstream CHR===
Also known as CHR/pop or teen CHR. Plays [[pop music|pop]], and [[Electronic dance music|dance]], and sometimes [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[country music|country]] crossover as well. Often referred as "[[top 40]]"; in terms of incorporating a variety of genres of music, CHR/pop is the successor to the original concept of top 40 radio which originated in the 1950s. [[WHTZ]] in [[New York City]], [[KIIS-FM|KIIS]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Jovem Pan]] in [[Brazil]], [[KRBE]] in [[Houston]], [[WIOQ]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[WBBM-FM|WBBM]] in [[Chicago]], [[WFLZ]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]/[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[WHYI]] in [[Miami]], [[WNCI]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[WZPL]], in [[Indianapolis]], and [[KDWB]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]/[[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] are the best-known CHR/pop stations in the U.S. ''See also: [[Mainstream Top 40|Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)]]''

===Adult CHR===
These stations typically are hybrids of the contemporary hit radio (CHR/pop) and [[Adult contemporary music#Hot adult contemporary|hot AC]] formats. This format contains a strong focus on current chart, contemporary and recurrent hits as well as placing a minority of older, classic hits from the 1990s and 2000s onto the playlist. Adult CHR stations play pop-friendly rhythmic, dance and hip hop titles from artists such as [[Rihanna]], [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]], [[Flo Rida]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Usher Raymond|Usher]] or [[Ne-Yo]] while still shying away from hardcore hip hop.

Examples in the U.S. include [[WKRQ]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[WWMX]] in [[Baltimore]], [[WKFR-FM]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[WROK (AM)|WROK]] in [[Rockford, Illinois]], [[WKCI-FM|WKCI]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]/[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[WZYP]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[KBMX]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[WMXZ]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], Sirius XM Hits 1, [[WNDV]] in [[South Bend]], [[WIXX]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[KLTG]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] and [[KZZO]] in [[Sacramento]]. United Kingdom (UK) media regulator [[Ofcom]] states: "where a format requires a contemporary and [[UK Singles Chart|chart music]] service, the main diet must be of modern music, reflecting the charts of today and recent months. Older, classic tracks would not be out of place, but only as spice to the main offering."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/radio/formats-content/about-formats Ofcom| About radio formats]&lt;/ref&gt;

The adult CHR format is sometimes utilized by stations which are heritage Top 40/CHR outlets in their respective markets which have been in the format since the 1970s or 1980s or FM successors to former AM top 40s. ''See also: [[Adult Top 40]], a US Billboard chart.''

===Rhythmic CHR===

{{main|Rhythmic contemporary}}
Also known as CHR/rhythmic, or CHR/urban. These stations focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[dance-pop]]. There are differences between CHR/rhythmic and the [[urban contemporary]] format; urban stations will often play [[R&amp;B]] and [[soul music|soul]] songs that CHR/rhythmic stations will not, and CHR/rhythmic stations, despite playlists heavy with urban product, sometimes have white disc jockeys and will include [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and rhythmic pop music that urban outlets will not play. [[KYLD]] in [[San Francisco]], [[WQHT]] in [[New York City|New York]], and [[KPWR]] in [[Los Angeles]] are among the most successful CHR/rhythmic stations in the U.S. and among the pioneers of the format.

===CHR/dance===
Playing [[electronic dance music|dance]] remixes of popular songs with perhaps some current hits from the dance charts. Pure dance-music radio stations (as opposed to CHR/rhythmic and [[rhythmic AC]] formats such as [[MOViN]]) are not very common but tend to have loyal audiences in the markets where they do exist.  Examples include [[KFCO|KDHT-FM]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[WPTY]] on [[Long Island, NY]] and [[KNHC]] in [[Seattle]].''see also: [[Dance/Mix Show Airplay]]''

===CHR/rock===
Stations with this format are similar in some ways to the adult CHR and mainstream CHR/pop formats, but also incorporate [[modern rock]] and [[modern AC]] titles in an upbeat presentation. Examples include [[KSXY]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]] [[KKCK]] in [[Marshall, Minnesota]].

===Other variations===
There are also [[ethnicity|ethnic]] variations, such as '''CHR/español''' ([[Latin pop]]), and '''CHR/Tejano''' ([[Tejano music|Tex-Mex and Tejano]]) which are commonly found in [[Arizona]], [[Texas]], [[California]], and Mexico.

==Key contributors==

===Todd Storz===
Credit for the format is widely given to [[Todd Storz]], who was the director of radio station [[KCRO|KOWH]]-AM in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1951.  At that time typical AM radio programming consisted largely of [[full service (radio format)|full-service]] "[[block programming]]" — pre-scheduled, sponsored programs of a wide variety, including [[radio drama]]s and variety shows.  Local popular music hits, if they made it on the air at all, had to be worked in between these segments.  Storz noted the great response certain songs got from the record-buying public and compared it to the way certain selections on [[jukebox]]es were played over and over.  He expanded his domain of radio stations, purchasing [[WQNO|WTIX-AM]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], gradually converted his stations to an all-hits format, and pioneered the practice of surveying record stores to determine which singles were popular each week.  Storz found that the more people heard a given song on the radio or from the jukebox, the more likely they were to buy a copy; a conclusion not obvious in the industry at the time.  In 1952 he purchased what was then WLAF-AM in Lafayette, Indiana and constructed WAZY-AM/FM which is still the longest running top 40 FM station in existence to this day. In 1954, Storz purchased [[WHB]]-AM, a high-powered station in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] which could be heard throughout the Midwest and Great Plains, converted it to an all-hits format, and dubbed the result "top 40".  Shortly thereafter WHB debuted the first "top 40 countdown", a reverse-order playing of the station's ranking of hit singles for that week.  Within a few years, top 40 stations appeared all over the country to great success, spurred by the burgeoning popularity of [[rock and roll]] music, especially that of [[Elvis Presley]]. A 1950s employee at WHB, Ruth Meyer, went on to have tremendous success in the early to mid-60's as program director of New York's premiere top 40 station at that time, WMCA.

Storz Broadcasting Company consisted of six AM radio stations, all featuring top 40 in the sixties.

===Gordon McLendon===
Although Todd Storz is regarded as the father of the top 100 format{{Citation Needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Gordon McLendon]] of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] is regarded as the person who took an idea and turned it into a mass media marketing success in combination with the development in that same city of [[PAMS]] jingles. McLendon's successful Mighty 1190 [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] in Dallas, along with his two other [[Texas Triangle]] stations, 610 [[KILT (AM)]] Houston and 550 [[KTSA]] San Antonio, which went top 40 during the mid to late 1950s, soon became perhaps the most imitated radio stations in America. With careful attention to programming, McLendon presented his stations as packages to advertisers and listeners alike.  It was the combination of top 40 and PAMS jingles which became the key to the success of the radio format itself. Not only were the same records played on different stations across America, but so were the same jingle music beds whose lyrics were resung repetitively for each station to create individual station identity. To this basic mix were added contests, games and [[disc jockey]] patter. Various groups (including [[Bartell Broadcasters]]) emphasized local variations on their top 40 stations.

Gordon McLendon would operate approximately a dozen and a half AM, FM and TV stations at various times, experimenting with formats other than top 40 (including [[beautiful music]] and all-news).

===Rick Sklar===
In the early 1960s [[Rick Sklar]] also developed the top 40 format for radio station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in [[New York City]] which was then copied by stations in the eastern and mid-western United States such as [[WWKB|WKBW]] and [[WLS (AM)|WLS]].

===Bill Drake===
[[Bill Drake]] built upon the foundation established by Storz and McLendon to create a variation called [[boss radio]]. This format began in California in early 1961 at KSTN (Stockton), then in 1962-63 at KYNO (Fresno), in 1964 at KGB (San Diego), and finally to [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] [[Los Angeles]] in May 1965, and was further adapted to stations across the western USA. It was later broadcast by American disc jockeys as a hybrid format on [[Swinging Radio England]] which broadcast from on board a ship anchored off the coast of southern England in [[international waters]]. At that time there were no commercial radio stations in the UK, and BBC radio offered only sporadic top 40 programming.  Other noteworthy North American top 40 stations that used the "Drake" approach included [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]] in San Francisco; [[CKLW]] in Windsor, ON; [[WRKO]] in Boston; [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]] in Memphis, TN; [[WCIS-FM|WOLF]] in Syracuse, NY; and [[WOR-FM]] in New York City.  Most listeners identified boss radio with less talk, shorter jingles and more music.

===Mike Joseph and hot hits===
Mike Joseph's "[[hot hits]]" stations of the late 1970s and early 1980s attempted to revitalize the format by refocusing listeners' attention on current, active "box-office" music. Thus, hot hits stations played only current hit songs - no oldies unless they were on current chart albums - in a fast, furious and repetitive fashion, with fast-talking personalities and loud, pounding jingles. In 1977, [[WTIC-FM]] in Hartford, CT, dropped its long-running classical format for Joseph's format as "96 Tics" and immediately became one of the top radio stations in the market. The first Joseph station to use the term "hot hits" on the air was [[WFBL]] ("Fire 14", which played its top 14 hits in very tight rotation) in Syracuse, NY, in 1979. Then [[WOGL|WCAU-FM]] in Philadelphia switched to hot hits as "98 Now" in the fall of 1981 and was instantly successful.  Other major-market stations which adopted the hot hits format in the early 1980s included [[WBBM-FM]] Chicago, WHYT (now [[WDVD]]) Detroit, WMAR-FM (now [[WWMX]]) Baltimore, which we might add was not successful against market leader WBSB B104, [[KITS]] San Francisco, and [[WNVZ]] Norfolk.

===Don Pierson===
[[Don Pierson]] took the formats of Gordon McLendon, boss radio and PAMS jingles to the UK in the form of [[Wonderful Radio London]], (a [[pirate radio]] ship) and subsequently revolutionized the popular music format. On 14 August 1967 The Marine Offences Act was introduced in the UK and the pirate stations were shut down.

The British Broadcasting Corporation were chosen by the UK government to come up with a station to replace the pirates, and so in 1967 [[BBC Radio 1]] started broadcasting, employing many of the DJ's from the pirate stations (Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett and John Peel etc.) and obtaining re-sings of the PAMS jingles.

In fact{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} it was Tony Blackburn who played the first pop record on Radio 1, The Move's "Flowers In The Rain".

[[Image:1907 Cooks Handbook to Norway and Denmark cover.png|thumb|right|''Cook's Handbook to Norway and Denmark'', 1907]]
'''''Cook's Tourists' Handbooks''''' were a series of travel [[guide book]]s for [[tourists]] published in the 19th-20th centuries by [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son]] of London. The firm's founder, [[Thomas Cook]], produced his first handbook to England the 1840s, later expanding to Europe, Near East, North Africa, and beyond. Compared with other guides such as ''[[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers|Murray's]]'', ''Cook's'' aimed at "a broader and less sophisticated middle-class audience."&lt;ref name=koshar1998 /&gt; The books served to advertise Cook's larger business of organizing travel tours.&lt;ref name=koshar1998&gt;{{cite journal |title='What Ought to Be Seen': Tourists' Guidebooks and National Identities in Modern Germany and Europe |author= Rudy Koshar |journal= Journal of Contemporary History |volume= 33 |date=July 1998 |jstor=261119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series continues today as ''Traveller Guides'' issued by Thomas Cook Publishing of [[Peterborough, England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Thomas Cook Publishing/Thomas Cook Tour Operations Ltd. |location=Peterborough, England |url= http://www.thomascookpublishing.com/TravellerGuides |title=Traveller Guides |accessdate=26 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massimo Stanzione]]'s '''''David with the Head of Goliath''''' is exhibited at the [[San Diego Museum of Art]].

== History ==
In 1947, Mrs. Harry Turpin gifted a Stanzione original painting titled ''David With the Head of Goliath'' to the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego (now the [[San Diego Museum of Art]]); the work was then attributed to [[Jusepe Ribera|Ribera]], but was reattributed to Stanzione by Mario Modestini in 1951, an attribution confirmed by Schleier, Felton, Zeri, and Spinosa. The painting is dated to approximately 1630. [[Caravaggio]] was an important influence in Stanzione’s artistic style and this painting illustrates a combination of styles from Caravaggio’s brutally realistic elements and dramatic lighting to classical 17th-century artistic trends including the lyrical style of Bologna artists. This painting shows David in an elegant posture, which softens the goriness, i.e. the dismembered head of [[Goliath]]. The theatrical lighting of this painting is a perfect demonstration of the chiaroscuro interpretation by Stanzione. [[Guido Reni]] and Caravaggio can be credited for Stanzione’s interpretation of [[chiaroscuro]]; they were supposedly his teachers. It was only after the painting was donated, that experts noticed under gallery lighting some aberrations in the canvas such as unevenness and crackle patterns. Those aberrations, along with the fact that young David appears to be gazing at something in the lower left corner led to suspicions that the canvas had been altered. By 1999, with the use of x-rays and careful removal of surface paint, the original paint of Goliath’s forehead was revealed. After intensive restoration, Goliath’s full face was uncovered and the painting restored to its original form. The full painting depicts Goliath’s dismembered head in the lower left corner, with David, knife in hand, gazing down to the lower left corner. It is believed that the head of Goliath was painted over in order to make the painting less gory and more appealing to potential buyers.

'''''Demons 2''''' (Italian: '''''Dèmoni 2''''') is a 1986 Italian [[horror film]] directed by [[Lamberto Bava]] and co-written and produced by [[Dario Argento]]. It is a sequel to Bava's 1985 film ''[[Demons (1985 film)|Demons]]'' and stars David Knight, [[Nancy Brilli]], [[Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni|Coralina Cataldi Tassoni]] as well as Argento's youngest daughter, [[Asia Argento]], in her debut film performance at age 10. The film was also known as '''''Demons 2: The Nightmare Returns'''''.  The demons from the first film invade the real world through a television broadcast, turning the residents of an apartment building into bloodthirsty monsters.

==Plot==
The film opens as if the events of the first film took place in reality, but this is a [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film within a film]] that the various residents of a high-rise apartment building are watching. Its story follows several teens who trespass into a city that was deserted as a result of the outbreak. Finding the lifeless corpse of a demon, one of the teens revives it accidentally by dripping blood from a scratch into its mouth. 

In reality, frustrated party girl Sally Day locks herself in her bedroom when her boyfriend does not attend her sixteenth birthday party. As her friends try to persuade her to return to the party, she watches part of the film on television. Suddenly, the demon notices her, climbs through the television and attacks her. Sally is transformed into a demon and attacks her friends, turning all but two of them into vile, bloodthirsty monsters.

The creatures' bile seeps through the building, burning through the ceiling and into other apartments and shorting out the electrical system. In one apartment, a dog licks up the bile and transforms into a vicious beast that attacks and kills its owner. A young boy left alone by his parents  avoids Sally and her rampaging demon friends but is ultimately poisoned by the bile and becomes a monster. The demon boy attacks Hannah, a pregnant woman waiting for her husband to come home. She kills the demon boy, but a flying demon bursts out of his body to further terrorize her. Her husband, George, has been trapped in the elevator with another woman. As they escape through a service hatch, a demon bursts through the elevator door and infects the woman. She in turn attacks George, but he kills her before entering his and Hannah's apartment in time to kill the flying demon with an umbrella.

Meanwhile, a group of bodybuilders led by gym instructor Hank have barricaded themselves in the underground car park, along with a group of tenants. Unable to break down the garage doors, they stand their ground and defend themselves with shotguns and makeshift weapons, such as Molotov cocktails. The demons eventually force their way in. Although they heavily outnumber the demons, the uninfected are relatively easily defeated and are either turned into demons themselves or killed.

The infected start making their way back up the building. George causes a leak in the gas pipes that kills all the infected  except Sally in an explosion. Hannah and George search for a way out and go into Sally's apartment, finding the two hidden partygoers. The group make their way to the roof but are stopped by Sally. She infects the two partygoers, but George dispatches them. George and Hannah lower themselves to the roof of an adjacent building, fighting Sally as they go. Inside the neighboring building, Hannah gives birth to the couple's child. George defeats the resilient Sally in mortal combat, and he and Hannah exit with their newborn child.

===Critical reception===
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
''Demons 2'' has an approval rating of 60% on film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on ten reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/demons_2/ |title=Demons 2 - The Nightmare Returns - Rotten Tomatoes |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllRovi|AllMovie]]'s review was negative, writing, "putting aside the simplistic plot, lousy dialogue and atrocious acting, ''Demons 2'' is watchable for one reason: the bloody mechanical and makeup effects by Sergio Stivaletti."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/demons-2-v13193/review |title=Demons 2 (1986) - Review - AllMovie |last=Legare |first=Patrick |work=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewing the film on Blu-ray, Budd Wilkins of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that it "trades in its predecessor's penchant for wall-to-wall gore in favor of surreal shocks and quasi-Cronenbergian craziness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/demons-2|title=Demons 2|last=Wilkins|first=Budd|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=9 November 2014|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in a retrospective for [[Dread Central]], Matt Serafini called it "much more a mixed bag than its predecessor" but questioned why it never led to a franchise.  Serafini suggested a new generation of Italian filmmakers continue the series, including the practical effects and new wave music of ''Demons 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36332/saturday-nightmares-why-didn-t-demons-2-lead-to-a-franchise/|title=Saturday Nightmares: Why Didn’t Demons 2 Lead To A Franchise?|last=Serafini|first=Matt|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=11 August 2012|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Edward George Farhat''' (June 7, 1926 – January 18, 2003) was a Lebanese-American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known  by his [[ring name]] '''The Sheik''' (sometimes called '''The Original Sheik''' to distinguish him from [[The Iron Sheik]], who debuted in 1972). He is also one of the originators of what became the [[hardcore wrestling]] style, as the promoter of [[Big Time Wrestling (Detroit)|Big Time Wrestling]], and the uncle of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] wrestler [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sheik.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early life and career (1949 - 1970)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
He started out wrestling in the [[Chicago]] area as The Sheik of Araby after having served in the U.S. Army. He often teamed with [[Gypsy Joe]]. Later on he went to Texas. During his early career, his biggest match was one he didn't even wrestle in.  He was set to face [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lou Thesz]] in Chicago for his title but Thesz had a reputation for embarrassing "[[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]" wrestlers so The Sheik bailed from the ring and hid under a bus. The publicity from the event helped push the Sheik character to a more prominent level. He went to [[New York City|New York]] for [[Vincent J. McMahon]] where he teamed with [[Dick The Bruiser]] and [[Bull Curry]] in feuds against [[Mark Lewin]] and [[Don Curtis]] as well as the team of [[Antonino Rocca]] and [[Miguel Pérez (wrestler)|Miguel Pérez]] in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]. He returned when McMahon formed the [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] to feud with [[Bruno Sammartino]] in the WWWF's major markets in the late 1960s.

===The Sheik's gimmick (1949 - 1995)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The Sheik's wrestling was centered on his character of a rich wild man from [[Syria]]. Before each match, he would use stalling tactics as he would kneel on a prayer rug to pray to Allah. He would lock on choke holds and refuse to break them, and use a camel clutch hold leading to submission. The hold would have him sit over his opponent's back as he applied a chinlock. He used hidden [[pencil]]s and other "foreign objects" to cut open his opponent's faces. Often, the tactic backfired and the opponent got The Sheik's pencil, leading to the extensive scarring on Farhat's forehead. The other illegal move was his fireball that he threw into his opponents' faces, sometimes burning their face severely. ( He had pieces of paper soaked in lighter fluid which he quick lit with a cigarette lighter hidden in his trunks. ) He didn't speak on camera, apart from the incomprehensible, oft-uttered phrase "aloo, aloo!" which he repeated in the ring. He was actually saying quickly Kalamazoo. At the start of his career his wife Joyce played the part of his valet Princess Saleema who would burn incense in the ring. He had three different [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] during his career to cut [[promo (professional wrestling)|promos]] on his behalf. His first manager was [[Ernie Roth|Abdullah Farouk]] but when Farouk managed full-time in the WWF, [[Eddy Creatchman]] became his manager. When Creatchman was unable to work with him later in his career, Sheik had Supermouth Dave Drason.

===Noteworthy feuds and matches (1960s - 1980)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The Sheik's biggest feud was his seemingly career-long conflict with [[Bobo Brazil]] in [[Big Time Wrestling (Detroit)|Big Time Wrestling]] in Detroit. The two feuded over Sheik's version of the United States Championship, frequently selling out [[Cobo Hall]]. This is seen briefly on the "documentary" movie, ''I Like to Hurt People.'' The two took the feud to several markets, most notably [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[Los Angeles, California]]. His other major opponent in Los Angeles was [[Fred Blassie]]. Sheik and Blassie faced off several times, including cage matches in the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]].

In 1968, he was brought into the WWWF for title matches with then-champion Bruno Sammartino.  They met three times in Madison Square Garden—Sheik won the first via count out, he was disqualified in the second, and he lost to Bruno in a Texas Death Match via submission when Bruno grabbed a foreign object (pen) and hammered Sheik's arm to a bloody pulp.  Sammartino and Sheik also had a series of matches in Boston, including one sell out the day after a crippling snow storm, and public transportation not yet restored.

Starting in 1969, he also wrestled regularly in [[Toronto]], where he was undefeated for 127 matches at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]]. He defeated the likes of [[Whipper Billy Watson]], [[Lou Thesz]], [[Gene Kiniski]], [[Bruno Sammartino]], [[Édouard Carpentier]], [[Ernie Ladd]], [[Chief Jay Strongbow]], [[Tiger Jeet Singh]], [[Johnny Valentine]] and even [[André the Giant]] during Andre's first extensive tour of North America in 1974. It was Andre who put an end to the Sheik's Toronto winning streak in August 1974 by disqualification. In 1976 he lost by pinfall to Thunderbolt Patterson and Bobo Brazil. Sheik continued to headline most shows in Toronto until 1977, but business dropped off significantly over the last three years. Few fans were aware of the fact that he was actually the booker within Frank Tunney's promotion following the retirement of Whipper Billy Watson in 1971. He was also the promoter at Cobo Hall in Detroit for many years. As business in Toronto failed, he worked for indy promoter Dave McKigney in Ontario and ran his own Big Time Wrestling promotion out of his home near Lansing, Michigan.

Late in his career, Sheik ventured to a promotion in Japan. His run was successful, but management was in financial ruin, so when the company went bankrupt, Sheik jumped to Baba's [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]. He then jumped a year later to Inoki's [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], but had a falling out with Inoki, and left Japan to return to wrestling full-time in Detroit. He returned in 1977 for All Japan, teaming, and feuding with, [[Abdullah the Butcher]]. His match with [[Abdullah the Butcher]] against [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] and [[Terry Funk]] where Terry fought off Butcher and Sheik with his arm in a sling is credited for turning the foreign Funks into faces in Japan.

===Later career (1980 - 1998)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
In 1980, he wrestled for various independent promotions throughout the United States and Japan through the 1980s. It was while in Japan that he suffered his first heart attack while boarding a taxi.

During the 1990s, he mainly wrestled in Japan for [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]] and had various dangerous [[Hardcore wrestling#Rules|death match]]es. On May 6, 1992, The Sheik had a "fire deathmatch" with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] against [[Atsushi Onita]] and [[Tarzan Goto]], where the ring ropes were replaced with flaming [[barbed wire]] and he got third-degree burns and went into a coma.

In 1994, he had a brief run in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] where he teamed with [[Pat Tanaka]] against [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Tazz|Taz]].  He wrestled his last match in Japan in 1998.

When Sabu joined WCW in 1995, Farhat joined him as his manager. During a match with [[Jerry Lynn]], who was wrestling as "Mr. JL" at the time, Farhat's leg was broken by the wrestlers during a spot he was previously unaware of.

===Retirement and legacy===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Farhat retired to his estate and died on January 18, 2003, of heart failure.  In his later years, Farhat provided extensive interviews to his biographer with the intent of publishing a book on his life.  These interviews provided a highly explosive look into the world of wrestling, especially on the early days of the [[WWE|WWWF/WWF]] and Japanese wrestling organizations.  As a result, the interviews and draft book were sealed at the time of his death.  Despite large offers for movie rights to this book, it is unknown when, or if, Farhat's family will allow his biographer to release the book.

The Sheik was seen as one of professional wrestling's biggest box office attractions, and as a pioneer of "[[hardcore wrestling]]" which became a major part of professional wrestling in the 1990s. On March 31, 2007, The Sheik was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by his nephew, Sabu, and [[Rob Van Dam]], who he had trained. He had also trained [[Scott Steiner]], and most notably, boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] before Ali's famous "boxer vs wrestler match" with [[Antonio Inoki]] in 1976 in Tokyo.

His wife, and former valet, Joyce, died on November 27, 2013, in Michigan. They are buried at Mount Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Williamston, Michigan.

==Reception==
[[Alessandra Stanley]] from [[The New York Times]], praised the film fidelity to the book and the actor's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Alessandra|title=TV WEEKEND; That Girl Is Loose At the Plaza Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/movies/tv-weekend-that-girl-is-loose-at-the-plaza-again.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reel Film Reviews gave the film two out of four stars, stating: "Eloise at the Plaza is mildly entertaining, if only because it seems to consist of one caper after another. The film's structure soon becomes perfectly obvious - Eloise gets into a madcap adventure, adults chase her around, Nanny admonishes her, etc - and the fast pace is clearly in place to keep younger viewers interested. But, though there are a number of talented actors in the cast, Eloise just isn't a compelling enough character to sustain an entire movie. There's no doubt that the movie will act as wish fulfillment for kids - who wouldn't want to run amuck and get away with it? - but when you get right down to it, Eloise is awfully thin and one-dimensional (not to mention annoying)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eloise at the Plaza (December 14/03)|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/eloise.htm|website=Reel Film Reviews|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVDizzy.com wrote: "The film even ascends beyond the second-tier quality that most television movies are satisfied to achieve. Eloise deserves praise not merely as a more bearable Wonderful World of Disney presentation, but as a genuinely entertaining family film, regardless of format."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eloise at the Plaza DVD Review|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/eloise.html|website=DVDizzy|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Kluge''' (21 June 1856 – 21 May 1926) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philologist]] and educator. He is known for the Kluge [[etymological dictionary]] of the [[German language]] (''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache''), which was first published in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001776655 Etymologisches wörterbuch der deutschen sprache, von Friedrich Kluge] HathiTrust Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Church of the Winter Palace''' ({{lang-ru|Собор Спаса Нерукотворного Образа в Зимнем дворце}}) in [[Saint Petersburg]], sometimes referred to as the [[Winter Palace]]'s [[cathedral]], was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1763.  It is located on the [[piano nobile]] in the eastern wing of the Winter Palace, and is the larger, and principal, of two churches within the Palace.  A smaller, more private church was constructed in 1768, near the private apartment in the northwest part of the wing. The Grand Church was designed by [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Francesco Rastrelli]], and has been described as "one of the most splendid rooms" in the Palace.{{r|Hermitage}} Today, the church is an unconsecrated exhibition hall of the [[State Hermitage Museum]].{{r|Hermitage}}

==History==
[[Image:Palace cathedral.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Winter Palace's Grand Church in 1828, by [[Alexei Tyranov]].]]

Construction of the church began on 14 October 1753 ([[Julian calendar]]). Six years later, the interior design was executed by the Italian artists Carlo Zucci, Francesco Martini, Giovanni Antonio Veneroni and the sculptor G. B. Gianni. Rastrelli was personally in charge of the three-tier [[iconostasis]] where the icons were painted by [[Ivan Ivanovich Belsky]] and [[Ivan Vishnyakov]]. The Italian [[Francesco Fontebasso]] painted the [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]]s in the church's [[spandrel]]s and the "Resurrection of Christ" [[plafond]] in the [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]].

The Grand Church was one of the final parts of the palace to be completed.  When the Palace was first inhabited on 6 April 1762, the cathedral was not yet completed, so a temporary church of the [[Resurrection of Christ]] was consecrated by [[Archbishop of Novgorod|Archbishop]] Dimitry Sechenov of [[Novgorod]].

On 12 July 1763, Archbishop Gavriil Kremenetsky of St Petersburg consecrated the Grand Church in the name of the [[Image of Edessa|Not-Made-by-Hand Image of Our Saviour]]. This eponymous icon, painted by Feodor Ukhtomsky in 1693, lavishly decorated with gold and diamonds, was placed near the [[sanctuary]].

==Architecture of the Grand Church==

II]] and the [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt]], which took place at the Chapel of the Winter Palace, St. Petersburg, on 14/26 November 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Among those also depicted in this portrait, against the wall and to the right of the window, from left to right: [[King Christian IX of Denmark]], the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Maria Fyodorovna]], the [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna]], the [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna]], the [[Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]], [[Olga Konstantinovna of Russia|Olga Konstantinovna, Queen of the Hellenes]], the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], the [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Georgy Alexandrovich]] (son of [[Tsar Alexander III]]) and [[Prince Heinrich of Prussia]] (son of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Kaiser Friedrich III]]). Today, this portrait hangs at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Image:GrandChuch.png|thumb|200px|right|Location of the Grand Church within the Winter Palace.]]

The Grand Church and the Palace's [[Jordan Staircase]] are one of the few parts of the palace to retain the original [[rococo]] decorative scheme devised by [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]. This was faithfully copied by [[Vasily Stasov]] when he was commissioned to rebuild the palace following the disastrous fire that destroyed most of the original palace interiors in 1837. However, the new intricate decoration was mostly made of moulded [[papier-mâché]], rather than wood.{{r|Hermitage}}

As before the fire, the church is sub-divided by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns and [[pilaster]]s into three distinct areas, brightly lit by large windows on opposite sides, the central area being covered by a dome. The walls of the church are richly embellished with gilded [[stucco]] in rococo design. The ceiling depicts the [[Ascension of Christ]] by Pyotr Basinm, while the [[lunette]]s beneath the dome depict [[Matthew the Evangelist|Saints Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]] by Fiodor Bruni.{{r|Hermitage}} The restored cathedral was consecrated on 25 March 1839 by Metropolitan [[Filaret, Metropolitan of Moscow|Filaret (Drozdov)]] of Moscow.

The Cathedral was the repository of multiple relics and memorabilia related to the [[Romanov family|Romanovs]]. It was used as the imperial family's private place of worship, with the imperial family's members usually praying in a special room beyond the sanctuary. This was the place where Nicholas II prayed at the [[liturgy]] before exiting onto the balcony to face the crowd on the day of [[First World War|declaring war on Germany]] in 1914.

==The Grand Church today==
In May 1918, the Cathedral was officially closed for worship. It is now used as an exhibition hall of the Hermitage Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/ru/article.php?kod=2805467476 Собор СПАСА НЕРУКОТВОРНОГО ОБРАЗА с церковью СРЕТЕНИЯ ГОСПОДНЯ при Императорском Зимнем дворце] From the Encyclopedia of St.Petersburg. Retrieved 10 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration work undertaken from 2012 until 2014 is described by the State Museum as a "recreation of the original design of the Court Cathedral" and "The icons, the candelabra, the standard lamps and pieces of the iconostasis, the pulpit, the lantern and the altar canopy were returned to their original place".{{r|Sign}}

The '''Great North Museum''' is a visitor attraction in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in [[North East England]]. It features three venues: the [[Great North Museum: Hancock]], the [[Hatton Gallery]] on the [[Newcastle University]] campus and the Regional Resource Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/discovery/visiting-us/great-north-museum-resource-centre.html |title=Great North Museum Resource Centre |publisher=[[Tyne and Wear Museums]] |accessdate=2013-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the basement of the [[Discovery Museum]]. All three venues are currently open.

The Great North Museum project has been made possible with funding from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[TyneWear Partnership]], [[One NorthEast]], the [[European Regional Development Fund]], [[Newcastle University]], [[Newcastle City Council]], the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], the [[Wolfson Foundation]] and The [[Northern Rock Foundation]], as well as numerous other trusts and foundations. The building architects were Terry Farrell and Partners; [[Sir Terry Farrell]] is a native of Newcastle, and had previously been a student at Newcastle University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hadrians-wall.org/frontier/i5s44-Great-North-Museum-Project.html |title=Great North Museum project |publisher=Hadrian's Wall.org |accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2008, the 'Be Part of It' campaign was launched, and it was announced that the Great North Museum: Hancock would be opening in &lt;!-- April --&gt;2009. Athlete [[Jonathan Edwards (triple jumper)|Jonathan Edwards]] is the patron of the 'Be Part of It' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/greatnorthmuseum/news/be-part-of-it |title=Be Part of It |publisher=Great North Museum |date=2008-11-21 |accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donors to the campaign have the opportunity to have their name (or the name of a loved one) permanently included on a donor wall in the museum.

On 6 November 2009, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM The Queen]] officially opened the Great North Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/item/royal-opening-for-great-north-museum1 |title=Royal opening for Great North Museum |publisher=Newcastle University |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Great North Museum had over 600,000 visitors.&lt;ref name=ALVA/&gt;

The Great North Museum Library is open to the public and is located on the second floor of the Hancock. It houses three collections - the Library and Archives of the Natural History Society of Northumbria, the Library of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle University’s Cowen Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/great-north-museum/library.html |title=Great North Museum Library |publisher=Great North Museum |accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great North Museum: Hancock ===
{{main|Great North Museum: Hancock}}
The ''Great North Museum: Hancock'' not only holds the collections of the former Hancock Museum and collates those of [[Newcastle University]]'s [[Museum of Antiquities]] and [[Shefton Museum]], which closed their doors in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/content.phtml?ref=1208183792 |title=Last chance to visit University Museums |publisher=Newcastle University |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum opened on 23 May 2009.

The natural history museum includes an interactive model of [[Hadrian's Wall]], new displays showing diversity of the animal and plant kingdoms, objects from the [[Ancient Greeks]] and mummies from [[Ancient Egypt]], a [[planetarium]] and a cast of a [[T-Rex]] dinosaur skeleton. The interactive Bio-Wall features hundreds of creatures, that visitors will be able to investigate and find out where they live and how they survive in such extreme places as the [[Arctic]] and [[Desert]]. There is also a full size model of an [[elephant]], a [[great white shark]] display, [[polar bear]] and [[giraffe]] specimens from the historic Hancock collections and a [[moa]] skeleton.

=== Hatton Gallery ===
[[File:Hatton Gallery Great North Museum.png|frame|Hatton Gallery]]
{{main|Hatton Gallery}}
The university's art gallery, the Hatton Gallery is also a part of the Great North Museum Project, but is not relocating to the Hancock, and is thus remaining in Newcastle University's Fine Art Building. Its permanent collection comprises over 3,500 works, some dating back to the 14th century. These works of art include paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings. Notably, it houses the ''Merzbarn'' - the only surviving [[Merz (Art style)|Merz]] construction by [[Kurt Schwitters]].

The '''IX monogram''' or '''XI monogram''' is a type of early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[monogram]] looking like the spokes of a wheel, sometimes within a circle.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Symbolism: An Explanation of the more Important Symbols of the Old and New Testament, the Primitive, the Mediaeval and the Modern Church by'' Frederick Roth Webber (2nd. edition, 1938). p.77 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1dd70E-chqwC&amp;pg=PA77]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The IX monogram is formed by the combination of the letter "I" or [[Iota]] for ''IHSOYS'' (Ιησους, [[Jesus]] in Greek) and "X" or [[Chi_(letter)|Chi]] for ''XPISTOS'' (Χριστος, [[Christ]] in Greek). The spokes can also be stand-alone, without the circle. These monograms can often be found as ancient burial inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;''Church Symbolism: An Explanation of the more Important Symbols of the Old and New Testament, the Primitive, the Mediaeval and the Modern Church by'' Frederick Roth Webber (2nd. edition, 1938). p.97 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1dd70E-chqwC&amp;pg=PA97]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Church Symbolism: An Explanation of the more Important Symbols of the Old and New Testament, the Primitive, the Mediaeval and the Modern Church by'' Frederick Roth Webber (2nd. edition, 1938). p.93 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1dd70E-chqwC&amp;pg=PA93]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''João Batista de Lacerda''' (12 July 1846 in [[Campos dos Goytacazes]] &amp;ndash; 6 August 1915 in [[Rio de Janeiro]]), was a [[physician]] and one of the pioneering Brazilian biomedical [[scientist]]s in the fields of experimental [[physiology]] and [[pharmacology]].

He graduated in [[medicine]] from the [[medical school]] of Rio de Janeiro and returned to Campos to open a private practice. Soon after, he was invited by the Minister of [[Agriculture]] of the Second Empire to be the associate director of the section of [[anthropology]], [[zoology]] and [[paleontology]] of the recently created [[Museu Nacional (Brazil)|National Museum of Natural History of Rio de Janeiro]], by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor D. Pedro II]]. Later, he assumed also the associate directorship of the Laboratory of Experimental Physiology, under the [[France|French]] [[physiologist]] [[Louis Couty]], who had been invited to the post. In this position, Lacerda carried out successfully a number of experimental investigations on [[curare]] and the [[poison]]s of Brazilian [[snakes]], [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s. One of his important discoveries was the helpful effect of [[potassium permanganate]] to treat snake bites. In the field of archeo-anthropology, he was one of the first to study human [[fossil]] remains in Brazil and was awarded the bronze medal of the Anthropological Exhibit of [[Paris]] in 1978.

An indefatigable worker, Lacerda also began research on [[microbiology]], [[beriberi]] and [[yellow fever]]. He also studied several [[infectious diseases]] of agricultural importance, such as in horses and cattle. Most of the research carried out in his lab was published in the National Museum's own periodical, the ''Arquivos do Museu Nacional'', as well as in other national and foreign journals.

After Couty died unexpectedly, Lacerda became the Laboratory director and greatly inspiring force; later, he also served as the general director of the National Museum and as a member and president of the Brazilian [[Academia Nacional de Medicina|National Academy of Medicine]].

He is generally considered the father of physiology and pharmacology in Brazil.

==Quote==
:''"In general, in Brazil, the men dedicated to studies and to science constitute a kind of noble proletariat, who exist on small salaries, hardly sufficient for a modest living. Neglecting the frivolous grandeurs of the world and feeling the inexpressible pleasures that scientific research communicates, they comply with this situation and accept it without constraint."''

The '''Louisiana Almanac''' is a regularly updated [[reference work]], published by the [[Gretna, Louisiana]] based [[Pelican Publishing Company]]. New editions are produced typically within a two to four year timespan, although, since the first publication in 1949, the book has been updated from durations between one and six years. The 2006-2007 Edition is the seventeenth version of the almanac.

==Book synopsis==
The Louisiana Almanac is a mesh of [[statistical data]], [[history|historical information]], and often obscure [[trivia]] relating to the [[State of Louisiana]]. Resources are provided in the following categories: general information, tourism, weather and climate, geography, population, sports, history, government, agriculture, economy, health, and transportation. Although often placed where relevant, maps, charts, and graphs are often printed poorly and can be difficult to interpret.

===Chapters===
The current edition (2006-2007) is divided into thirty-one chapters (excluding a foreword, index and list of acknowledgments) and totals 757 pages.

*'''General Information''' (pgs. 7-28): Contains generally basic information included in most almanacs, including calendars, astronomical data, and tables of weights and measures
*'''Touring and Recreation''' (pgs. 29-91): Includes tourism-related information, largely devoted to state parks and various popular tourist attractions and historic places throughout Louisiana
*'''Museums, Exhibition Spaces, and Historic Sites''' (pgs. 92-105): Entire section is composed of a large chart detailing the locations and contact information of museums and other important sites in Louisiana.
*'''Fairs, Festivals, and Celebrations''' (pgs. 106-119): Chapter consists of a list of festivals held within Louisiana, each sorted chronologically by month, with the exception of [[Mardi Gras]], which is detailed of its own accord
*'''History of Louisiana''' (pgs. 120-159): Contains a rather brief history of Louisiana (and the area that would later become Louisiana) beginning from the earliest known Indian settlement and including the state's various flags, the notes to the official state song, and related items.
*'''Important Dates in Louisiana History''' (pgs. 160-181): Chronicles significant dates in the history of the area including present-day Louisiana from [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto's]] 1541 discovery of the [[Mississippi River]] to the impact of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.
*'''Louisiana Superlatives''' (pgs. 182-197): Consists entirely of various (often obscure) "firsts," "bests," and "worsts" in Louisiana history.
*'''Louisiana Weather and Climate''' (pgs. 198-217): Has a variety of weather-related information including all of the following: record temperature extremes, annual rainfall totals, historical hurricane landings, a guide to hurricane preparation and other related subtopics.
*'''Hurricanes Katrina and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]]''' (pgs. 218-225):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7632">'''Luce López-Baralt''' born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] is a professor of [[Spanish literature|Spanish]] and [[Comparative literature|Comparative Literature]] at the [[University of Puerto Rico]].

==Academic career==
Many of her books and articles present for discussion the mystical literature and religious practices of Spain, renaissance and medieval (including al-Andalus), i.e., both Christian and Muslim. She acknowledges the influence of the early 20th century Spanish Arabist, the Rev. [[Miguel Asín Palacios]], among others. In particular, she has followed traces of the trail that show a fruitful interaction between Muslims and Christians in Iberia, e.g., as it affected [[Saint John of the Cross|San Juan de la Cruz]] and [[Saint Teresa of Avila|Santa Teresa de Avila]]. Evidently, this trail continues on, eventually leading also to the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. She has also done work on the literature of [[Puerto Rico]].

Often serving as a visiting professor, she has taught in at various universities in South America, North America, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Her works have been translated into French, English, German, Dutch, Arabic, Urdu, and Persian.

In November 1998, the [[Universidad de Puerto Rico]] held a Congress in honor of Luce López-Baralt and her sister, also an academic, Mercedes López-Baralt (anthropologist, historian, and literary critic).

Professor Luce López-Baralt received her Bachelor of Arts in Hispanic Studies from the Universidad de Puerto Rico, her Masters in Romance Literature from [[New York University]], and her Doctorate in Romance Literature from [[Harvard University]]. She also did post-doctorate work at the [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]], and at the [[American University of Beirut]].

'''''Man Bites Dog''''' ({{lang-fr|'''C'est arrivé près de chez vous'''}}, literally "It has Happened near your Home") is a 1992 [[Cinema of Belgium|Belgian]] [[black comedy]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[mockumentary]] written, produced and directed by [[Rémy Belvaux]], [[André Bonzel]] and [[Benoît Poelvoorde]], who are also the film's co-editor, cinematographer and lead actor respectively.

The film follows a crew of filmmakers following a [[serial killer]], recording his horrific crimes for a [[Documentary film|documentary]] they are producing. At first dispassionate observers, they find themselves caught up in the increasingly chaotic and [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] violence. The film received the [[André Cavens Award for Best Film]] by the [[Belgian Film Critics Association]] (UCC). Since its release, the picture has become a [[cult film]], and received a rare [[NC-17]] rating for its release in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/man-bites-dog,37588/|title=Man Bites Dog|date=28 January 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/07/143296617/what-s-on-your-cult-film-list|title=What's On Your Cult Film List?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ben ([[Benoît Poelvoorde]]) is a witty, charismatic [[serial killer]] who holds forth at length about whatever comes to mind, be it the "craft" of murder, the failings of architecture, his own poetry, or classical music, which he plays with his girlfriend Valerie (Valérie Parent). A film crew joins him on his [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] adventures, recording them for a [[fly on the wall]] documentary. Ben takes them to meet his family and friends while boasting of murdering many people at random and dumping their bodies in canals and quarries. The viewer witnesses these grisly killings in graphic detail.

Ben ventures into apartment buildings, explaining how it is more cost-effective to attack old people than young couples because the former have more cash at home and are easier to kill. In a following scene, he screams wildly at an elderly lady, causing her to have a heart attack. As she lies dying, he casually remarks that this method saved him a bullet. Ben continues his candid explanations and appalling rampage, shooting, strangling, and beating to death anyone who comes his way: women (he is [[Misogyny|misogynistic]]), immigrants (he is a [[Racism|racist]] [[Xenophobia|xenophobe]]), and postmen (his favorite targets).

The camera crew becomes more and more involved in the murders, first as accomplices but eventually taking an active part in them. When Ben invades a home and kills an entire family, they help him hold down a young boy and smother him. They meet a competing camera crew and take turns shooting the three men. During filming, two of Ben's crew are killed; their deaths are later called "occupational hazards" by a crew member.

When Ben takes a couple hostage in their own home, he holds the man at gunpoint while he and the crew gang-rape the woman. The following morning, the camera dispassionately records the aftermath: the woman has been butchered with a knife, her entrails spilling out, and the man has been shot to death. Ben's violence becomes more and more random until he kills an acquaintance in front of his girlfriend and friends during a birthday dinner. Spattered with blood, they act as though nothing horrible has happened, continuing to offer Ben presents. The film crew disposes of the body for Ben.

After a victim flees before he can be killed, Ben is arrested, but he escapes. At this point someone starts taking revenge on him and his family. Ben discovers that his parents have been killed, along with his girlfriend Valerie: a flautist, she has been murdered in a particularly humiliating manner, with her flute inserted into her anus. This prompts Ben to decide that he must leave. He meets the camera crew to say farewell, but in the middle of reciting a poem he is abruptly shot dead by an off-camera gunman. The camera crew is then picked off one by one. After the camera falls, it keeps running, and the film ends with the death of the fleeing sound recordist.

==Production==
The film is shot in [[Black-and-white|black and white]] and was produced on a shoe-string budget by four student filmmakers, led by director [[Rémy Belvaux]]. The film's writers, Belvaux, Poelvoorde and Bonzel, all appear in the film using their own first names: Poelvoorde as Ben, the killer; Belvaux as Rémy, the director; and Bonzel as André, the camera operator. The genesis of the idea came from shooting a documentary without any money. This film is rated [[NC-17]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for "strong [[graphic violence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103905/|title=Man Bites Dog|date=15 January 1993|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Man Bites Dog - censored poster.jpg|thumb|right|The censored film poster]]
Although it is never shown or suggested in the film itself that Benoit kills a baby, the original poster features an image of a baby's pacifier with spattering blood coming from an unseen target at the end of Benoit's gun. For foreign release posters (not including the [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]]/[[Australia]]n release), the baby's pacifier was changed to a set of dentures.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the R-rated version of the film that was made for the U.S. video audience (as NC-17 rated films were never allowed to be stocked at [[Blockbuster Video]]), the scenes where Ben and the crew work together to kill a young child are excised; the following scenes where Ben rapes a woman and the camera crew joins in are included but edited to have less nudity and gore.

==Reception==
''Man Bites Dog'' received positive reviews upon release. Based on 18 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 72%, with an average score of 7.1/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_bites_dog/|title=Man Bites Dog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LA Times film critic Kenneth Turan highly praises the film upon its release  "''Man Bites Dog'' defines audacity. An assured, seductive chamber of horrors, it marries nightmare with humor and then abruptly takes the laughter away. Intentionally disturbing, it is close to the last word about the nature of violence on film, a troubling, often funny vision of what the movies have done to our souls.... The deserving winner of the International Critics Award at Cannes ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-02/entertainment/ca-18344_1_man-bites-dog|title=MOVIE REVIEW :  'Man Bites Dog': Seductive Nature of Violence :  The ragtag production allows us to cozy up to its charming killer, then, realizing his heinousness, gag on our self-satisfied black laughter.|first=KENNETH|last=TURAN|date=2 April 1993|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Rob Gonsalves called the film  "[an] original, a stark and (sorry) biting work far more complex, both stylistically and thematically, than first meets the eye." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=1093&amp;reviewer=416|title=Movie Review - Man Bites Dog - eFilmCritic|first=Ben|last=Nieporent|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was screened at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]] where it won the International Critics’ Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/718-man-bites-dog|title=Man Bites Dog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SACD award for Best Feature and the Special Award of the Youth for directors Rémy Belvaux, André Bonzel and Benoît Poelvoorde.&lt;ref name="thequietus.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/10016-man-bites-dog-remy-belvaux-andre-bonzel-benoit-poelvoorde-20-years-on|title=The Quietus - Film - Film Features - 20 Years On: Man Bites Dog Revisited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's controversial content and extreme violence was off-putting to some viewers, and resulted in the film being banned in Sweden.&lt;ref name="thequietus.com"/&gt; In 2003, the video was banned in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No.24 - 227-235 - 25032003|url=http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/archive/2003/march/2003%2003%2025%20IO%20Issue.pdf|website=[[Iris Oifigiúil]]|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] '''National Recording Preservation Board''' selects recorded sounds for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Recording Registry|National Recording]] Registry. The National Recording Registry was initiated to maintain and preserve "sound recordings that are culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"; to be eligible, recordings must be at least ten years old. Members of the Board also advise the [[Librarian of Congress]] on ongoing development and implementation of the national recorded sound preservation program.

The National Recording Preservation Board (NRPB) is a federal agency located within the Library of Congress. The NRPB was established by the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-474).&lt;ref name="NRPB"&gt;{{cite web |author=  |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-home.html |publisher= The Library of Congress |title= Current Registry |date=2006-11-03 |accessdate=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation also created both the [[National Recording Registry]] and the non-profit [[National Recording Preservation Foundation]],&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite web |author=  |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-about.html |publisher= The Library of Congress |title= Overview |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is loosely affiliated with the National Recording Preservation Board, but the private-sector Foundation (NRPF) and federal Board (NRPB) are separate, legally distinct entities.

The main responsibilities of the board are:&lt;ref name="O" /&gt;
* Develop the National Recording Registry selection criteria
* Recommend and review nominees
* Develop a National Recording Preservation Study and Action Plan comparable to those by the [[National Film Preservation Board]]

==Organization==

[[File:Endor.jpg|thumb|Illustration portraying a scene from the Bible wherein the [[Witch of Endor]] uses a necromantic ritual to conjure the spirit of [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] at the behest of [[Saul the King|Saul]]; from the frontispiece of ''Sadducismus Triumphatus'' (1681) by [[Joseph Glanvill]].]]
'''Necromancy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɛ|k|r|ə|m|æ|n|s|i}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EPD|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Necromancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] involving communication with the [[Death|deceased]] – either by [[Evocation|summoning]] their [[spirit]] as an [[Ghost|apparition]] or raising them bodily – for the purpose of [[divination]], imparting the means to foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge, to bring someone back from the dead, or to use the deceased as a weapon, as the term may sometimes be used in a more general sense to refer to [[black magic]] or [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[Webster's Dictionary#Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]] | title = necromancy | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/necromancy | edition = 11th |date=April 2008 | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield, MA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[Oxford Dictionary of English]] | title = necromancy | url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/necromancy | edition = 3rd rev. |date=August 2010 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = [[Oxford|Oxford, UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "necromancy" is adapted from [[Late Latin]] ''necromantia'', itself borrowed from [[Koine Greek|post-Classical Greek]] νεκρομαντεία (''nekromanteía''), a compound of [[Ancient Greek]] νεκρός (''nekrós''), "dead body", and μαντεία (''manteía''), "divination by means of"; this compound form was first used by [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]] in the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) | title = necromancy, ''n.'' | url = http://oed.com/view/Entry/125700 | edition = 3rd | date = September 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical Greek term was ἡ νέκυια (''[[nekyia]]''), from the episode of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' in which Odysseus visits the realm of the dead and νεκρομαντεία in Hellenistic Greek, rendered as ''necromantīa'' in [[Classical Latin|Latin]], and as ''necromancy'' in 17th-century English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/125745 necyomancy, ''n.''], ''OED''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antiquity ==
{{Main|Magic in the Greco-Roman world}}
Early necromancy was related to – and most likely evolved from – [[shamanism]], which calls upon spirits such as the [[ghost]]s of ancestors. Classical necromancers addressed the dead in "a mixture of high-pitch squeaking and low droning", comparable to the [[Trance|trance-state]] mutterings of shamans.&lt;ref&gt;Luck, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
Necromancy was prevalent throughout Western antiquity with records of its practice in ancient [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In his ''[[Geographica]]'', [[Strabo]] refers to νεκρομαντία (''nekromantia''), or "diviners by the dead", as the foremost practitioners of divination among the people of [[Parthian Empire|Persia]],&lt;ref&gt;Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239:book=16:chapter=2:section=39 Book XVI, Chapter 2, Section 39].&lt;/ref&gt; and it is believed to have also been widespread among the peoples of [[Chaldea]] (particularly the [[Sabians]], or "star-worshipers"), [[Etruria]] and Babylonia. The Babylonian necromancers were called ''manzazuu'' or ''sha'etemmu'', and the spirits they raised were called ''etemmu''.

The oldest literary account of necromancy is found in [[Homer]]’s ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 808.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruickbie, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of [[Circe]], a powerful sorceress, [[Odysseus]] travels to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] (''[[katabasis]]'') in order to gain insight about his impending voyage home by raising the spirits of the dead through the use of spells which Circe has taught him. He wishes to invoke and question the [[Shade (mythology)|shade]] of [[Tiresias]] in particular; however, he is unable to summon the seer's spirit without the assistance of others. The ''Odyssey'''s passages contain many descriptive references to necromantic rituals: rites must be performed around a pit with fire during nocturnal hours, and Odysseus has to follow a specific recipe, which includes the blood of sacrificial animals, to concoct a libation for the ghosts to drink while he recites prayers to both the ghosts and gods of the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Homer. ''Odyssey'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0218:book=10:card=10 Book X, Lines 10–11], and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0218:book=11:card=1 Book XI].&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices such as these, varying from the mundane to the grotesque, were commonly associated with necromancy. Rituals could be quite elaborate, involving [[magic circle]]s, [[wand]]s, [[talisman]]s, and [[incantation]]s. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and unfermented grape juice. Some necromancers even went so far as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses.&lt;ref&gt;Guiley, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of [[burial|interment]] or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased’s ghostly spirit instead.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some cultures considered the knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades knew only certain things. The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death. [[Ovid]] writes in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of a marketplace in the underworld where the dead convene to exchange news and gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Luck, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'', [[wikisource:Metamorphoses/Book IV#The Transformation of Ino and Melicerta to Sea-Gods|Book IV, Fable VII, Lines 440–464]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several references to necromancers – called "bone-conjurers" among Jews of the later [[Hellenistic period]]&lt;ref&gt;Luck, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; – in the [[Bible]]. The [[Deuteronomy|Book of Deuteronomy]] ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Deuteronomy#18:9|18:9–12]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[wikisource:Tanakh/Torah/Devarim#Devarim 18|''Tanakh, Torah, Devarim'' 18:9–12]].&lt;/ref&gt;) explicitly warns the [[Israelites]] against engaging in the [[Canaan#Canaan in the Hebrew Bible|Canaanite]] practice of divination from the dead: {{Quote|&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;There shall not be found among you any one who maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or who useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;For all who do these things are an abomination unto the LORD, and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee ([[Authorized King James Version|KJV]]).}} Though Mosaic Law prescribed the [[List of capital crimes in the Torah|death penalty]] to practitioners of necromancy ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Leviticus#20:27|Leviticus 20:27]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[wikisource:Tanakh/Torah/Vayikra#Vayikra 20|''Tanakh, Torah, Vayikra'' 20:27]].&lt;/ref&gt;), this warning was not always heeded. One of the foremost examples is when [[Saul the King|King Saul]] had the [[Witch of Endor]] invoke the Spirit of [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], a [[Biblical judges|judge]] and [[prophet]], from [[Sheol]] using a ritual conjuring pit ([[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#28:3|1 Samuel 28:3–25]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a28.htm#3 ''Tanakh, Nevi'im, Shmu'el Aleph'' 28:3–25].&lt;/ref&gt;).  However, the so-called witch was shocked at the presence of the real spirit of Samuel for in I Sam 28:12 it says, "when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice." Samuel questioned his reawakening asking, "Why hast thou disquieted me?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saul did not receive a death penalty (his being the highest authority in the land) but he did receive it from God himself as prophesied by Samuel during that conjuration &amp;ndash; within a day he died in battle along with his son Jonathan.

Some Christian writers later rejected the idea that humans could bring back the spirits of the dead and interpreted such shades as disguised [[demon]]s instead, thus conflating necromancy with demon summoning. [[Caesarius of Arles]] entreats his audience to put no stock in any demons or gods other than the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], even if the working of spells appears to provide benefit. He states that demons only act with divine permission and are permitted by God to test Christian people. Caesarius does not condemn man here; he only states that the art of necromancy exists, although it is prohibited by the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Kors &amp; Peters, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some Christians believe that necromancy is real (along with other facets of the occult "magic") but God has not suffered Christians to deal with those spirits (Deuteronomy 18:14). Still others believe the phantom of Samuel to be a trick, like the hoax séances conducted by many early 20th century illusionist spiritualists, which fooled those recording the events of Samuel's life.

== Early and High Middle Ages ==

Many medieval writers believed that actual [[resurrection]] required the assistance of God. They saw the practice of necromancy as conjuring demons who took the appearance of spirits. The practice became known explicitly as [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]], and the Catholic Church condemned it.&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer 2011, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the practitioners of necromancy were linked by many common threads, there is no evidence that these necromancers ever organized as a group.

Medieval necromancy is believed{{by whom|date=March 2015}} to be a synthesis of [[Astral plane|astral]] magic derived from Arabic influences and [[exorcism]] derived from Christian and Jewish teachings. Arabic influences are evident in rituals that involve moon phases, sun placement, day and time. Fumigation and the act of burying images are also found in both astral magic and necromancy. Christian and Jewish influences appear in the symbols and in the conjuration formulas used in summoning rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer 2011, pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners were often members of the Christian clergy, though some nonclerical practitioners are recorded. In some instances, mere apprentices or those ordained to lower orders dabbled in the practice. They were connected by a belief in the manipulation of spiritual beings – especially demons – and magical practices. These practitioners were almost always literate and well educated. Most possessed basic knowledge of exorcism and had access to texts of [[astrology]] and of [[demonology]]. Clerical training was informal and university-based education rare. Most were trained under apprenticeships and were expected to have a basic knowledge of Latin, ritual and doctrine. This education was not always linked to spiritual guidance and seminaries were almost non-existent. This situation allowed some aspiring clerics to combine Christian rites with [[occult]] practices despite its condemnation in Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer 2011, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval practitioners believed they could accomplish three things with necromancy: will manipulation, illusions, and knowledge:

* Will manipulation affects the mind and will of another person, animal, or spirit. Demons are summoned to cause various afflictions on others, "to drive them mad, to inflame them to love or hatred, to gain their favor, or to constrain them to do or not do some deed."&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer 2011, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Illusions involve reanimation of the dead or conjuring food, entertainment, or a mode of transportation.
* Knowledge is allegedly discovered when demons provide information about various things. This might involve identifying criminals, finding items, or revealing future events.

The act of performing medieval necromancy usually involved magic circles, conjurations, and sacrifices such as those shown in the ''[[Munich Manual of Demonic Magic]]'':

* Circles were usually traced on the ground, though cloth and parchment were sometimes used. Various objects, shapes, symbols, and letters may be drawn or placed within that represent a mixture of Christian and occult ideas. Circles were believed to empower and protect what was contained within, including protecting the necromancer from the conjured demons.
* Conjuration is the method of communicating with the demons to have them enter the physical world. It usually employs the power of special words and stances to call out the demons and often incorporated the use of Christian prayers or biblical verses. These conjurations may be repeated in succession or repeated to different directions until the summoning is complete.
* [[Sacrifice]] was the payment for summoning; though it may involve the flesh of a human being or animal, it could sometimes be as simple as offering a certain object. Instructions for obtaining these items were usually specific. The time, location, and method of gathering items for sacrifice could also play an important role in the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer 2011, pp. 159–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare confessions of those accused of necromancy suggest that there was a range of spell casting and related magical experimentation. It is difficult to determine if these details were due to their practices, as opposed to the whims of their interrogators. [[John of Salisbury]] is one of the first examples related by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], but as a Parisian [[ecclesiastical court]] record of 1323 shows, a "group who were plotting to invoke the demon Berich from inside a circle made from strips of cat skin" were obviously participating in what the Church would define as "necromancy".&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer 1998, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Stanley Redgrove claims necromancy as one of three chief branches of medieval [[ceremonial magic]], alongside [[black magic]] and [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Redgrove, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not correspond to contemporary classifications, which often conflate "nigromancy" ("black-knowledge") with "necromancy" ("death-knowledge").

== Late Middle Ages to Renaissance ==
{{Further|Renaissance magic}}
[[File:A Magician by Edward Kelly.jpg|thumb|Engraving of occultists [[John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] "in the act of invoking the spirit of a deceased person"; from ''Astrology'' (1806) by [[Ebenezer Sibly]].]]
In the wake of inconsistencies of judgment, necromancers and other practitioners of the magic arts were able to utilize spells featuring holy names with impunity, as any biblical references in such [[ritual]]s could be construed as prayers rather than [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]]. As a consequence, the necromancy that appears in the ''Munich Manual'' is an evolution of these theoretical understandings. It has been suggested that the authors of the ''Manual'' knowingly designed the book to be in discord with [[ecclesiastical law]]. The main recipe employed throughout the ''Manual'' used the same religious language and names of power alongside demonic names. An understanding of the names of God derived from [[Apocrypha|apocryphal texts]] and the [[Torah|Hebrew Torah]] required that the author of such rites have at least a casual familiarity with these sources.

Within the tales related in occult manuals are found connections with stories from other cultures' literary traditions. For instance, the ceremony for conjuring a horse closely relates to the Arabic ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and French [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]]; [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer’s]] ''[[The Squire's Tale]]'' also bears marked similarities.&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer 1998, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes a parallel evolution of spells to foreign gods or demons that were once acceptable, and frames them into a new Christian context, albeit demonic and forbidden. As the material for these manuals was apparently derived from scholarly magical and religious texts from a variety of sources in many languages, the scholars who studied these texts likely manufactured their own aggregate sourcebook and manual with which to work spells or magic.

In the notebooks of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], it is stated that "Of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which deals with the belief in Necromancy, the sister of [[Alchemy]], which gives birth to simple and natural things."&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo. ''Notebooks'', [[wikisource:The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci/XIX#On spirits (1211-1213)|Volume 2, Chapter XIX, Section III:1213]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern era ==
In the present day, necromancy is more generally used as a term to describe the pretense of manipulation of death and the dead, often facilitated through the use of ritual magic or some other kind of occult ceremony. Contemporary [[séance]]s, [[Mediumship|channeling]] and [[Spiritualism]] verge on necromancy when supposedly invoked spirits are asked to reveal future events or secret information. Necromancy may also be presented as sciomancy, a branch of [[Theurgy|theurgic magic]].

Because of their themes of spirit contact, the long-running show [[Supernatural Chicago]] and the annual [[Harry Houdini]] séance, both of which are held at the [[Excalibur (nightclub)|Excalibur]] nightclub in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], dub their lead performer "[[Neil Tobin]], Necromancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.supernaturalchicago.com | title = Supernatural Chicago | work = [[Excalibur (nightclub)|Excalibur Nightclub]] | accessdate = April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the practice of necromancy having endured in one form or another throughout the millennia, ''An Encyclopædia of Occultism'' states: {{Quote|The art is of almost universal usage. Considerable difference of opinion exists among modern adepts as to the exact methods to be properly pursued in the necromantic art, and it must be borne in mind that necromancy, which in the Middle Ages was called sorcery, shades into modern spiritualistic practice. There is no doubt, however, that necromancy is the touch-stone of occultism, for if, after careful preparation the adept can carry through to a successful issue, the raising of the soul from the other world, he has proved the value of his art.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In popular culture==
Necromancy appears in many works of fantasy fiction, often by villains who use it to raise armies of zombies the heroes must slay.  Necromancy is a popular plot element in video games, such as ''[[Diablo 2]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Gothic (video game)|Gothic]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', as well as in the [[tabletop role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''.  In the film ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992) the protagonist [[Ash Williams|Ash]] fights a [[skeleton (undead)|skeletal]] army raised by the ''[[Necronomicon]]''. Necromancer is the main protagonist of [[Tony Vilgotsky]]'s novel ''Shepherd of the Dead''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rostov.aif.ru/society/persona/dobryy_mag_protiv_sil_zla_o_chyom_pervyy_roman-fentezi_pro_rostov-na-donu Valentina Vartsaba.

A '''notice of electronic filing (NEF)''' is part of the system established by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]] through the docketing and access systems of [[PACER (law)|PACER]] &amp; [[CM/ECF]]. PACER is a public-access system accessible by any person after registration and for a fee.&lt;ref name="Pacer Billing"&gt;[http://www.pacer.gov/billing/ PACER Billing Information]&lt;/ref&gt;  CM/ECF is the Case Management/Electronic Court Filing system, available only to those admitted to a particular U.S. District or U.S. Court of Appeals. The NEF provides a record of [[Service of process|service]] of an electronically filed document by parties, or of service of the electronically filed orders and judgments of the courts, upon attorneys in the case and the court. For such parties, the NEF has replaced the traditional service via US Mail or other "paper" methods. ('''Figures 1, 2''')

==Sources of information==
The central source for information regarding NEFs remains in [[CM/ECF]] manuals.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://efile.andersonlaw.net/ Anderson's Unofficial Manual for e-filing at the Central district of California. No Official Manual existed.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caed/DOCUMENTS/CMECF/UserManual.pdf Official Manual of the Eastern District of California]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/cmecf/pdf/SDCA_Users_manual.pdf Official Manual of the Southern District of California]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:MxhAitN1ZekJ:west.thomson.com/store/filingandshelvingdownload.aspx%3Ffile%3D12942_2008329_135333.pdf+northern+district+of+illinois+cm/ecf+manual&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESibX6mf-QKkbkmvQ7DB6JN3qCYs2lLHODLLTNo4BxdpajoFAJ4sFax8rb0NHzGP05V3fNLFfyGvmFHuvcitHdh-1QjKVTY5NcpAMURpIQqWywiJDJaF5vujqLnPPiKCRP_28W-k&amp;sig=AHIEtbTeIuioblVZauGwfFnvZHdjeAxVZQ Compilations of Local Rules of U.S. District Courts]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the most explicit definition of the power and effect of NEF in the Central District of California, one of the most populous in the U.S., including Los Angeles County, remained in the "Unofficial Manual" of CM/ECF as follows (Rev 07, 2008, page 13):&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;

'''L. The Notice of Electronic Filing'''

The system will present you with a notice of electronic filing ("NEF") screen and will also e-mail you a copy of the NEF. The notice of electronic filing ("NEF") is your proof that the document has been E-Filed. You should print the screen to a piece of paper or a PDF (or both) before proceeding, because you will need to attach the NEF as the last page of the courtesy copy that you submit to the Court. The NEF includes a "document number" and a link. Be sure to note that document number, as you will need it if you need to e-mail a proposed order to the Court. The NEF also includes an "Electronic Document Stamp" which is a string of letters and numbers which Court staff can use to verify the authenticity of the NEF. The NEF also contains the path and file name of the document you uploaded and any attachments.}}

A more specific definition is found in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas Administrative Policies and Procedures for Electronic Filing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/ecf/docs/efileprocd.pdf] United States District Court for the Western District of Texas,Administrative Policies and Procedures for Electronic Filing, April 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 2: Definitions and Related Requirements:''' (page 5)

...

h. Notice of Electronic Filing ("NEF") is an electronic notice automatically generated by the Electronic Filing System at the time a document is docketed. The NEF includes the time of filing and docketing, the name of the party and Filing User filing the document, the type of document, the text of the docket entry, the name of the party and Filing User receiving the notice. If a document is attached to the docket entry, the NEF will contain a Hyperlink to the filed document allowing recipients to retrieve the document.

...

'''Section 7: Consequences of Electronic Filing''' (page 11)

a. Electronic transmission of a document through the Electronic Filing System constitutes the filing of the document pursuant to Rule 5(e), FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, and Rule 49, FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. 

b. The transmission of a NEF constitutes entry on the docket pursuant to Rules 58 and
79, FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, and Rules 49 and 55, FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. 

...

'''Section 16: Notice of Court Orders and Judgments'''

a. Immediately upon entry of an order or judgment, the Clerk will transmit a NEF to
Filing Users. Transmission of the NEF constitutes the notice required by Rule 77(d),
FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, and Rule 49(c), FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE. The Clerk will send paper copies of orders and judgments to non-Filing
Users.}}

The General Order 08-02 of the US District Court, Central District of California provided additional information, pertaining to the significance of the "electronic document stamp" in the process of entry:
&lt;ref&gt;[US District Court Central District of California: General Order 08-02, February 7.2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IV. Electronic Filing.''' (page 17)

...

'''O. Certification of Electronic Documents.''' Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 44(a)(1) and 44(c), the method of electronic certification described herein is deemed proof of an official court record maintained by the Clerk of Court. The NEF contains the date of electronic distribution and identification of the United States District Court for the Central District of California as the sender.  An encrypted verification code appears in the electronic document stamp section of the NEF. The electronic document stamp shall be used for the purpose of confirming the authenticity of the transmission and associated document(s) with the Clerk of Court, as necessary. When a document has been electronically filed into CMIECF, the official record is the electronic recording of the document kept in the custody of the Clerk of Court. The NEF provides certification that the associated document(s) is a true and correct copy of the original filed with the court.}}

Although such information is derived from disparate US courts, it can be assumed to be universally applicable, since the basic platforms of PACER and CM/ECF were universally implemented in all US courts.  However, significant variations are found in the manner in which the NEFs are employed. ('''Figures 2,3,4''')

==Significance==
As documented, above, in the texts from the US District Courts in California and Texas, the NEF today serves as the form of authentication by the Clerk and counsel of the entry of records, in same way as the traditional Certificate of Service.

The CM/ECF system includes a Document Verification Utility, which permits the user to enter the case number and document number.  The Utility, available to counsel on the case and the court, then compares the current version of the document with the NEF's Electronic Document Stamp and verifies that the document, as it appears on the docket, was not altered. ('''Figures 5,6''').

==Criticism==
The Notice of Electronic Filing has come under some criticism for not being a public document and therefore not available to non-participants in the related case(s). This has led some pro-se litigants and others to misinterpret what an NEF is and its significance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/38328585/] Zernik, J: Data Mining of Online Judicial Records of the Networked US Federal Courts, International Journal on Social Media: Monitoring, Measurement, Mining, 1:69–83 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6273">The '''Ohio Web Library''' is a large collection of over 280 electronic information resources, or online [[databases]], provided by [[Libraries Connect Ohio]] (LCO), which is composed of four major Ohio library networks — [[OPLIN]], [[OhioLINK]], [[INFOhio]], and the [[State Library of Ohio]]. Within these licensed databases are almost 31,000 individual electronic [[Periodicals|serial]] titles (i.e., publications with ISSN), and the databases are accessed through a [[federated search]] tool or [[Metasearch engine|meta search engine]] with a simple interface.

LCO can cooperatively purchase access to these statewide resources at a cost-effective rate whereas most individual libraries would not be able to afford them on their own. These subscription-based research databases are available for free to all Ohio residents regardless of their location, age, education, or economic status and include online publications and research resources, such as [[scholarly journal]]s, popular [[magazine]]s, [[trade publications]], [[newspaper]]s (Ohio and nationwide), encyclopedias, dictionaries, and educational/training tutorials.&lt;ref name="owl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohioweblibrary.org/about.php|title=About Ohio Web Library|website=Ohio Web Library|publisher=Ohio Public Library|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and Governance ==
The Ohio Web Library is funded by a federal [[IMLS]] [[Library Services and Technology Act]] (LSTA) grant through the State Library of Ohio, which provides about $1.5 million per year. The three LCO library networks — OPLIN, OhioLINK, and INFOhio — provide an additional $3 million in state funds each year from their budgets. The federal LSTA grant that helps fund the Ohio Web Library is a temporary funding measure that expires every June 30. No permanent funding is in place to sustain these resources or to expand them.&lt;ref name="owl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.ohio.gov/Marketing/PR/2008/July|title=Ohio Web Library - New and Improved|date=July 3, 2008|website=State Library of Ohio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825201223/http://www.library.ohio.gov/Marketing/PR/2008/July|archive-date=August 25, 2014|access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ohio Web Library resources are purchased by Ohio libraries and library organizations for exclusive use by Ohio residents. This system uses IP address recognition to verify whether someone is located in Ohio, but these resources can also be accessed by providing an Ohio [[public library]] card number for user authentication.

== Collaborative Library Organizations ==
The Ohio Web Library is a [[collaborative]] effort of Ohio libraries and the following library organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.librariesconnectohio.org|title=Libraries Connect Ohio|website=Libraries Connect Ohio|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[INFOhio]]

* [[Ohio Public Library Information Network|Ohio Public Library Information Network (OPLIN)]]
* [[State Library of Ohio|State Library of Ohio (SLO)]]

== Ohio Public Library Information Network (OPLIN) ==
The [[Ohio Public Library Information Network]] (OPLIN) provides [[Broadband Internet access|broadband Internet]] connections and related information services to [[Ohio]] [[Public library|public libraries]]. Its primary mission is to ensure that all Ohio residents have free public Internet access through the 251 independent local public library systems in Ohio, as well as the use of research databases not freely available on the World Wide Web.

As a state government agency, OPLIN receives extensive fiscal support services from the State Library of Ohio and contracts with the Ohio Office of Information Technology for assistance with network management. Most of the budget is used to purchase the services provided to Ohio public libraries, primarily Internet access and information databases. Because OPLIN provides these services, public libraries do not need to pay for them from their individual budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oplin.ohio.gov/about|title=About OPLIN|website=OPLIN|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Russian Chronicles''' (''{{lang-ru|Древнерусские летописи}} {{lang-uk|Давньоруські літописи}}'') or '''Old Russian Letopisi''' are type of written sources in [[Rus' (region)|Old Rus']], main type of Old Russian historical literature, composed from 11th to 18th centuries. Chronicles are among the most extensive monuments of Old Russian literature and one of the leading genres of it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Lurye, Yakov. Letopisi // Literature of Old Rus'. Biographical and Bibliographical Dictionary / ed. by Oleg Tvorogov. - Moscow: Prosvescheniye ("Enlightenment"), 1996. ({{lang-ru|[http://interpretive.ru/dictionary/1311/word/letopisi Лурье Я.С. Летописи] // Литература Древней Руси. Биобиблиографический словарь / под ред. О.В. Творогова. - М.: Просвещение, 1996}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronicles were main form of Russian historical narrative until the middle of the 16th century, the time of [[Ivan the Terrible]], when they gave primacy to another [[Historiography|historiographical]] genre — chronographs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Copies==

Old Russian Chronicles survive in some hundreds сopies (codices). Some Chronicles known in multiple сopies, others - in only one copy. Every chronicle was a ''svod'', i.e. collection because it included (collected) materials from some previous chronicles, which were revised, shortened or added, and entries on the events of the last years or decades belonged to the chronicler. The scholar determined several tens of svods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Сharacteristic==

Chroniclers were mainly churchmen. Old Russian Chronicles were composed in monasteries, at the princely (see: [[knyaz]]) courts (later at the [[Russian Tsar|tsar]]'s courts) and in the offices of [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]. Chronicles often contradicted each other on estimation of events and in factual basis. Chronicles were a set of annual entries, that is messages about the events which happened in each year. Mostly there were short factual entries, but sometimes  chronicler used literary form of the narrative on the most significant events of Russian history. In annual entries, chronicler often included addresses and dialogues of princes, literary phrases: stable speech formulas, [[epithet]]s, rhetorical figures and others.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Aleksey Shakhmatov]] was the largest expert in [[Textual criticism|textology]] of Old Russian Сhronicles, and he considered that the main part of сhronicle texts were ''svods'', that is collections of separate records from different sources, and every new сhronicle was a svod of some previous сhronicles and new historical records&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[[Aleksey Shakhmatov]].

Греков; АН СССР, Институт литературы. – М.; Л.: Издательство АН СССР, 1938. — 372 с.}}).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent studies, besides svods, considerable part of chronicle text is admitted as annual records, which were regularly being conducted at certain state or church office - as West European [[annals]]. For example, hypothetical "Novrorod Archbishop Сhronicle" was being conducted at the office of [[Diocese of Novgorod and Staraya Russa|Novgorod archdiocese]] from 12th to 14th centuries and was main basis of [[Novgorod First Chronicle]] of 15th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://annals.xlegio.ru/rus/small/nis1npl.htm Гиппиус А.А.

Sources for the oldest chronicles, including [[Primary Chronicle]], were [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] texts (on [[sacred history]] and other subjects), including Chronicle of [[George Hamartolos]] on [[Generations of Noah|Table of Nations]] (in Primary Chronicle)&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Petrukhin|Petrukhin, Vladimir]].

==Chronicle Genealogy by [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]]==

Primary Chronicle of the beginning of the 12th century is the oldest survived Russian chronicle, narrating the earliest history of Rus'. However Shakhmatov paid attention on abundance of entries of 11th century about [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]], which are read in Novgorod First Chronicle (of the 15th century), but absent in Primary Chronicle. This and some others textual facts were a base for his theory on the beginning of Novgorod First Chronicle includes text, older than Primary Chronicle. The scholar named it "Primary Svod" (Collection) and dated as the end of 11th century. This svod was also a basis for Primary Chronicle. If two or more сhronicle coincide with each other up to a certain year, one сhronicle copied from another (this is rarely) or this сhronicles had a common source, arrived to this year - older svod. Shakhmatov discovered and developed a method of study on chronicle (svod) genealogy. Rested on deep textual analysis, Shakhmatov built extensive genealogy of Old Russian Chronicles. He connected most of this chronicles and created genealogy table, in which extant chronicles of 14th-17th centuries went back not only to "Primary Svod", but also to earlier hypothetical svods of 11th century and even to historical records of the end of 10th century. Shakhmatov's method and theories began a mainstream in Russian Chronicle studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Бобров А.Г. Новгородские летописи XV века. — СПб.: Дмитрий Буланин, 2000. — 287 с.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to scholars who are the followers of Shakhmatov, Russian Chronicles were systematically being conducted since the middle of the 11th century. There were two centers of Russian Chronicle conduct in the early period: [[Kiev]] (the capital of early Rus') and [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]]. A result of Kievan and Novgorodian chronicle records of 11th century was Primary Chronicle (of the beginning of the 12th century), and also text containing in Novgorod First Chronicle. Primary Chronicle survives in [[Laurentian Codex|Laurentian]] and [[Hypatian Codex|Hypatian]] chronicles (codices). This two centers, South and North, were remaining later. Chronicles of South Russian [[Principality|princedoms]] (knyazhestva) of 12th-13th centuries survives in Hypatian Chronicle:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; hypothetical "Kievan Chronicle",&lt;ref&gt;In quotes, there are hypothetical chronicle, existence of which is supposed in textology studies&lt;/ref&gt; chosen from Hypatian Chronicle, was a continuation of Primary Chronicle and covered events from 1118 to 1200; [[Galician–Volhynian Chronicle]], also containing in Hypatian Chronicle, covered events in [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Galician and Volhynian]] princedoms from 1201 to 1292.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.molitvoslov.by/2014/letopis-ipatevskaja-slovar-knizhnikov.html Лихачева О.П.

Hypatian Chronicle of the end of the 13th - the beginning of the 14th centuries is an All-Russian svod in south redaction (presumedly). It survives in сopies of 15th-18th centuries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Laurentian Chronicle of 14th century is a svod from North-East Rus' ([[Vladimir-Suzdal]]). One copy of 1377.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molitvoslov.by/2014/letopis-ipatevskaja-slovar-knizhnikov.html Лурье Я.С. Летопись Лаврентьевская] // Словарь книжников и книжности Древней Руси / АН СССР. ИРЛИ; Отв. ред. [[Dmitry Likhachov|Д.С. Лихачев]]. — Л.: Наука, 1987. — Вып. 1 (XI – первая половина XIV в.).&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Tver]]ian svod" of 1375 reflected in Rogozhskiy Chronicler and Tverian Collection of 16th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Chronicle svod, related with [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of Moscow, was continued up to 1408 and survived in Troitskaya ("[[Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius|Trinity]]") Chronicle, which burnt in [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|1812 Fire of Moscow]]. It was reconstructed by Mikhail Prisyolkov.&lt;ref&gt;Приселков М.Д. Троицкая летопись: Реконструкция текста. – 2-е изд. – СПб.: Наука, 2002. – 512, [2] с.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronicle svod was made in Tver about 1412, it reflected additional revision (similar to Troitskaya Chronicle) of All-Russian svod of the end of the 14th - the beginning of the 15th century. This "Tverian svod" reflected in Simeon Chronicle and Rogozhskiy Chronicler. "[[Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod]]" of the 1430s (or "Svod of 1448" according to Shakhmatov) was compiled at office of Moscow Metropolitan and united All-Russian and Novgorodian chronicles. The svod was preserved in [[Sofia First Chronicle|Sofia First]] and [[Novgorod Fourth Chronicle|Novgorod Fourth]] chronicles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

First known [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscow]] [[grand prince]]ly appeared at the middle of the 15th century. "Chronicle Svod of 1472" reflected in [[Vologda]]-[[Perm]] and Nicanor chronicles. Basis of "Svod of 1472" was "Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod", edited by Moscow grand princely chronicler, who brought censorship, excluded in particular the mentions of Novgorodian liberty, because [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod State]] was joint to [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscow Grand Princedom]]. In the end of the 1470s, "Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod", the svod similar to Troitskaya Chronicle and other sources was compiled together. This compilation was censored even more than "Svod of 1472". The "Compilation of the 1470s" reflected in "Moscow Grand Princely Svod of 1479", surviving in copy of 18th century, and in its later redaction was continued up to 1492. This "Svod of 1479" underlied all of official сhronicles of the end of the 15th - the 16th centuries. The compilation of the 1470s also reflected in the first part of [[Vasili Yermolin|Yermolin]] Chronicle. The "Svod of [[Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery]]" contained text, independent of Moscow Grand Princedom. This svod reflected in the second part of Yermolin Chronicle and in so-called Abridged Chronicle Svods of the end of the 15th century. "Rostov Archbishop Svod" of the 1480s reflected in Typographical Chronicle. Another "Chronicle Svod of 1480s", made in unofficial church sphere, reflected in "Svod of 1518", which in turn reflected in [[Sofia Second Chronicle]] and [[Lvov Chronicle]]. [[Joasaphus, Metropolitan of Moscow|Ioasaf]] Chronicle was made the end of the 1520s at office of Moscow Metropolitan. It covered events of 1437-1520. In the same years, the first redaction of [[Nikon Chronicle]]. Immediate source of Nikon Chronicle was Ioasaf Chronicle. Nikon Chronicle was the largest Russian Chronicle. Voskresenskaya ("[[New Jerusalem Monastery|Resurrection]]") Chronicle was another extensive chronicle, it was made between 1542-1544. In the second half of the 1550s, in the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]], initial redaction of Nikon Chronicle was united with passages from Voskresenskaya Chronicle and Chronicler of the Beginning of [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] - chronicle of events of 1533-1552, i.e. the beginning of Ivan's reign (as grand prince, and since 1547 as tsar). In 1568—1576, also in the reign of Ivan the Terrible, multivolume [[Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible|Illustrated Chronicle Svod]]. This svods was the last All-Russian Chronicles, they give place to another form of historiographical texts — chronographs. Chronicles of 17th-18th centuries were local, provincial texts,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; like [[Siberian Chronicles]] of the late 16th - 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/history/solov/solv06pd.htm] [[Sergei Soloviev]] about Chronicles authenticity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://interpretive.ru/dictionary/1147/word/sibirskie-letopisi Сергеев В.И.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10643">The '''Pace memorandum''' was a 1990 [[memorandum]] written by [[Glenn L. Pace]], a [[general authority]] in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), describing to a committee of the church the complaints of sixty members of the church that claimed they had been subjected to [[satanic ritual abuse]] (SRA) by family members and other members of the church. The state of [[Utah]] conducted a 30-month investigation of the claims after the Pace memorandum was leaked to the press in 1991, concluding that there was no evidence found to substantiate the testimony of the alleged victims.

==Background==
{{Main|Satanic ritual abuse}}
The SRA [[moral panic]] began in the 1980s as children in the [[United States]], subjected to coercive interviewing techniques at the hands of zealous [[social work]]ers, made unsubstantiated allegations of bizarre Satanic rituals and horrific sexual and physical abuse at the hands of [[day care]] workers.  As the decade unfolded, clients of believing therapists began to make similar allegations, which are now generally seen as [[confabulation]]s caused by [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] therapeutic techniques such as [[hypnosis]] and [[automatic writing]] rather than the discovery of [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]]. Despite the similarities between the allegations of adults and children, investigations produced only [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]], and in many cases contradictory evidence of the patients' disclosures.  The court cases surrounding SRA allegations (such as the iconic [[McMartin preschool trial]]) were among the most expensive and lengthy in history and produced no convictions or convictions based solely on the [[testimony]] of children that were frequently overturned or dismissed upon appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Mary de Young |author=De Young, Mary |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-7864-1830-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The panic subsided in the late 1990s, but in the early 1990s while it was still a substantial concern, adherents in the LDS Church began telling leaders of the church that they had been subjected to SRA by their relatives—often parents—and other members of the church.&lt;ref name = memo/&gt;

==The Pace memorandum==
In July 1990, Pace, who at the time was a member of the church's [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|presiding bishopric]], fulfilled a request by the church's [[Strengthening Church Members Committee]] by writing a memorandum about his investigations into alleged incidents of SRA among Latter-day Saints in Utah, Idaho, California, Mexico, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=memo&gt;{{Cite web|last=Pace |first=GL |authorlink=Glenn Leroy Pace |url=http://mormonalliance.org/casereports/volume1/part1/v1p1c06.htm#ELDER%20GLENN%20L.%20PACE:%201990%20MEMO |title=Ritualistic Child Abuse, memorandum to Strengthening Church Members Committee |date=1990-07-19 |accessdate=2009-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210064301/http://www.mormonalliance.org/casereports/volume1/part1/v1p1c06.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}  Page photoreproductions:  [http://www.utlm.org/images/newsletters/no80pacememop1.gif 1], [http://www.utlm.org/images/newsletters/no80pacememop2.gif 2],

Pace reported that children were being "instructed in satanic doctrine" and that as eight-year-olds they were "baptized by blood into the satanic order which is meant to cancel out their baptism into the Church".&lt;ref name = memo/&gt; Forty-five of Pace's witnesses claimed to have witnessed or participated in human sacrifice, including the killing of babies.  Pace said that the alleged perpetrators included "Young Women leaders, Young Men leaders, bishops, a patriarch, a stake president, temple workers, and members of the Tabernacle Choir" and that some of the abuse took place in church meetinghouses.&lt;ref name = memo/&gt; Pace wrote that "when sixty witnesses testify to the same type of torture and murder, it becomes impossible for me, personally, not to believe them."&lt;ref name = memo/&gt;&lt;ref name = Trib/&gt;&lt;ref name = DN/&gt;&lt;ref name = Coates&gt;{{cite news | last = Coates | first = J | title = Mormons Study Satanism Claims: Members Report Abuse As Kids By Renegade Cliques | work = [[Arizona Republic]] | date = 1991-11-03 | pages = A7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pace compared these allegations to stories in [[Standard Works|LDS Church scriptures]] about [[Secret combination (Latter Day Saints)|secret combination]]s and [[Cain]]'s combination with [[Satan]] to become [[Master Mahan]].&lt;ref name = memo/&gt; Pace also suggested that the alleged abusers were using and corrupting the [[Penalty (Latter Day Saints)|oaths]] in the church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] ceremony as part of the Satanic abuse, and that many victims had flashbacks when they attended the temple for the first time and were asked to participate in the ceremonies.&lt;ref name = memo/&gt;&lt;ref name = Coates/&gt;

==Government investigation==
In 1991, the [[Utah State Legislature]] appropriated $250,000 for the Attorney General's office to investigate the RSA allegations in the state of Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Robinson | first = BA | url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_rep04.htm | title = Utah State Government's Inquiry into Ritual Crime| date = 2000-11-23 | publisher = [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a two and one half year span the investigators interviewed hundreds of alleged victims, but none of the incidents reported were corroborated with any evidence beyond their testimony&lt;ref name=utahag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Spangler | first = J | title = Report Finds Little Proof of Ritual Abuse | work = [[Deseret News]] | date = 1995-04-25 | pages = B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1995 report stated that there was no evidence from any of the alleged victims that would warrant an investigation of homicide.&lt;ref name=utahag&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://www.saferchildren.net/print/utahag.pdf | format = PDF | last = King | first = MR | last2 = Jacobson |first2 = M | year = 1995 | title =  Ritual Crime in the State of Utah: Investigation, Analysis &amp; A Look Forward | location = Salt Lake City | publisher = Utah Attorney General's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike King, the coauthor of the report, told news media that the specific accusations against church leaders were "absurd", and Jerry Lazar, the head of [[psychiatry]] at [[LDS Hospital]] in [[Salt Lake City]], said he "has never been able to independently verify memories of satanic ritual abuse".&lt;ref name = AP&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | url = http://www.smwane.dk/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=83 | title = Satanism Probe Comes Up Empty | work = [[Salt Lake Tribune]] | date = 1995-02-28 | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church reaction==

The LDS Church has made no official statement related to the allegations related in the Pace memorandum. However, one commentator has suggested that [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Richard G. Scott|Richard G. Scott's]] sermon in the April 1992 [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] of the church may have been related to the SRA allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Introvigne]], [http://www.cesnur.org/2001/archive/mi_mormons.htm "A Rumor of Devils: Allegations of Satanic Child Abuse and Mormonism, 1985–1994"], paper read at the Annual Conference of the [[Mormon History Association]] in [[Park City, Utah]], 1994-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In his remarks, Scott warned Latter-day Saints:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I caution you not to participate in ... improper therapeutic practices that may cause you more harm than good. ... Detailed leading questions that probe your past may unwittingly trigger thoughts that are more imagination or fantasy than reality. They could lead to condemnation of another for acts that were not committed. While likely few in number, I know of cases where such therapy has caused great injustice to the innocent from unwittingly stimulated accusations that were later proven false. Memory, particularly adult memory of childhood experiences, is fallible. Remember, false accusation is also a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Richard G. | last = Scott| url = http://www.lds.org/ensign/1992/05/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse | title = Healing the Tragic Scars of Abuse | journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | year = 1992 | volume = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Parable of the Polygons''''' is a 2014 interactive [[blog]] post created by [[Vi Hart]] and [[Game design|game developer]] Nicky Case. The article focuses on a society of blue squares and yellow triangles which have slight personal biases against diversity, which leads to social segregation. It is based on [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Thomas Schelling]]'s papers about [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]. The article was well-received, especially its visual and playable aspects, and was called a useful educational tool for topics like [[racial segregation]].

== Content ==
[[File:Parable of the Polygons - first board.png|thumb|alt=A grid of randomly positioned blue squares and yellow triangles with faces showing happy, unhappy, or neutral expressions|A randomly generated board containing segregated squares and triangles|upright=1.3]]

The article is an interactive [[blog]] post, "part story and part game".&lt;ref name="startribune2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt; It has a model consisting of a society of blue squares and yellow triangles, presented in a grid.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; At the top of the article, a crowd of triangles and squares are wiggling.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Just under, it says, "This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world."&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article first demonstrates step-by-step how [[systemic bias|institutional bias]] can occur even when there is little personal bias against diversity, and individuals are well-intentioned.&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article describes the squares and triangles as "slightly shapist".&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; In the first example, a square or triangle is happy only if at least a third of its neighbors are of the same shape as it is.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; The shapes merely adopt a [[meh]] face in a homogeneous neighborhood.&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; 

At this point, the article lets the reader interact with the model.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The reader's goal is to make all residents happy with where they live, by moving only unhappy shapes.&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt; At first, the bias is easily managed; however, as the population grows, the shapes' bias quickly leads to visually segregated areas.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article reads: "Sometimes a neighborhood just becomes square, and it's not their fault if no triangles wanna stick around. And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square, but they can't help it if squares ain't interested."&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt; 

The reader can later execute automated simulations, and increase and decrease the shapes' bias.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mnn2014" /&gt; When the bias is increased, the segregation is more prominent.&lt;ref name="citylab2014" /&gt; A subsequent iteration of the game shows that decreasing bias does not make a difference if the population started out segregated.&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Shapes then have to reject the default scenario of segregation in favor of seeking out the other shapes.&lt;ref name="startribune2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Finally, the reader can generate new models using a sandbox.&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; 

The article departs from Schelling's work by discussing a demand for "even the smallest bit of diversity" which reverses [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]; Case said that the article teaches that such segregation is "easily offset" with a "small amount of anti-bias", even if bias is still present.&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article also departs from Schelling by concluding with encouraging words on how to enact change.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; The article concludes with: "If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life – that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors."&lt;ref name="bustle2015" /&gt;

== Development and release ==
[[Vi Hart]] and Nicky Case, creator of ''[[Coming Out Simulator 2014]]'', teamed up following a talk on the lack of tech event diversity and [[women in STEM]] delivered by Hart, which convinced Case "of the necessity of active measures".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; The article applies ideas from [[game theory|game theorist]] and economist [[Thomas Schelling]]'s 1978 paper ''Micromotives and Macrobehaviour'' which describes how small personal [[bias]] against diversity leads to greater segregation in the general population.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; It is also based on Schelling's 1971 paper ''Dynamic Models of Segregation''.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; 

Case described Schelling's model as "perfect – simple and fun to play";&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Schelling played his own model on a chess board or graph paper with nickels and dimes, moving them one by one.&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo2014" /&gt; Case said that he was "fascinated with taking models/systems from the arts [and] humanities, and translating them into game models/systems".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The second part of the article was based on a "new surprising aspect of Schelling's model", which introduced a nonconformity bias.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that by playing around with variables, they found that "just as a ''small'' bias can turn a society segregated, a ''small'' anti-bias can reverse that".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart said they knew that nonconformity would mix up the population, but that they were "pleasantly surprised to see it work even [at a] very minimum level".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that the article ends on an "optimistic note" that "small local changes really can change institutions from the bottom-up".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Development of the article began in September 2014.&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt;

The goal of ''Parable of the Polygons'' was for readers to "learn to demand diversity".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; People are represented by abstract shapes because marking their races and genders would be "really weird" and "have the unfortunate implication that [the races and genders] are binary and immutable".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; A triangle was chosen because it appears in Hart's videos.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; The article contains few words, and the ability to move shapes is introduced "slowly and deliberately".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Hart said that they felt that "it was important to start with moving the shapes by hand, so that later when shapes move automatically [the reader would know] there's nothing going on behind [their] back".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;  The article provides readers with interactive sections governed by simple rules to help them prove the counter-intuitive results to themselves.&lt;ref name="blog2015" /&gt; Case said that there was "an effort made to keep players from being scared off by the big stuff"; thus, the article includes jokes, slang, and "cute and friendly shapes".&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; Hart said that they wanted to make sure to explain systemic bias without changing the readers' "minds".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that a main message was "[not to] take it personally" because "large collective bias can exist even with small individual bias".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;

{{Quote

}}

The article was released in December 2014; Hart noted that "matters of systematic bias [were] even more topical [at the moment]",&lt;ref name="polygon2014" /&gt; and Case said, "There's a huge gap between the racial proportions of the police force and the neighborhoods they're policing, that both reinforces and results from racial tensions."&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; Case said that Schelling's models could be identified in that "a black officer [had led] the police force one night" amidst the [[Ferguson unrest]].&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt; A remixed version which includes a green pentagon was made the same year and is featured at the bottom of the article.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart described the reaction to the article as "more positive than anything [Hart's] ever done" and "almost disturbingly eerie".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said: "It's been surprisingly positive and polite, especially for something that touches on a touchy subject!"&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Hart said that they planned to "tweak some stuff after release", but did not because the reception was "so overwhelmingly positive".&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt; Case said that the article was doing "shockingly well", so any fixes "might weaken or confuse the message" when applied.&lt;ref name="gamasutra2014" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The critical reception for the article was overwhelmingly positive. Joanna Rothkopf of [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] called the article "an adorable and eloquent primer on issues of segregation".&lt;ref name="salon2014" /&gt; ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''{{'s}} Chava Gourarie described the article as "a cute, engaging, playable explanation".&lt;ref name="cjr2016" /&gt; Aatish Bhatia of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] described the design and characters as "charming" and "delightfully animated".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;

The playable aspect of the article received praise. ''[[Kill Screen]]''{{'s}} Jess Joho wrote, "''Parable of the Polygons'' asks you to tackle Schelling's concepts in a way only a game could."&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;
Bhatia called the article "a truly interactive way of communicating an idea".&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Jesse Singal of [[New York (magazine)|''The Cut'']] called the article "a really well-done use of the web".&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt;

Singal noted the article's parallels to human behavior.&lt;ref name="thecut2014" /&gt;
Bhatia said that the article delivers an "effective, lucid and very relevant" lesson on real-world segregation, race and equality.&lt;ref name="wired2014" /&gt;
Laura Moss of ''[[Mother Nature Network]]'' said that it "accurately illustrates [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] neighborhoods", and noted that the article illustrates "Schelling's three major findings": the effect of slight individual bias, the starting game state and the reluctancy to become more diverse, and the necessity of intervention "in creating and maintaining diversity".&lt;ref name="mnn2014" /&gt;
Joho said that "demonstrating a difficult reality while still maintaining a sense of actionable hope" was the article's "greatest achievement by far".&lt;ref name="killscreen2014" /&gt;

Amanda Montañez wrote in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' blog that the shapes assume that "their individual preference for diversity is sufficient to propel their society toward integration", but that "the social system in which they operate prohibits it".&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Montañez said that "true progress requires a more active, dramatic shift than expected" and that, in the article, "the complacent squares and triangles must abandon their preconceptions about the nature of 'shapism' and adopt a new, activist stance on integration".&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt; Montañez compared the idea of using two-dimensional geometric shapes to represent people to the 1884 illustrated novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]].&lt;ref name="sa2016" /&gt;

'''Persianisation''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɜːr|ʒ|ə|ˌ|n|aɪ|ˈ|z|eɪ|ʃ|ə|n}} or '''persification''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɜːr|s|ᵻ|f|ᵻ|ˈ|k|eɪ|ʃ|ə|n}} is a [[sociology|sociological]] process of cultural change in which something becomes "[[Persianate]]". It is a specific form of [[cultural assimilation]] that often includes [[language shift|language assimilation]]. The term applies not only to cultures but also to individuals, as they acclimate to [[Persian culture]] and become "persianised" or "persified".

Historically, the term was commonly applied to changes in the culture of non-Iranian peoples living within the Iranian cultural sphere, especially during the early and the middle Islamic periods such as [[Arab]]s, and various [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] (such as [[Georgians|Georgian]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], and [[Dagestan]]i) and [[Turkic peoples]] including the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and [[Ghaznavids]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia, Tej K., ''The handbook of bilingualism'', (2004), p.788-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravandi, M., ''The Seljuq court at Konya and the Persianisation of Anatolian Cities'', in Mesogeios (Mediterranean Studies), vol. 25-6 (2005) , pp157-69&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been applied to the transmission of aspects of Persian culture, including language, to the non-Persian peoples in area surrounding Persia (modern-day [[Iran]]), such as [[Anatolia]] and [[South Asia]].

==History==

===Pre-Islamic Period===
Unlike the [[Ancient Greeks]] and the [[Roman Empire]], the ancient Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] was not concerned with spreading its culture to the many peoples that it conquered.  Arguably, the first recorded episode of persianization dates back to [[Alexander the Great]], who, after conquering the Persian Empire in the 4th century BCE, adopted Persian dress, customs and court mannerisms; married a Persian princess, [[Stateira II]] and made subjects cast themselves on their faces when approaching him, in Persian-style, known to Greeks as the custom of [[proskynesis]], a symbolic kissing of the hand that Persians paid to their social superiors. Persian dress and practices were also observed by [[Peucestas]], who was later made [[satrap]] of [[Persis]], where he conciliated the favour of the Persians to his rule in exchange for those of the Macedonians.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, [http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book7a.asp vii. 23, 24, 26]; [[Photius I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''Bibliotheca'', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_03bibliotheca.htm cod. 82], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_03bibliotheca.htm cod. 92]; Diodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Diod.+17.110.1 xvii. 110], xviii. 3, 39; [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'', [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans13.html#4 xiii. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Islamic Period to 15th century===
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
After the fall of the [[Sasanian dynasty]] in 651, the [[Umayyad]] Arabs adopted many of the Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were either persianized [[Arameans]] or ethnic Persians; certainly, [[Persian language|Persian]] remained the language of official business of the caliphate until the adoption of [[Arabic]] toward the end of the 7th century,&lt;ref&gt;Hawting G., ''The First Dynasty of Islam. The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750'', (London) 1986, pp. 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; when, in 692, minting began at the caliphal capital, [[Damascus]]. The new Islamic coins evolved from imitations of Sasanian and [[Byzantine]] coins, and the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi script]] on the coinage was replaced with Arabic.

The [[Abbasids]], after 750, established their capital in what is now [[Iraq]], eventually at [[Baghdad]]. A shift in orientation toward the east is discernible, which was encouraged by increased receptiveness to Persian cultural influence and the roots of the Abbasid revolution in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], now in [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy H., ''The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates'', London, 1986, pp. 134-37&lt;/ref&gt; A proverb complained about the Persianization of morals by Turks.&lt;ref name="Weatherford2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Weatherford|title=Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tgiDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=25 October 2016|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-7352-2115-4|pages=367–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 18th centuries===
Two major powers in [[West Asia]] rose, the Persian [[Safavids]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks. The Safavids reasserted Persian culture and hegemony over [[Caucasus]], [[Eastern Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and other regions. Many khans, begs and other rulers adopted Persian customs and clothing and patronized Persian culture. They founded the city of [[Derbent]] in the [[North Caucasus]] (now in [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]]). Many ethnic peoples adopted many aspects of Persian culture and contributed to their persianization.

At the same time, the Ottomans and their predecessors, the various Beylerbergs and the [[Sultanate of Rum]], patronized so heavily of Persian culture that they became fully Persianate. The Ottomans, for example, adopted Persian names; made Persian an official and prestigious language; adopted Persian titles; adopted Persian cuisine, dances, and literature and added many Persian words to their own language.

===Modern times===
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
In modern times, the term is often used in connection with non-Persian speakers like the [[Azeri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stavenhagen |first=Rodolfo |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ethnic Conflicts and the Nation State |year=2002 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location= |isbn=0-312-15971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kurds]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret K., ''The official Persianization of Kurdish'', Paper presented at the Eighth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, Leeds,
England, (August 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that modern [[Iranian nationalism]] was established during the Pahlavi era and was based on the aim of forming a modern [[nation-state]].&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt; What is often neglected is that Iranian nationalism has its roots before the Pahlavi, in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt; On the eve of [[World War ]]I, [[Pan-Turkist]] propaganda focused on the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking lands of Iran, the Caucasus and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"&gt;Touraj Atabaki, "Recasting Oneself, Rejecting the Other: Pan-Turkism and Iranian Nationalism" in Van Schendel, Willem (Editor). ''Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World: Nationalism, Ethnicity and Labour in the Twentieth Century''. London, GBR: I. B. Tauris &amp; Company, Limited, 2001:

{{quote|As far as Iran is concerned, it is widely argued that Iranian nationalism was born as a state ideology in the [[Reza Shah]] era, based on philological nationalism and as a result of his innovative success in creating a modern nation-state in Iran. However, what is often neglected is that Iranian nationalism has its roots in the political upheavals of the nineteenth century and the disintegration immediately following the Constitutional revolution of 1905–9. It was during this period that Iranism gradually took shape as a defensive discourse for constructing a bounded [[territorial entity]] – the 'pure Iran' standing against all others. Consequently, over time there emerged among the country's [[intelligentsia]] a political [[xenophobia]] which contributed to the formation of Iranian defensive nationalism. It is noteworthy that, contrary to what one might expect, many of the leading agents of the construction of an Iranian bounded territorial entity came from non Persian-speaking ethnic minorities, and the foremost were the Azerbaijanis, rather than the nation's titular ethnic group, the Persians.

....

In the middle of April 1918, the Ottoman army invaded Azerbaijan for the second time.

...

Contrary to their expectations, however, the Ottomans did not achieve impressive success in Azerbaijan. Although the province remained under quasi-occupation by Ottoman troops for months, attempting to win endorsement for pan-Turkism ended in failure.

...

The most important political development affecting the Middle East at the beginning of the twentieth century was the collapse of the Ottoman and the Russian empires. The idea of a greater homeland for all Turks was propagated by pan-Turkism, which was adopted almost at once as a main ideological pillar by the Committee of Union and Progress and somewhat later by other political caucuses in what remained of the Ottoman Empire. On the eve of World War I, pan-Turkist propaganda focused chiefly on the Turkic-speaking peoples of the southern Caucasus, in Iranian Azerbaijan and Turkistan in Central Asia, with the ultimate purpose of persuading them all to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and to join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was this latter appeal to Iranian Azerbaijanis which, contrary to pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azerbaijani intellectuals to become the most vociferous advocates of Iran’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. If in Europe ‘romantic nationalism responded to the damage likely to be caused by modernism by providing a new and larger sense of belonging, an all-encompassing totality, which brought about new social ties, identity and meaning, and a new sense of history from one’s origin on to an illustrious future’,(42) in Iran after the Constitutional movement romantic nationalism was adopted by the Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the irredentist policies threatening the country’s territorial integrity. In their view, assuring territorial integrity was a necessary first step on the road to establishing the rule of law in society and a competent modern state which would safeguard collective as well as individual rights. It was within this context that their political loyalty outweighed their other ethnic or regional affinities. The failure of the Democrats in the arena of Iranian politics after the Constitutional movement and the start of modern state-building paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group’s cultural nationalism. Whereas the adoption of integrationist policies preserved Iran’s geographic integrity and provided the majority of Iranians with a secure and firm national identity, the blatant ignoring of other demands of the Constitutional movement, such as the call for formation of society based on law and order, left the country still searching for a political identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ultimate purpose of persuading these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and to join the new pan-Turkic homeland.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azerbaijanis, which contrary to [[Pan-Turkist]] intentions, caused a small group of Azerbaijani intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies emanating from modern [[Turkey]] and threatening Iran’s territorial integrity.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azerbaijanis.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and modern state.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;  The adoptions of this integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group’s cultural nationalism.&lt;ref name="RecastingAtabaki"/&gt;

According to [[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], in 1930s, the term was used to describe the official policy pursued by [[Reza Shah|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] to assimilate the ethnic minorities in Iran (Iranians as well as Non-Iranians). In particular, within this policy the [[Azerbaijani language]] was banned for use on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies and in the publication of books. Swietochowski writes:

{{quote|The steps that the Teheran regime took in the 1930s with the aim of Persianization of the Azeris and other minorities appeared to take a leaf from the writings of the reformist-minded intellectuals in the previous decade. In the quest of imposing national homogeneity on the country where half of the population consisted of ethnic minorities, the Pahlavi regime issued in quick succession bans on the use of Azeri on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies, and, finally, in the publication of books. Azeri was reduced to the status of a language that only could be spoken and hardly ever written. As the Persianization campaign gained momentum, it drew inspiration from the revivalist spirit of Zoroastrian national glories. There followed even more invasive official practices, such as changing Turkic-sounding geographic names and interference with giving children names other than Persian ones. While cultivating cordial relations with Kemalist Turkey, Reza Shah carried on a forceful de-Turkification campaign in Iran.|&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Swietochowski, Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition. p.122, {{ISBN|0-231-07068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Mogul Empire==
The [[Mughal Empire]] was an Islamic imperial power that ruled a large portion of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and [[Afghanistan]] in [[South Asia]]. From 1526, the Moguls invaded the Indian Subcontinent, from their initial base in Kabul, and they eventually ruled most of [[Hindustan]] ([[South Asia]]) by the late 17th and the early 18th centuries until the mid-19th century. The emperors were descendants of the [[Timurids]] who had embraced [[Persian culture]], converted to [[Islam]] and resided in [[Turkestan]], and they were the ones responsible for the spread of Persian and Islamic culture to [[Central Asia]]. At the height of their power around 1700, they controlled most of the Indian Subcontinent and Afghanistan and spread Persian culture throughout, just as their predecessors the Turkic Ghaznavids and the Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]] had done. In general, from its earliest days, Persian culture and language was spread in South Asia by various Persianised Central Asian [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet.

[[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], identified his lineage as [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Chaghatay]]-Turkic, and his origin, milieu, training and culture were Persian culture. He was largely responsible for the fostering of the culture by his descendants and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian Subcontinent (and Afghanistan), with brilliant literary, artistic and historiographical results. Many works of art such as the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Humayun's Tomb]] and the [[Badshahi Mosque]] are of Persian Islamic architecture, with Persian names. Persian was the official language of the Mughal courts, until replaced with [[Urdu]] by the [[British people|British]].

==Afghanistan==
Afghanistan's persianization can be demonstrated in several aspects since it occurred as early as its foundation in 1747 as Persian customs, particularly the use of the [[Dari language]], was brought into the country by the [[Durrani]] mercenaries after their sojourn in Iran.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=War, Exile and the Music of Afghanistan: The Ethnographer’s Tale|last=Baily|first=John|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2015|isbn=9781472415820|location=Surrey, UK|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan royal family was also considered persianized Pashtuns so that by the twentieth century they hardly spoke Pashto and this indicates that at least for the elite and bureaucracy, the Persian culture and language were deeply entrenched.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1964, the Afghanistan Constitution cited Dari as one of its two official languages alongside Pashto.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the latter is the designated national language, Dari remains the ''lingua franca''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

There are modern initiatives that attempt to "Pashto-ize" all governmental communication.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan|last=Dupree|first=Louis|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1980|isbn=0691030065|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Dari is the language of the bureaucracy, Persian-speaking Afghans dominated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982|last=Kakar|first=Mohammed|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=0520208935|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persianization is especially seen in the case of the "Kabulis", the long-established families from [[Kabul]] (usually Pashtuns completely immersed in Persian culture).

Persianization is also reinforced by the incidence of urbanization in the country, which influenced the characteristics of the Afghan ethnic groups. The two most significant ethnic groups in Afghanistan are the Pashtuns, who are speakers of the Pashto language, and the Tajiks, who are Persian speaking agriculturalists and townspeople.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While Pashtuns dominated the country since they constitute the majority of the Afghan population, Persian culture still permeated.  In the early [[history of Afghanistan]] as an independent country, many [[Pashtuns]] moved into urbanized areas and adopted [[Dari language|Dari]] as their language. As a result, many ethnic Pashtuns in Afghanistan identify themselves as [[Tajiks]]{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} but still have Pashtun names (such as a last name with the suffix "-zai") simply because they speak Dari and are assimilated into Tajiki culture in the country within a process known as "de-tribalization". An account cited, for instance, that Mohammad Naim, the Afghan foreign minister during the 1950s, was unable to reply when - in a visit to Pakistan - Pakistan's Yaqob Khan spoke with him in Pashto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan: Political Frailty and External Interference|last=Misdaq|first=Nabi|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415702054|location=Oxon|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[Pakistan]], a similar pattern occurs with [[urbanization]], when Pashtuns assimilate into the country's national [[Urdu]]-speaking culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13780">{{About|a political theory called "pluralism"|the idea of "pluralism" in politics as acknowledgment of diversity|Pluralism (political philosophy)|other uses|Pluralism (disambiguation)}}

Classical '''pluralism''' is the view that politics and decision making are located mostly in the framework of government, but that many non-governmental groups use their resources to exert influence. The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process. Groups of individuals try to maximize their interests. Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups. There may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a population. Any change under this view will be slow and incremental, as groups have different interests and may act as "veto groups" to destroy legislation. The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a [[Social equilibrium|democratic equilibrium]],&lt;ref&gt;Held, David, Models of Democracy&lt;/ref&gt; and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals. A [[polyarchy]]—a situation of open competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult population—ensures competition of group interests and relative equality. Pluralists stress civil rights, such as freedom of expression and organization, and an electoral system with at least two parties. On the other hand, since the participants in this process constitute only a tiny fraction of the populace, the public acts mainly as bystanders. This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons: (1) it may be representative of a population content with the political happenings, or (2) political issues require continuous and expert attention, which the average citizen may not have.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Important theorists of pluralism include [[Robert A. Dahl]] (who wrote the seminal pluralist work, ''[[Who Governs?]]''), [[David Truman]], and [[Seymour Martin Lipset]].

==Pluralist conception of power==
The list of possible sources of power is virtually endless: legal authority, money, prestige, skill, knowledge, charisma, legitimacy, free time, and experience. Pluralists also stress the differences between potential and actual power as it stands. Actual power means the ability to compel someone to do something and is the view of power as a causation.  Dahl describes power as a "realistic relationship, such as A's capacity for acting in such a manner as to control B's responses" [''A Preface to Democratic Theory''].  Potential power refers to the possibility of turning resources into actual power. Cash, one of many resources, is only a stack of bills until it is put to work. [[Malcolm X]], for example, was certainly not a rich person growing up, but received money from many groups after his prison term and used other resources such as his forceful personality and organizational skills.  He had a greater impact on American politics than most wealthy people. A particular resource like money cannot automatically be equated with power because the resource can be used skillfully or clumsily, fully or partially, or not at all.

The pluralist approach to the study of [[Political power|power]], states that nothing categorical about power can be assumed in any community. The question then is not who runs a community, but if any group in fact does.  To determine this, pluralists study specific outcomes.  The reason for this is that they believe human behavior is governed in large part by [[inertia]].  That said, actual involvement in overt activity is a more valid marker of leadership than simply a reputation.  Pluralists also believe that there is no one particular issue or point in time at which any group must assert itself to stay true to its own expressed values, but rather that there are a variety of issues and points at which this is possible.  There are also costs involved in taking action at all{{snd}} not only losing, but expenditure of time and effort. While a [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] may argue that power distributions have a rather permanent nature, this rationale says that power may in fact be tied to issues, which vary widely in duration. Also, instead of focusing on actors within a [[system]], the emphasis is on the [[leadership]] roles itself.  By studying these, it can be determined to what extent there is a power structure present in a [[society]].

Three of the major tenets of the pluralist school are (1) resources and hence potential power are widely scattered throughout society; (2) at least some resources are available to nearly everyone; and (3) at any time the amount of potential power exceeds the amount of actual power.

Finally, and perhaps most important, no one is all-powerful unless proven so through empirical observation. An individual or group that is influential in one realm may be weak in another. Large military contractors certainly throw their weight around on defense matters, but how much sway do they have on agricultural or health policies? A measure of power, therefore, is its scope, or the range of areas where it is successfully applied as observed by a researcher. Pluralists believe that with few exceptions power holders usually have a relatively limited scope of influence.  Pluralism does leave room for an elitist situation-  Should a group A continuously exert power over multiple groups.  For a pluralist to accept this notion, it must be empirically observed and not assumed so by definition.

For all these reasons power cannot be taken for granted. One has to observe it empirically in order to know who really governs. The best way to do this, pluralists believe, is to examine a wide range of specific decisions, noting who took which side and who ultimately won and lost. Only by keeping score on a variety of controversies can one begin to identify actual power holders. Pluralism was associated with [[behavioralism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/APGOV_pluralism.htm Pluralism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A contradiction to pluralist power is often cited from the origin of one's power.  Although certain groups may share power, people within those groups set agendas, decide issues, and take on leadership roles through their own qualities. Some theorists argue that these qualities cannot be transferred, thus creating a system where elitism still exists.  What this theory fails to take into account is the prospect of overcoming these qualities by garnering support from other groups.  By aggregating power with other organizations, interest groups can over-power these non-transferable qualities.  In this sense, political pluralism still applies to these aspects.

==Elite pluralism==
Elite pluralists agree with classical pluralists that there is "plurality" of power; however, this plurality is not "pure" as some people and groups have more power than others. For example, some people have more money than others, so they can pay to have their opinion put across better (i.e. more advertising) than the working class can. This inequality is because society has "elites"; people who have more power, perhaps through money, inheritance or social tradition than others.&lt;ref&gt;Schattschneider, E.E. 1960. ''The Semi-Sovereign People''. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, it claims that elites play a big role in decision making. The idea behind reads as follow: in democracies the people participate in electing the elites who will represent them and, at the end, the ones who are going to make the laws. As Davita S. Glasberg and Deric Shannon highlights, "political elites are not a monoholitic, unified interest group representing their own narrow group of interests but rather are diverse, competitive elites representing a wide range of interests".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/746832550|title=Political sociology : oppression, resistance, and the state|last=Deric.|first=Shannon,|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412980401|oclc=746832550}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have to compete in "the political market place" in order to gain voters being the power equally distributed between all the potential voters. Moreover, the stability in the system is achieved through this competition among the elites, as they have to negotiate in order to pass a bill. And, sometimes, they have to change their positions and points of view in order to reach a common point. Elites respect and follow the policy-making procedures because they are accountable of their acts and they can be replaced through legal procedures of through new elections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Neo-pluralism==
While Pluralism as a political theory of the state and policy formation gained its most traction during the 1950s and 1960s in America, some scholars argued that the theory was too simplistic (see Connolly (1969) ''The Challenge to Pluralist Theory''){{snd}} leading to the formulation of neo-pluralism. Views differed about the division of power in democratic society. Although neo-pluralism  sees multiple pressure groups competing over political influence, the political agenda is biased towards [[corporate power]].  Neo-pluralism no longer sees the state as an umpire mediating and adjudicating between the demands of different interest groups, but as a relatively  autonomous actor (with different departments) that forges and looks after its own (sectional) interests. Constitutional rules, which in pluralism are embedded in a supportive political culture, should be seen in the context of a diverse, and not necessarily supportive, political culture and a system of radically uneven economic sources. This diverse culture exists because of an uneven distribution of socioeconomic power. This creates possibilities for some groups{{snd}} while limiting others{{snd}} in their political options.
In the international realm, order is distorted by powerful multinational interests and dominant states, while in classical pluralism emphasis is put on stability by a framework of pluralist rules and [[free market]] society.

There are two significant theoretical critiques on pluralism: [[Corporatism]] and [[Neo-Marxism]].

===Charles Lindblom===
[[Charles E. Lindblom]], who is seen as positing a strong neo-pluralist argument, still attributed primacy to the competition between [[interest group]]s in the policy process but recognized the disproportionate influence business interests have in the policy process.

===Corporatism===
Classical pluralism was criticized as it did not seem to apply to [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] democracies or the European context. This led to the development of [[Corporatism|corporatist]] theories. Corporatism is the idea that a few select interest groups are actually (often formally) involved in the policy formulation process, to the exclusion of the myriad other 'interest groups'. For example, [[trade union]]s and major sectoral business associations are often consulted about (if not the drivers of) specific policies.

These policies often concern tripartite relations between workers, employers and the state, with a coordinating role for the latter. The state constructs a framework in which it can address the political and economic issues with these organized and centralized groups. In this view, parliament and party politics lose influence in the policy forming process.

== In foreign policy ==

From the political aspect, 'pluralism' has a huge effect on the process and decision-making in formulating policy. In international security, during the policy making process, different parties may have a chance to take part in decision making. The one who has more power, the more opportunity that it gains and the higher possibility to get what it wants. According to M. Frances (1991), "decision making appears to be a maze of influence and power."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3015">'''''Room Hire Co (Pty) Ltd v Jeppe Street Mansions (Pty) Ltd'''''&lt;ref&gt;1949 (3) SA 1155 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African law|law]]: the leading case, indeed, on disputes of fact. It was heard in the [[Transvaal Provincial Division]] on April 28 and 29, 1949, with judgement on July 15. Murray AJP, Ramsbottom J and Blackwell J presided. A. Shacksonvis KC (with him A. Mendelow) appeared for the appellant, and A. Suzman KC (with him MJ Hart) for the respondent. The appellant's attorneys were Schwartz &amp; Goldblatt; the respondent's were Podlashuc, Meintjes, Liebson &amp; Klagsbrun.

The case was an appeal from a decision in the [[Witwatersrand Local Division]] by Neser J. Its significance lies in the area of [[South African civil procedure|civil procedure]], with its determination that the court in [[application proceedings]], where a material fact arises which cannot be resolved by ''viva voce'' [[evidence (law)|evidence]], may either direct the parties to [[trial]] or dismiss the application with costs.

== Judgment ==
Ramsbottom J and Blackwell J concurred in the judgment of Murray AJP, who reiterated that, except in [[interlocutory]] matters, it is undesirable to attempt to settle disputes of fact solely on the probabilities disclosed in contradictory [[affidavit]]s. Where no real dispute of fact exists, there is no reason for incurring the delay and expense involved in a trial action: Motion proceedings in such a case are generally recognised as permissible.

Where a dispute of fact is shown to exist, however, the court has a discretion as to the future course of the proceedings. If the dispute of fact cannot properly be determined by ''viva voce'' evidence under Rule 9,&lt;ref&gt;The calling of evidence under this Rule rests with the court or judge, regardless of whether or not the parties request it. It is, in other words, solely in his discretion.&lt;/ref&gt; the parties may be sent to trial in the ordinary way (either on the affidavits as constituting the pleadings, or else with a direction that pleadings be filed); otherwise the application may be dismissed with costs.

The '''Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts''', known simply as the '''SANU Memorandum'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trepca.net/english/2006/serbian_memorandum_1986/serbia_memorandum_1986.html|title=SANU Memorandum integral English translation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-sr-cyr|Меморандум САНУ}}), was a draft document produced by a 16-member committee of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) from 1985 to 1986. Excerpts of the draft were leaked, published by daily ''[[Večernje novosti]]'' in September 1986.

The memo immediately captured the public's attention in [[SFRJ|Yugoslavia]] as it gave voice to controversial views on the state of the nation and argued for a fundamental reorganization of the state.{{sfn|Bokovoy|Irvine|Lilly|1997|p=322}} The main theme was decentralisation leading to the disintegration of Yugoslavia and that the Serbs were discriminated against by Yugoslavia's constitutional structure.&lt;ref name="esiweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=281&amp;story_ID=13&amp;slide_ID=18|title=Picture stories - ESI|publisher=esiweb.org|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed that Serbia's development was eroded by support to other parts of Yugoslavia. It was officially denounced in 1986 by the government of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] for inciting nationalism.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=321}} Some consider its publication to be a key moment in the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]{{sfn|Silber|Little|1996|p=31}} and a contributor to the [[Yugoslav wars]].&lt;ref name="esiweb"/&gt;

==Overview==
In the 1980s, a major issue in Yugoslavia was the problem of massive debts occurred in the 1970s and the resulting policies of austerity.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=386}} Yugoslavia had debts initially valued at $6 billion US dollars, but which turned out to actually be a sum equal to $21 billion U.S. dollars, a staggering debt load for a poor country.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=386-387}} The high debt load led to repeated programmes of austerity in the 1980s imposed by the IMF, and which in turn led to the exposure of so much corruption of the part of the Communist authorities to the extent of causing a crisis of faith in the Communist system by the mid-1980s.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=386-387}} The revelation that corruption was systematic in Yugoslavia and that the Communist elites were plundering the public coffers to support luxurious lifestyles for themselves well beyond the means of ordinary people sparked much resentment, especially at a time of austerity.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=386-387}} The fact that it was the Communist elites who had run up the debts in the 1970s that led to the austerity policies imposed in the 1980s not only made them unpopular, but also created grave doubts about the basic competence of the elites to govern the country.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=386-387}} Making the economic crisis more difficult was the fact that Croatia and Slovenia were more wealthier than Serbia, and objected to transferring their wealth to support Serbia in times of austerity.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50}}

In May 1985, after Stambolić urged the government to discuss Kosovo for the first time since 1981,{{sfn|Jović|2009|p=248}} SANU selected a committee of sixteen distinguished academics to draft a memorandum addressing causes for the economic- and political crisis and how to tackle the problems.{{sfn|Djokić|2003|p=255}} It was planned to be endorsed by the academy prior to being presented to the Communist Party and state organs.{{sfn|Djokić|2003|p=255}} The last draft, however, was leaked to a regime tabloid,{{sfn|Djokić|2003|p=255}} the Serbian newspaper ''[[Večernje novosti]]'' in September 1986.{{sfn|Bokovoy|Irvine|Lilly|1997|p=322}} The newspaper attacked it, describing it as reactionary and nationalist, but did not publish it.{{sfn|Djokić|2003|p=255}} An official campaign by the Serbian state and party officials began against it.{{sfn|Djokić|2003|p=255}}

The memo is divided into two parts: one on the "Crisis in the Yugoslav Economy and Society", the other on the "Status of Serbia and the Serb Nation".{{sfn|Miller|2008|p=269}} The first section focuses on the economic and political fragmentation of Yugoslavia that followed the promulgation of the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 constitution]]. The memo argued that because Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] was a Croat that he had designed the Yugoslav federation in such a way to unduly balance the entire economic and political system in favor of his native Croatia together with Slovenia.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}} In this way, the memo claimed that the burden of austerity policies imposed by the IMF fell almost entirely on the Serbs while at the same time allowing Croatia and Slovenia to keep too much of their wealth to themselves.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}} The second section focuses on what the authors saw as Serbia's inferior status in Yugoslavia, while describing status of Serbs in the province of [[Kosovo]] and in [[Croatia]] in such a way to make its point.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}} The memo argued that because the provincial authorities in both Kosovo and Vojvodina could deal directly with the federal government, that this had made them into de facto republics outside of the control of the Serbian socialist republic.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}} Since March 1981, there had been regular riots in Kosovo between the ethnic Albanian majority and its Serb minority, which in turn had been caused by competition for jobs in a time of austerity as the university system produced far more graduates than what there were jobs for.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}} The memo written before the worse of the rioting in Kosovo between 1987-1990 claimed that the other republics, especially Croatia, were supporting the Albanian provincial government in Kosovo as part of a plot to force out the Serb minority.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}}  [[Kosta Mihailović]] made contributions on the economy, [[Mihailo Marković]] on self-management, and [[Vasilije Krestić]] on the status of the Serbs of [[Croatia]].

The memo claimed that at the end of [[World War II]], [[Josip Broz Tito]] deliberately weakened [[Serbia]] by dividing up the majority of Serbian territory, namely present day Serbia, [[Montenegro]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and Croatia with Serb majority populations. The memo argued that Tito further weakened the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] by dividing its territory and creating the [[autonomous province]]s of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], which was not reciprocated in the other Yugoslav republics. A major theme of the memo was that of alleged Serbian victimization at the hands of the other republics, who were portrayed as having profited at Serbia's expense. The authors of the memo wrote that it was time to "...remove this historical guilt off of the Serbian people and to refute officially the claims that they had an economically privileged position between the two wars and that there would be no denying of their liberating role throughout history and their contribution in the creation of Yugoslavia....The Serbs in their history have never conquered or exploited others. Through the two world wars, they liberated themselves, and when they could, help others to liberate themselves".{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50}}

The theme of alleged Serb victimization at the hands of others was at least in part a response to the economic crisis of the 1980s to suggest that the burden of austerity should fall mostly on the other republics, but the most powerful consequence was that for the first time since 1945 a historical narrative had been aired which portrayed the Serbs as a uniquely and innately virtuous and honorable people who were the perpetual victims of others.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50}} The British historian Richard Crampton wrote the real significance of the memo was it for the first time openly stated what many ordinary Serbian people had been thinking and that because of the intellectual prestige of its authors conferred a sort of pseudo-scientific legitimacy on the widespread feelings that it was the Serbs who were being unjustly singled out by the policies of economic austerity.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}} At a time of widespread economic pain and suffering, the message of the memo that the Serbs were being forced unjustly to suffer more than they should have been was very popular.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}} The message of the memo that the solution to the economic crisis of the 1980s was for the Serbs to aggressively reassert their interests in Yugoslavia, abolish the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, and bring the ''prečani'' Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia into Serbia led to much alarm with the other peoples of Yugoslavia who saw the memo as a call for Serbian domination of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387}}

The Austrian scholar Doris Gödl wrote this theme in the memo of Serbs as perpetual victims strongly suggested that they could do no wrong and everything that had gone wrong in Yugoslavia was the work of others.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50}} Gödl wrote that though the memo was true in the sense that the Serbs at times had indeed been victimized, the picture of history presented in the memo of continuous Serb victimization from the times of the Ottoman Empire to the present was extremely one-sided and distorted, ignoring the fact that the Serbs at times had victimized the other peoples of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50-51}} Gödl concluded this version of history which portrayed the other peoples of Yugoslavia, especially the Croats, as perpetual aggressors and the Serbs as constant victims did much to fuel the nationalism that [[Slobodan Milošević]] tapped into starting in 1987.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50}}

==Reception==
The memo was denounced by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]], including [[Slobodan Milošević]], the future president of Serbia, who publicly called the memo "nothing else but the darkest nationalism", and [[Radovan Karadžić]], the future leader of [[Republika Srpska|Serbs in Bosnia]], who stated "Bolshevism is bad, but nationalism is even worse".{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=347}} Despite these declarations, Milošević, Karadžić, and other Serb politicians publicly agreed with most of the memo and would form close political connections with the writers of the memo such as Mihailo Marković, who became the vice-president of the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] and Dobrica Ćosić who was appointed president of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1992.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=321}} Starting in 1987, Milošević, the party boss of the Serbian Communist Party, started to cynically appeal to Serbian nationalism to distract public attention from the extent of massive corruption within the Communist Party, a gambit that worked very well.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387-388}} However, Milošević's appeal to Serb nationalism, which however successful it was in distracting the attention of ordinary Serbs away from corruption and the debt crisis, inevitably sparked fears in the other republics that he was attempting a power play to make Yugoslavia into a Serb-dominated nation.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387-388}} Milošević's decision to end the autonomy for Kosovo in 1989 and his deployment of ethnic Serbian policemen to violently crush protests by Kosovar Albanians led to secessionist feelings in the other republics who wanted out of Yugoslavia before Milošević imposed Serb domination on all of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387-388}} Within the other republics, it was noted that the SANU memo called for ending Kosovo's autonomy, and so the ending of Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 caused fears that Milošević would carry out the other parts of the memo, through it is not clear if that was his intention in 1989.{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=387-388}}

Gödl wrote that by 1989, a similar version of history to the one presented in the SANU memo was being preached in Croatia with the only difference being that the Croats were portrayed as perpetual victims and the Serbs as perpetual aggressors.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=51}} Especially popular in this regard was the 1990 book ''The Drina River Martyrs'' written by an ultra-nationalist Bosnian Croat Roman Catholic priest, Father Anto Baković, which portrayed both the Chetnik and Partisan movements in World War II as extremely anti-Croat and anti-Catholic, presenting the history of Yugoslavia as one of continuous violent trauma inflicted by the Serbs against the Croats.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=51}} Father Baković used what are now known within the Catholic circles as the [[Blessed Martyrs of Drina]], a group of Bosnian Croat nuns who were victimized by the Chetniks in December 1941, as a microcosm of the "martyrdom" of the Croats in World War II.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=51}} Gödl wrote the popularity of books like ''The Drina River Martyrs'' were at partly a response to the SANU memorandum and similar other Serb nationalist works, which by emphasizing crimes committed in the immediate post-World War II era by the Partisans was meant to cancel out the memory of ''Ustashe'' crimes which played such a central role in the Serb memory of the past.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=51}} Gödl contended that by 1989 that many Serbs and Croats were both caught up in historical narratives that portrayed their own group as innately pure and virtuous and the other as innately vicious and cruel, seeing themselves as perpetual victims and the other as perpetual victimizers.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50-51}} Gödl wrote that it was the popularity of these narratives of perpetual victimization with both Croats and Serbs in the 1980s that portended the violent break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991-1992.{{sfn|Gödl|2007|p=50-52}}

[[File:Shuowen dingsheng start.png|thumb|right|upright=2|Start of the first section of the ''Shuowen tongxun dingsheng'', covering the 豐 ''fēng'' rhyme group, beginning with phonetic components 東 ''dōng'', 同 ''tōng'', 彤 ''tōng'' and 中 ''zhōng'']]
The '''''Shuowen tongxun dingsheng''''' ({{zh|t=說文通訓定聲|p=Shuōwén tōngxùn dìngshēng}}) is an 18-volume study of the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' completed in 1833 by the Qing phonologist [[Zhu Junsheng]] (朱駿聲) (1788–1858) and published in 1870.  The bulk of the work is a phonetic study in which the 9000 characters of the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' and 7000 additional characters are grouped into 1137 series, each sharing a phonetic element.  These phonetic series were further grouped into 18 ''[[Shijing]]'' rhyme groups, based on [[Duan Yucai]]'s dictum that characters sharing a phonetic element belonged in the same rhyme group.  The work thus anticipated the structure of [[Bernard Karlgren]]'s ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]''.  The work also includes very detailed notes on rhyming, semantics, and interchangeable characters.

The '''''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.''''' ("Special Search List Great Britain") was a secret list of prominent British residents to be arrested, produced in 1940 by the ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'' as part of the preparation for the proposed invasion of Britain codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion|''Unternehmen Seelöwe'']] (Operation Sea Lion). After the war, the list became known as '''The Black Book'''.&lt;ref name="GoodenLewis2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip Gooden|author2=Peter Lewis|title=The Word at War: World War Two in 100 Phrases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwlpBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22|date=September 25, 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4729-0490-4|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geheim!"&gt;{{harvnb| Facsimile}} – [[wikt:geheim|Geheim!]] (Secret!) is printed in red on the grey-green cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

The information was prepared by the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA) under [[Reinhard Heydrich]]. Later, SS-Oberführer [[Walter Schellenberg]] claimed in his memoirs that he had compiled the list,{{sfn|Shirer|2011|pp=937–938}} starting at the end of June 1940.&lt;ref name="Doerries2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reinhard R. Doerries|title=Hitler's Intelligence Chief: Walter Schellenberg: Walter Schellenberg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n58KBgb8mz4C&amp;pg=PA33|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=978-1-936274-13-0|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained 2,820 names of people, including British nationals and European exiles, who were to be immediately arrested by ''SS'' [[Einsatzgruppen]] upon the invasion, occupation, and annexation of Great Britain to the [[Third Reich]]. Abbreviations after each name indicated whether the individual was to be detained by RSHA Amt IV (the [[Gestapo]]) or Amt VI ([[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|Ausland-SD]], Foreign Intelligence).&lt;ref name="GoodenLewis2014" /&gt;

The list was printed as a supplement or appendix to the secret ''[[Informationsheft Grossbritannien|Informationsheft G.B.]]'' handbook, which Schellenberg also claimed to have written. This handbook noted opportunities for looting, and named potentially dangerous anti-Nazi institutions including [[Freemasonry|Masonic lodges]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Boy Scouts]]. On 17 September 1940, SS-Brigadeführer Dr [[Franz Six]] was designated to a position in London where he would implement the post-invasion arrests and actions against institutions, but on the same day, Hitler postponed the invasion indefinitely.{{sfn|Shirer|2011|pp=937, 939}} In September 1945, at the end of the war, the list was discovered in Berlin. Reporting included the reactions of some of the people listed.{{sfn | Guardian, Berlin | 1945}}

==Background==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|right|upright| SS functionary [[Walter Schellenberg]] said he had compiled the Black Book]]

The list was similar to earlier lists prepared by the SS,{{sfn | Forces War Records | 2017}} such as the [[Special Prosecution Book-Poland]] ({{lang-de|Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen}}) prepared before the [[World War II|Second World War]] by members of the German [[fifth column]] in cooperation with German Intelligence, and used to target the 61,000 Polish people on this list during [[Operation Tannenberg]] and [[Intelligenzaktion]] in occupied Poland between 1939 and 1941.

Rapid German victories led quickly to the [[Fall of France]] and British forces had to be withdrawn during the [[Dunkirk evacuation]], with the Nazi spearhead reaching the coast on 21 May 1940. It was only then that the prospect of invading Britain was raised with Hitler, and the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German high command]] did not issue any orders for preparations until 2 July. Eventually, on 16 July, Hitler issued his Directive no. 16 ordering preparation for invasion, codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]].{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=35–41}} 

German intelligence set out to provide their invading forces with encyclopaedic handbooks giving useful information. Seven maps, each covering the whole of the [[British Isles]], covered different topographical aspects. A book provided 174 photographs, mostly [[aerial photography]], supplemented with views cut out from newspapers and magazines. A mass of information was included in a book on ''Military-Geographical Data about England''. Only one book was marked secret, the ''Informationsheft GB''.{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=191–192}} [[Walter Schellenberg]] wrote in his memoirs that "at the end of June 1940 I was ordered to prepare a small handbook for the invading troops and the political and administrative units that would accompany them, describing briefly the most important political, administrative and economic institutions of Great Britain and the leading public figures."&lt;ref name="Doerries2013" /&gt;

==Description==
The ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' was an appendix or supplement to the secret handbook ''[[Informationsheft Grossbritannien]]'' (''Informationsheft GB'') which provided information for German security services about institutions thought likely to resist the Nazis, including the private [[public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Boy Scouts]]. A general survey of British museums and art galleries suggested opportunities for looting. The handbook described the [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|organisation of the British police]], and had a section analysing the [[British intelligence agencies]]. Following this, four pages had around 30 passport-sized photographs of individuals who also appeared in the appendix.{{sfn | Fleming | 1975 | pp=192–195}}

The appendix, of 104 pages, was a list in alphabetical order&lt;ref&gt;Walter Schellenberg, ''The Schellenberg Memoirs'', London 1956 (Deutsch: Aufzeichungen, München 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Invasion 1940. The Nazi Invasion Plan for Britain by SS General Walter Schellenberg, London 2000&lt;/ref&gt; of 2,820 names, some of which were duplicated. The term ''Fahndungsliste'' translates into "wanted list", and ''Sonderfahndungsliste'' into "specially" or "especially wanted list".&lt;ref name="Forces War Records TBB"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Black Book | website=Forces War Records | date=28 February 2017 | url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/the-black-book | accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instructions "Sämtliche in der Sonderfahndungsliste G.B. aufgefürten Personen sind festzunehmen" (all persons listed in the Special Wanted List G.B. are to be arrested) made this clear.&lt;ref name="Doerries2013" /&gt;

Beside each name was the number of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA) to which the person was to be handed over. Churchill was to be placed into the custody of Amt VI  ([[Sicherheitsdienst#Ausland-SD|Ausland-SD]], Foreign Intelligence), but the vast majority of the people listed in the Black Book would be placed into the custody of Amt IV ([[Gestapo]]). The book had some significant errors, such as people who had died ([[Lytton Strachey]], died in 1932) or were no longer based in the UK ([[Paul Robeson]], moved back to the United States in 1939), and omissions (such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], one of the few English language writers whose works were published and performed in Nazi Germany).&lt;ref name = Schellenberg&gt;Schellenberg, ''Invasion, 1940'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimension of the booklet is given as {{convert|19|cm|in}}, and [[wikt:geheim|Geheim!]] (Secret!) is printed on the cover. The facsimile version shows the printing in red, on a pale grey-green cover, and has 376 pages.&lt;ref name="Geheim!" /&gt;{{sfn| SearchWorks}}

==Post-war discovery==
A print run of the list produced around 20,000 booklets but the warehouse in which they were stored was destroyed in a bombing raid&lt;ref name="DJFUK"/&gt; and only two originals are known to survive.&lt;ref name="Coward" /&gt; One is in the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London,{{sfn | ''Imperial War Museums'' | 1999}} and one is noted in the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]].{{sfn| SearchWorks}}

On 14 September 1945, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the booklet had been discovered in the [[Berlin]] headquarters of the Reich Security Police ([[Reich Main Security Office]]).{{sfn | Guardian, Berlin | 1945}} When told the previous day that they were on the Gestapo's list, [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Lady Astor]]  ("enemy of Germany") said "It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called '[[Cliveden Set]]' was pro-Fascist", while  [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Lord Vansittart]] said "The German black-list might indicate to some of those who now find themselves on it that their views, divergent from mine, were somewhat misplaced. Perhaps it will be an eye-opener to them", and the cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] said "That is all right. I had them on my list too."{{sfn | Guardian, Berlin | 1945|loc=para 10}}

Being included on the list was considered a mark of honour. [[Noël Coward]] recalled that, on learning of the book, [[Rebecca West]] sent him a telegram saying "My dear—the people we should have been seen dead with."&lt;ref name="GoodenLewis2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coward"&gt;Noël Coward, ''Future Indefinite''.

== Name ==
The name derives from the [[Jihomoravský kraj|South Moravian]] city [[Slavkov u Brna|Austerlitz]]. It is known for the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] of 1805, which is also called the "Battle of the Three Emperors".

== Background ==
In the form of the [[Visegrád Group]] an agreement had already existed since 15 February 1991 on cooperation between the Central European countries Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. In particular, it was a concern to expand this group to include Slovenia and Austria. On 3 April 2014, the Czech President [[Miloš Zeman]] announced at a press conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia, that Slovenia and Austria will also participate in the meetings of an enlarged Visegrád group in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://radio.cz/de/rubrik/nachrichten/slowenien-und-oesterreich-werden-an-sitzungen-der-visegrad-staaten-teilnehmen |title=Slowenien und Österreich werden an Sitzungen der Visegrad-Staaten teilnehmen - Radio Prag |last=Martin |first=Lothar  |date=2014-04-03 |website=radio.cz|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by his spokesman, Gábor Kaleta, circulated on 4 April 2014 To understand that an expansion of the Visegrád Group is not planned and thus rejected Zeman's offer to Slovenia and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs/news/expanding-visegrad-group-not-on-the-agenda|title=|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408214154/http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs/news/expanding-visegrad-group-not-on-the-agenda|archivedate=2014-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Hungary's reluctance to include Slovenia and Austria in the Visegrád Group, the different points of view regarding the Russian sanctions in the wake of the Ukraine conflict on the one hand and the three states of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria on the other proved to be an obstacle on the way To an expansion of the Visegrád group.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

It was therefore necessary to find a different framework for enhanced cooperation. On January 29, 2015, the Prime Minister of Czech Republic [[Bohuslav Sobotka]] and Slovakia [[Robert Fico]] and the Austrian Chancellor [[Werner Faymann]] came together in [[Slavkov u Brna]], Austerlitz near Brno. The 'Austerlitz Declaration' was signed and the Austerlitz format was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/Austerlitz-Declaration.pdf|title=Austerlitz Declaration|website=www.vlada.cz|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petr Drulák, the deputy minister of the Czech Republic, emphasized, however, that the Austerlitz format was not a competition, but an addition to the Visegrád group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://derstandard.at/2000015574633/Oesterreich-Tschechien-Slowakei-Gemeinsame-Politik-im-Austerlitz-Format |title=Österreich, Tschechien, Slowakei: Gemeinsame Politik im Austerlitz-Format |last=Schubert |first=Gerald |date=2015-04-11 |publisher=Der Standard|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Time''{{'}}s All-Time 100 Movies}}
'''"All-Time" 100 Movies''' is a compilation by [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] featuring and celebrating 100 of "the greatest" films released between March 3, 1923 (when the first issue of ''TIME'' was published) and early 2005 (when the list was compiled). The list was compiled by critics [[Richard Schickel]] and [[Richard Corliss]] and generated significant attention, receiving 7.8 million hits in its first week alone.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1068026,00.html|title=That Old Feeling: Secrets of the All-''Time'' 100|first=Richard|last=Corliss|date=June 2, 2005|accessdate=March 4, 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811185345/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1068026,00.html|archivedate=August 11, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

    =========================COPYRIGHT WARNING=============================--&gt;

There are 106 films in this list with ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' (1938), ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955, 1956, 1959), ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1972, 1974), and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] (2001–2003) each listed as single entries.&lt;ref name=List/&gt;

These pairs and trilogies of films were directed by [[Leni Riefenstahl]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], and [[Peter Jackson]], respectively. [[Martin Scorsese]] also had three films on the list, which were ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), and ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990). [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Stanley Donen]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Sergio Leone]], [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Yasujirō Ozu]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Billy Wilder]], and [[William Wyler]] all had two films each on the list.

Films on the list span a period of 80 years starting with ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'' (1924) directed by [[Buster Keaton]], and finishing with ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) directed by [[Andrew Stanton]].

==Method==
[[Richard Schickel]] and [[Richard Corliss]] each independently compiled a list of 115&amp;ndash;120 films they judged to be worthy of inclusion and then debated and weighed each choice until they agreed on the top 100.&lt;ref name="time.com" /&gt; The process took about four months to complete. An effort was made to make the list as diverse as possible in terms of directors, actors, countries, and genres represented.&lt;ref name="time.com" /&gt;

==10 Best Soundtracks==
The list also included a section on the "10 Best Soundtracks" of all time, as chosen by [[Richard Schickel]] and [[Richard Corliss]]. &lt;ref name=List&gt;{{cite news|title=All-''Time'' 100 Movies|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|author=[[Richard Schickel]], [[Richard Corliss]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953094_1953153,00.html|accessdate=October 27, 2010|date=February 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Academy Award]] winner [[A.R. Rahman]]'s acclaimed debut album for the Tamil film [[Roja]] made it to this list, making [[A.R. Rahman]] the only debut composer to attain this distinguished honor.

==Reception==
According to Richard Corliss, the list's web pages attracted a record 7.8 million page views in its first week, including 3.5 million on May 23, its opening day.&lt;ref name="time.com" /&gt;

"Thousands of readers have written in to cheer or challenge our selections, and thousands more have voted for their own favorites. The response simply underscores Richard's and my long-held belief that everybody has two jobs: his own and movie critic."&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28947">A '''{{lang|non|vǫlva}}''' or '''{{lang|is|völva}}''' ([[Old Norse]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], respectively; plural forms {{lang|non|vǫlur}} and {{lang|is|völvur}}, sometimes anglicized '''vala'''; also '''{{lang|non|spákona}}''' or '''{{lang|non|spækona}}''') is a female [[shamanism|shaman]] and [[Prophet|seer]] in [[Norse religion]] and a recurring motif in [[Norse mythology]].
[[File:Ed0048.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|The seeress speaks her prophecy in this illustration to a 19th-century Swedish translation of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''.]]

==Names and etymology==
{{wiktionary|vǫlva}}
The {{lang|non|vǫlur}} were referred to by many names. Old Norse {{lang|non|vǫlva}} means "wand carrier" or "carrier of a magic staff",&lt;ref&gt;Mercatante &amp; Dow 2004, II:893.&lt;/ref&gt; and it continues [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*walwōn}}, which is derived from a word for "wand" (Old Norse {{lang|non|vǫlr}}).&lt;ref name="hell"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym/1169.html Hellquist 1922:1081]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vala'', on the other hand, is a literary form based on {{lang|non|vǫlva}}.&lt;ref name="hell"/&gt;

Another name for the {{lang|non|vǫlva}} is {{lang|non|fjǫlkunnig}} (plenty of knowing) indicating she knew {{lang|non|[[seiðr]]}}, {{lang|non|[[prophecy|spá]]}} and {{lang|non|[[galdr]]}}. A practitioner of {{lang|non|seiðr}} is known as a {{lang|non|seiðkona}} "{{lang|non|seiðr}}-woman" or a {{lang|non|seiðmaðr}} "{{lang|non|seiðr}}-man".

A {{lang|non|spákona}} or {{lang|non|spækona}} "{{lang|non|spá}}-woman"&lt;ref&gt;The Tale of Norna-Gest&lt;/ref&gt; (with an [[Old English]] cognate, {{lang|ang|spæwīfe}})&lt;ref&gt;Hellquist 1922:851&lt;/ref&gt; is a specialised {{lang|non|vǫlva}}; a "seer, one who sees", from the Old Norse word {{lang|non|spá}} or {{lang|non|spæ}} referring to [[prophecy|prophesying]] and which is cognate with the present English word "spy", continuing Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*spah-}} and the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/speḱ-|(s)peḱ]]}}'' (to see, to observe) and consequently related to Latin {{wikt-lang|la|speciō}} ("I see") and [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|spaśyati}} and {{lang|sa-Latn|paśyati}} ({{wikt-lang|sa|पश्यति}}, "to see").&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0939.html Hellquist 1922:851]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Odin og Völven by Frølich.jpg|thumb|"Odin and the ''Völva''" (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
Vǫlur practiced seiðr, spá and galdr, practices which encompassed [[shamanism]], [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], [[prophet|prophecy]] and other forms of indigenous magic associated with women. Seiðr in particular had connotations of ''[[ergi]]'' (unmanliness), a serious offense in Norse society.

Historical and mythological depictions of vǫlur show that they were held in high esteem and believed to possess such powers that even the father of the gods, [[Odin]] himself, consulted a vǫlva to learn what the future had in store for the gods. Such an account is preserved in the ''[[Völuspá]]'', which roughly translates to "Prophecy of the Vǫlva". In addition to the unnamed seeress (possibly identical with [[Heiðr]]) in the ''Vǫluspá'', other examples of vǫlur in Norse literature include [[Gróa]] in ''[[Svipdagsmál]]'', Þórbjǫrgr in the ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]'' and [[Huld]] in ''[[Ynglinga saga]]''.

The vǫlur were not considered to be harmless.&lt;ref name="Harrison55"/&gt; The goddess who was most skilled in magic was [[Freyja]], and she was not only a goddess of love, but also a warlike divinity who caused screams of anguish, blood and death, and what Freyja performed in [[Asgard]], the world of the gods, the vǫlur tried to perform in [[Midgard]], the world of men.&lt;ref name="Harrison55"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:55&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon of the vǫlva was not the spear, the axe or the sword, but instead they were held to influence battles with different means, and one of them was the wand,&lt;ref name="Harrison55"/&gt; (see the section [[#Wands and weaving|wands and weaving, below]]).

==Early accounts==
{{Disputed-section|"Early accounts"|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Cimbrians and Teutons invasions.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The migrations of the Teutons and the [[Cimbri]].&lt;br /&gt;{{Battle red}} Cimbri and Teutons defeats.&lt;br /&gt;{{Battle blue}} Cimbri and Teutons victories.]]
The earliest descriptions of Germanic prophetesses appear in Roman accounts about the [[Cimbri]], whose priestesses were aged women dressed in white. They sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood in order to prophesy coming events.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] in [[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographica]] 7.2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' (1, 50) [[Julius Caesar]] writes in the course of clashes with Germanic tribesmen under [[Ariovistus]] (58 BCE):
{{quote|When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore Ariovistus did not come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the reason{{spaced ndash}}that among the Germans it was the custom for their ''matrons'' to pronounce from lots and divination whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not; that they had said, "that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon.}}

[[Tacitus]] also writes about prophetesses among the [[Germanic peoples]] in his [[Histories (Tacitus)|''Histories'']] 4, 61 - notably a certain [[Veleda]]: "by ancient usage the Germans attributed to many of their women prophetic powers and, as the superstition grew in strength, even actual divinity."

[[Jordanes]] relates in his ''[[Getica]]'' (XXIV:121) of [[Goths|Gothic]] [[wikt:haliurunna|''haliurunnas'']], witches who were driven into exile by King [[Filimer]] when the Goths had settled in [[Oium]] ([[Ukraine]]). The name is possibly a corruption of a [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Halju-runnos'', meaning "hell-runners" or "runners to the realm of the dead".&lt;ref&gt;Scardigli, Piergiuseppe, ''Die Goten: Sprache und Kultur'' (München 1973) pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; These witches were condemned to seek refuge far away and, according to this account, engendered the [[Huns]].

The [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paul the Deacon]], who died in [[Southern Italy]] in the 790s, wrote on how his people once had departed from southern Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:69&lt;/ref&gt; He tells of a conflict between the early Lombards and the Vandals. The latter turned to one Godan (presumably Odin), while Gambara, the mother of the two Lombard chieftains Ibor and Aio, turned to Godan's spouse Frea (presumably [[Frijjō|Freyja/Frigg]]). Frea helped Gambara play a trick on Odin and thanks to the Gambara's good relations with the goddess, her people won the battle.&lt;ref name="Harrison74"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:74&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed eyewitness account of a [[human sacrifice]] by what may have been a vǫlva was given by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] as part of his account of a [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 921. In [[Norse funeral#Ibn Fadlan's account|his description of the funeral]] of a [[Germanic kingship|Scandinavian chieftain]], a slave girl [[volunteering|volunteers]] to die with her [[slavery|master]]. After ten days of festivities, she is stabbed to death by an old woman (a sort of priestess who is referred to as "Angel of Death") and burnt together with the deceased in his boat (see [[Oseberg Ship]]).

[[File:Freya (1901) by Anders Zorn.jpg|thumb|right|Freya, "Freja" [alt.] (1901) by [[Anders Zorn]] ]]

==Viking society==
In Norse society, a vǫlva was an elderly woman who had released herself from the strong family bonds that normally surrounded women in [[Norse clans]]. She travelled the land, usually followed by a retinue of young people, and she was summoned in times of crisis. She had immense authority and she charged well for her services.&lt;ref name="meulen81"&gt;Steinsland, G. &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen, P. 1998:81&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many aristocratic Viking women wanted to serve [[Freyja]] and represent her in [[Midgard]]. They married Viking warlords who had [[Odin]] as a role model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of [[Valhalla]].&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt; In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the [[einherjar]], the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by [[Valkyrie]]s. However, the duties of the mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses were out in battle. Scholars no longer believe that these women waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the ''[[Darraðarljóð]]''.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt;

It is difficult to draw a line between the aristocratic lady and the wandering vǫlva, but Old Norse sources present the vǫlva as more professional and she went from estate to estate selling her spiritual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/religion-magic-death-and-rituals/viking-seeresses/|title=Viking seeresses - National Museum of Denmark|work=National Museum of Denmark|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vǫlva had greater authority than the aristocratic lady, but both were ultimately dependent on the benevolence of the warlord that they served.{{inconsistent}} When they had been attached to a warlord, their authority depended on their personal competence and credibility.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt;

===Saga sources===
[[File:Faroe stamp 428 The Prophet.jpg|upright=0.9|right|thumb|A depiction of a vǫlva on a [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] stamp by [[Anker Eli Petersen]] (2003).]]
In ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'', toward the end of ''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]'', Norna-Gest states that "spákonur traveled around the country-side and fore-told the fates of men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/nornages.htm The Tale of Norna-Gest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Landnámabók]], a Volva named ''Þuríðr Sundafyllir'' gained the epithet of "filler of inlets" during a famine in Iceland, when she used her magic powers to fill the fjords with fish.

''The [[Saga of Eric the Red]]'' relates that the settlers in [[Greenland]] c. 1000 were suffering a time of starvation. In order to prepare for the future, the ''vǫlva Þórbjǫrgr lítilvǫlva'' ("the little vǫlva") was summoned. Before her arrival the whole household was thoroughly cleaned and prepared. The high seat, which was otherwise reserved for the master and his wife, was furnished with down pillows.

The vǫlva appeared in the evening, dressed in a foot-length blue or black [[cloak]] decked with gems to the hem. In her hand she wielded a wand, the symbolic [[distaff]] (''seiðstafr''), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In the saga of [[Örvar-Oddr]], the seiðkona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant than the fact that it was intended to signify the otherness of the seiðkona.

The ''Saga of Eric the Red'' further relates that around her neck she wore a necklace of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of [[amadou]] from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.

As the vǫlva entered the room, she was hailed with reverence by the household, and then she was led to the high seat, where she was provided with dishes prepared only for her. She had a [[porridge]] made of goat milk and a dish made of hearts from all the kinds of animals at the homestead. She ate the dishes with a brass spoon and a knife whose point was broken off.

The vǫlva was to sleep at the farm during the night and the next day was reserved for her dance. In order to dance the seiðr, she needed special tools. First, she positioned herself on a special elevated platform and a group of young women sat down around her. The girls sang special songs intended to summon the powers that the vǫlva wished to communicate with. The session was a success because the vǫlva was permitted to see far into the future and the famine was averted.

In the prologue of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', related by a vǫlva,&lt;ref&gt;Mercatante &amp; Dow 2004, II:893&lt;/ref&gt; the origin of [[Thor]]'s wife [[Sif]] is detailed, where she is said to be a ''spákona''. Snorri contextually correlates [[Sif]] with the oracular seeress [[Sibyl]] on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heimskringla.no/original/snorre/prologus.php The prologue of Heimskringla]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18947/18947-h/18947-h.htm#foreword The prologue of Heimskringla in translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological record===
[[File:Finds from a priestess' grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Finds from a vǫlva's grave in [[Köpingsvik]], [[Öland]]. There is an 82 cm long [[wand]] of iron with bronze details and a unique model of a house on the top. There is also a pitcher from Persia or Central Asia, and a West European bronze bowl. Dressed in a bear pelt, she had received a [[ship burial]] with both human and animal sacrifice. The finds are on display in the [[Swedish History Museum]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
Scandinavian archaeologists have discovered wands in about 40 female graves, and they have usually been discovered in rich graves with valuable [[Norse funeral#Grave goods|grave offerings]] which shows that the vǫlvas belonged to the highest level of society.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:56&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is a grave in [[Fyrkat]], Denmark which turned out to be the richest grave in the area.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; She had been [[Chariot burial|buried in a wagon]] from which the wheels had been removed.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; She had been plainly clad in what was probably only a long dress.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; Around her toes, she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; At her head, she had a [[Gotland]]ic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from Finland and Russia.&lt;ref name="Harrison56"/&gt; At her feet, she had a box which contained her magic tools, comprising a [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellet]] from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of [[Hyoscyamus niger]] ("henbane").&lt;ref name="Harrison57"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:57&lt;/ref&gt; If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the vǫlva performed her rituals and [[Hlidskjalf]] from which [[Odin]] watched across the world.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt;
[[File:Freyja in silver.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|The pendant, in the [[Swedish History Museum]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
Another notable grave was the [[Oseberg Ship]] in Norway that revealed two women who had received a sumptuous burial.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; One of the women was most likely a high-ranking lady who knew how to practice [[seiðr]] as she had been buried with a wand of wood.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; In the grave, there were also four [[cannabis]] seeds, which probably had been in the pillows that supported the corpses.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt; Additional cannabis seeds were discovered in a small leather pouch.&lt;ref name="Harrison57"/&gt;

Around the ninth century, a vǫlva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in [[Östergötland]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:58&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"/&gt; There was also a silver pendant which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"/&gt; This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as [[Freyja]]'s necklace, [[Brísingamen]]. The pendant may represent Freyja herself, the most prominent vǫlva of them all.&lt;ref name="Harrison58"/&gt;

In [[Birka]], a vǫlva and a warrior were once buried together. Above them, a spear was positioned in order to dedicate the dead couple to [[Odin]].&lt;ref name="Harrison62"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:62&lt;/ref&gt; They had probably served Freyja and Odin, two deities of war, and he had done so with his spear and she with her wand.&lt;ref name="Harrison62"/&gt;

===Wands and weaving===
{{main|Wand|Weaving (mythology)}}
In theory, invisible fetters and bonds could be controlled from a loom, and if a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:72&lt;/ref&gt; But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; The men may have fought on the battle field in sweat and blood, but in a spiritual way, their women took part.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; It is not by coincidence that archaeologists find weaving tools and weapons side by side.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt;

A distaff possessed magical powers, and in the world of the gods, the [[Norns]] twined the threads of fate.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; In ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana I]]'', norns arrive at the birth of [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] and twined his fate as a hero, and it is possible that these Norns were not divine beings but vǫlur.&lt;ref name="Harrison73"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:73&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the wands that have been excavated have a basket-like shape in the top, and they are very similar to distaffs used for spinning linen.&lt;ref name="Harrison73"/&gt; One theory for the origin of the word seiðr is "thread spun with a distaff", and according to this theory, practicing magic was to send out spiritual threads.&lt;ref name="Harrison72"/&gt; Since the Norsemen believed that the Norns controlled people's fate by spinning, it is very likely that they considered individual fates to be controllable with the same method.&lt;ref name="Harrison73"/&gt;

It is not a coincidence that women are called "[[peace-weaver]]s" in ''[[Beowulf]]'', and since [[Freyja]] had started the first war, it was on the part of the vǫlva to decide when to start wars by practicing magic.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt; This is probably why [[Harald Bluetooth]], who was at war with the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] apparently kept a vǫlva at Fyrkat.&lt;ref name="Harrison69"/&gt;

[[The Wife's Lament]] could be a poem about a peace-weaver.

===Sexual rites and drugs===
[[File:Freyr statue Rällinge crop.jpg|thumb|The [[phallus|ithyphallic]] [[Freyr#Rällinge statuette|Rällinge statuette]], interpreted as a Viking Age depiction of [[Freyr]].]]
Today, it is generally accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testifies to such rites is a small phallic statuette that was found in Rällinge in Sweden in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:75&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother [[Freyr]].&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; [[Adam of Bremen]] tells of the phallic statue of Freyr in the [[Temple at Uppsala]] and of the ribald songs that were sung during the rituals.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; In ''[[Völsa þáttr]]'', there is an account on how a [[Stallion#Reproductive anatomy|horse's penis]] was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.&lt;ref name="Harrison75-78"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:75-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Some wands that have been excavated cannot be associated with distaffs, but instead appear to represent a [[phallus]], and moreover the use of magic had close associations with sexuality in Old Norse society.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; In the ''[[Lokasenna]]'', due to his interest in [[seiðr]], [[Loki]] is depicted accusing [[Odin]] of being ''[[ergi]]'', which suggests that he could be perceived as unmanly, cowardly and accepting the 'female' role in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; As early as 1902, an anonymous German scholar (he did not dare publish in his own name) wrote on how seiðr was connected with sex.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; He argued that the wand was an obvious phallic symbol and why magic should otherwise be considered taboo for men.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; It was possible that the magic practices included sexual rites.&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt; As early as 1920, it was noted that the name of the male magic practitioner Ragnvald Rettilbein referred to such practices, as ''rettilbein'' means "straight member".&lt;ref name="Harrison75"/&gt;

The vǫlur were known for their art of seduction, which was one of the reasons why they were considered dangerous.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:79&lt;/ref&gt; One of the stanzas in ''[[Hávamál]]'' warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt; Freyja, who is the mistress of seiðr, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt;

One of the methods for seducing men may have been the use of drugs.&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt; In [[Fyrkat]], the grave of a vǫlva revealed the use of [[Hyoscyamus niger|henbane]], a drug which not only produces hallucinations but can also be a powerful [[aphrodisiac]].&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt; If Freyja was the goddess of love in [[Asgard]], the vǫlva was her counterpart in [[Midgard]].&lt;ref name="Harrison79"/&gt;

===Other practices===
The vǫlur could also employ drums during their sessions as in [[Sami shamanism]].&lt;ref name="meulen82"&gt;Steinsland, G. &amp; Meulengracht Sørensen, P. 1998:82&lt;/ref&gt; All vǫlur were not surrounded by the same retinue and preparations as Þórbjǫrgr, but she could also perform the seiðr alone, which was called ''útiseta'' (literally, "sitting out").&lt;ref&gt;Blain 2001:61ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keyser 1854:275&lt;/ref&gt; This practice appears to have involved [[meditation]] or [[introspection]], possibly for the purpose of [[divination]]. Blain (2001) sees it as an aspect of seiðr reminiscent of [[shamanism]]. The term is derived from a 13th-century [[Law of Iceland]], which outlawed ''útiseta at vekja trǫll upp ok fremja heiðni'' "sitting out to wake up [[troll]]s and practicing heathenry". Although the theoretical legal punishment for this offense was death, nobody was convicted under it until a minor [[witch craze]] reached Iceland in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Blain 2001:62&lt;/ref&gt; Keyser (1854) describes it as "a peculiar kind of sorcery [...] in which the magician sat out at night under the open sky [...] especially to inquire into the future".

===Male practitioners===
{{main|ergi}}
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|During the Christianization of Norway, King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] had seiðmenn tied up and thrown on a [[skerry]] at ebb.]]
During the Christianization of Norway, King Olaf Trygvasson had seidmen tied up and thrown on a skerry at ebb. Men who practiced sorcery or magic were not received with the same respect but killed like animals and tortured to death because they were dealing with a practice that was held to be in the domain of women.&lt;ref name="meulen81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison65"/&gt; This offense was considered ''[[ergi]]'', "unmanliness, sexually perverse". The ''Heimskringla'' relates that Ragnvaldr Rettilbein, one of [[Harald Fairhair]]'s sons by the [[Sami people|Sami woman]] Snæfrid was a seiðmaðr.&lt;ref name="meulen81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison65"&gt;Harrison &amp; Svensson 2007:65&lt;/ref&gt; The king had him burnt to death inside a house with a large group of fellow male practitioners.&lt;ref name="meulen81"/&gt;

In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', [[Loki]] taunts [[Odin]] for having practiced magic on [[Samsø]], something which was considered ''ergi''.&lt;ref name="Harrison65"/&gt;

==Disappearance==
Increasing conversions to Christianity began to displace the Norse religion, leading to the disappearance of the vǫlur;  aided by [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and civil laws enacted against them, as in this Anglo-Saxon [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]:

{{quotation|If any ''wicca'' (witch), ''wiglaer'' ([[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]), [[false swearer]], ''[[morthwyrtha]]'' (worshipper of the dead) or any foul contaminated, manifest ''[[horcwenan]]'' ([[whore]]), be anywhere in the land, man shall drive them out.

We teach that every priest shall extinguish [[Pagan religions#Heathen|heathendom]] and forbid [[wilweorthunga]] ([[fountain worship]]), ''[[licwiglunga]]'' (incantations of the dead), ''[[hwata]]'' ([[omen]]s), ''[[galdra]]'' ([[magic and religion|magic]]), [[man worship]] and the abominations that men exercise in various sorts of [[witchcraft]], and in ''[[frithspottum]]'' ([[peace-enclosures]]) with elms and other trees, and with stones, and with many phantoms.|16th [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] enacted under [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] in the 10th century}}

They were persecuted and killed in the course of [[Christianization]], which also led to an extreme polarization of the role of females in Germanic society.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Resurgence of the traditions of the vǫlur are apparent in Europe and the United States within Heathen reconstructionism and the Christian community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==In fiction==
The term Spaewife was used as the title for several fictional works: [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s poem "The Spaewife"; [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]]'s historical romance ''The Spaewife: A Tale of the Scottish Chronicles''; and [[John Boyce]]'s ''The Spaewife, or, The Queen's Secret'' (under the pen-name Paul Peppergrass).

===Melville===
Francis Melville describes a spae-wife as a type of [[elf]] in ''The Book of Faeries''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;No taller than a human finger, fairy spae wives are usually dressed in the clothes of a peasant. However, when properly summoned, the attire changes from common to magnificent: blue cloak with a gem-lined collar and black lambskin hood lined with catskin, calfskin boots, and catskin gloves. Like human spae wives, they can also predict the future, through [[runes]], tea leaves and signs generated by natural phenomena, and are good healers. They are said to be descended from the erectors of the [[standing stones]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synopsis==
 
''With the People from the Bridge'' follows the main line of narrative of ''[[Z213: Exit]]'', the first book of the [[Poena Damni]] trilogy. The work opens with a [[First-person narrative|first-person]] account of the [[narrator]] of ''Z213: Exit'', who recounts his arrival at a derelict train station named Nichtovo&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mallory Smart, http://maudlinhouse.tumblr.com/post/113470405890/review-for-with-the-people-from-the-bridge&lt;/ref&gt; in search of a place where, he has been told, an improvised performance is being staged by, what appear to be, a band of social outcasts. The [[narrator]] joins the few members of the audience present and goes on to record in his journal the setting as well as the events taking place "on stage” as the performance is about to begin.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Max Goodwin Brown, http://www.versaljournal.org/blog/2015/3/12/with-the-people-from-the-bridge-by-dimitris-lyacos&lt;/ref&gt; A group of four women in the role of a [[wikt:chorus|Chorus]] and three other protagonists (LG, NCTV, Narrator) are making their final preparations in front of a dilapidated car among machine parts and the noise of a generator.  As the lights "on stage" are lowered the performance sets off with the Chorus's opening monologue followed in turn by the sequence of recitations of the other characters.  The story unfolds during the timeline of a calendar day dedicated to the dead, a kind of [[All Souls' Day]] or [[Saturday of Souls]]. The plot-line originates in the [[Bible]] incident ([[Gospel According to Mark|Mark]], [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|5:9]]), according to which the Gerasene demoniac begs Jesus to spare him from his torments.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Julie Kovacs, http://exercisebowler.com/issue21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In the play enacted, LG assumes and expands on the role of the demoniac, recounting his past condition and describing how he has ended up taking residence in a cemetery. In a kind of simultaneous narration, LG recounts how he has opened the grave of his deceased companion (NCTV), prompted by voices he has been hearing. He enters, finds her body inside and feels compelled to stay with her,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; eventually making the realization that she is gradually coming back to life. Meanwhile, the Chorus are making preparations in anticipation of the yearly visit of their deceased kin and LG and NCTV eventually join them after having broken off from a crowd of revenants aroused on the occasion of the [[Soul Saturday]]. As the day comes to an end, LG and NCTV leave and become again part of the crowd they had broken off from. Despite trying to hold on to each other they are finally absorbed in an indefinite collective of souls moving ahead and cross “the bridge between the worlds" as a Christian-like resurrection appears on the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Swann, http://portagemagazine.org/with-the-people-from-the-bridge-by-dimitris-lyacos/&lt;/ref&gt; The book concludes with the epilogue of the on-stage(internal) Narrator recounting the process by which a mob gathered in a cemetery unearths two bodies, ritually “killing” the female by driving a stake in her chest, in a manner akin to handling vampires&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; in the [[Slavic people|Slavonic]] tradition. A final narrative twist is offered by the presence of a tabloid clipping which delivers the reader back to a stark and gruesome every-day reality.&lt;ref name="criticalflame.org"&gt;Robert Zaller, Eucharist: Dimitris Lyacos's "With the People from the Bridge"The Critical Flame, March 2016. http://criticalflame.org/eucharist-dimitris-lyacoss-with-the-people-of-the-bridge/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==

With the people from the bridge is a [[cross-genre]] work combining prose narrative with dramatic monologues written in poetry form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exercisebowler.com/issue21.htm|title=Exercise Bowler Issue 21|work=exercisebowler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verse soliloquies, elements of staging and ritual as well as choral incantations and simple descriptions are combined to create a polyvalent text approximating both poetry and drama.&lt;ref name="criticalflame.org"/&gt; The makeshift stage as well as the presence of actors give the text its dramatic character, while action and setting, filtered through a spectator's perspective, bring to prominence the dimension of storytelling. Self-reflexive theatricality achieved through a clear-cut presentation of the  division of spectators, actors and director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versaljournal.org/blog/2015/3/12/with-the-people-from-the-bridge-by-dimitris-lyacos|title=With The People From The Bridge, by Dimitris Lyacos|work=Versal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accounted for by the unifying voice of an external narrator leads to the work's classification as a piece of [[metatheatre]]. Further, and due to a constellation of elements including broken narrative, fragmented characters and illusory/imagistic setting, conveyed in the form of a personal experience of an audience member, the work has been categorized as a dinstinctively postmodern play. However, because of its allegiance and focus on a Grand Narrative reconstruction it seems  to stand at a distance from postmodern associations.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Labernik.

Don’t go out. Stay here until
	they come and take you. If you go out
	nobody will know you. Each one waiting
	for their own, in a station
	you don’t recognize, a station inside
	a church. I had a dream yesterday.
	We were holding hands all together 
	around her and were looking at
	the blood under her finger-nails.
	And inside her lips.
	And He came and took us by the hand
	and we went down and out on to the street.
	And at the end of the street there were 	stairs and by way of the stairs 
	you would go down
	inside the church.
	From there again you would go up. 
	And another staircase, and more 
	people and we all wanted 
	to cross to the other side. 
	You could see the water from up above. 
	Then we said we should lie down 
	one on top of the other
	on top of the other. 
	One on top of the other
	until that fades too.
	Don’t go out.

The book exhibits a version of [[Postmodernism|postmodern]]  eclecticism,&lt;ref&gt;Artemis Michailidou, https://greysparrowpress.sharepoint.com/Pages/Spring2015Review.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; alternating poetry with prose parts. Despite its postmodern affinities, it can be construed, however, in line with the High Modernist tradition setting aside the postmodern playfulness for a serious and earnest handling of subject.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Labernik. From the Ruins of Europe: Lyacos's Debt-Riddled Greece. http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/from-the-ruins-of-europe-lyacoss-debt-riddled-greece&lt;/ref&gt; The text develops in a series of intermittent [[monologue]]s interspersed with biblical excerpts and the comments of the first-order [[narrator]].  The biblical elements together with vampiric and dystopian images work in tandem, creating a sense of foreboding and entrapment.&lt;ref&gt;A review of Dimtiris Lyacos's With the People from the Bridge Katie Bodendorfer Garner.

Review by Elisabeth Myhr. https://webdelsolreviewofbooks.wordpress.com/tag/dimitris-lyacos/. Web del Sol Review of Books, May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On occasions, the monologues seems to be ungrammatical and on others the characters seem to be turning back on their words. There is an effect akin to [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]],&lt;ref&gt;Raquel Thorne, http://cahoodaloodaling.com/with-the-people-from-the-bridge-by-dimitris-lyacos/&lt;/ref&gt; the text, however, develops in a linear way among the overlapping stories of the four protagonists. [[Ellipsis]] in narrative conjoined with simplicity of stage movement and the framework of a predominantly static performance, point to [[ritual]] as well as ritualistic theatre.
 
==Structure==
 
The work is structured in the form of an external-frame narrative by a first-order, unreliable [[narrator]]&lt;ref name="asiancha.com"&gt;Michael O'Sullivan. The Precarious Destitute: A Possible Commentary on the Lives of Unwanted Immigrants. http://www.asiancha.com/content/view/2105/505/&lt;/ref&gt; (the narrator of [[Z213: Exit]]) who sets the stage for the development of the inside story. Within this master narrative, four hyponarratives by Narrator (internal/second-order), Chorus, LG and NCTV contribute fragments of the story from their own point of view. As different narratives within the play intertwine, new elements come to the foreground but there is also a sense in which each individual narration overlaps with the others creating an effect of multiple focalization.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Jahn, http://www.uni-koeln.de/~ame02/pppn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The language of the text is simple and idiomatic while the syntax is occasionally disrupted by lacunae as well as incomplete sentences.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Partial fragmentation combines, however, with a more conventional (although most of the time elliptical) linguistic use for the purpose of bringing forward the [[storytelling]]-like character of the work.

==Title==

An earlier version of the text, similar in subject matter and structure but significantly different in content and style was published in 2001 in Greek and German&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctl-presse.de/buecher/25ly.htm|title=Lyacos,  Nyctivoe Libretto 5|work=ctl-presse.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 in English under the title Nyctivoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoestring-press.com/2009/09/poena-damni-nyctivoe-by-dimitris-lyacos/|title=Poena Damni: Nyctivoe|work=shoestring-press.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Nyctivoe, a rare ancient Greek adjective, appears in an [[incantation]] to the goddess of the moon&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.de/books?id=leqORQpn4PsC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;dq=νυκτιβόη&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U82R3jLs6_&amp;sig=tp_2cOgt-r6_Q5pclOsIdJ0mfEc&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwA2oVChMI6eux4baHxgIViFUsCh3mUQAh#v=onepage&amp;q=νυκτιβόη&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Magical Papyri]], a syncretic compilation of texts from the [[Hellenistic]] Period focusing on [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/ict/anrw/pub/II/18/brashear.html|title=Institute for the Classical Tradition - Boston University|work=bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous version of the book, Nyctivoe is a proper name ascribed to the female character of the story, substituted in the new version by NCTV (the sequence of consonants in Nyctivoe).

The current title makes reference both to the setting where the events in the book are described to take place as well as to the bridge crossed by the crowd in the final part of the book. The bridge as the symbol of passage from the world of the living to the realm of the dead relates to the [[Chinvat bridge]] in the [[Zoroastrian]] religion.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Also, the bridge is a symbol of a non-place&lt;ref&gt;Chris Duncan, http://raysroadreview.com/book-review-with-the-people-from-the-bridge/&lt;/ref&gt; relating to the name of the station(Nichtovo) the narrator of the book recalls to have arrived at. From a perspective of social commentary on contemporary events the title has been also interpreted to point to the "living bridge" of illegal [[immigrants]] seeking a Promised Land of plenty.&lt;ref name="asiancha.com"/&gt;

==Publication history and critical reception==
The first edition of With the People from the Bridge had received a number of twenty-one unanimously positive international reviews until autumn 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyacos.net/reviews/with-the-people-from-the-bridge&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been the subject of a considerable amount of scholarly criticism&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zaller, A Column of Cloud and a Column-of-Fire: Dimitris Lyacos’ Poena Damni.Journal of Poetics Research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3843">The '''World Mill''' (also "heavenly mill", "cosmic mill" and variants) is a   [[mytheme]] suggested as recurring in [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] and other mythologies. It involves the analogy of the [[cosmos]] or [[firmament]] and a rotating [[millstone]].
The mytheme was extensively explored in [[Viktor Rydberg]]'s 1886 ''[[Investigations into Germanic Mythology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;vol. 1, sections 79-82.
*''[http://www.alfaleith.org/reading/rydberg/208.php 79. The Great World Mill. Its Mistaken Identity With the Frodi Mill.]''
*''[http://www.alfaleith.org/reading/rydberg/209.php 80. The World Mill, Continued.]''
*''[http://www.alfaleith.org/reading/rydberg/213.php 81. The World Mill Makes the Constellations Revolve.]''
*''[http://www.alfaleith.org/reading/rydberg/215.php 82. The Great World Mill (Continued). Origin of Sacred Fire Through Mundilfari.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Mackenzie described the World Mill’s symbolic relationship to the Swastika, and developed supposed analogs in Chinese, Egyptian, Babylonian, and AmerInd folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Donald A. (1926). ''The Migration of Symbols and Their Relations to Beliefs and Customs'' New York: Knopf, LCCN 26008213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clive Tolley (1995) examined the significance of the mytheme in Indo-European and [[Finnish mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolley (1995:Saga-Book 24:63-82).&lt;/ref&gt;  Tolley found that "the image of a cosmic mill, ambivalently churning out well-being or disaster, may be recognized in certain fragmentary myths", adding additional Indo-European and Finnish analogs of the mill to the material previously considered by Rydberg and others. Tolley comes to the conclusion that
: "the cosmic mill was not, in extant Norse sources, a widely developed mythologem. Nonetheless, the myth of [[Mundilfæri]] connects the turning of the cosmos via a 'mill-handle' with the regulation of seasons, and the myth of [[Bergelmir]] suggests the concept of a creative milling of a giant's body, associated in some way with the sea,"

Richard M. Dorson surveyed the views of 19th-century writers on the World Mill in his 1968 historical review, ''Peasant Customs and Savage Myths: Selections from the British Folklorists'',&lt;ref&gt;Dorson, Richard M., editor (1968). ''Peasant Customs and Savage Myths: Selections from the British Folklorists'', vol.1.  Univ. Chicago Press, LCCN   68016690, p.174. According to Dorson,:&lt;blockquote&gt;A similar conception underlies the Eddaic Mundilföri, the giant who makes the heavens turn round in its daily and yearly revolutions by moving (færa) the handle (mundil, möndull) of the great world-mill — that being the Teutonic idea of the revolving vault of heaven.[Rydberg, Teutonic Mythology, 396-7; M. Müller, Contributions to the Science of Mythology, 40, 651] Mundilföri, the axis-mover and heaven-turner, is a solar being who has his children Máni and Sól (i,e, Sun and Moon). As fire-producer by turning, he was identified with Lodhurr, the fire-kindler. [Rydberg, 412; Du Chaillu, Viking Age, i. 38; C.F. Keary, The Vikings, 65. In the Finnish Kalevala the sun is called ‘God’s spindle’ (Grimm, T.M., 1500)].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the mytheme is discussed in the ''Kommentar zu den Liedern der Edda'',&lt;ref&gt;bd. 3, p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; in regard to the Eddic poem, ''[[Grottasöngr]]''.
