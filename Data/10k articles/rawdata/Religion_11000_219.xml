'''Alhayat TV''', also known as '''Life TV''' (قناة الحياة), is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-language  television channel that airs in countries in [[North Africa]], [[West Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[United States|America]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and some of [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;[http://www.hayatv.tv/home/about-us/3069.html Al Haya TV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228001053/http://www.hayatv.tv/home/about-us/3069.html |date=December 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The channel was founded in [[Cyprus]] in 2003 by Al Hayat Ministries, an evangelical evangelical organization.&lt;ref&gt; Al Hayat Ministries, [http://alhayat.org/en-us/ouroutreach/oursupporters.aspx Our Supporters], Official Website, USA, retrieved August 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Naomi Sakr, ''Arab Television Today'', I.B.Tauris, UK, 2007, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, new evangelical partners joined Al Hayat TV, including [[Joyce Meyer]] Ministries.&lt;ref&gt; Omar Abdel-Razak, bbc.co.uk, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t7g8z Conversion Wars], UK, August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Alhayat directs a lot of content toward Arabic-speaking [[Muslim]]s, and many of its programs feature professed Muslim who converted to Christianity. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} [[Brother Rachid]] is a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] ex-[[Muslim]] convert and is the host of the weekly live call-in show ''Daring Question'' (سؤال جريء). This show is the channel's flagship program.

Alhayat TV became controversial for content that is heavily critical of [[Islam]] and the [[Prophet Mohammed]]. Its programs are much debated and sometimes the subject of angry criticism from Muslims who claim that Alhayat's content is biased and inaccurate.&lt;ref name="IEN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/223965/islams-public-enemy-1-raymond-ibrahim|title=Islam's Public Enemy #1|date=March 25, 2008|author=[[Raymond Ibrahim]]|publisher=National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Father [[Zakaria Botros]], an Egyptian-born preacher who was twice arrested by Arab authorities, is often cited for his bold tone and exposition of contradictions he perceives in Islam.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IEN1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OW" /&gt; In 2010, he was expelled from al-Hayat by Joyce Meyer Ministries, who owns the TV station, due to threats of violence from radical Muslims.

[[Grand Imam of al-Azhar|Al-Azhar]] expressed concerns over the broadcasting of Alhayat TV, saying that the Coptic channel was offensive to Muslims and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/al-azhar-condemns-christian-channel-promoting-sedition|title=Al-Azhar condemns Christian channel for promoting sedition {{!}} Egypt Independent|access-date=April 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amarna''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|ɑːr|n|ə}}; {{lang-ar|العمارنة|al-ʿamārnah}}) is an extensive [[Egypt]]ian [[archaeology|archaeological]] site that represents the remains of the capital city newly established (1346 BC) and built by the [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]] of the late [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]], and abandoned shortly after his [[death]] (1332 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/|title=The Official Website of the Amarna Project |accessdate=2008-10-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081008002752/http://www.amarnaproject.com/| archivedate= 8 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name for the city employed by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians is written as '''Akhetaten''' (or '''Akhetaton'''—transliterations vary) in [[English (language)|English]] transliteration. Akhetaten means "[[akhet (hieroglyph and season)|Horizon]] of the [[Aten]]".&lt;ref name="davidp125"&gt;David (1998), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is located on the east bank of the [[Nile River]] in the modern Egyptian province of [[Minya Governorate|Minya]], some {{convert|58|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the city of [[Minya, Egypt|al-Minya]], {{convert|312|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Egyptian capital [[Cairo]] and {{convert|402|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Luxor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?t=k&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=27.649016,30.908833&amp;spn=0.056566,0.077248&amp;z=14|accessdate=2008-10-01|publisher=Google|title=Google Maps Satellite image}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Deir Mawas]] lies directly west across from the site of Amarna. Amarna, on the east side, includes several modern villages, chief of which are el-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south.

The area was also occupied during later [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and early [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christian]] times; excavations to the south of the city have found several structures from this period.&lt;ref name="roman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/recent_projects/survey/middle_egypt/2006.shtml |title=Middle Egypt Survey Project 2006 |publisher=Amarna Project |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-06-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070622062044/http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/recent_projects/survey/middle_egypt/2006.shtml| archivedate= 22 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name Amarna comes from the Beni Amran tribe that lived in the region and founded a few settlements.  The ancient Egyptian name was Akhetaten.

(This site should be distinguished from Tell Amarna in Syria, a [[Halaf culture|Halaf period]] archaeological [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1032531/Tell_Amarna_in_the_General_Framework_of_the_Halaf_Period] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

English Egyptologist, Sir [[John Gardner Wilkinson]] visited Amarna twice in the 1820s and identified it as ''''Alabastron'''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/amarna/index.html  University College London website, ''Digital Egypt for Universities: Amarna'', accessed 26 July 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of Roman-era authors [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''On Stones'') and [[Ptolemy]] (''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''),&lt;ref name="MatHyer"&gt;{{cite book |title= Materia hieroglyphica |author=Sir John Gardner Wilkinson |year=1828 |location=Malta |publisher=privately printed |page=22 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nWgGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA22&amp;lpg=RA1-PA22&amp;dq=Amarna+%22alabastron%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hKes9f72Hn&amp;sig=brxS2b3VzBGYagHv_xVRkShhKdI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinn-iOgpHOAhXMvBoKHe4BACsQ6AEIOTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Amarna%20%22alabastron%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MatInd"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries |author= Alfred Lucas, John Richard Harris |year=2011 |edition=reprint of 4th edition (1962), revised from first (1926) |location=Mineola, NY |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |page=60 |isbn=9780486404462 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8dIoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=Amarna+%22alabastron%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p-SL65uxH6&amp;sig=4t3Zvp7hXMlGTMEPOFuve9yVCNI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmk9ONg5HOAhVLmBoKHew1B7I4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Amarna%20%22alabastron%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not sure about the identification and suggested [[Nekhen|Kom el-Ahmar]] as an alternative location.&lt;ref name="ModEg"&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Egypt and Thebes: being a description of Egypt; including the information required for travellers in that country |volume= II |year=1843 |location=London |publisher=John Murray |pages=43-44 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fLsMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Amarna+%22alabastron%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_RD2l1YPyN&amp;sig=wu5P0tY05k85W_Gix5LdUOvYz24&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinn-iOgpHOAhXMvBoKHe4BACsQ6AEINDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Amarna%20%22alabastron%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==City of Akhetaten==
{{Amarna Image Map|width=425}}
The area of the city was effectively a virgin site, and it was in this city that the Akhetaten described as the Aten's

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"seat of the First Occasion, which he had made for himself that he might rest in it."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It may be that the [[Royal Wadi and tombs|Royal Wadi]]'s resemblance to the [[egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyph]] for ''horizon'' showed that this was the place to found the city.

The city was built as the new capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, dedicated to his [[Atenism|new religion]] of worship to the [[Aten]]. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign (1346 BC) and was probably completed by Year 9 (1341 BC), although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of [[mud-brick]], and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.&lt;ref&gt;Grundon (2007), p.89&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the only ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[city]] which preserves great details of its internal plan, in large part because the city was abandoned after the death of Akhenaten, when Akhenaten's son, King [[Tutankhamun]], decided to leave the city and return to his birthplace in Thebes (modern Luxor). The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to [[Horemheb]] indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign,&lt;ref name="kemp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/kemp.html |title=Excavating Amarna |publisher=Archaeology.org |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2007-06-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711043111/http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/kemp.html| archivedate= 11 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement&lt;ref name="roman" /&gt; began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Amarna was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately {{convert|8|mi|km}} of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city's population.&lt;ref name="davidp125"/&gt; The entire city was encircled with a total of 14 boundary [[stela]]e detailing Akhenaten's conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of Egypt.&lt;ref name="davidp125"/&gt;

The earliest dated stele from Akhenaten's new city is known to be ''Boundary stele K'' which is dated to Year 5, IV Peret (or month 8), day 13 of Akhenaten's reign.&lt;ref name="aldredp47"&gt;Aldred (1988), p.47&lt;/ref&gt; (Most of the original 14 boundary stelae have been badly eroded.) It preserves an account of Akhenaten's foundation of this city. The document records the pharaoh's wish to have several temples of the Aten to be erected here, for several royal tombs to be created in the eastern hills of Amarna for himself, his chief wife [[Nefertiti]] and his eldest daughter [[Meritaten]] as well as his explicit command that when he was dead, he would be brought back to Amarna for burial.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred (1988), pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt; Boundary stela K introduces a description of the events that were being celebrated at Amarna:

{{quotation|His Majesty mounted a great chariot of electrum, like the [[Aten]] when He rises on the horizon and fills the land with His love, and took a goodly road to Akhetaten, the place of origin, which [the Aten] had created for Himself that he might be happy therein. It was His son Wa'enrē [i.e. Akhenaten] who founded it for Him as His monument when His Father commanded him to make it. Heaven was joyful, the earth was glad every heart was filled with delight when they beheld him.&lt;ref name="aldredp48"&gt;Aldred (1988), p.48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This text then goes on to state that Akhenaten made a great oblation to the god Aten "and this is the theme [of the occasion] which is illustrated in the [[lunette (stele)|lunette]]s of the stelae where he stands with his queen and eldest daughter before an altar heaped with offerings under the Aten, while it shines upon him rejuvenating his body with its rays."&lt;ref name="aldredp48"/&gt;

[[File:Amarna boundary stela U 02.JPG|thumb|Statues to the left of Boundary stela U in el-Amarna]]

===Site and plan===

Located on the east bank of the Nile, the ruins of the city are laid out roughly north to south along a "Royal Road", now referred to as "Sikhet es-Sultan".&lt;ref name="waterson81"&gt;Waterson (1999), p.81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grundon92"&gt;Grundon (2007), p.92&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal residences are generally to the north, in what is known as the [[North City, Amarna|North City]], with a central administration and religious area and the south of the city is made up of residential suburbs.

====North City====
[[File:Egyptian - Seal Ring with the Name of Akhenaten - Walters 42201 - Side A.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|Akhenaten seal ring in blue faience. [[Walters Art Museum]]]]
{{Main|North City, Amarna}}
If one approached the city of Amarna from the north by river the first buildings past the northern boundary stele would be the [[North Riverside Palace]].  This building ran all the way up to the waterfront and was likely the main residence of the Royal Family.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Barry, The City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People, Thames and Hudson, 2012, pg 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;  Located within the North City area is the [[Northern Palace (Amarna)|Northern Palace]], the main residence of the Royal Family{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Between this and the central city, the Northern Suburb was initially a prosperous area with large houses, but the house size decreased and became poorer the further from the road they were.&lt;ref name="grundon92"/&gt;

====Central City====

Most of the important ceremonial and administrative buildings were located in the central city. Here the [[Great Temple of the Aten]] and the [[Small Aten Temple]] were used for religious functions and between these the Great Royal Palace and Royal Residence were the ceremonial residence of the King and Royal Family, and were linked by a bridge or ramp.&lt;ref&gt;Waterson (1999), p.82&lt;/ref&gt; Located behind the Royal Residence was the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]], where the [[Amarna Letters]] were found.&lt;ref&gt;Moran (1992), p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

This area was probably the first area to be completed, and had at least two phases of construction.&lt;ref name="waterson81"/&gt;

====Southern suburbs====

To the south of the city was the area now referred to as the ''Southern Suburbs''. It contained the estates of many of the city's powerful nobles, including [[Nakhtpaaten]] (Chief Minister), Ranefer, [[Panehesy]] (High Priest of the Aten) and Ramose (Master of Horses). This area also held the studio of the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]], where the famous bust of Nefertiti was found in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Waterson (1999), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the south of the city was [[Kom el-Nana]], an enclosure, usually referred to as a ''sun-shade'', and was probably built as a sun-temple.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/komelnana/index.shtml|title=Kom El-Nana|accessdate=2008-10-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081008020948/http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/komelnana/index.shtml| archivedate= 8 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the [[Maru-Aten]], which was a palace or sun-temple originally thought to have been constructed for [[Akhenaten]]'s queen [[Kiya]], but on her death her name and images were altered to those of [[Meritaten]], his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Eyma (2003), p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

====City outskirts====

Surrounding the city and marking its extent, the [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|Boundary Stelae]] (each a rectangle of carved rock on the cliffs on both sides of the Nile) describing the founding of the city are a primary source of information about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/boundary_stelae/index.shtml|title=Boundary Stelae|accessdate=2007-06-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070529001036/http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/boundary_stelae/index.shtml| archivedate= 29 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Away from the city Akhenaten's [[Royal Wadi and Tombs|Royal necropolis]] was started in a narrow valley to the east of the city, hidden in the cliffs. Only one tomb was completed, and was used by an unnamed Royal Wife, and Akhenaten's tomb was hastily used to hold him and likely [[Meketaten]], his second daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/royal_tombs/index.shtml|title=Royal Tomb|accessdate=2008-10-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080927231423/http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/royal_tombs/index.shtml| archivedate= 27 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the cliffs to the north and south of the Royal Wadi, the nobles of the city constructed their [[Tombs of the Nobles (Amarna)|Tombs]].

==Life in ancient Amarna/Akhetaten==
[[File:TutankhamunBerlin.jpg|thumb|Tutankamun Amarna portrait. [[Altes Museum]], [[Berlin]]]]

Much of what is known about Amarna's founding is due to the preservation of a series of official boundary stelae (13 are known) ringing the perimeter of the city.  These are cut into the cliffs on both sides of the Nile (10 on the east, 3 on the west) and record the events of Akhetaten (Amarna) from founding to just before its fall.&lt;ref&gt;Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, Revolution and Restoration, [[David P. Silverman|Silverman, David P]]; [[Josef W. Wegner|Wegner, Josef W]]; Jennifer Houser; Copyright 2006 by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the move from Thebes to Amarna, Akhenaten needed the support of the military.  Ay, one of Akhenaten's principal advisors, exercised great influence in this area because his father [[Yuya]] had been an important military leader.  Additionally, everyone in the military had grown up together, they had been a part of the richest and most successful period in Egypt's history under Akhenaten's father, so loyalty among the ranks was strong and unwavering. Perhaps most importantly, "it was a military whose massed ranks the king took every opportunity to celebrate in temple reliefs, first at Thebes and later at Amarna."&lt;ref&gt;Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet, Reeves, Nicholas, Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, London, copyright 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious life===

While the reforms of Akhenaten are generally believed to have been oriented towards a sort of monotheism, this may be rather oversimplifying to state than [[monolatrism]]. Archaeological evidence shows other deities were also revered, even at the centre of the Aten cult – if not officially, then at least by the people who lived and worked there.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
..at Akhetaten itself, recent excavation by [[Barry Kemp (Egyptologist)|Kemp]] (2008: 41-46) has shown the presence of objects that depict gods, goddesses and symbols that belong to the traditional field of personal belief. So many examples of [[Bes]], the grotesque dwarf figure who warded off evil spirits, have been found, as well as of the goddess-monster, [[Taweret]], part crocodile, part hippopotamus, who was associated with childbirth. Also in the royal workmen’s village at Akhetaten, stelae dedicated to [[Isis]] and [[Shed (deity)|Shed]] have been discovered  (Watterson 1984: 158 and 208).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Turner, [https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:180305 ''Seth - a misrepresented god in the Ancient Egyptian pantheon?''] PhD Thesis, [[University of Manchester]]; 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amarna art-style broke with long-established Egyptian conventions.  Unlike the strict idealistic [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] of previous [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]], it depicted its subjects more realistically.  These included informal scenes, such as intimate portrayals of affection within the royal family or playing with their children, and no longer portrayed women as lighter coloured than men. The art also had a realism that sometimes borders on caricature.

While the worship of [[Aten]] was later referred to as the [[Amarna heresy]] and suppressed, this art had a more lasting legacy.

==Rediscovery and excavation==

The first western mention of the city was made in 1714 by [[Claude Sicard]], a [[France|French]] [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] who was travelling through the Nile Valley, and described the boundary stela from Amarna. As with much of Egypt, it was visited by [[Napoleon]]'s ''corps de savants'' in 1798–1799, who prepared the first detailed map of Amarna, which was subsequently published in ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'' between 1821 and 1830.&lt;ref name="amarnamapping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/recent_projects/survey/index.shtml|title=Mapping Amarna|accessdate=2008-10-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081008012317/http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/recent_projects/survey/index.shtml| archivedate= 8 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this European exploration continued in 1824 when Sir [[John Gardiner Wilkinson]] explored and mapped the city remains. The copyist [[Robert Hay (Egyptologist)|Robert Hay]] and his surveyor G. Laver visited the locality and uncovered several of the Southern Tombs from sand drifts, recording the reliefs in 1833. The copies made by Hay and Laver languish largely unpublished in the [[British Library]], where an ongoing project to identify their locations is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astene.org.uk/associated_events_societies/hay.htm|title=The Robert Hay Drawings in the British Library|accessdate=2008-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627025558/http://www.astene.org.uk/associated_events_societies/hay.htm|archivedate=2006-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prussia]]n expedition led by [[Richard Lepsius]] visited the site in 1843 and 1845, and recorded the visible monuments and topography of Amarna in two separate visits over a total of twelve days, using drawings and paper squeezes. The results were ultimately published in ''Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien'' between 1849 and 1913, including an improved map of the city.&lt;ref name="amarnamapping"/&gt; Despite being somewhat limited in accuracy, the engraved ''Denkmäler'' plates formed the basis for scholastic knowledge and interpretation of many of the scenes and inscriptions in the private tombs and some of the Boundary Stelae for the rest of the century. The records made by these early explorers teams are of immense importance since many of these remains were later destroyed or otherwise lost.

In 1887 a local woman digging for ''[[sebakh]]'' uncovered a cache of over 300 [[cuneiform|cuneiform tablet]]s (now commonly known as the [[Amarna Letters]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~ib205/budge.html|title=Wallis Budge describes the discovery of the Amarna tablets|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tablets recorded select [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] correspondence of the Pharaoh and were predominantly written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' commonly used during the [[Late Bronze Age]] of the [[Ancient Near East]] for such communication. This discovery led to the recognition of the importance of the site, and lead to a further increase in exploration.&lt;ref name="grundon9091"&gt;Grundon (2007), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1891 and 1892 [[Alessandro Barsanti]] 'discovered' and cleared the king's tomb (although it was probably known to the local population from about 1880).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/royal_tombs/index.shtml|title=Royal Tomb|publisher=The Amarna Project|accessdate=2008-10-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080927231423/http://www.amarnaproject.com/pages/amarna_the_place/royal_tombs/index.shtml| archivedate= 27 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time Sir [[Flinders Petrie]] worked for one season at Amarna, working independently of the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]]. He excavated primarily in the Central City, investigating the [[Great Temple of the Aten]], the Great Official Palace, the King's House, the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]] and several private houses. Although frequently amounting to little more than a sondage (survey), Petrie's excavations revealed additional cuneiform tablets, the remains of several glass factories, and a great quantity of discarded [[faience]], glass and ceramic in sifting the palace rubbish heaps (including Mycenaean sherds).&lt;ref name="grundon9091"/&gt;  By publishing his results and reconstructions rapidly, Petrie was able to stimulate further interest in the site's potential.

The copyist and artist [[N. de Garis Davies|Norman de Garis Davies]] published drawn and photographic descriptions of private tombs and boundary stelae from Amarna from 1903 to 1908. These books were republished by the EES in 2006.

In the early years of the 20th century (1907 to 1914) the [[Deutsche Orientgesellschaft]] expedition, led by [[Ludwig Borchardt]], excavated extensively throughout the North and South suburbs of the city. The famous bust of [[Nefertiti bust|Nefertiti]], now in Berlin's [[Neues Museum|Ägyptisches Museum]], was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]]. The outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August 1914 terminated the German excavations.

From 1921 to 1936 an Egypt Exploration Society expedition returned to excavation at Amarna under the direction of T.E. Peet, Sir [[Leonard Woolley]], [[Henri Frankfort]], [[Stephen Glanville]]&lt;ref&gt;Grundon(2007), p.71&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Pendlebury]]. [[Mary Chubb]] served as the digs administrator. The renewed investigations were focused on religious and royal structures.

During the 1960s the Egyptian Antiquities Organization (now the [[Egypt]]ian [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]]) undertook a number of excavations at Amarna.

Exploration of the city continues to the present, currently under the direction of [[Barry Kemp (Egyptologist)|Barry Kemp]] (Emeritus Professor in Egyptology, University of Cambridge, England) (until 2006, under the auspices of the [[Egypt Exploration Society]] and now with the [http://www.amarnaproject.com/ Amarna Project]).&lt;ref name="kemp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ees.ac.uk/fieldwork/amarna.htm |title=Fieldwork- Tell El-Armana |accessdate=2008-10-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424101113/http://www.ees.ac.uk/fieldwork/amarna.htm |archivedate=2008-04-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 a separate expedition led by Geoffrey Martin described and copied the reliefs from the Royal Tomb, later publishing its findings together with objects thought to have come from the tomb. This work was published in 2 volumes by the EES.

From 2005 to 2013, the Amarna Project excavated at a [[Southern Tombs Cemetery|cemetery]] of private individuals, close to the southern tombs of the Nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7209472.stm|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|title=Grim secrets of Pharaoh's city|accessdate=2008-10-01|author=John Hayes-Fisher|work=BBC Timewatch | date=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asman''' is the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] and [[Middle Persian]] name of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] divinity that is the hypostasis of the sky. Asman is the "highest heaven," and is distinguished from the firmament (''thwasha''), which lies nearer the earth. The 27th day of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] is dedicated to him.

In the [[Avesta]], specifically in the [[Vendidad]], the word is mentioned as being the first thing created. The word is also the origination of the word (آسمان) ''aasmaan'' in modern [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] as well as (ਅਸਮਾਨ) ''asmaan'' in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], (आसमान) in [[Hindi]] and (আসমান) in [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gershevitch|Fisher|1985|p=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Athleta Christi"''' ({{lang-la|"Champion of Christ"}}) was a class of [[Early Christian]] soldier [[martyr]]s, of whom the most familiar example is one such "[[military saint]]," [[Saint Sebastian]].

==Usage==
Since the 15th century, the title has been a political one, granted by [[Pope]]s to men who have led military campaigns defending [[Christianity]]. The militant [[Catholic hymn]] ''Athleta Christi nobilis'' ("Noble Champion of the Lord"), a hymn for [[Matins]] on May 18, the feast of Saint [[Venantius of Camerino|Venantius]], was written in the 17th century by an unknown author. The medieval precursors of the hymn are numerous and include [[hymns]], [[responsories]] and [[antiphon]]s dedicated to many saints and martyrs, even non-militant ones such as [[Sts. Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/MMDB/Alist/AfileA54.htm Latrobe article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050109001325/http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/MMDB/Alist/AfileA54.htm |date=January 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who have held the title include:
* [[Louis I of Hungary]], called upon by [[Pope Innocent VI]];
* [[John Hunyadi]] of Hungary, called by [[Pope Pius II]];
* [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]] of [[Albania]], called by Popes [[Pope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Paul II|Paul II]], and [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Fulfilled Promise: A Documentary Account of Religious Persecution in Albania''; By Gjon Sinishta; page 6.[https://books.google.com/books?id=8OtJAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=athleta+christi+skanderbeg&amp;dq=athleta+christi+skanderbeg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Um7eS_eTLI2U8gSfwMCXBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDwQ6wEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7442">{{dicdef}}{{more citations needed|date=November 2014}}'''Babul''' ( Hindi: बाबुल, Pronounced: ''bəˈbo͞ol'' ) ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq| بابل }}}}) is an old [[Urdu]]-[[Hindi]] term for father indicating a daughter's affection. The term is now mainly used in [[Bollywood songs]] in the context of a newly married daughter leaving her father's home.

In [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], the conclusion of a daughter's marriage, marked by the bidaai (farewell) ceremony, is a profoundly sad occasion, because after this she leaves her father's house and permanently relocates to her husband's family. The moment thus marks the end of her past life and the beginning of a new one. The expression of this sentiment varies, but is usually in the formed of hushed sobs, while maintaining sober calmness and composure. This sentiment is often reflected in [[Bollywood]] and regional films.

==Famous examples==
[[Wajid Ali Shah]] (1822–1887), the last [[nawab]] of [[Awadh]], wrote a popular [[Bhairavi (Hindustani)|bhairavi]] [[thumri]] "[[Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Jaye]]", where he likens bidai to death, and his own banishment for his beloved Lucknow&lt;ref&gt;Nawab Wajid Ali Shah by Susheela Mishra, Great Masters of Hindustani Music by Susheela Mishra Hem Publishers, 1981 [https://groups.google.com/group/rec.music.indian.classical/browse_thread/thread/72692da1fc29a68b]&lt;/ref&gt; ([https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Babul+mora+&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=-1&amp;oq= video search for [[Kundan Lal Saigal|Saigal]]'s 1938 rendition]):

बाबुल मोरा, नैहर छूटो ही जाए&lt;br /&gt;
चार कहार मिल, मोरी डोलिया उठायें ... &lt;br /&gt;
मोरा अपना बेगाना छूटो जाए | ... &lt;br /&gt;
आँगना तो पर्बत भयो और देहरी भयी बिदेश ... &lt;br /&gt;
जाए बाबुल घर आपनो मैं चली पीया के देश | बाबुल मोरा ...

''Translation: My father! I'm leaving home.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The four bearers lift my doli ([[palanquin]]) (here it can also mean the four coffin bearers)''.
''I'm leaving those who were my own.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Your courtyard is now like a mountain, and the threshold, a foreign country.''&lt;br/&gt;
''I leave your house, father, I am going to my beloved.

The expression is found in the Sanskrit texts also. In [[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sha/sha08.htm ACT IV SHAKUNTALA'S DEPARTURE SCENE II.--Early Morning.&lt;/ref&gt; the sage Kanva, who had adopted [[Shakuntala]], mourns:

यास्यत्यद्य शकुन्तलेति हृदयं संस्पृष्टमुत्कण्ठया ..&lt;br /&gt;
ऐक्लव्यं मम तावदीदृशमिदं स्नेहादरण्यौकसः&lt;br /&gt;
पीड्यन्ते गृहिणः कथं नु तनयाविश्लेषदुःखैर्नवैः||६||

''Shakuntala must go to-day, I miss her now at heart ..''&lt;br /&gt;
''What must a father feel, when come''&lt;br /&gt;
''The pangs of parting from his child at home?''

==Gurbani==
This word Babul has been used in Gurbani, the Sikh scripture few times. Babul means father. God has been referred to as Babul in Gurbani.

ਬਾਬੁਲੁ ਮੇਰਾ ਵਡ ਸਮਰਥਾ ਕਰਣ ਕਾਰਣ ਪ੍ਰਭੁ ਹਾਰਾ ॥&lt;br /&gt;
My father (Babul, God) is all powerful and capable. He is the doer and cause of everything.&lt;ref&gt;Soohee, Fifth Mehl http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=778&amp;g=1&amp;h=1&amp;r=1&amp;t=1&amp;p=0&amp;k=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farewell from father==

Many Bollywood movies have songs on the babul theme. There have been several movies that use the term "babul" in the title: ''[[Babul (1950 film)]]'', ''[[Baabul (2006 film)]]'', ''[[Babul Ka Aangann Chootey Na]]'' (it is hard to leave father's courtyard) and ''[[Babul Ki Galiyaan]]'' (father's streets).

A song by [[Sahir Ludhiyanvi]] from 1968 film ''[[Neel Kamal (1968 film)|Neel Kamal]]'' is often played in Indian weddings is&lt;ref&gt;http://sach-sahirludhianvi.blogspot.com/2008/04/sahir-ludhianvi-biography_13.html  BAABUL KII DUAAYEIN LETII JAA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%27babul+ki+duaen video search)]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Baabul ki duaaen leti ja, ja tujh ko sukhi sansaar mile"

बाबुल की दुआएं लेती जा, जा तुझ को सुखी संसार मिले&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
नाज़ों से तुझे पाला मैनें, कलियों की तरह, फूलों की  तरह&lt;br /&gt;
बचपन में झुलाया है तुझ को, बाँहों ने मेरी झूलों कि तरह&lt;br /&gt;
मेरे बाग़ की ऐ नाज़ुक डाली, तुझे हर पल नई बहार मिले |

''Take your father's blessing! May you find a happy world.''

''I raised you tenderly with love, like a flower,''&lt;br /&gt;
''I used to swing you in my own arms like a swing.''&lt;br /&gt;
''O delicate branch of my garden, may you always find spring.''

It is said that the singer [[Mohammad Rafi]] sang this song just before his own daughter's marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rafi+bidai&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f video search]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakeel Badayuni]] wrote this song for the 1957 classic ''[[Mother India]]'':

"Pee ke ghar aaj pyaari dulhaniya chali"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Pyaari+Dulhaniya&amp;search_type= video search]&lt;/ref&gt;

पी के घर आज प्यारी दुल्हनिया चली&lt;br /&gt;
रोएं माता पिता उनकी दुनिया चली

मेरी क़िस्मत में जाता था परदेस रे&lt;br /&gt;
छोड़ कर अपने बाबुल का आँगन चली

''The bride leaves today for her beloved's house.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The father and mother cry, their world is going away.''&lt;br /&gt;
''It was my fate to go to a distant land,''&lt;br /&gt;
''I leave, leaving behind my father's courtyard.''

==Returning to father's home in Savan==

In the month of Savan ([[Shravana]]), the bride is supposed to return to her father home, now as an outsider. A song by [[Shailendra (lyricist)|Shailendra]] (movie [[Bandini (film)|Bandini]]) expresses this ([https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ab+Ke+Baras+Bhej+&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=-1&amp;oq= video search]):

अब के बरस भेज भैयाको बाबुल &lt;br /&gt;
सावन में लीजो बुलाय रे&lt;br /&gt;
लौटेंगी जब मेरे बचपन की सखियाँ&lt;br /&gt;
दीजो संदेशा भिजाय रे

This year, father, send my brother,&lt;br /&gt;
to come and get me during Savan,&lt;br /&gt;
when my childhood friends will also return,&lt;br /&gt;
do send a message asking me to come.

This song forms the title of a 2002 film [[Ab Ke Baras]].

[[Buddhism]] is a minority religion in [[Mexico]], numbering 108,701 followers or 0.09% of the total Mexican population.

==Tibetan Buddhism==
Casa Tibet México (headquartered in the [[Colonia Roma]] of [[Mexico City]]) was the third of the [[Tibet House]]s to be created.&lt;ref name="El Universal"&gt;{{cite web|title= Casa Tibet en contra del estereotipo| url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/37708.html |publisher=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the [[XIV Dalai Lama]] on his first visit to Mexico.&lt;ref name="El Universal"/&gt; One of the main objectives of the Casa Tibet is to combat the esoteric [[New Age]] beliefs that surround eastern [[cosmogony]] and to disseminate and preserve true [[Tibetan culture]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism|spirituality]].&lt;ref name="El Universal"/&gt;

The current Director, [[Lama]] Marco Antonio Karam, was chosen by the [[Dalai Lama]] to head the Casa Tibet.&lt;ref name="El Universal"/&gt; Another important mission the Casa Tibet participates in is the sponsoring of Tibetan children located in [[Dharamshala]], India.&lt;ref name="El Universal"/&gt; In Mexico, they have given help to [[street children]], [[Indigenous people of Mexico|Indigenous children]] and [[single mother]]s.&lt;ref name="El Universal"/&gt; The Casa Tibet does not [[proselytize]], but will not refuse an individual wanting to learn about Tibetan ideology.&lt;ref name="El Universal"/&gt;

==Other Denominations==
There's a [[Thai Buddhist]] temple in [[Tamaulipas]]  where there are 3 monks from [[Thailand]] that teach the religion, as well as one monk from [[Cambodia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4238">Christian polemics and apologetics in Europe during the Middle Ages were primarily directed inwards, either against "heretics," such as the [[Cathars]], or between [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]]. A subset of polemic and apologetic activity continued against Judaism and Islam, both openly in Christian Europe and more circumspectly in the pre-Ottoman and Ottoman lands.

==Polemics against heretics==
{{main|Church and state in medieval Europe|Christian heresy|Medieval Inquisition}}
Given the absolute control of the state, and the lack of ethnic separation (such as protected to a degree and at some times Jewish communities in Christian Europe) military and police actions were generally used against Christian heretics, rather than polemics and apologetics. For example, the [[Cathars]] did not survive [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209-1229) and massacre at [[Montségur]] (1244) to leave traces of Cathar apologetics.

==Polemics against Islam==
{{main|Medieval Christian views on Muhammad|Islamic view of the Bible}}
The [[Crusades]] also formed the background to medieval Christian [[criticism of Islam]] and medieval Islamic [[criticism of Christianity]], resulting in conflicting responses from Christian authors of chivalrous epics and hostile theological polemics.&lt;ref&gt;John Victor Tolan ''Medieval Christian perceptions of Islam'' Page 420 2000 "For medieval Christians. Islam presented a series of disquieting challenges. Epic poets imagined Muslim ... either of demonic hostility or of chivalric ideals, while polemics wrote theological refutations, often defaming the Prophet."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Muslim-Christian polemic during the Crusades'' R. Y. Ebied, David Richard Thomas, Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Abī Ṭālib Dimashqī - 2005 "This edition and English translation of the fourteenth century correspondence between Cypriot Christians and the Muslim Ibn Ab lib al-Dimashq is a significant example of later medieval Christian-Muslim polemic that affords an invaluable "&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter the Venerable]]'s commission of a Latin translation of the Qur'an, was followed by polemical writings from [[Peter Pascual|Pedro Pascual]], [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]] ''Contra legem Sarracenorum'' "Against the Quran of the Saracens" (1300), and [[Ramon Llull]].&lt;ref&gt;David Richard Thomas ''Early Muslim polemic against Christianity: Abū ʻĪsá al-Warrāq's "Against the Trinity"  Muḥammad ibn Hārūn Warrāq,  - 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oddbjorn Leirvik - 2010 "As a post-Christian religion, which has included much of the Christian heritage, Islam challenges Christianity by ... and argue against the reliability of the Christian sources, culminating in the medieval polemic of Ibn Hazm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The ambivalence of interreligious experience: [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce|Riccoldo da Monte]]'' Page 147 Rita George Tvrtkovic, University of Notre Dame - 2007 "Medieval Theology of Islam: Method [[Amos Funkenstein]] describes four kinds of medieval Christian anti-Jewish polemic: the classic ''dialogi cum Judaeis'' argument; rationalistic polemic attempting to “prove” Christian doctrine; attacking the attacking the Talmud; using the Talmud to demonstrate the truth of Christianity.458 To an extent, these four methods of argumentation are similar to those used by medieval Christians against Islam. This should not be surprising, ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polemics against Judaism==
{{main|Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)|Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages}}
Virulent [[Antisemitism in Europe (Middle Ages)|antisemitism in medieval Europe]] obviated the need for any debate or discussion in most periods and most countries. However, during the 12th Century converted Jews such as [[Petrus Alfonsi]] and [[Pablo Christiani]], well versed in Jewish religion, initiated the ''Contra Iudaeos'' (or ''Adversus Iudaeos'') literature either from missionary or polemic reasons. This was both an impetus to and response to Jewish apologetics answering Christians, and more robust polemical writings (where safe to publish) among the community as a guard against conversion.

'''Comet Kohoutek''', [[Astronomical naming conventions#Comets|formally designated]] '''C/1973 E1''', '''1973 XII''', and '''1973f''', was first sighted on 7 March 1973 by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] astronomer [[Luboš Kohoutek]]. It attained [[perihelion]] on 28 December that same year.

Comet Kohoutek is a [[long-period comet]]; its previous apparition was about 150,000 years ago, and its next apparition will be in about 75,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;calculated from original 1/a and future 1/a values. See [http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iauc/02500/02588.html IAUC 2588]&lt;/ref&gt; At its apparition in 1973, it had a [[hyperbolic trajectory]] ([[Orbital eccentricity|e]] &gt; 1) due to gravitational perturbations from [[giant planets]]. Due to its path, scientists theorized that Kohoutek was an [[Oort cloud|Oort-cloud]] object. As such, it was believed that this was the comet's first visit to the inner [[Solar System]], which would result in a spectacular display of outgassing. Infrared and visual telescopic study have led many scientists to conclude, in retrospect, that Kohoutek is actually an [[Edgeworth–Kuiper belt|Edgeworth/Kuiper-belt object]], which would account for its apparent rocky makeup and lack of outgassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The Star Online]] |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2006/2/6/lifefocus/13229171&amp;sec=lifefocus |title=Mystery of Kohoutek |date=6 February 2006 |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its close approach, Kohoutek was promoted by the media as the "comet of the century". However, Kohoutek's display was considered a let-down,&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/97561/new-sun-skirting-comet-could-provide-dazzling-display-in-2013/ |title=New ‘Sun-Skirting’ Comet Could Provide Dazzling Display in 2013 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=2012-09-26 |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to partial [[Comet#Fate of comets|disintegration]] when the comet closely approached the Sun prior to its Earth flyby. Since this was probably the comet's first visit to the inner Solar System, it would have still contained large amounts of frozen [[volatiles]] since its formation. Although it failed to brighten to levels expected, it was still a naked-eye object. Its greatest visual magnitude was −3, when it was at perihelion, {{convert|0.14|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from the [[Sun]]. Its orbital [[inclination]] is 14.3°. Its best viewing was in the night sky after [[perihelion]], when it had dimmed to fourth [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]]. The comet also sported a tail up to 25° long, along with an anti-tail.

This comet was observed by the crews of [[Skylab 4]] and [[Soyuz 13]], thus becoming the first comet to be observed by a manned spacecraft, since [[Apollo 13]]'s planned observations of the prominent naked-eye [[Comet Bennett]] were aborted by the moon-bound craft's oxygen-tank explosion.

C/1973 E1 should not be confused with the [[periodic comet]] [[75D/Kohoutek]], which can also be called "Comet Kohoutek". In addition, there are another [[List of comets by type#List of near-parabolic comets|two long-period comets]], C/1969 O1-A (a.k.a. 1970 III, 1969b), and C/1973 D1 (a.k.a. 1973 VII, 1973e) also discovered by Luboš Kohoutek.

Because Comet Kohoutek fell far short of expectations, its name became synonymous with spectacular duds. However, it was fairly bright as comets go and put on a respectable show in the evenings shortly after perihelion.

In 1973, [[David Berg]], founder of the [[Children of God (cult)|Children of God]], predicted that Comet Kohoutek foretold a colossal [[doomsday event]] in the [[United States]] in January 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-25/news/mn-1278_1_david-berg |title=David Berg; Founder of Controversial Sect |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 25, 1994 |access-date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gw7rDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp; |last=Mumfrey |first=W.

The majority of U.S.-based members then fled in anticipation to existing [[commune (intentional community)|communes]], or formed new ones, around the world.

== In popular culture ==

'''Daniel Seth Loeb''' (born December 18, 1961) is an American investor, [[hedge fund|hedge fund manager]], and philanthropist. He is the founder and chief executive of [[Third Point LLC|Third Point]], a New York-based hedge fund focused on event-driven, value-oriented investing with $10.8 billion in [[assets under management]], as of March 2016.&lt;ref name="Third Point portfolio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan Loeb Bio, Returns, Net Worth|url=http://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/third+point/16|website=Insider Monkey|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="third point description"&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Point – About Us|url=http://www.thirdpoint.com/|publisher=[[Third Point LLC]]|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]]'' noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite web|last=Fishman|first=Steve|title=Get Richest Quickest|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/bizfinance/finance/features/10426/index1.html#print|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb was described as "one of the most successful activists" in 2014.&lt;ref name="2014 investor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oleinic|first1=Alex|title=Why You Should Follow Billionaire Dan Loeb's Small-Cap Picks|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3037016-why-you-should-follow-billionaire-dan-loebs-small-cap-picks|accessdate=19 April 2015|publisher=Seeking Alpha|date=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Loeb is the son &lt;ref name=nymag/&gt; of Ronald and Clare (née Spark) Loeb.&lt;ref name=wedding&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/04/style/weddings-celebrations-margaret-munzer-daniel-loeb.html ''Weddings\Celebrations''; Margaret Munzer, Daniel Loeb"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 4, 2004; retrieved August 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Santa Monica, California]] where he attended [[Palisades Charter High School]].&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;&lt;ref name=mattel /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kampeas, Ron [http://blogs.jta.org/politics/article/2011/05/14/3087695/jewish-republican-pro-gay-rights "Jewish, Republican, pro-gay rights"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213231257/http://blogs.jta.org/politics/article/2011/05/14/3087695/jewish-republican-pro-gay-rights|date=December 13, 2011}}, ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]'', May 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the school, he took [[Advanced Placement|AP]] classes, started a skateboard company and was nicknamed "[[Milo Minderbinder]]" by one of his teachers (after a character in the novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' who had a fascination with the [[stock market]]).&lt;ref name="life of dan loeb"/&gt; His father was a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell &amp; Manella LLP&lt;ref name="mattel"&gt;Gopinath, Deepak [https://www.scribd.com/doc/14103274/Daniel-S-Loeb-Third-Point-LLC-Hedge-Fund-Rabble-Rouser-by-Deepak-Gopinath-of-Bloomberg Hedgefund Rabble Rouser] ''[[Bloomberg Markets]]'', October 2005; retrieved August 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[general counsel]] for [[Williams-Sonoma]].&lt;ref name="wedding"/&gt; His father also served as an outside director of [[Mattel]], Inc. for over 30 years and during one period became interim President of Mattel. His mother is a historian and independent scholar.&lt;ref name="wedding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mattel"/&gt;

Loeb's great-aunt, [[Ruth Handler]], created the [[Barbie doll]] and co-founded [[Mattel]] Inc.&lt;ref name=mattel/&gt; In 2009, Loeb told an audience "[I] associated success in business with [[Hot Wheels]] and Barbie dolls. I think it was a very powerful enforcer early on to like business."&lt;ref name="life of dan loeb"&gt;{{cite web|last=La Roche|first=Julia|title=The Fabulous Life Of Dan Loeb – The Hedge Fund Manager At War Against Bill Ackman|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/who-is-dan-loeb-2013-1#speaking-of-his-family-loebs-great-aunt-is-the-creator-of-the-barbie-doll-5|publisher=Business insider|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loeb attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] for two years and subsequently graduated from [[Columbia University]] with an economics degree.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey, Brandon [http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_20616462 "Daniel Loeb: Southern California native a hedge fund manager who takes on corporate executives"], ''Silicon Valley'', May 5, 2012; retrieved May 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; By his senior year at Columbia, he had made $120,000 in the stock market, but lost it all on an investment in a firm called Puritan-Bennett Inc. The loss taught him a lesson, he later said, in "overconcentrating positions".&lt;ref name="life of dan loeb"/&gt;

==Investing career==
From 1984-87, Loeb worked at [[private equity]] firm [[Warburg Pincus]].&lt;ref name="salt conference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Loeb profile at|url=http://www.saltconference.com/saltvegas2013/loeb_daniel.html|publisher=Salt Conference|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as director of corporate development at [[Island Records]], a [[record label]], where he focused on securing debt financing.&lt;ref name=finance&gt;{{cite web|last=La Roche|first=Julia|title=He didn't always work in finance, though.

====Sony====
In May 2013, Loeb proposed splitting [[Sony]]'s entertainment and electronics businesses, arguing that such a split would increase profits.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Charles [http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/14/news/companies/sony-third-point/index.html Hedge fund targets Sony for spin-off] [[CNNMoney.com]], May 14, 2013; retrieved August 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/interactive/investing/dan-loeb-sony "Dan Loeb letter to Sony"], [[CNNMoney.com]]; accessed April 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yasu, Mariko and Naoko Fujimura [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-05-22/sony-directors-discuss-loeb-s-proposal-for-entertainment-ipo-2 "Sony Directors Discuss Loeb's Proposal for Entertainment IPO"], ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', May 22, 2013; retrieved August 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2013, Third Point LLC announced it had increased its stake in Sony to 70 million shares, or about 7 percent, valued at $1.4 billion.&lt;ref name="upsoffer"&gt;[http://www.4-traders.com/SONY-CORPORATION-6492482/news/Third-Point-ups-Sony-stake-calls-for-independent-entertainment-board-17027918 "Third Point ups Sony stake, calls for independent entertainment board"], 4-Traders.com, June 18, 2013; retrieved August 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bloomberg.com]], Sony's board of directors considered Loeb's proposal and hired [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Citigroup, Inc.]] to evaluate it.&lt;ref&gt;Hyuga, Takahiko, Mariko Yasu and Jonathan Browning [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-30/sony-said-to-work-with-morgan-stanley-citigroup-on-loeb-plan.html "Sony Said to Hire Morgan Stanley, Citigroup for Loeb Plan"], [[Bloomberg.com]], May 31, 2013; retrieved August 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[George Clooney]], whose [[Smokehouse Pictures]] production company has a contract with Sony's entertainment division, publicly opposed the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;De La Merced, Michael J.

As of May 2014, Sony remained 12 percent lower than when Loeb first suggested for them to split. Sony had its sixth annual loss in seven years with shares dropping 8.8 percent as of May 2014. In February 2014, Sony said it would sell its PC business to buyout [[Japan industrial Partners Inc.]] and split its TV manufacturing unit into an independently operated entity. Ayano Iguchi, a company spokeswoman, said Sony was "focused on creating shareholder value by executing on our plan to revitalize and grow the electronics business, while further strengthening the entertainment and financial service businesses." Chris Konstantinos, director of international portfolio managements at [[RiverFront]] stated that a breakup was "long overdue."&lt;ref name="sony breakup"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-05-18/sony-taking-loeb-breakup-advice-better-late-than-never-real-m-and-a|title=Sony Taking Loeb Breakup Advice Better Late Than Never: Real M&amp;A|last=Sutherland|first=Brooke|date=19 May 2014|newspaper=BusinessWeek|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Loeb sold his shares in Sony and later wrote, "They have a long way to go and we continue to believe that more urgency will be necessary to definitively turn around the company's fortunes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-activist-investor-dan-loeb-sells-stake-in-sony-corp-20141021-story.html|title=Activist investor Dan Loeb sells stake in Sony Corp.|date=October 21, 2014|publisher=LA Times|last1=Miller|first1=Daniel|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/daniel-loeb-third-point-exit-sony-investment-1201335648|title=Daniel Loeb, Third Point Exit Sony Investment|date=October 21, 2014|publisher=Variety|last1=Lang|first1=Brent|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sotheby's ====
In October 2013, Loeb issued a letter scrutinizing the governance of [[Sotheby's]].&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/823094/000119312513388165/d605390dex993.htm SEC records regarding Loeb, Sotheby's], sec.gov; accessed May 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It announced that [[Third Point]] had acquired "9.3% of the outstanding shares" and addressed Third Point's concerns regarding the governance of Sotheby's. These concerns are summarized as, "we are troubled by the Company's chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's, as evidenced by each of the Contemporary and Modern art evening sales over the last several years."&lt;ref name="sec" /&gt; The letter expressed strong skepticism of Sotheby's international strategy—"Sotheby's is struggling internationally, lagging in newer markets like [[China]] and the Middle East"—and called for the removal of [[William F. Ruprecht|William Ruprecht]] from all his positions.&lt;ref name="sec" /&gt;

After Sotheby's instituted a "[[poison pill]]" to stop Third Point from growing its position past 10%, Third Point [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/823094/000119312514116267/d698590dex995.htm brought a lawsuit] in the state of [[Delaware]]; however, on May 3, 2014, Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons of the Delaware Court of Chancery [https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304655304579548120576221060 ruled] that the auction house was justified in its use of the corporate action. On May 5, Loeb and Sotheby's reached an agreement, stipulating that Loeb, Olivier Reza and Harry J. Wilson join the board in exchange for Third Point having an ownership cap at 15%. William Ruprecht remained CEO and the proxy contest ceased.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/sothebys-and-loeb-end-fight-over-board/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 "Loeb and Sotheby's reach a deal"], dealbook.nytimes.com, May 5, 2014; accessed May 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-05-07/sothebys-and-the-16-million-anti-dan-loeb-proxy-battle Sotheby's and Loeb reach deal], businessweek.com, May 7, 2014; accessed May 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 35 years at Sotheby's, Ruprecht retired as CEO. On March 16, 2015, Sotheby's named Tad Smith as its new president and chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/madison-square-garden-ceo-tad-smith-to-resign-1426503922|title=Sotheby's Picks Sports Executive as New CEO|date=March 16, 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|last1=Crow|first1=Kelly|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tad-smith-new-ceo-of-sothebys-2015-3|title=Tad Smith new CEO of Sotheby's|publisher=Business Insider|last1=La Roche|first1=Julia|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fanuc====
In late 2014, Loeb's Third Point took a stake in [[Fanuc]], a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, and was deemed a top prospect for "shaking up Japanese firms."&lt;ref name="Fanuc"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21653638-prospects-shaking-up-japanese-firms-have-never-looked-so-good-winds-change|title=Winds of Change|date=6 June 2015|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/business/dealbook/samsung-ct-shareholders-back-cheil-industries-merger-defying-activist-hedge-fund-elliott-associates.html?_r=0|title=Samsung Fight Exposes Tension in Asia Over Activist Investors|date=17 July 2015|work=The New York Times|last2=GOUGH|first2=NEIL|last1=SANG-HUN|first1=CHOE|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanuc 3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/third-point-fanuc-taking-important-steps-to-reward-shareholders-1430491992|title=Third Point: Fanuc Taking 'Important Steps' to Reward Shareholders|publisher=Wall Street Journal|last1=Pfanner|first1=Eric|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ligand Pharmaceuticals ====
In January 2007, when John Higgins became CEO of [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]], Loeb bought into the biotech firm to cut its losses and grow revenue. Loeb invested $50 million, increased the company's profit to $250 million, and bought back $68 million in stock.&lt;ref name="Ligand"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2015/07/01/life-after-loeb-ligand-pharmaceuticals-prospers-in-stripped-down-mode/|title=Life After Loeb: Ligand Pharmaceuticals Prospers In Stripped-Down Mode|publisher=Forbes|last1=Fisher|first1=Daniel|website=Forbes|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Seven &amp; I ====
In April 2016, Loeb won a battle in his drive to shake up corporate Japan who had "been sheltered from agitating investors." [[Seven &amp; I Holdings Co.]]'s board was planning to replace Ryuichi Isaka as head of the company however, Loeb recommended Isaka as a successor to [[Toshifumi Suzuki]], chairman and chief executive. On April 7, Suzuki resigned after losing a boardroom dispute with Loeb. Loeb wrote in a March 27, 2016 letter to Seven &amp; I directors, "Mr. Isaka should be rewarded—not demoted—for his performance and commitment to delivering results for shareholders ... This isn't a dynasty.

==== Nestlé ====
In June 2017, Third Point disclosed its ownership of approximately 40 million shares of [[Nestlé]], making it the company's sixth-largest shareholder according to [[standard and poor|Standard &amp; Poor's Global Market Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de la Merced|first=Michael|title=Third Point, a Hedge Fund, Sets Its Activist Sights on Nestlé|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/25/business/dealbook/nestle-third-point-daniel-loeb-activist-investor.html|accessdate=11 January 2018|publisher=[[NYT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investment philosophy ==
''[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]]'' noted that Loeb's "preferred strategy" is to buy into troubled companies, replace inefficient management, and return the companies to profitability, which "is the key to his success."&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;

=== Letters ===
On [[Wall Street]], Loeb has a reputation for "financial savvy" and for "his withering criticism of corporate executives who are unfortunate enough to stumble in his sights".&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt; One of Loeb's signature tactics involves letter-writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Loeb is well known in Hedgeworld for his attacks on what he views as greedy execs who also happen to be depressing shareholder value. Of shares he owns. "The moral-indignation business", Loeb sometimes calls it. "Hedge-fund guys love to read Loeb's attacks; 'he articulates what people feel', says one."&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Often these letters cite the results of investigations he has ordered, detailing management decisions and actions he considers detrimental to shareholder value. The letters usually accompany his government filings.&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt; Loeb once spent more than $4 million to increase his stake in a company to more than 5%, the statutory threshold requiring investor filings with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], in order to file one of his letters criticizing the firm's management.&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt; According to ''New York'' magazine, "Loeb is proud of his letters, which are thorough, well argued, and filled with clever turns of phrase. (He had a batch prepared for his high-school English teacher.)"&lt;ref name=nymag/&gt; A 2005 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' "The Talk of the Town" item described him as "a kind of investor's [[H. L. Mencken]]."&lt;ref name="big deal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Neuman|first=William|title=BIG DEAL; A Town House for a Penthouse|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04EEDD1E30F93BA35752C0A9609C8B63|accessdate=October 31, 2013|work=The New York Times|date=January 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 letter responding to a job inquiry by a U.K. fund manager Loeb bristled at the applicant's reference to his (the applicant's) "place in society", telling the applicant that he would "have plenty of time to discuss your 'place in society' with the other fellows at the club." At Third Point, Loeb explained, "'one's place in society' does not matter at all. We are a bunch of scrappy guys from diverse backgrounds ([[Jewish]], [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]] etc) who enjoy outwitting pompous asses like yourself in financial markets globally."&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite web|last=La Roche|first=Julia|title=In 2004, Loeb sent a letter to InterCept's chairman and CEO John Collins calling them the 'worst' management team.|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/dan-loeb-letters-and-emails-2013-10#16-in-2004-loeb-sent-a-letter-to-intercepts-chairman-and-ceo-john-collins-calling-them-the-worst-management-team-4|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a September 2005 letter to [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]] CEO David Robinson, Loeb  expressed wonder that Ligand's board of directors had not shown Robinson "the door long ago – accompanied by a well worn boot planted in the backside."&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;

Loeb sent a letter to John Collins, chairman and CEO of [[InterCept]], in 2004, accusing InterCept of following "a '[[good ol' boy]]' set of ethics", pointing out that InterCept employed Collins' daughter and son-in-law, the latter of whom Loeb had recently reached by phone on a golf course during working hours. Loeb further noted his discovery that InterCept leased a jet from a partnership controlled by Collins and another board member.&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;

He wrote to Irik Sevin, CEO of [[Star Gas Partners]], in February 2005, calling him "one of the most dangerous and incompetent executives in America" and accusing him of "ineptitude" and of using the firm as his "personal 'honey pot'". He wrote: "I was amused to learn, in the course of our investigation, that at Cornell University there is an 'Irik Sevin Scholarship'. One can only pity the poor student who suffers the indignity of attaching your name to his academic record." Loeb demanded the resignation from the firm's board of Sevin's "elderly 78-year old mom" and insisted that Sevin also "step down ... so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in [[the Hamptons]] where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;

A 2005 ''The New York Times'' article reported that many hedge-fund managers were now writing letters to the SEC demanding executives take specific actions and cited Loeb's letter to Sevin as exemplary of the genre, noting that three weeks after the letter was sent, "Sevin was gone, and a jubilant Mr. Loeb sent out an e-mail message to friends and associates declaring a 'huge victory for Third Point.'"&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Atlas|first=Riva|title=Some Funds Taking Role Far Beyond Just Investor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/16/business/16invest.html?adxnnlx=1124197489-TzwLymvE924SNb1lQwP/CA&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art collection ===
He is a prominent art collector and the walls at his Park Avenue office are covered with paintings", according to a ''The New York Times'' August 26, 2013 article.&lt;ref name="dealbook nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/third-point-hedge-fund-increases-sothebys-stake|title=Third Point Hedge Fund Increases Sotheby's Stake|last=Stevenson|first=Alexandra|date=August 26, 2013|publisher=Dealbook New York Times|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a Sotheby's auction in 2009, Manhattan dealer [[Larry Gagosian]] purchased [[Jeff Koons]]' ''Baroque Egg With Bow (Turquoise/Magenta)'' for $5.4 million from Loeb, who had bought it from the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in 2004 for about $3 million.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/arts/design/13auction.html|title=In 'a Recalibrated Market', Auction Buyers Take Over|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=May 13, 2009|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loeb has traced his love of art to his student years at Columbia, when he saw Poussin's ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women#Nicolas Poussin|The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and took an art humanities class as part of the core curriculum. The "prep school kids" treated him like a "jerk", thinking they "all knew so much more", but in the end "I got one of two A's, and all the prep school snotty kids didn't."&lt;ref name="art collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/who-is-dan-loeb-2013-1#outside-of-his-hedge-fund-loeb-has-an-impressive-art-collection-which-has-actually-proved-to-be-a-good-investment-15|title=Outside of his hedge fund, Loeb has an impressive art collection, which has actually proved to be a good investment.|last=La Roche|first=Julia|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Davi Cheng''' is artist and graphic designer from Hong Kong who combines traditional methods of drawing and painting with advanced digital design techniques.

==Biography==
Davi Cheng was born in Hong Kong into a Christian/Protestant extended family. Her great-grandfather converted to Christianity in 1896 at the First Congregational Church in Territorial Arizona while he was working as a documented laborer. He returned to China in 1902 to spread the Gospel, and Cheng's family remained there until her family immigrated to the United States when she was 14 years old. 

Davi earned a B.A. in Biological Sciences from [[University of California, Berkeley]] with the intention of pursuing a career in the medical field. Instead she gravitated toward art, making detailed sketches and drawings of wildlife. After graduating and working in business for a few years, Cheng went back to school to study computer graphic design. As a visual artist she combines traditional methods of drawing and painting by hand with advanced digital design techniques. She also works as a graphic designer in corporate and nonprofit contexts.

The themes in Cheng's art emerge from her Chinese heritage and her deep engagement with Jewish texts and traditions from a progressive and multicultural perspective. She is a longtime member and past president of [[Beth Chayim Chadashim|Congregation Beth Chayim Chadashim]] (BCC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About BCC|url = http://www.bcc-la.org/about/|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles, and part of the Be'chol Lashon (In Every Tongue)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Be'chol Lashon {{!}} Advocating for the Growth and Diversity of the Jewish People {{!}} Home|url = http://www.bechollashon.org/|website = www.bechollashon.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; international network celebrating Jewish diversity.

Cheng's work is published in ''Women of the Book''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women of the Book: Davi Cheng: Pekudei|url = http://womenofthebook.org/artists/davi-cheng/|website = womenofthebook.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2015), a visual Torah scroll created by 54 Jewish women artists from around the world. Cheng's original interpretation of the Torah portion parshat [[Pekudei]], a pen and ink painting on parchment, was inspired by her Hong Kong childhood superheroes and by images of clouds in ''[[Journey to the West]]'', one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature.

Another painting, "Burning Bush I," was published on the cover of ''Asian Jewish Life''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art Work by BCC Member Davi Cheng on the cover of Asian Jewish Life magazine {{!}} BCC People|url = http://bcc-la.org/people/art-work-by-bcc-member-davi-cheng-on-the-cover-of-asian-jewish-life-magazine/|website = bcc-la.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine (June 2015, issue 16); on ''The Jewniverse'', "Chinese Art with a Jewish Twist (Or, Jewish Art with a Chinese Twist)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese Art With a Jewish Twist (Or, Jewish Art With a Chinese Twist) {{!}} Jewniverse|url = http://thejewniverse.com/2015/chinese-art-with-a-jewish-twist-or-jewish-art-with-a-chinese-twist/|website = thejewniverse.com|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ilana Sichel (June 8, 2015); and on ''My Jewish Learning'', "Seamlessly Chinese and Jewish"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seamlessly Chinese and Jewish|url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/jewish-and/seamlessly-chinese-and-jewish/|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Davi Cheng (June 1, 2015).

Cheng designed BCC synagogue's permanent stained glass window installation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BCC's new home|url = http://www.bcc-la.org/about/new-home/|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the centerpiece of which refers to the biblical story of the [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]]. Along with three other artists, she also fabricated and installed all twelve panes (measuring 30" x 40" each). She has created other art works for the sanctuary, collaborating with Jerry Hanson on a set of stained glass Ark doors and a solar-powered ''Ner Tamid'' ("eternal light") made with more than a thousand one-inch glass squares.

==Personal life==
Cheng plays trumpet and French horn and co-founded and performs in Beth Chayim Chadashim's Klezmer band, Gay Gezunt, and also sings in the synagogue's choir. She lives with her spouse Bracha Yael Cheng in Los Angeles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17512">[[File:Sodano.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Angelo Sodano]], the current Dean of the College of Cardinals.]]
The '''Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals''' ({{lang-la|Decanus Sacri Collegii}}) is the [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] (president) of the [[College of Cardinals]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The position was established in the early [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]].

The Dean presides over the College of Cardinals, serving as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' in the college.  He always holds the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal Bishop]]. The Dean of the College of Cardinals is assisted by the [[Cardinal Vice-Dean|Vice-Dean]]; in those roles they act as the president and vice-president of the college respectively. Both are elected by and from the Cardinal Bishops who are not Eastern Catholic patriarchs and subject to [[papal]] confirmation. Except for presiding, the Dean and Vice-Dean have no power over the other cardinals. In the [[order of precedence in the Catholic Church]] as the senior Cardinal Bishops, the Dean and Vice-Dean are placed second and third respectively after the [[pope]]. 

The Dean is often, but not necessarily, the longest-serving member of the whole College.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} It had been customary for centuries for the longest-serving of the six cardinal bishops of [[Suburbicarian diocese|suburbicarian sees]] to be Dean. This was required by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] from 1917 until 1965, when [[Pope Paul VI]] empowered the six to elect the Dean from among their number. This election was a formality until the time of [[Pope John Paul II]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The Dean holds the position until death or resignation; there is no mandatory age of retirement.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Responsibilities==
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
It is the Dean's responsibility to summon the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] for the purposes of electing a new [[pope]] following a death or [[papal resignation|resignation]].  The Dean presides over the conclave unless he is too old to vote in it. Additionally, the dean has the responsibility of communicating the "news of the Pope's death to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See and to the Heads of the respective Nations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html |title=Universi Dominici Gregis, art. 19 |author=[[Pope John Paul II]] |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=2007-10-08 |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506074146/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html |archivedate=2007-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the public face of the Holy See during the [[sede vacante]] period. It is the Dean, unless he is impeded, who asks the Pope-elect if he accepts the election, and then asks the new Pope what name he wishes to use. According to Canon 355 (from the Latin [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]] 1983), if the newly elected [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]] is not already a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], it has always been the right of the Bishop of Ostia to [[Holy Orders|ordain]] him.

The Cardinal Dean has "the [[titular bishop|title]] of the [[Bishop of Ostia|diocese of Ostia]], together with that of any other church to which he already has a title,"&lt;ref&gt;Canon 350, section 4&lt;/ref&gt; such as his [[suburbicarian diocese]]. This has been the case since 1914, by decree of [[Pope Pius X]]—previous deans had given up their prior suburbicarian see for the joint title of Ostia and Velletri, which were separated in that same 1914 decree.

==Deans elected Pope==
Nine Deans have been elected Pope:&lt;ref&gt;For the first half of 12th century the source is Rudolf Hüls, ''Kardinäle, Klerus und Kirchen Roms: 1049–1130'', Tübingen 1977, p. 84, for the rest the respective [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/consistories.htm biographical entries] by S. Miranda, with corrections appearing from J.M. Brixius, ''Die Mitglieder des Kardinalkollegiums von 1130–1181'', Berlin 1912; Werner Maleczek, ''Papst und Kardinalskolleg von 1191 bis 1216'', Vienna 1984; [[Agostino Paravicini Bagliani]], ''Cardinali di curia e "familiae" cardinalizie dal 1227 al 1254'', Padova 1972; and Richard Sternfeld, ''Der Kardinal Johann Gaetan Orsini (Papst Nikolaus III.) 1244–1277'', Berlin 1905, for 12–13th centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Anastasius IV|Anastasius IV]], [[Pope Lucius III|Lucius III]], [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]], [[Pope Alexander IV|Alexander IV]], [[Pope John XXI|John XXI]], [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]], [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]], [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]].

==List of Deans==
{{refimprove|list|date=September 2014}}
The following is the list of Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, separated into three groups to account for the [[Western Schism]], which  ended after the [[Council of Constance]]. The earliest attested reference to the "College of Cardinals" is at the Council of Reims in 1148.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Broderick, S.J., "The Sacred College of Cardinals: Size and Geographical Composition (1099–1986)," ''Archivum Historiae Pontificiae'', Vol. 25 (1987), pp. 7-71, at p. 9 note 6. And see: Edith Pasztor, "Riforma della chiesa nel secolo XI e l'origine del Collegio dei Cardinali: Problemi e ricerche," in: ''Studio sul Medioevo cristiano offerti a Raffaello Morghen'', II, (Roma 1974), pp. 609-625, arguing that the College of Cardinals did not yet exist at the end of the 11th century. Without the existence of the College, of course, a Dean of the College of Cardinals would be impossible.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each name in the following list includes years of birth and death, then comma-separated years of cardinalate and deanship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18028">Former [[Iran]]ian president [[Mohammad Khatami]] introduced the idea of '''Dialogue Among Civilizations''' as a response to [[Samuel P. Huntington]]’s theory of a [[Clash of Civilizations]]. The term was initially used by Austrian philosopher [[Hans Köchler]] who in 1972, in a [http://www.i-p-o.org/Koechler-letter-UNESCO-26Sep1972.jpg letter] to [[UNESCO]],
had suggested the idea of an international conference on the "dialogue between different civilizations" (''dialogue entre les différentes civilisations'')&lt;ref&gt;Letter, dated 26 September 1972, to Ms. Marie-Pierre Herzog, Director of the Division of Philosophy, UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subsequently, on 19 October 1972, Hans Köchler delivered a programmatic lecture at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, on "Cultural Self-comprehension and Co-existence: Preconditions for a Fundamental Dialogue". The text was first published in German: "Kulturelles Selbstverständnis und Koexistenz: Voraussetzungen für einen fundamentalen Dialog,"  in: "Kulturelles Selbstverständnis und Koexistenz: Voraussetzungen für einen fundamentalen Dialog," in: Philosophie und Politik. (Veröffentlichungen der Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik an der Universität Innsbruck, Vol. IV.) Innsbruck: AWP, 1973, pp. 75-78.&lt;/ref&gt; and had organized, in 1974, a first international conference on the role of intercultural dialogue ([http://www.i-p-o.org/iccsn.htm "The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations"]) with the support and under the auspices of Senegalese President [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]].&lt;ref&gt;International Conference "The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations," organized by the International Progress Organization, Innsbruck, Austria, 27–29 July 1974. For details, see the conference proceedings: Hans Köchler (ed.),  Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations. (Studies in International [Cultural] Relations, Vol. 1.) Tübingen/Basel: Erdmann, 1978. {{ISBN|3-7711-0311-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed chronology see 
[http://hanskoechler.com/dialogue_civilizations.htm "Global Debate: Dialogue of Civilizations"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the first places for where Dialogue Among Civilizations took place was in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]] at the Safa Khaneh Community that was established in 1902.
Safa Khaneh was a place that [[Haj Aqa Nourollah]] and his older brother made. It was a place were Muslims and Christians talked about their religions with each other. It was one of the first interfaith centers in the world. Later a magazine was published based on the dialogues between Muslims and Christians in the Safa Khaneh and it was released in Iran, India and England. The founder of Safa Khaneh, Haj Aqa Nouroollah was one of the leaders of the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitution Era]] in Iran. His house has become a museum named [[Constitution house of Isfahan]].

==Introduction==

The page dedicated to the United Nations Year of Dialog Among Civilizations introduces the idea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Dialogue/background.html |title=Background |publisher=UN |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|What is '''diversity'''? What can people do to open the lines of communication and redefine the meaning of diversity? How can we better understand diversity? What is the overall perception of diversity? These were the questions the General Assembly grappled with in 1998, when the year 2001 was announced as the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations.

What does a dialogue among civilizations mean? One could argue that in the world there are two groups of civilizations – one which perceives diversity as a threat and the other which sees it as an opportunity and an integral component for growth. The Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations was established to redefine diversity and to improve dialogue between these two groups. Hence, the goal of the Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations is to nurture a dialogue which is both preventive of conflicts – when possible – and inclusive in nature.

To do this, Governments, the United Nations system and other relevant international and non-governmental organizations were invited by the United Nations General Assembly to plan and implement cultural, educational and social programmes to promote the concept of the dialogue among civilizations.}}

==The Vision==

Here are some excerpts from the vision of the Foundation for Dialogue among Civilizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dialoguefoundation.org/?Lang=en&amp;Page=28 |title=Welcome To FDC Website - Home Page |language=fa |publisher=Dialogue Foundation |accessdate=11 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031133501/http://dialoguefoundation.org/?Lang=en&amp;Page=28 |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... The act of dialogue among cultures and civilizations faces multiple theoretical and practical questions. Fundamental questions regarding civilization and culture, and the intellectual and scientific preoccupations in this regard should not be underestimated. I would like, however, to emphasize that the main objective for this initiative of dialogue among cultures and civilizations is in fact to initiate a new paradigm in international relations and those among human beings in our contemporary world. This necessity will be clearer when we compare it with the other paradigms which currently form the basis of international relations. It is through a fundamental and structural critique of these paradigms that the raison d’être for this new paradigm is identified.

We cannot invite people and governments to the paradigm of dialogue of cultures and civilizations without learning lessons from history, without thoroughly investigating the reasons behind major world disasters in the twentieth century and their continuation in the current one, and without passing judgment on the existing dominant paradigm which is based on a dialogue of power and glorification of might.

Dialogue among civilizations, viewed from an ethical perspective, is in fact an invitation to discard what might be termed the power oriented will, in favour of a love oriented one. In this case, the result of dialogue will be empathy and compassion. And the interlocutors will primarily be thinkers, leaders, artists and all benevolent intellectuals who are the true representatives of their respective cultures and civilizations.

Relying on shared principles, objectives, and threats in order to find shared solutions is a major step towards changing the existing situation and isolating the extremists who, by sanctifying violence and force, have spoilt the world for all its inhabitants regardless of their culture or civilization. ...}}

==The Mission==

Here are some excerpts from the mission of the Foundation for Dialogue among Civilizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dialoguefoundation.org/?Lang=en&amp;Page=29 |title=Welcome To FDC Website - Our Mission |language=fa |publisher=Dialogue Foundation |accessdate=11 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031133506/http://dialoguefoundation.org/?Lang=en&amp;Page=29 |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... The foundation aims to build upon the successes of the United Nations year and further implement the recommendations of the relevant UN resolutions.

... The Foundation believes that dialogue among civilisations is conducive to mutual understanding, tolerance, peaceful coexistence and international cooperation and security.

Strategic objectives of the Foundation for Dialogue Among Civilisations include:

# promoting and facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts and/disputes
# reconciling tensions between cultures, countries and religions
# promoting and facilitating the much needed dialogue between Muslim societies and other societies around the world
# contributing to academic research and enriching the wider debate around peace in the world

'''Activities'''

The Foundation for Dialogue Among Civilisations will fulfill its objectives through:

# the organization of diverse cultural, artistic, and scientific events including debates, fora, symposia and seminars designed to encourage exchange between cultures and civilisations in the spirit of the Foundation

== Contrasting view: ''The Clash of Civilizations'' ==
{{Main|Clash of Civilizations}}

In 1993, Huntington provoked great debate among [[international relations]] theorists with the interrogatively-titled "The Clash of Civilizations?", a controversial, oft-cited article published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine. Its description of post–Cold War [[geopolitics]] contrasted with the controversial [[The End of History and the Last Man|End of History]] thesis advocated by [[Francis Fukuyama]].

Huntington expanded "The Clash of Civilizations?" to book length and published it as ''[[The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order]]'' in 1996. The article and the book posit that post–Cold War conflict would most frequently and violently occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences. That, whilst in the Cold War, conflict likely occurred between the Capitalist West and the Communist Bloc East, it now was most likely to occur between the world's major civilizations — identifying seven, and a possible eighth: (i) Western, (ii) Latin American, (iii) Islamic, (iv) Sinic (Chinese), (v) Hindu, (vi) Orthodox, (vii) Japanese, and (viii) the African. This cultural organization contrasts the contemporary world with the classical notion of sovereign states. To understand current and future conflict, cultural rifts must be understood, and culture — rather than the State — mern(?) nations will lose predominance if they fail to recognize the irreconcilable nature of cultural tensions.

* ''In Eurasia the great historic fault lines between civilizations are once more aflame. This is particularly true along the boundaries of the crescent-shaped Islamic bloc of nations, from the bulge of Africa to central Asia. Violence also occurs between Muslims, on the one hand, and Orthodox Serbs in the Balkans, Jews in Israel, Hindus in India, Buddhists in Burma and Catholics in the Philippines. Islam has bloody borders.'' —— "The Clash of Civilizations?", original 1993 "Foreign Affairs" magazine article

Critics (see ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' articles) call ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'' the theoretical legitimization of American-led Western aggression against China and the world's Islamic cultures. Nevertheless, this post–Cold War shift in geopolitical organization and structure requires that the West internally strengthens itself culturally, by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic universalism and its incessant military interventionism. Other critics argue that Huntington's taxonomy is simplistic and arbitrary, and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations. Huntington's influence upon U.S. policy has been likened to that of British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee|A.J. Toynbee]]'s controversial religious theories about Asian leaders in the early twentieth century.

Personal Representative of the Secretary-General for the UN Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations, has said:

* ''History does not kill. Religion does not rape women, the purity of blood does not destroy buildings and institutions do not fail. Only individuals do those things.''

Mr. Picco was appointed the Personal Representative to the Secretary-General for the United Nations Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations in 1999 in order to facilitate discussions on diversity, through organizing conferences, seminars and disseminating information and scholarly materials. Having served the United Nations for two decades, Mr. Picco is most recognized for participating in UN efforts to negotiate the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and in bringing an end to the Iran-Iraq war. He believes that people should take responsibility for who they are, what they do, what they value, and what they believe in.

{{History of Sri Lanka}}
The '''''Dipavamsa''''' or '''''Deepavamsa''''' (i.e., "Chronicle of the Island"; in [[Pali]]: ''Dīpavaṃsa''), is the oldest historical record of [[Sri Lanka]]. The chronicle is believed to be compiled from [[Atthakatha]] and other sources around the 3-4th century. Together with the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', it is the source of many accounts of ancient history of Sri Lanka and India. Its importance resides not only as a source of history and legend, but also as  an important early work in [[Buddhist]] and Pali literature.

==Contents==
It is probably authored by several Buddhist monks or nuns of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]] in the 3rd-4th century. The ''Dipavamsa'' was likely the first completely new Pali text composed in Sri Lanka; it was also among the last texts to be composed anonymously.&lt;ref name=Hinuber&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalasekera/&gt;

The preamble begins with "Listen! I shall relate the chronicle of the Buddha's visits to the island, the arrival of the [[relic of the tooth of the Buddha|Tooth Relic]] and the [[Bodhi Tree|Bodhi tree]], the advent of the Buddha's doctrine, the rise of the teachers, the spread of Buddhism in the island and the coming of [[Prince Vijaya|Vijaya]] the Chief of Men".&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~hettiarachchi/dipa.html Differences between the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura]] (5th century) had ordered the ''Dipavamsa'' be recited at the [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] festival held annually in [[Anuradhapura]].

The Dipavamsa refers to three visits to the Island by the Buddha, the places being [[Kelaniya]], [[Deegavapi Raja Maha Viharaya]], the place where the Bo-sapling was later planted within the Maha Mewna-uyana (Park) of Anuradhapura. It does not make any mention of the Buddha visiting [[Adam's Peak]].

==Depiction of Buddhist sects==
Starting with the ''Dīpavaṃsa'' in the 4th century, the Theravādins of the Mahāvihāra in Sri Lanka attempted to identify themselves with the original [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthavira sect]] of [[India]]. The ''Dīpavaṃsa'' lauds the Theravāda as a "great [[banyan tree]]," and dismissively portrays the other [[early Buddhist schools]] as thorns (''kaṇṭaka'').&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Diane. ''Essential Buddhism: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice.'' 2010. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

:These 17 sects are schismatic,
:only one is non-schismatic.
:With the non-schismatic sect,
:there are eighteen in all.
:Like a great banyan tree,
:the Theravāda is supreme,
:The Dispensation of the Conqueror,
:complete, without lack or excess.
:The other sects arose
:like thorns on the tree.
:— ''Dīpavaṃsa'', 4.90–91&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Sujato. ''Sects &amp; Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' Santi Forest Monastery, 2006. p. i&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the ''Mahavamsa''==
Regarding the Vijaya legend, Dipavamsa has tried to be less super-natural than the later work, [[Mahavamsa]] in referring to the husband of the Kalinga-Vanga princess, ancestor of Vijya, as a man named Sinha who was an outlaw that attacked caravans en route. In the meantime, Sinha-bahu and Sinhasivali, as king and queen of the kingdom of Lala (Lata), "gave birth to twin sons, sixteen times." The eldest was Vijaya and the second was Sumitta. As Vijaya was of cruel and unseemly conduct, the enraged people requested the king to kill his son. But the king caused him and his seven hundred followers to leave the kingdom, and they landed in Sri Lanka, at a place called Tamba-panni, on the exact day when the Buddha passed into Maha Parinibbana.

The Dipavamsa gives a fuller account of the arrival of Theri [[Sangamitta]] (daughter to Asoka), but the epic story of [[Dutugamunu]] is treated only briefly, in ten Pali stanzas, while the Mahavamsa devoted ten chapters to it. Due to the greater attention given to the nuns of Sri Lanka in the Dipavamsa, as well as the description of Sangamitta as being particularly proficient at history, [[Hugh Nevill]] suggested that the Dipavamsa might have originated with the nuns community at one or more of the Viharas, rather than being composed by monks.&lt;ref name=Malalasekera&gt;{{cite book

The Dipavamsa is considered "source material" to the Mahavamsa. The latter is more coherently organized, and is probably the greatest religious and historical epic in the [[Pali]] language. The historiography (i.e., the chronology of kings, battles etc.) given in the Mahavamsa, and to that extent in the Dipavasma, are believed to be largely correct from about the time of the death of [[Asoka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lakdiva.org/mahavamsa] See Geiger's defence of the historicity of the Mahavamsa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. M. de Silva, ''History of Sri Lanka'' (Penguin) 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernesto Cardenal Martínez''' (born 20 January 1925) is a [[Nicaraguan]] former [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[priest]], poet, and politician. He is a [[liberation theology|liberation theologian]] and the founder of the [[primitivism (art)|primitivist]] art community in the [[Solentiname Islands]], where he lived for more than ten years (1965–1977). A member of the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Sandinista]]s, a party he has since left, he was Nicaragua's minister of culture from 1979 to 1987.

==Early life==
Cardenal was born into an upper-class family in [[Granada, Nicaragua]]. A first cousin of the poet [[Pablo Antonio Cuadra]], Cardenal studied literature in [[Managua]] and then from 1942 to 1946 in [[Mexico]] and from 1947 to 1949 in [[New York City]]. In 1949 and 1950, he traveled through [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]].

In July 1950, he returned to Nicaragua, where he participated in the 1954 April Revolution against [[Anastasio Somoza García]]'s regime. The coup d'état failed and ended with the deaths of many of his associates. Cardenal subsequently entered the [[Trappist]] [[The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani|Monastery of Gethsemani]] ([[Kentucky]], [[United States]]), joining another poet-priest, [[Thomas Merton]], but in 1959, he left to study [[theology]] in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]].

==Priesthood==
Cardenal was ordained a Catholic priest in 1965 in Granada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbstone.org/authdetail.cfm?AuthID=39|title=curbstone.org|website=www.curbstone.org|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to the [[Solentiname Islands]], where he founded a Christian, almost-monastic, mainly-peasant community, which eventually led to the founding of the artists' colony. The colony engaged with painting as well as sculpture and was visited many times by artists and writers of the region such as [[Willarson Brandt]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Asilia Guillén]], and [[Aedes Margarita]]. It was there that the famous book ''[[The Gospel of Solentiname|El Evangelio en Solentiname]]'' (''The Gospel of Solentiname'') was written. Cardenal collaborated closely with the [[leftist]] [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional]] (Sandinista National Liberation Front, or FSLN) in working to overthrow [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]'s regime.

==Nicaraguan Revolution==
Many members of the Solentiname community engaged in the revolutionary process through guerrilla warfare that the FSLN had developed to strike at the regime. The year 1977 was crucial to Cardenal's community, when Somoza's [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]], as a result from an attack to the headquarters stationed in the city of [[San Carlos, Río San Juan|San Carlos]] a few miles from the community, raided Solentiname and burned it to the ground. Cardenal fled to [[Costa Rica]].

[[File:ErnestoCardenal2001.jpg|thumb|Cardenal in [[Managua]] in 2001]]
On 19 July 1979, immediately after the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Liberation of Managua]], he was named Minister of Culture by the new Sandinista regime. He campaigned for a "revolution without vengeance."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;gs_rn=1&amp;gs_ri=hp&amp;cp=39&amp;gs_id=1s&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=Ernesto+Cardenal+80+Berliner+Morgenpost&amp;es_nrs=true&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;tbo=d&amp;oq=Ernesto+Cardenal+80+Berliner+Morgenpost&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;bvm=bv.41248874,d.d2k&amp;fp=e58b2ac11e131ec1&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=939 "Revolution ohne Rache" in: Ernesto Cardenal 80].'' In: ''[[Berliner Morgenpost]]'', 10 June 2008. Retrieved, 23 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother [[Fernando Cardenal]], also a Catholic priest (in the [[Jesuit order]]), was appointed Minister of Education. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Nicaragua in 1983, he openly scolded Ernesto Cardenal, who knelt before him on the Managua airport runway, for resisting his order to resign from the government, and admonished him: "Usted tiene que arreglar sus asuntos con la Iglesia" ("You must fix your affairs with the Church"). On 4 February 1984 Pope John Paul II defrocked Cardenal because of Cardenal's refusal to leave his political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/462|title=Revista Envío - Dos modelos de Iglesia (agosto 84 - julio 85)|website=www.envio.org.ni|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardenal remained Minister of Culture until 1987, when his ministry was closed for economic reasons.

==Later career==
Cardenal left the FSLN in 1994, protesting the [[authoritarian]] direction of the party under [[Daniel Ortega]] but insists that he has retained his [[leftist]] opinions, calling it a "robbery of the people and dictatorship not a revolutionary movement" when he left the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ernesto-cardenal-poet-and-catholic-priest-still-causes-controversy-at-age-86/2011/05/26/AGSok0EH_story.html|title=Ernesto Cardenal, poet and Catholic priest, still causes controversy at age 86|last={{!}}|first=Manuel Roig-Franzia|date=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a member of the [[Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista]] (Sandinista Renovation Movement, MRS) that participated in the 2006 Nicaraguan general election. Days before the election, Cardenal stated, in a clear reference to his dispute with Ortega: "I think more desirable an authentic capitalism, as Montealegre's ([[Eduardo Montealegre]], the presidential candidate for [[Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance]]) would be, than a false Revolution."&lt;ref&gt;''La Prensa'', 2 November 2006. Managua's Daily Newspaper ''(in Spanish)'' {{cite web |url=http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2006/noviembre/02/noticias/ultimahora/153819.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205080449/http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2006/noviembre/02/noticias/ultimahora/153819.shtml |archivedate=5 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also a member of the board of advisers of the pan-[[Latin America]]n TV station [[teleSUR]].

Cardenal has been for a long time a polemical figure in Nicaragua's literary and cultural history. He has been described as "the most important poet right now in Latin America"&lt;ref&gt;''La Prensa'' 26 August 2007, ''(in Spanish)'' http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2007/agosto/26/noticias/enfoque/.&lt;/ref&gt; politically and poetically. He has been a vocal representative for Nicaragua and a key to understanding the contemporary literary and cultural life of Nicaragua. He participated in the [[Stock Exchange of Visions]] project in 2007. During a short visit to [[India]], he made a profound impression on a group of writers called the [[Hungry generation]].

Cardenal's tour of the United States in 2011 to promote his newest work stirred up some controversy, as with the [[American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property]] that protested his appearances at Catholic universities such as [[Xavier University|Xavier, Cincinnati,]] because of his Marxist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ernesto-cardenal-poet-and-catholic-priest-still-causes-controversy-at-age-86/2011/05/26/AGSok0EH_story.html|title=Ernesto Cardenal, poet and Catholic priest, still causes controversy at age 86|last={{!}}|first=Manuel Roig-Franzia|date=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==
Earlier works were focused on life and love; however, some works like "Zero Hour" had a direct correlation to his Marxist political ideas, being tied to the assassination of guerrilla leader [[Augusto César Sandino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/ernesto-cardenal|title=Ernesto Cardenal|date=20 November 2016|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|access-date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardenal's poetry also was heavily influenced by his unique Catholic ideology, mainly liberation theology. Some of his latest works are heavily influenced by his understanding of science and evolution, though it is still in dialogue with his earlier Marxist and Catholic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ernesto-cardenal-poet-and-catholic-priest-still-causes-controversy-at-age-86/2011/05/26/AGSok0EH_story.html|title=Ernesto Cardenal, poet and Catholic priest, still causes controversy at age 86|last={{!}}|first=Manuel Roig-Franzia|date=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cardenal sums up his later material in a [[PBS NewsHour]] interview:
{{quote|In the first place, one matures, and can write about things one couldn't before. One couldn't get poetry out of this theme or this situation. And later, you can do it because you have more technical ability to do it. Now I can do easily things that were impossible for me to do when I was younger. That also happens to painters, I guess, and to all artists and creators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7852">[[File:Frigg by Doepler.jpg|thumb|"Frigg and Her Servants" (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Fensalir''' ([[Old Norse]] "[[Fen]] Halls"&lt;ref name=ORCHARD43&gt;Orchard (1997:43).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a location where the goddess [[Frigg]] dwells. Fensalir is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the location, including that the location may have some connection to religious practices involving [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], [[bog]]s, or [[swamp]]s in [[Norse paganism]], and that it may be connected to the goddess [[Sága and Sökkvabekkr|Sága]]'s watery location [[Sága and Sökkvabekkr|Sökkvabekkr]].

==Attestations==
[[File:Northern Jutlandic Bog IV.JPG|thumb|A bog in northern [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]].]]
In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Völuspá]]'', Frigg is described as weeping over her son [[Baldr]]'s death in Fensalir. This stanza is absent in the ''[[Hauksbók]]'' manuscript of the poem.&lt;ref name=LINDOW114&gt;Lindow (2001:114).&lt;/ref&gt; The portion of the stanza mentioning Fensalir foretells that vengeance will come for the death of Baldr and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:while Frigg wept
:in Fen Halls
:for [[Valhalla|Valhǫll's]] woe.&lt;ref name=DRONKE16&gt;Dronke (1997:16).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In chapter 35 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (described as king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that Frigg is the highest among the [[Áss|ásynjur]] or Aesir, and that "she has a dwelling called Fensalir and it is very splendid."&lt;ref name=FAULKES29&gt;Faulkes (1995:29).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 49, High says that when [[Loki]] witnessed that Baldr had gained invincibility due to the oath all things took not to harm him, Loki went to Fensalir appearing as a woman. In his disguise, Loki there asked Frigg why Baldr was not harmed by the objects. Frigg revealed that it is due to the oath they have taken. The disguised Loki asks if nothing can hurt Baldr, and Frigg reveals that only [[mistletoe]] can, for it seemed to her too young to demand an oath from. After this, Loki immediately disappears, and subsequently engineers the death of Baldr with a mistletoe projectile.&lt;ref name=FAULKES48&gt;Faulkes (1995:48).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', Fensalir receives a third and final mention. In chapter 19, ways to refer to Frigg are provided, including that Frigg may be referred to as "queen of [[Áss|Æsir]] and Asyniur, of [[Fulla]] and [[falcon]] form and Fensalir."&lt;ref name=FAULKES86&gt;Faulkes (1995:86).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
In 1882, the German scholar Anton Edzardi proposed that Fensalir may point to religious practices involving [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]].&lt;ref name=EDZARDI-LINDOW&gt;Edzardi (1882:330–339) referenced in Lindow (2001:115).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lindow]] comments that "I have no idea why Frigg should live in a [[bog]]gy place, despite the old argument that there is an association with a cult situated at a spring."&lt;ref name=LINDOW114/&gt; [[Rudolf Simek]] comments that Edzardi's theory "must remain unanswered."&lt;ref name=SIMEK81&gt;Simek (2007:81).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Edzardi theorized a connection between Fensalir and a belief in folklore that particular swamps act as an entrance to the realm of [[Holda]], whom he connects with Frigg.&lt;ref name=GILDERSLEEVE105&gt;Gildersleeve (1883:105).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 19th-century work, [[Paul Henri Mallet]] and Walter Scott write that the "fen" element of ''Fensalir'' "may also be made to sig[nify] the watery deep, or the [[sea]]."&lt;ref name=MALLETSCOTT550&gt;Mallet, Scott (1847:550).&lt;/ref&gt; This [[etymology]] has resulted in theories that the name ''Fensalir'' may mean "Sea Halls" rather than "Fen Halls." In his 19th-century translation of the ''Poetic Edda'', [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] comments that "some scholars have regarded [Frigg] as a solar myth, calling her the [[solar deity|sun-goddess]], and pointing out that her home in ''Fensalir'' ("the sea-halls") symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon."&lt;ref name=BELLOWS15&gt;Bellows (2004:15).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lindow]] says that due to similarity between the goddess [[Sága and Sökkvabekkr|Sága]]'s [[Sága and Sökkvabekkr|Sökkvabekkr]] and Fensalir, the open drinking between Sága and Odin, and the potential etymological basis for Sága being a seeress "have led most scholars to understand Sága as another name for Frigg."&lt;ref name=LINDOW265&gt;Lindow (2001:265).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stephan Grundy]] states that ''Sága'' and ''Sökkvabekkr'' may be by-forms of ''Frigg'' and ''Fensalir'' used for the purpose of composing [[alliterative verse]].&lt;ref name=GRUNDY62&gt;Grundy (1999:62).&lt;/ref&gt;

Britt-Mari Näsström theorizes that "Frigg's role as a fertility goddess is revealed in the name of her abode, Fensalir [...]", that Frigg is the same as Sága, and that both the names ''Fensalir'' and ''Sökkvabekkr'' "imply a goddes {{sic}} living in the water and recall the fertility goddess [[Nerthus]]."&lt;ref name="NÄSSTRÖM88"&gt;Näsström (1996:88).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington) Gabriel.jpg|thumb|''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'' of Gabriel by [[Jan van Eyck]], 1434.]]

'''Gabriel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|eɪ|b|r|i|ə|l}}; {{lang-he|גַּבְרִיאֵל |lit = Gavri'el "God is my strength"}}, {{lang-grc|Ⲅαβριήλ |lit = Gabriel}}, {{lang-cop|ⲅⲁⲃⲣⲓⲏⲗ}}, {{lang-arc|ܓܒܪܝܝܠ}}), in the [[Abrahamic religions]], is an [[archangel]]. It was first described in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and subsequently developed by other traditions.

In the Hebrew Bible, Gabriel appears to the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], to explain his visions ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 8:15–26, 9:21–27). Gabriel the [[archangel]] is also a character in other ancient Jewish writings such as the [[Book of Enoch]].  Alongside archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], Gabriel is described as the [[guardian angel]] of Israel, defending this people against the angels of the other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews]] [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol1/one.htm#1 Vol I : The Creation of The World - The First Things Created]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Christian [[New Testament]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]], the angel Gabriel appears to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], foretelling the births of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]], respectively ([[Gabriel#New Testament|Luke 1:11–38]]). In many Christian traditions including Anglican, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic, Gabriel is also referred to as a [[saint]].&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;{{cite web|last=Zimmerman|first=Julie|title=Friar Jack's Catechism Quiz: Test Your Knowledge on Angels|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/e-News/FriarJack/fj082102.asp|publisher=AmericanCatholic.org|accessdate=16 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521190231/http://www.americancatholic.org/e-News/FriarJack/fj082102.asp|archivedate=21 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Book of Common Prayer]] 1662, Calendar (29 September) "S. Michael and all Angels", page xxix; or propers, page 227, "Saint Michael and All Angels".&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], Gabriel is an [[archangel]] whom God sent with [[revelation]] to various prophets, including [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Maulana Muhammad |last2=Gallegos |first2=Christopher |title=The Religion of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etnEKz_rOfgC&amp;pg=PT69#v=onepage&amp;q=%22transmission%20of%20the%20practices%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=1936 |publisher=eBookIt.com |location=[[Lahore]] |isbn=9781934271186 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 5 verses of the 96th chapter of the [[Quran]], the [[Al-Alaq|Clot]], is believed by Muslims to have been the first verses revealed by Gabriel to Muhammad.

In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the angel Gabriel is the same individual as the prophet Noah in his mortal ministry.

In [[Yazidis#Religious beliefs|Yazidism]], Gabriel is one of the Seven Mysteries, the Heptad to which God entrusted the world and sometimes identified with [[Melek Taus]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeitschrift für Religionswissenschaft5. Jahrgang 1997 diagonal-Verlag Ursula Spuler-Stegemann ''Der Engel Pfau zum Selbstvertändnis der Yezidi''  p. 14 (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Jewish [[rabbi]]s interpreted the "man in linen" as Gabriel in the [[Book of Daniel]] and the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. In the Book of Daniel, Gabriel is responsible for interpreting Daniel's visions. Gabriel's main function in Daniel is that of revealer, a role he continues in later literature. In the Book of Ezekiel, Gabriel is understood to be the angel that was sent to destroy [[Jerusalem]]. According to the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', Gabriel takes the form of a man, and stands at the left hand of God.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{cite book|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6450-gabriel |title=Gabriel |work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|date= 1906|accessdate=December 2, 2016 |volume=5 |pages=540–543}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shimon ben Lakish]] ([[Syria Palaestina]], 3rd century) concluded that the angelic names of Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel came out of the Babylonian exile (Gen. Rab. 48:9).&lt;ref name=everson/&gt; Alongside archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], Gabriel is described as the [[Patron|guardian angel]] of Israel, defending this people against the angels of the other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews]] [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol1/one.htm#1 Vol I : The Creation of The World - The First Things Created]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kabbalah]], Gabriel is identified with the [[sephirot]] of [[Yesod]]. Gabriel also has a prominent role as one of God's archangels in the Kabbalah literature. There, Gabriel is portrayed as working in concert with Michael as part of God's court. Gabriel is not to be prayed to because only God can answer prayers and sends Gabriel as his agent.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

According to [[Jewish mythology]], in the [[Garden of Eden]] there is a [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] or the "tree of souls"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;pg=PA153#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Tree%20of%20Souls%22&amp;f=false |title=Origins of the Kabbalah |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01|isbn=0691020477 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that blossoms and produces new [[souls]], which fall into the [[Guf]], the ''Treasury of Souls''. Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then [[Lailah]], the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030044612/http://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archivedate=2012-10-30 |title=200_ THE TREASURY OF SOULS for Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism |work=Scribd. |deadurl=yes |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertestamental literature==
The [[intertestamental period]] (roughly 200 BC – 50 AD) produced a wealth of [[Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible|literature]], much of it having an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] orientation. The names and ranks of angels and devils were greatly expanded, and each had particular duties and status before God.

In [[s:Book of Enoch/Chapter 09|1 Enoch 9:1–3]], Gabriel, along with [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Uriel (angel)|Uriel]] and [[Suriel]], "saw much blood being shed upon the earth" (9:1) and heard the souls of men cry, "Bring our cause before the Most High." (9:3) In 1 Enoch 10:1, the reply came from "the Most High, the Holy and Great One" who sent forth agents, including Gabriel—
&lt;blockquote style="border:1px"&gt;And the Lord said to Gabriel: "'Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy ''[the children of fornication and]'' the children of the Watchers from amongst men ''[and cause them to go forth]:'' send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle: for length of days shall they not have." [[s:Book of Enoch/Chapter 10|—1&amp;nbsp;Enoch&amp;nbsp;10:9]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gabriel is the fifth of the five angels who keep watch: "Gabriel, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim." ([[s:Book of Enoch/Chapter 20|1 Enoch 20:7]])

When Enoch asked who the four figures were that he had seen: "And he said to me: 'This first is Michael, the merciful and long-suffering: and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the wounds of the children of men, is Raphael: and the third, who is set over all the powers, is Gabriel: and the fourth, who is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit eternal life, is named Phanuel.' And these are the four angels of the Lord of Spirits and the four voices I heard in those days." ([[s:Book of Enoch/Chapter 40|Enoch 40:9]])

===New Testament===
[[File:Archangel Gabriel. Tsalenjikha fresco (Georgia, 14th c.).jpg|thumb|Archangel Gabriel. A fresco from the [[Tsalenjikha Cathedral]] by Cyrus Emanuel Eugenicus. 14th century]]

First, concerning [[John the Baptist]], an angel appeared to his father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]], a priest of the course of Abia, ({{bibleref|Luke|1:5-7|9}}) whose barren wife [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elisabeth]] was of the daughters of [[Aaron]], while he ministered in the temple:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Luke 1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
12 And when Zacharias saw ''him'', he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost,&lt;!-- Ghost is correct KJV, do not change to spirit. --&gt; even from his mother's womb.
16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
({{bibleref|Luke|1:10-20|KJV}} KJV) (other versions: {{bibleref|Luke|1:1-25|!}})&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gabriel Archangel Hajdudorog.JPG|thumb|right|Gabriel on the southern deacons' door of the [[iconostasis of Hajdúdorog|iconostasis]] in the [[Cathedral of Hajdúdorog]], Hungary.]]
After completing his week&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120720085450/http://www.avbtab.org/rc/read/dedicate.htm THE Dedication (Jesus' birth)] "The priests serve 4 weeks per year: 1 week twice a year in courses, and the two week-long feasts, unleavened bread and tabernacles. Pentecost is a one-day observance, which would have come before Zacharias' (the 8th) course began, or at the latest, the 1st day of his course, which was from 12 thru 18 Sivan, or noon on the 19th, if Josephus is correct that courses changed at noon on the sabbaths." Josephus Antiquities b.7 ch.14 s.7 "eight days, from sabbath to sabbath." Josephus against Apion b.2 sect.8 "mid-day"&lt;/ref&gt; of ministry, Zacharias returned to his house (in [[Hebron]])&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Joshua|21:9-11|9}} with {{bibleref|Luke|1:39-40|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Elizabeth conceived. After she completed "five months" ({{bibleref|Luke|1:21-25|9}}) of her pregnancy, Gabriel is mentioned again:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Luke 1:26 ¶ And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name ''was'' Mary.
28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, ''thou that art'' highly favoured, the Lord ''is'' with thee: blessed ''art'' thou among women.
29 And when she saw ''him'', she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
({{bibleref|Luke|1:26-38|KJV}} KJV) (other versions: {{bibleref|Luke|1:26-38|!}})&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gabriel only appears by name in those two passages in Luke. In the first passage the angel identified himself as Gabriel, but in the second it is Luke who identified him as Gabriel.  The only other named angels in the New Testament are Michael the Archangel (in {{bibleref|Jude|1:9|9}}) and [[Abaddon]] (in {{bibleref|Revelation|9:11|9}}) . Gabriel is not called an archangel in the Bible. Believers are expressly warned not to worship angels (in {{bibleref|Colossians|2:18-19|9}} and {{bibleref|Revelation|19:10|9}}).&lt;ref&gt;See also Easton's Bible Dictionary [[s:Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)/Angel|angel]] entry&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gabriel's horn===
The [[Literary trope|trope]] of Gabriel blowing a trumpet blast to indicate the Lord's return to Earth is especially familiar in [[Negro spirituals]]. However, though the Bible mentions a trumpet blast preceding the resurrection of the dead, it never specifies Gabriel as the trumpeter. Different passages state different things: the angels of the Son of Man (Matthew 24:31); the voice of the Son of God (John 5:25-29); God's trumpet (I Thessalonians 4:16); seven angels sounding a series of blasts (Revelation 8-11); or simply "a trumpet will sound" (I Corinthians 15:52).&lt;ref name="svm"&gt;S. Vernon McCasland, "Gabriel's Trumpet", ''Journal of Bible and Religion'' '''9''':3:159–161 (August 1941) {{jstor|1456405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In related traditions, Gabriel is again not identified as the trumpeter. In Judaism, trumpets are prominent, and they seem to be blown by God himself, or sometimes [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. In [[Zoroastrianism]], there is no trumpeter at the last judgement. In Islamic tradition, it is [[Israfil]] who blows the trumpet, though he is not named in the [[Qur'an]]. The Christian [[Church Fathers]] do not mention Gabriel as the trumpeter; early English literature similarly does not.&lt;ref name="svm"/&gt;

The earliest known identification of Gabriel as the trumpeter comes in John Wycliffe's 1382 tract, ''De Ecclesiæ Dominio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracts &amp; Treatises of John De Wycliffe, D.D.|last=Vaughn|first=Robert|publisher=Wycliffe Society|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 1455, in [[Armenian art]], there is an illustration in an Armenian manuscript showing Gabriel sounding his trumpet as the dead climb out of their graves.&lt;ref&gt;Walters MS 543, fol. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Two centuries later, Gabriel is identified as the trumpeter, in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667):&lt;ref name="svm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milton, ''Paradise Lost'', XI.72ff&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Betwixt these rockie pillars Gabriel sat
Chief of the Angelic guards (IV.545f)...
He ended, and the Son gave signal high
To the bright minister that watch'd, he blew
His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
When God descended, and perhaps once more
To sound at general doom. (XI.72ff).
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, Gabriel's horn is omnipresent in Negro spirituals, but it is unclear how the Byzantine conception inspired Milton and the spirituals, though they presumably have a common source.&lt;ref name="svm"/&gt;

Gabriel's horn also makes an appearance in ''The Eyes of Texas'' (1903) where it signifies the rapture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicar|first1=Jim|title=The Origins of "The Eyes of Texas"|url=https://lhb.music.utexas.edu/history/songs/|website=Longhorn Band|accessdate=6 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707082746/https://lhb.music.utexas.edu/history/songs/|archive-date=7 July 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marc Connelly]]'s play based on spirituals, ''[[The Green Pastures]]'' (1930), Gabriel has his beloved trumpet constantly with him, and the Lord has to warn him not to blow it too soon.&lt;ref name="svm"/&gt; Four years later "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" was introduced by [[Ethel Merman]] in [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934).

===Feast days===

Saint Gabriel Archangel's festivity day was exclusively celebrated the 18th of March as of many sources dating between the years 1588 and 1921, except for a source published in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Catholic Directory, Ecclasiastical Register, and Almanac|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XG42AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=18th+of+march+archangel+gabriel+day&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxvsyj-8jTAhVEKyYKHV9cA_gQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=18th%20of%20march%20archangel%20gabriel%20day&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the feast was celebrated on April 7th for unknown reasons (a parentheses notes that the day is normally celebrated on March 18). Writer [[Elizabeth Drayson]] mentions the feast being celebrated in March 18 the year of 1588 in her 2013 book: "The Lead Books of Granada". {{cite book |last=Drayson |first=Elizabeth |date=January 13, 2016 |title=The Lead Books of Granada |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LwRfCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=archangel+gabriel+18+march#v=onepage&amp;q=archangel%20gabriel%2018%20march&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan - 2013 edition |page=3 |isbn=113735884X |author-link=}}

One of the oldest out of print sources pronouncing the feast for March 18th, was first published in 1608 and has the name "Flos sanctorum: historia general de la vida y hechos de Jesu-Christo ... y de los santos de que reza y haze fiesta la Iglesia Catholica ..." by the [[Spain|Spanish]] writer [[Alonso de Villegas]], a newer edition of this book was published in the year 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Villegas |first=Alonso |date=1794 |title=Flos sanctorum: historia general de la vida y hechos de Jesu-Christo... |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D-MIM9Quh_sC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=el+arc%C3%A1ngel+del+bautismo+gabriel+18+marzo#v=onepage&amp;q=el%20arc%C3%A1ngel%20del%20bautismo%20gabriel%2018%20marzo&amp;f=false |location= Spain|publisher=Imprenta de Isidro Aguasvivas |page=250 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another source published in Ireland in 1886 «The Irish Ecclesiastical Record» also mentions March 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1886 |title=The Irish Ecclesiastical Record |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qKM9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1112&amp;lpg=PA1112&amp;dq=archangel+gabriel+18th+of+march+commemoration#v=onepage&amp;q=archangel%20gabriel%2018th%20of%20march%20commemoration&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Browne and Nolan, 1886 |page=1112 |isbn=|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a painting from 1886 by the Italian artist Diodore Rahoult, the 18th of March appears on the painting as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archangel Gabriel, divine messenger; commemoration on 18 March, 1886|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/archangel-gabriel-divine-messenger-commemoration-on-18-news-photo/700192371#archangel-gabriel-divine-messenger-commemoration-on-18-march-colored-picture-id700192371|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast of Saint Gabriel was included for the first time in the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1921, for celebration on March 24. {{Citation needed|reason=A reliable citation is needed for the 1921 source. There are web blogs and pages that mention this, however some of these are probably basing their source on Wikipedia information. Printed information is preferred in these cases.|date=April 2017}}  It is unknown whether this was a temporary change, however there is no recent mention of the feast commemoration between the years 1921 and 1969. In 1969 the day was officially transferred to September 29 for celebration in conjunction with the feast of [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]] and [[Raphael (archangel)|St. Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of England]] has also adopted the September 29 date, known as [[Michaelmas]].

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]] celebrate his [[feast day]] on November 8 (for those churches that follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], November 8 currently falls on November 21 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]], a difference of 13 days). Eastern Orthodox commemorate him, not only on his November feast, but also on two other days: March 26 is the "[[Synaxis]] of the Archangel Gabriel" and celebrates his role in the [[Annunciation]]. 

July 13 is also known as the "Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel", and celebrates all the appearances and miracles attributed to Gabriel throughout history. The feast was first established on [[Mount Athos]] when, in the 9th century, during the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Basil II]] and the Empress Constantina Porphyrogenitus and while [[Nicholas II Chrysoberges|Nicholas Chrysoverges]] was [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], the Archangel appeared in a cell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keliaxionestin.com/eng/?page_id=760|title=The miracle of “Axion Estin”.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Karyes]], where he wrote with his finger on a stone tablet the hymn to the [[Theotokos]], "[[Axion Estin|It is truly meet...]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Velimirovic | first =Bishop Nikolai | contribution =July 13: The Holy Archangel Gabriel | year =1985 | title =Prologue from Ochrid | place =Birmingham, UK | publisher =Lazarica Press | isbn =978-0-948298-05-9 | url =http://www.westsrbdio.org/prolog/my.html?month=July&amp;day=13&amp;Go.x=6&amp;Go.y=12 | accessdate =2007-07-31 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014848/http://www.westsrbdio.org/prolog/my.html?month=July&amp;day=13&amp;Go.x=6&amp;Go.y=12 | archivedate =2007-09-28 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ethiopian Church]] celebrates his feast on December 28, with a sizeable number of its believers making a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to "Saint Gabriel" in [[Kulubi]] on that day.&lt;ref&gt;Nega Mezlekia, ''Notes from the Hyena's Belly: An Ethiopian Childhood'' (New York: Picador, 2000), p. 266. {{ISBN|0-312-28914-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Gabriel is the [[patron saint]] of messengers, those who work for broadcasting and telecommunications such as radio and television, [[remote sensing]],{{Citation needed|date= February 2016}} postal workers, clerics, diplomats, and stamp collectors.&lt;ref name=Guiley2004p140&gt;{{cite book |last1= Guiley |first1= Rosemary |authorlink1= |others= |title= Encyclopedia of Angels |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=15XABtvHcEsC |accessdate= 2013-11-15 |type= |edition= 2nd |series= |volume= |year= 2004 |publisher= Facts on File, Inc. |location= New York, NY |language= |isbn= 9780816050239 |oclc= 718132289  |doi= |id= |page= 140 |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= "He is the patron saint to telecommunication workers, radio broadcasters, messengers, postal workers, clerics, diplomats, and stamp collectors." |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter-day Saint teachings===
In [[Latter-day Saint]] theology, Gabriel is believed to have lived a mortal life as the prophet [[Noah]].

Gabriel ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جبريل, ''Jibrīl'' or جبرائيل ''Jibrāʾīl'')&lt;ref&gt;Nader, M. [http://submission.org/Holy_Spirit.html The Holy Spirit in the Quran]. Submission.org. Retrieved 11 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is venerated as an [[archangel]] and as the Angel of Revelation in Islam. As the Bible portrays Gabriel as a celestial messenger sent to [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 8.16, 9.21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]],&lt;ref&gt;Luke 1.26.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]],&lt;ref&gt;Luke 1.19.&lt;/ref&gt; so too Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel was sent to numerous pre-Islamic prophets with revelation and divine injunctions, including [[Adam]], whom Muslims believe was consoled by Gabriel some time after the [[Fall of man|Fall]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam|last = Glasse|first = Cyril|publisher = Suhail Academy|year = 2000|isbn = 969-519-018-9|location = Lahore|pages = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known by many names in Islam, such as "the holy spirit", "keeper of holiness" and "peacock of paradise".&lt;ref&gt;Josef von Hammer-Purgstall ''Die Geisterlehre der Moslimen'' (the doctrin of spirits of muslims) 1852 original: Bayerische Staatsbibliothek digitalized: 22. July 2010 (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Muslim belief, [[God in Islam|God]] revealed the Quran to the Islamic [[Prophet of Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]] through the angel Gabriel,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the fifty-third chapter of the text describes the angel without naming him, in a passage that Islamic commentators have unanimously interpreted as referring to Gabriel. The passage in question, {{cite quran|53|4-11|s=ns|b=n}}, reads:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
This is naught but a revelation revealed,
taught him by one mighty in power,
very strong; he stood poised
being on the higher horizon,
then drew near and suspended hung,
two bows'-length away, or nearer,
then revealed to His servant that he revealed.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Gabriel is also ''named'' numerous times in the Qur'an ({{cite quran|2|97|s=ns|b=n}} and {{cite quran|66|4|s=ns|b=n}} for example). In {{cite quran|2|92-96|s=ns|b=n}}, the Quran mentions Gabriel along with [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], who is also venerated as an exalted angel in Islam. In [[Muslim]] [[tradition]], Gabriel is considered one of the primary [[archangel]]s. [[Exegesis]] narrates that [[Muhammad]] saw Gabriel in his full angelic splendor only twice, the first time being when he received his first revelation.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Djabrail''&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims also revere Gabriel for a number of historical events predating the first revelation. Muslims believe that Gabriel was the angel who informed [[Zechariah (priest)|Zachariah]] of [[John the Baptist|John's]] [[Nativity of St John the Baptist|birth]] as well as [[Islamic views of Mary|Mary]] of the future [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] of [[Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Zachariah''; ''Story of Jesus''&lt;/ref&gt; and that Gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed [[Abraham]] of the birth of [[Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of Ishmael''&lt;/ref&gt; All of these events can be found also in the Quran. Gabriel also makes a famous appearance in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]], where he questions Muhammad on the core tenets of Islam.

Contrary to Christian tradition, Islamic traditions depict Gabriel as the warring angel. Accordingly he aided Muhammed to overcome his adversaries, significantly during the [[Battle of Badr]] and against a demon during the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]]&lt;ref&gt;Al-qadi 'Iyad al-Yahsubi ''Ash - Shifa- Healing through defining The rights of Prophet Muhammad: الشفا بتعريف حقوق المصطفى (ص) [عربي/انكليزي] ترجمة'' Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah 2013 {{ISBN|978-2-745-16073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Islam Issa ''Milton in the Arab-Muslim World'' Taylor &amp; Francis 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-317-09592-7}} page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] sees Gabriel as a messenger of God who delivered messages to Muhammad. He is mentioned in the ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]'', the primary theological work of the Baha'i religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-1.html |title=The Kitáb-i-Íqán PART ONE |website=reference.bahai.org|accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown draws comparisons in Byzantine iconography between portrayals of angels and the conventions used to depict court eunuchs. Mainly from the Caucasus, they tended to have light eyes, hair, and skin; and those "castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards...." As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  "Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch".&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Amelia |url=https://www.academia.edu/1053017/Painting_the_Bodiless_Angels_and_Eunuchs_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Culture |title=Brown, Amelia R., ''Painting the Bodiless: Angels and Eunuchs in Byzantine Art and Culture'', University of Queensland (2007) |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent popular works on angels consider Gabriel to be [[female]] or [[androgynous]].&lt;ref name=Giovetti1993&gt;{{cite book |last1= Giovetti |first1= Paola |authorlink1= |others= Translated by Toby McCormick |title= Angels: The Role of Celestial Guardians and Beings of Light |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=svkGyVmZyEEC |accessdate= 2013-10-09 |type= |edition= |year= 1993 |publisher= Samuel Weiser |location= York Beach, ME |isbn= 978-0877287797 |oclc= 27173025  |page= |pages= |quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Godwin1990&gt;{{cite book |last1= Godwin |first1= Malcolm |authorlink1= |others= |title= Angels An Endangered Species |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MwCEPwAACAAJ |accessdate= 2013-11-13 |type= |edition= |year= 1990 |publisher= Simon and Schuster |location= New York, NY |isbn= 0671706500 |oclc= 21227232  |page= 43 |quote= "But Gabri-el is unique amongst an otherwise male or androgynous host, for it is almost certain that this great Archangel is the only female in the higher echelons." |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The eccentric English hagiographer and antiquarian, [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] (1834–1924), wrote the English lyrics to ''Gabriel's Message'', which he translated from the [[Basque music|Basque]] [[Christmas]] carol ''Birjina gaztetto bat zegoen'', which was probably related to the 13th or 14th-century Latin [[chant]] ''Angelus Ad Virginem'', which itself is based on the biblical account of the [[Annunciation]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. In Creed's song, "My Own Prison", Gabriel is mentioned deciphering the visions to the main character in the song. "Sugar Baby", the last track on [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)|Love and Theft]]'' album, contains this reference: "Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as we're born/ Look up, look up - seek your Maker - 'fore Gabriel blows his horn."

Daniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the "likeness of man" and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as "the man Gabriel." David Everson observes that "such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous ... descriptions of angels," as in Genesis 19:5.&lt;ref name=everson&gt;{{cite web|author=Student |url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/gabriel357902.shtml |title=Everson, David.

Gabriel is most often portrayed in the context of scenes of the [[Annunciation]]. In 2008 a 16th-century drawing by Lucas van Leyden of the Netherlands was discovered. George R. Goldner, chairman of the department of prints and drawings at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, suggests that the sketch was for a stained glass window. "The fact that the archangel is an ordinary-looking person and not an idealized boy is typical of the artist", said Goldner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/arts/design/25voge.html?_r=0 Vogel, Carol. "Angels Appear, and Museums Rejoice", ''New York Times'', 25 July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gendün Rinchen was born in a small cave by the side of the path to [[Paro Taktsang|Paro Tagtsang]], so as a child he was nicknamed ''"Dragphugpa"'' (Cave Man).&lt;ref name="Yogis"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a young age he showed great interest in the Buddhist religion and at seven he received novice ordination at [[Tashichho Dzong|Tashichö Dzong]] in [[Thimphu]] and was given the name Gendün Rinchen.

When he was twenty-seven he travelled to Lhodrak Lhalung, center of the tradition of [[Pema Lingpa|Padma Lingpa]] in Southern Tibet. There he studied the Thirteen great texts of Mahayana Buddhist Philosophy from Khatok Khen Rinpoche. At the age of twenty-nine he went to [[Drigung Monastery|Drigung]] in Central Tibet where he studied classical Tibetan orthography, grammar and poetry; the works of [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham Rinpoche]] and [[Khenpo Shenga]] and received many tantric teachings including those on the ''[[Mañjuśrīnāmasamgīti]]''. Afterwards he went to [[Samye|Samye Monastery]] where he received the empowerments and instructions of the ''[[Rinchen Terdzod|Rinchen Terdzö]]''; the ''Nyingthig'' and [[Longchenpa|Longchenpa's]] ''Dzödun'' from [[Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (2nd Dudjom Rinpoche)|Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje]].

After returning to Bhutan, he entered a three-year meditation retreat at the [[Paro Taktsang|Tagsang Palphug]] hermitage,  which was followed by another three year retreat he entered when he was forty at Kungachöling in [[Paro District|Paro]]. From Lopon Sonam Zangpo, a disciple of Drubwang Shakya Shri, he received teachings on the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]], [[Mahamudra|Mahāmudrā]], and so on.

For ten years he was the abbot of [[Tango Monastery]] where he wrote many commentaries on Buddhist philosophy, sutra and tantra.

In 1990 he was enthroned as the 69th Je Khenpo of Bhutan and subsequently travelled throughout the country giving religious teachings. At the age of 61 he resigned from the post of Je Khanpo and retired to a life of prayer and meditation at Jangchub Ding in Yangchenphug. In 1997, on the ninth day of the third month according to the Bhutanese calendar, he died sitting in a straight meditation posture. It is reported that his body remained sitting thus for more than a week or eleven days during which time his body remained flexible and showed no signs of decay.&lt;ref name="Yogis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pistono, 2005"&gt;

'''Gyromancy''' is a method of [[divination]] in which a person spins around inside or walks the circumference of a circle drawn on the ground, the perimeter of which is marked with the letters of an alphabet. The divination is inferred from the letter at the position where the person either stumbles or falls across the circle’s edge. The person would repeat the practice "...till he evolved an intelligible sentence, or till death or madness intervened."&lt;ref name="isbn1-56459-369-X"&gt;{{cite book | author = Waite, Arthur Edward | title = Occult Sciences: A Compendium of Transcendental Doctrine and Experiment | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | location = | year = | pages = | isbn = 1-56459-369-X | oclc = | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dizziness]] brought on by spinning or circling is intended to introduce randomness or to facilitate an [[altered state of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/g/gyromancy.html Mystica Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from [[Medieval Latin]], ''gyromantia'', which is derived from Greek ''gyros'' (circle) and ''manteia'' (oracle).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gyromancy Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ishti''' in Hinduism is a series of oblations to different deities.&lt;ref&gt;The Aitareya Brahmanam of the Rigveda Martin Haug - 1863 "The technical meaning of an ishti is a series of oblations to different deities, consisting chiefly of Purodds'a. An dhuti or uti, which appears to be an older name of the same idea (this meaning is quite omitted in the Sanscrit Dictionary ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism Benjamin Walker - 1968 - It consists of ishti, i.e. butter, fruit and grains; the midday ishti, called the prishtha, is generally accompanied by stotra (hymns) and sdmans (chants). Offerings of cakes ...&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 [[Pew Research Center]] report, there were then 10,000 Muslims in Cuba who constitute 0.1% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/muslimspopulation.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, most of the 10,000 Cuban Muslims were converts to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Andrew Morrow|title=Religion and Revolution: Spiritual and Political Islam in Ernesto Cardenal|date=15 Mar 2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443838337|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain point there were many Muslim students entering the nation of Cuba interested in studying at Cuba's prestigious schools. The number of students was approximately 1500-2000. That group included students of Pakistani origin, among others. It is known that the dominant population that went to study at Cuba was the Pakistani students who were about 936 in strength.  In 2001, Sheikh Muhammad bin Nassir Al-Aboudy, the Assistant Secretary-General of the [[Muslim World League]] (MWL) travelled to [[Cuba]] to obtain permission from the Cuban authorities to establish an Islamic organization that would support Cuba’s Muslim community. Among the other aims of the proposed organization would be constructing mosques and the dissemination of [[Islamic culture]] among Muslims.

{{as of|2015|7}} the Turkish Religious Affairs Foundation had opened the first prayer room for Cuban Muslims and the first mosque in Cuba was under construction with Turkish funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/local-muslim-cubans-get-first-prayer-room-2188586&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Cuban Muslims learned Islam through embassies of Middle Eastern countries as well as through students coming to study in Cuba from Muslim countries. Islam started to spread among Cubans in the 1970s and '80s. Printed and audio-visual Islamic resources are now almost nonexistent in Cuba. Spanish translation of the Quran and other major Islamic books are not available in the country. The Muslim community of Cuba even lacks educated religious cadres.&lt;ref name="worldbulletin.net"&gt;http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=28195{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Mezquita Abdallah"==
There is now a masjid in Old Havana open to everyone for all daily prayers. Elsewhere, Cuba’s Muslims usually pray in their homes. Although former [[President]] [[Fidel Castro]] was reported to have promised to build a mosque for his country’s Muslims, according to members of the Humanitarian Aid Foundation (IHH) who visited Cuba,.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=124277&amp;bolum=102&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the only prayers performed in public were the Friday Prayers that were conducted in a place known as Casa de los Árabes ("The Arab House") in old Havana. The Arab House belonged to a wealthy [[Arab]] immigrant who lived in Cuba during the 1940s, and it was built on [[Andalusia]]n architectural designs. The House encompasses an Arab museum and restaurant. [[Qatar]] donated US$40,000 for the remodeling of the House, but it was only opened for Friday prayers..&lt;ref name="islamawareness.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamawareness.net/LatinAmerica/cuba.html|title=Islam in Cuba|work=islamawareness.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious Groups==

There are two Islamic groups in Cuba: the Cuban Islamic Union, which is headed by its president, Imam Yahya Pedro,&lt;ref name="worldbulletin.net"/&gt; and Cuban Association for the Diffusion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://acdisite.wordpress.com/acerca-de/|title=Quiénes Somos?|date=2016-01-14|access-date=2018-04-25|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sunnis are concentrated in the Malcolm X Center, in the home of the Muslim Hassan AbdulGafur, in Cerro, in Havana. Hassan AbdulGafur was the first to form an Islamic organization in Cuba in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.diariodecuba.com/cuba/1496441543_31615.html/|title=¿Cómo celebran los musulmanes cubanos el Ramadán?|date=2016-01-14|access-date=2018-04-25|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Muslims==

Actually it is important to note, that most jinn are simply spirits from other cultures. Actually, syncretism played an imortant role in Islamic expansion through central asia. Many Muslims identify abformer deites with jinn today. further, there is no strict concept of jinn, since it depends on the corre. culture</comment>

'''Jinn''' ({{lang-ar|الجن}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-jinn}}''), also [[Romanization of Arabic|Romanized]] as '''djinn''' or [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] as '''genies''' (with the more broad meaning of [[spirit]]s or [[demon]]s, depending on source)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jinn|title=jinn – Definition of jinn in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries – English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 22 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; are [[supernatural]] creatures in early pre-Islamic  [[Arabian mythology|Arabian]] and later [[Islamic mythology]] and [[Islamic theology|theology]]. Jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept, rather they may be various [[pagan]] beings integrated into Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 2 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since jinn are not inevitably evil (nor good), Islam was able to adapt spirits from other religions during its expansion. 

Besides the jinn, Islam acknowledges the existence of demons (''Shayāṭīn''). The lines between demons and jinn are blurred, since malevolent jinn are also called ''shayāṭīn''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lebling (30 July 2010). Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar. I.B.Tauris. p. 87. {{ISBN|978-0-85773-063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 3 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; However both Islam and Western scholarship, generally distinguishes between angels, jinn and demons (''shayāṭīn'') as three different types of spiritual entities in Islamic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 21 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG'', 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 47 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In an Islamic context, the term ''jinn'' is used for both a collective designation for any supernatural creature and also to refer to a specific type of supernatural creature.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 67 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jinn'' is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[collective number|collective noun]] deriving from the [[Semitic root]] {{sc|jnn}} ({{lang-ar|جَنّ / جُنّ}}, ''jann''), whose primary meaning is "to hide" or "to conceal". Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, "beings that are concealed from the senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |title=An Arabic-English Lexicon |author=Edward William Lane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archivedate= 8 April 2015 |df= }}. p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognate]]s include the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|majnūn}}'' ("possessed", or generally "insane"), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jannah}}'' ("garden", also “heaven”), and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|janīn}}'' ("embryo").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |last=Wehr |first=Hans |authorlink=Hans Wehr |year=1994 |edition=4 |publisher=Spoken Language Services |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87950-003-0 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jinn'' is properly treated as a plural, with the singular being ''jinnī''.

The origin of the word Jinn remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Some scholars relate the Arabic term jinn to the Latin genius, as a result of syncretism during the reign of the Roman empire under [[Tiberius]] Augustus,&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 38&lt;/ref&gt; but this derivation is also disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 25 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion holds that jinn may be derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] "ginnaya" ({{lang-syc|ܓܢܬܐ}}) with the meaning of "[[tutelary deity]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 24 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; or also "garden". Others claim a [[Persian language|Persian]] origin of the word, in the form of the Avestic "Jaini", a wicked (female) spirit.  Jaini were among various creatures in the possibly even pre-Zoroastrian mythology of peoples of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Tisdall, W. St. Clair. The Original Sources of the Qur'an, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Religion of the Crescent or Islam: Its Strength, Its Weakness, Its Origin, Its Influence, William St. Clair Tisdall, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] form ''genie'' is a borrowing of the French ''{{lang|fr|génie}}'', from the [[Latin]] ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'', a guardian spirit of people and places in [[ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]]. It first appeared&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd&amp;nbsp;ed. "genie, ''n''." Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in 18th-century translations of the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Thousand and One Nights]]'' from the French,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Arabian Nights' entertainments |year=1706 |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;I |p=14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; where it had been used owing to its rough similarity in sound and sense.

== Pre-Islamic Arabia ==
{{see also|Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia}}
Jinn were worshipped by many Arabs during the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|Pre-Islamic period]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt; but, unlike gods, jinn were not regarded as [[Immortality|immortal]]. In ancient Arabia, the term ''jinn'' also applied to all kinds of supernatural entities among various religions and cults; thus, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]], Christian, and [[Judaism|Jewish]] angels and demons were also called "jinn".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

The exact origins of belief in jinn are not entirely clear.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lebling |first1=Robert |title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar |date=2010 |publisher=I.

==Islamic theology==
{{see also|Islamic mythology}}
In the Islamic sense, ''jinn'' is used in two different ways:

* As the opposite of ''al-Ins'' (something in shape) referring to any object that cannot be detected by human sensory organs, including [[angels in Islam|Angels]], [[Shaitan|Demon]]s and the interior of human beings. Thus every Demon and every Angel is also a jinn, but not every Jinn is an Angel or a Demon.&lt;ref&gt;Scott B. Noegel, Brannon M. Wheeler ''The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'' Scarecrow Press 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-461-71895-6}} page 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Michigan ''Muhammad Asad: Europe's Gift to Islam, Band 1'' Truth Society 2006 {{ISBN|978-9-693-51852-8}} page 387&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-0-710-31356-0}} page 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husam Muhi Eldin al- Alousi ''The Problem of Creation in Islamic Thought, Qur'an, Hadith, Commentaries, and Kalam''National Printing and Publishing, Bagdad, 1968 p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
*An invisible entity, created by God out of a "mixture of fire" or "smokeless fire", who roamed the earth before Adam. These entities are believed to resemble humans with regard to the need of eating and drinking, procreation and dying, being subject to judgment they will either be condemned to heaven or hell according to their deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt; But they were much faster and stronger than humans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;John Andrew Morrow ''Islamic Images and Ideas: Essays on Sacred Symbolism'' McFarland, 27 November 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-476-61288-1}} page 73&lt;/ref&gt; Jinn are also related to heavenly beings, a sub-category of angels or a tribe of angelic beings, who is able to sin and created from fire, unlike their light-created counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Vicchio ''Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith'' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-556-35304-8}} page 183&lt;/ref&gt; However these jinn must be distinguished, from the Pre-Adamite jinn-race, who share many characteristics with human, instead of angels.

In Islamic tradition, [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] was sent as a [[prophets of Islam|prophet]] to both human and jinn communities, and that prophets and messengers were sent to both communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|51|56|end=56|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad ibn Ayyūb al-Ṭabarī, ''Tuḥfat al-gharā’ib'', I, p. 68; Abū al-Futūḥ Rāzī, ''Tafsīr-e rawḥ al-jenān va rūḥ al-janān'', pp. 193, 341&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally [[Al-Jinn|Surah 72]] is held to tell about the revelation to Jinn and several stories mention one of Muhammad's followers accompanied him, witnessing the revelation to the Jinn.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Islamic prophet, who is related to interactions with Jinn, is [[Solomon in Islam|Solomon]]. In Quran, he is said to be a king in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]] and was gifted by [[God in Islam|God]] to talk to animals and Jinn. God granted him authority over the rebellious Jinn or ''[[marid]]'', thus Solomon forced them to build the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]]. Beliefs regarding Solomon and his power over the Jinn were later extended in folklore and folktales.

Related to common traditions, the angels were created on Wednesday, the Jinn on Thursday and humans on Friday, but not the very next day, rather more than 1000 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 43 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The community of the Jinn race were like these of humans, but then corruption and injustice among them increased and all warnings sent by God were ignored. Consequently, God sent his angels to battle the infidel Jinn. Just a few survived, and were ousted to far islands or to the [[Mount Qaf|mountains]]. With the revelation of Islam, the Jinn were given a new chance to access salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, ''Thomas Patrick Hughes Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 page 134 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Said Reynolds ''The Qur'an and Its Biblical Subtext'' Routledge 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-135-15020-4}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tubanur Yesilhark Ozkan ''A Muslim Response to Evil: Said Nursi on the Theodicy'' Routledge 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-317-18754-7}} page 141&lt;/ref&gt; But because of their anciennity, the jinn would attribute themselves to a superiority over humans and envy the them for their place and rank on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter'' de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 43 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Islamic Jinn belief==
[[File:Kitab al-Bulhan --- devils talking.jpg|thumb|right=0.4|The black king of the djinns, Al-Malik al-Aswad, from the late 14th&amp;nbsp;century [[Book of Wonders]]]]

===In the beginning of Islam===
In early Islamic development, the status of jinn were reduced from that of deities&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Fee, Jeffrey B. Webb ''American Myths, Legends, and Tall Tales: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore [3 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore (3 Volumes)'' ABC-CLIO 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69568-8}} page 527&lt;/ref&gt; to minor spirits. To assert a strict [[monotheism]] and the Islamic concept of [[Tauhid]], all affinities between the jinn and God were denied, thus jinn were placed parallel to humans, also subject to God's judgment and able to attain [[Paradise]] or [[Hell]]. However, even though their status as tutelary deities was reduced, they were not consequently regarded as demons.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 52&lt;/ref&gt; In later revelations, the concept of demons and angels distinct from the pagan jinn were made.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Waardenburg Islam: Historical, Social, and Political Perspectives Walter de Gruyter 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-110-20094-2}} page 40&lt;/ref&gt; T. Fahd stated, the jinn were related to the pagan belief, while the demons and angels were borrowed from [[Abrahamic religions|monotheistic concepts]] of angels and demons. In later revelations the demons and the jinn seems to be used interchangeably, here placing the jinn with the [[Devil#Islam|devil]], against the angels and [[Muhammad]].

===Jinn belief in the later centuries===
[[File:Iranischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zulqarnayn]] with the help of some jinn, building the Iron Wall to keep the barbarian [[Gog and Magog]] from civilized peoples (16th&amp;nbsp;century [[Persian miniature]])]]
When Islam spread outside of Arabia, belief in the jinn was assimilated with local belief about [[spirit]]s and [[deity|deities]] from Iran, Africa, Turkey and India.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo Encyclopedia of Islam Infobase Publishing 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-438-12696-8}} page 402&lt;/ref&gt; Persians, for example, identified the jinn in the Quran with the [[Daeva]] from [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] lore.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 134&lt;/ref&gt; Developed from various traditions and local folklore, but not mentioned in canonical Islamic scriptures, jinn were thought to be able to possess humans; [[Morocco]] especially has many possession traditions, including [[Exorcism in Islam|exorcism rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Laycock ''Spirit Possession around the World: Possession, Communion, and Demon Expulsion across Cultures: Possession, Communion, and Demon Expulsion across Cultures'' ABC-CLIO 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69590-9}} page 243&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sindh]] the concept of the Jinni was introduced during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Era]] and has become a common part of local folklore, also including stories of both male jinn called "''jinn''" and female jinn called "''Jiniri''". Folk stories of female jinn include stories such as the ''Jejhal Jiniri''. Although, due to the cultural influence, the concept of jinn may vary, all share some common features. The jinn are believed to live in societies resembling these of humans, practicing religion (including Islam, Christianity and Judaism), having emotions, needing to eat and drink, and can procreate and raise families. Additionally, they fear iron, generally appear in desolate or abandoned places, and are stronger and faster than humans.&lt;ref name="Hughes, Thomas Patrick 1885. p.136"&gt;Hughes, Thomas Patrick. ''Dictionary of Islam''. 1885. "Genii" p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, jinn are thought to eat bones and prefer rotten flesh over fresh flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Abu’l-Fotūḥ, XVII, pp.&amp;nbsp;280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition and existence of jinn is the subject of various debates during the [[Middle Age]]s. According to [[Ashari]], the existence of jinn can not be proven, because arguments concerning the existence of jinn are beyond human comprehension. Adepts of [[Ashʿari theology]] explained jinn are invisible to humans, because they lack the appropriate sense organs to envision them.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 22&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argued, if jinn exist, their bodies must either be ethereal or made of solid material; if they were composed of the former, they would not able to do hard work, like carrying heavy stones. If they were composed of the latter, they would be visible to any human with functional eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.33 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Critics therefore refused to believe in a literal reading on jinn in Islamic sacred texts, preferring to view them as "unruly men".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Thomas Patrick. ''Dictionary of Islam''. 1885. "Genii" p.134&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, advocates of belief in jinn assert that God's creation can exceed the human mind; thus, jinn are beyond human understanding. Since they are mentioned in Islamic texts, scholars such as [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Ibn Hazm]] prohibit the denial of jinn. They also refer to spirits and demons among the Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews to "prove" their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.33 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Taymiyya believed the jinn to be generally "ignorant, untruthful, oppressive and treacherous". He held that the jinn account for much of the "magic" that is perceived by humans, cooperating with magicians to lift items in the air, delivering hidden truths to fortune tellers, and mimicking the voices of deceased humans during seances.&lt;ref name="taym"&gt;[[Ibn Taymiyyah]], ''al-Furqān bayna awliyā’ al-Raḥmān wa-awliyā’ al-Shayṭān'' ("Essay on the Jinn"), translated by Abu Ameenah Bilal Phillips&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics, such as [[Jahiz]] and [[Mas'udi]], stated that sightings of jinn are due to psychological causes. According to Mas'udi, the jinn as described by traditional scholars, are not [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] false, but improbable. Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''waswās'' (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.37 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Sufism|Sufi traditions]] related the meaning of jinn back to its origin "something that is concealed from sights", thus they were related to the hidden realm, including angels from the heavenly realm and the jinn from a sublunary realm. [[Ibn Arabi]] stated: "Only this much is different: The spirits of the jinn are lower spirits, while the spirits of angels are heavenly spirits".&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/futuhat_ch009.html&lt;/ref&gt; The jinn share, due to their [[Barzakh|intermediary abode]] both angelic and human traits. According to some Sufi teachings, a jinn is like an "empty cup", composed of its own ego and intention, and a reflection of its observer.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Witteveen ''The Heart of Sufism: Essential Writings of Hazrat Inayat Khan'' Shambhala Publications 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because jinn are closer to the material realm, it would be easier for human to contact a jinn, than an angel.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In folk literature ====
[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|right|Abbasid manuscript of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'']]
Jinn can be found in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' story of "[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]";&lt;ref name="classiclit.about.com"&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-jinni.htm The fisherman and the Jinni] at About.com Classic Literature&lt;/ref&gt; more than three different types of jinn are described in the story of ''Ma‘ruf the Cobbler'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idriesshahfoundation.org/books/tales-of-the-dervishes/ Idries Shah – Tales of the Dervishes] at ISF website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Vol_10/tale169.htm|title=MA’ARUF THE COBBLER AND HIS WIFE}}&lt;/ref&gt; two jinn help young [[Aladdin]] in the story of ''Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-alladin.htm The Arabian Nights – ALADDIN; OR, THE WONDERFUL LAMP] at About.com Classic Literature&lt;/ref&gt; as Ḥasan Badr al-Dīn weeps over the grave of his father until sleep overcomes him, and he is awoken by a large group of sympathetic jinn in the ''Tale of ‘Alī Nūr al-Dīn and his son Badr ad-Dīn Ḥasan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-nuraldin.htm The Arabian Nights – TALE OF NUR AL-DIN ALI AND HIS SON BADR AL-DIN HASAN] at About.com Classic Literature&lt;/ref&gt; In some stories, jinn are credited with the ability of [[teleportation|instantaneous travel]] (from China to Morocco in a single instant); in others, they need to fly from one place to another, though quite fast (from Baghdad to Cairo in a few hours).

===Modern era===
Affirmation on the existence of Jinn as sapient creatures living along with humans is still widespread in the Middle Eastern world and mental illnesses are often attributed to jinn possession.&lt;ref&gt;G. Hussein Rassool ''Islamic Counselling: An Introduction to theory and practice'' Routledge, 16.07.2015 {{ISBN|978-1-31744-125-0}} p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

However some [[modernism|modernist commentators]], on the basis of the word's meaning, reinterpretated references to jinn as microorganisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es or undetectable uncivilized persons.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ross Valentine ''Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice'' Hurst Publishers 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-850-65916-7}} page 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U. A. B. Razia Akter Banu ''Islam in Bangladesh'' BRILL 1992 {{ISBN|978-9-004-09497-0}} page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Others try to [[Pseudoscience|reconcile the traditional perspective on jinn, with modern sciences]]. [[Fethullah Gülen]], leader of [[Gülen movement|Hizmet movement]], had put forward the idea, that jinn may be the cause of [[schizophrenia]] and [[cancer]] and that the Quranic references to jinn on "smokeless fire" could for that matter mean "energy".&lt;ref&gt;John Grant ''Denying Science: Conspiracy Theories, Media Distortions, and the War Against Reality'' Prometheus Books {{ISBN|978-1-616-14400-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others again refuse connections between illness and jinn, but still believe in their existence, due to their occurrences in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Alireza Doostdar ''The Iranian Metaphysicals: Explorations in Science, Islam, and the Uncanny'' {{ISBN|978-1-400-88978-5}} Princeton University Press 2018 page 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern [[Salafi]] tenets of Islam, refuse reinterpretations of jinn and adhere to [[Bi-la kaifa|literalism]], arguing the threat of jinn and their ability to possess humans, could be proven by ''[[Quran and Sunnah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/1819&lt;/ref&gt; Jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism. [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, impose [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there is no distinction made between demons and indifferent spirits from other cultures, as Salafi scholars [[Umar Sulaiman Al-Ashqar]] stated,&lt;ref&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/20666&lt;/ref&gt; that demons are actually simply ''unbelieving jinn''.

[[Sleep paralysis]] is conceptualized as a "Jinn attack" by many sleep paralysis sufferers in Egypt as discovered by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] neuroscientist Baland Jalal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jalal|first=Baland|last2=Simons-Rudolph|first2=Joseph|last3=Jalal|first3=Bamo|last4=Hinton|first4=Devon E.|date=1 October 2013|title=Explanations of sleep paralysis among Egyptian college students and the general population in Egypt and Denmark|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1363461513503378|journal=Transcultural Psychiatry|volume=51|issue=2|pages=158–175|doi=10.1177/1363461513503378}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scientific study found that as many as 48 percent of those who experience sleep paralysis in Egypt believe it to be an assault by the Jinn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Almost all of these sleep paralysis sufferers (95%) would recite verses from the [[Quran]] during sleep paralysis to prevent future "Jinn attacks". In addition, some (9%) would increase their daily Islamic prayer ([[salah]]) to get rid of these attacks by Jinn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sleep paralysis is generally associated with great fear in Egypt, especially if believed to be supernatural in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jalal|first=Baland|last2=Hinton|first2=Devon E.|date=1 September 2013|title=Rates and Characteristics of Sleep Paralysis in the General Population of Denmark and Egypt|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11013-013-9327-x|journal=Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry|volume=37|issue=3|pages=534–548|doi=10.1007/s11013-013-9327-x|issn=0165-005X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supernaturality==
The supernaturality of Jinn does not mean they are transcendent to nature, but that they appear so in relation to human's perception of nature, due to their invisibility. They are "natural" in the [[Ancient philosophy|classical philosopical]] sense by consisting of an element, undergoing change and being bound in time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. McCraw, Robert Arp ''Philosophical Approaches to the Devil'' Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|9781317392217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus they are not purely spiritual, but also physical in nature, being able to interact in a tactile manner with people and objects, and also subject to bodily desires like eating and sleeping. Unlike the Jinn in Islamic belief and folklore, Jinn in Middle Eastern folktales are often depicted as monstrous or magical creatures, and unlike the former, generally considered to be fictional.&lt;ref name="Robert Lebling"&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depictions ==
The appearance of jinn can be divided into three major categories&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 113 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;:

=== Zoomorphic manifestation ===
Jinn are assumed to be able to appear in shape of various animals such as scorpions, cats, [[owl]]s and [[onagers]]. The dog is also often related to jinn, especially black dogs. However piebald dogs are rather identified with [[Hinn (mythology)|hinn]]. Associations between dogs and jinn prevailed in Arabic-literature, but lost its meaning in Persian scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 134 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Serpents are the animals most associated with jinn. Islamic traditions knows many narratitions concerning a serpent who was actually a jinni.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 116 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; However (except for the '''udhrut'' from [[Fortune-telling|Yemeni]] folklore) the jinn can not appear in form of wolves. The wolf is thought of as the [[Predation|natural predator]] of the jinn, who contrasts the jinn by his noble character and disables them to vanish.&lt;ref&gt;name="ReferenceA"&gt;Robert Lebling Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 43 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jinn in form of storms and shadows ===
The jinn are also related to the wind. They may appear in mists or sandstorms.&lt;ref name="Hughes, Thomas Patrick 1885. p.136"/&gt; [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]], who is held to have accompanied Muhammad during his lecture to the jinn, is said to view the jinn as shadowy ghosts with no individual structure.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 64&lt;/ref&gt; According to a narration [[Ghazali]] asked [[Ṭabasī]], famous for jinn-incantations, to reveal the jinn to him. Accordingly Tabasi showed him the jinn, seeing them like they were "a shadow on the wall". After Ghazali requested to speak to them, Ṭabasī stated, that for now he could not see more.&lt;ref&gt;Travis Zadeh  ''Commanding Demons and Jinn: The Sorcerer in Early Islamic Thought'' p.145&lt;/ref&gt; Although sandstorms are believed to be caused by jinn, others, such as [[Abu Yahya Zakariya' ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini]] and Ghazali attribute them to natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 147 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise sandstorms are thought to be caused by a battle between different groups of jinn.

=== Anthropomorphic manifestation ===
A common characteristic of the jinn is their lack of individuality, but they may gain individuality by materializing in human forms &lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 153 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Asmodeus|Sakhr]] and severel jinn known from magical writings. But also in their anthropomorphed shape, they stay partly animalic and are not fully human. Therefore, individual jinn are commonly depicted as monstrous and anthropomorphized creatures with body parts from different animals or human with animalic traits.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 164 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly associated with jinn in humanform are the [[Sila (mythology)|Si'lah]] and the [[Ghoul]]. However, they stay partly animalic, their bodies are depicted as fashioned out of two or more different species.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 164&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them may have the hands of cats, the head of birds or wings rise from their shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 160 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In witchcraft and magical literature==
[[File:Kitab al-Bulhan --- demons.jpg|thumb|right=1.4|Zawba'a or Zoba'ah, the demon king of Friday]]
[[Witchcraft]] (''sihr'') is often associated with Jinn and [[Ifrit|Afarit]]&lt;ref&gt;Ian Richard Netton ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-135-17960-1}} page 377&lt;/ref&gt; around the Middle East. Therefore, a sorcerer may summon a Jinn and force him to perform orders. Summoned Jinn may be sent to the chosen victim to cause demonic possession. Such summonings were done by invocation,&lt;ref&gt;name="Robert Lebling"&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 153&lt;/ref&gt; by aid of talismans or by satisfying the Jinn, thus to make a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Gerda Sengers ''Women and Demons: Cultic Healing in Islamic Egypt'' BRILL 2003 {{ISBN|978-9-004-12771-5}} page 31&lt;/ref&gt; Jinn are also regarded as assistants of [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]]s. Soothsayers reveal information from the past and present; the Jinn can be a source of this information because their lifespans exceed those of humans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

[[Ibn al-Nadim]], in his ''Kitāb al-Fihrist'', describes a book that lists 70 Jinn led by Fuqtus, including several Jinn appointed over each day of the week.&lt;ref name="Dodge"&gt;Bayard Dodge, ed. and trans. ''The Fihrist of al-Nadim: A Tenth-Century Survey of Muslim Culture.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1970. pp. 727–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lebling"&gt;Robert Lebling. ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar.'' I.B. Taurus, 2010. p.38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayard Dodge]], who translated al-Fihrist into English, notes that most of these names appear in the [[Testament of Solomon]].&lt;ref name="Dodge" /&gt; A collection of late fourteenth- or early fifteenth-century magico-medical manuscripts from [[Ocaña, Spain]] describes a different set of 72 Jinn (termed "Tayaliq") again under Fuqtus (here named "Fayqayțūš" or Fiqitush), blaming them for various ailments.&lt;ref&gt;Celia del Moral.

Universidad de Granada, 1987. p.38 et passim&lt;/ref&gt; According to these manuscripts, each Jinni was brought before King Solomon and ordered to divulge their "corruption" and "residence" while the Jinn King Fiqitush gave Solomon a recipe for curing the ailments associated with each Jinni as they confessed their transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Book of Deadly Names|last = Shadrach|first = Nineveh|publisher = Ishtar Publishing|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0978388300|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disseminated treatise on the [[occult]], written by [[Abū al-Faḍl Muhammad al Ṭabasī|al-Ṭabasī]], called [[al-Shāmil fī al-baḥr al-kāmil|Shāmil]], deals with subjugating demons and jinn by incantations, charms and the combination of written and recited formulae and to obtain supernatural powers through their aid. Al-Ṭabasī distinguished between licit and illicit magic, the later founded on disbelief, while the first on purity.&lt;ref&gt;Travis Zadeh ''Commanding Demons and Jinn: The Sorcerer in Early Islamic Thought'' Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2014  p-143-145&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Rwandan genocide]], both [[Hutu]]s and [[Tutsi]]s avoided searching local [[Islam in Rwanda|Rwandan Muslim]] neighborhoods because they widely believed the myth that local [[Muslim]]s and mosques were protected by the power of Islamic magic and the efficacious Jinn.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In the Rwandan city of [[Cyangugu]], arsonists ran away instead of destroying the mosque because they feared the wrath of the jinn, whom they believed were guarding the mosque.&lt;ref name = "Kubai"&gt;{{cite journal

==Comparative mythology==
===Ancient Mesopotamian religion===
Beliefs in entities similar to the jinn are found throughout pre-Islamic Middle Eastern cultures.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; The ancient [[Sumer]]ians believed in [[Pazuzu]], a wind demon,&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-7141-1705-8|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|147–148}} who was shown with "a rather canine face with abnormally bulging eyes, a scaly body, a snake-headed penis, the talons of a bird and usually wings."&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;{{rp|147}} The ancient Babylonians believed in ''[[utukku]]'', a class of demons which were believed to haunt remote wildernesses, graveyards, mountains, and the sea, all locations where jinn were later thought to reside.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; The Babylonians also believed in the [[Rabisu]], a [[vampire|vampiric]] demon believed to leap out and attack travelers at unfrequented locations, similar to the post-Islamic ''[[ghoul|ghūl]]'',&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; a specific kind of jinn whose name is etymologically related to that of the Sumerian ''[[gallu|galla]]'', a class of [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]] demon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cramer, Marc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdB-AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ghoul+galla+sumerian&amp;dq=ghoul+galla+sumerian|title= The Devil Within|publisher=W.H.

[[Lamashtu]], also known as Labartu, was a divine demoness said to devour human infants.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;{{rp|115}} [[Lamassu]], also known as Shedu, were guardian spirits, sometimes with evil propensities.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;{{rp|115–116}} The [[Assyria]]ns believed in the [[Alû]], sometimes described as a wind demon residing in desolate ruins who would sneak into people's houses at night and steal their sleep.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; In the ancient Syrian city of [[Palmyra]], entities similar to jinn were known as ''ginnayê'',&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] name which may be etymologically derived from the name of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|genii]]'' from [[Roman mythology]].&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; Like jinn among modern-day [[Bedouin]], ''ginnayê'' were thought to resemble humans.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; They protected caravans, cattle, and villages in the desert&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; and [[Tutelary deity|tutelary]] shrines were kept in their honor.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt; They were frequently invoked in pairs.&lt;ref name="Lebling1–10"/&gt;

===Judaism===
[[Shedim]], one of several supernatural creatures in early [[Jewish mythology]], resemble the Islamic concept of Jinn. Both are said to be invisible to human eyes but are subject to bodily desires, like procreating and the need to eat, and both may be malevolent or benevolent. Like the Islamic notion of jinn as Pre-Adamites, Jewish lore also regard shedim as Pre-Adamites, replaced by human beings in some legends.&lt;ref&gt;Carol K.

===Buddhism===
Similar to the Islamic idea of spiritual entities converting to one's own religion can be found on [[Buddhism]] lore. Accordingly, Buddha preached among humans and [[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]s, spiritual entities who are like humans subject to the cycle of life, that resembles the Islamic notion of Jinn, who are also [[ontologically]] placed among humans in regard of their [[Eschatology|eschatological]] destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie Musæus-Higgins ''Poya Days'' Asian Educational Services 1925 {{ISBN|978-8-120-61321-8}} page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[Cornelius Van Allen Van Dyck|Van Dyck]]'s Arabic translation of the Old Testament uses the alternative collective plural "jann" (Arab:الجان}; translation:al-jānn) to render the Hebrew word usually translated into English as "familiar spirit" (אוב , [[Strong's Concordance|Strong]] #0178) in several places ([[Leviticus]] 19:31, 20:6, [[1 Samuel]] 28:3,7,9, [[1 Chronicles]] 10:13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabicbible.com/arabic-bible.html|title=Arabic Bible – Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry|website=''arabicbible.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guanche mythology ===
In [[Church of the Guanche People|Guanche mythology]] from [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]], there existed the belief in beings that were similar to genies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.eldia.es/afondo/2013-07-07/1-guanches-perros-llegaron-juntos-Tenerife.htm|title=Los guanches y los perros llegaron juntos a Tenerife|date=7 July 2013}} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ''[[maxios]]'' or ''dioses paredros'' ("attendant gods", domestic and nature spirits) and ''[[tibicena]]s'' (evil genies), as well as the demon ''[[Guayota]]'' (aboriginal god of evil) that, like the Arabic ''[[Devil (Islam)|{{transl|ar|ALA|Iblīs}}]]'', is sometimes identified with a genie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldia.es/2009-08-23/CRITERIOS/3-Religion-guanche.htm Guanche Religion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002215856/http://www.eldia.es/2009-08-23/CRITERIOS/3-Religion-guanche.htm |date= 2 October 2009 }} (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Guanches]] were the [[Berbers|Berber]] natives of the Canary Islands before they were colonised and enslaved by the Europeans who claimed the island for themselves.

==In popular culture==
{{main|Genie in popular culture}}

The jinn frequently occurs as a character or plot element in fiction. Two other classes of jinn, the [[ifrit]] and the [[marid]], have been represented in fiction as well.

Genies appear in film in various forms, such as the genie freed by Abu, the eponymous character in the 1940 film ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|Thief of Bagdad]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |author=Crowther, Bosley |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/49447/The-Thief-of-Bagdad/details |title='The Thief of Bagdad,' a Delightful Fairy Tale, at the Music Hall--'Lady With Red Hair,' at the Palace |accessdate=2 July 2016 |date=6 December 1940 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Blue Djinn" character appears in the 1960s sitcom ''[[I Dream Of Jeannie]]'', season 2, episode 1.

A Jinni makes a short appearance in the novel ''[[American Gods]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], originally published in 2001.  ''American Gods'' was also made into a TV series for the Starz television cable television network in 2017. The television adaptation also features a Jinni.

The protagonist of the [[Bartimaeus Sequence]] is a jinni, and the books have an established hierarchy that include other types of spirits: imps, foliots, djinn, afrits, and marids (to use the author's own spelling). In this interpretation, jinn and all other spirits are not physical beings, but are instead from another dimension of chaos called "The Other Place". To exist on Earth at all, magicians must summon sprits and force them to take some kind of form, something so alien that it causes all spirits pain. As a result, magicians must put measures in place to force spirits to do what they want in a form of magical slavery.

In the popular American television series, "[[Supernatural]]", the jinn (alternatively 'djinn' or 'genies') are used as a plot device and one of the supernatural beings that the main characters come in contact with. Mentioned in 7 episodes, 2.20 "What is and What Should Never Be", 6.01 "Exile on Main St", 6.10 "Caged Heat", 7.22 "There Will Be Blood", 8.20 "Pac-Man Fever", 9.20 "Bloodlines", and 13.16 "Scoobynatural".

The '''Khagi''' are a [[Hindu]] [[caste]] found mainly in the western region of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Origin ==

The word Khagi is said to be derived from the [[Sanskrit]] ''khadgika'', which means a sworsdsman. According to the community's tradition, they were originally Chauhans of Ajmer who emigrated under their leaders Kanka and Mahesa, who left their homeland as a result of a famine, and settled in the town of [[Sahaswan]] in [[Badaun District]]. The Khagi became the local rulers, but fell out with a [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultan of Delhi]], who sent a force to suppress them. They suffered defeat, and their estates were confiscated, and they were forced to become cultivators. The community also practiced widow remarriage, a custom not followed by other clans, and as such evolved into a distinct community.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Present circumstances ==

The Khagis are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]] community, and practice clan [[exogamy]]. Their main clans are the Baiswar, Bais, [[Banjara]], Dalera, Dhimar, [[Gaurahar]], Karluniya, Lodha, Raghuvanshi. Each of these clans is of equal status, and intermarry. The Khagi are a small and medium sized farmers, and tend to occupy their own villages. They are found mainly in [[Badaun District|Badaun]], [[Moradabad District|Moradabad]] and [[Jyotiba Phule Nagar]] in [[Rohilkhand]], and there are also settlements in [[Etah District|Etah]] and [[Mainpuri District|Mainpuri]] districts. Their customs are similar to other [[Hindu]] cultivating [[castes]] such as the [[Kurmi]] and [[Kisan (caste)|Kisan]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''League for the Larger Life''' was an early [[New Thought]] organization based in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], with a chapter in [[Washington, D.C.]]. A locally-focused organization, several of its members were influential across the United States and around the world. The League was uniquely composed of thirty [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] societies in the city.&lt;ref&gt;(May 22, 1916) [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E6D9113FE233A25751C2A9639C946796D6CF&amp;pagewanted=print "Theatre review"] ''The New York Times.'' Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and activities ==

The mission of the League was "to spread a knowledge of the fundamental principles that underlie healthy and harmonious living" and "to assist the individual in the solution of personal problems."&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, E.S. (2001) ''In therapy we trust: America's obsession with self-fulfillment.'' JHU Press. p 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The League operated Sunday services, classes throughout the week, and provided lecturers and teachers places to provide their services at their headquarters, 222 W. 72nd Street in New York City. The League's classes focused on [[The Bible]], health, and music, and provided a daily Prosperity Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, A. Moody, W.R., Fitt, A.P. (1922) ''Record of Christian work, Volume 41''. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1995) ''Prospects, Volume 20.'' Cambridge University Press. p 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also identified as an [[antiwar]] organization in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Alonso, H.H. (1989) ''The Women's Peace Union and the outlawry of war, 1921-1942.'' Syracuse University Press. p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable members ==

[[Orison Swett Marden]], an early New Thought writer, was the first president of the League. Dr. Julia Seton and many others were involved in the League, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser, H.W. (1919) ''A history of the new thought movement.'' T. Y. Crowell Company. p 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braden, C.S. (1963) ''Spirits in rebellion: The rise and development of new thought.'' Southern Methodist University Press. p 223.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Del Mar]], a noted chess champion, was a leader in the League at one point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daytona-beach-blog.com/2008/daytona-beach-history-helen-wilmans-post "Daytona Beach History - Helen Wilmans-Post"], Daytona Beach History Blog. Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fenwicke Holmes]], the influential brother of [[Religious Science]] founder [[Ernest Holmes]], was heavily influenced by his stand speaking at the League at the behest of Dr. Seton.

== History ==

Founded in 1916, the League held its first conference that year. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', more than 1,000 people at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre. Several organizations were represented at the conference, including The Vedanta Society, which [[Bodhananda Swamikal|Swami Bodhananda]] led; the Higher Thought Centre, led by [[W. Frederic Keeler]]; the [[First Church of Divine Science]], where W. John Murray was pastor; and the [[Freedom Fraternity]], headed by Miss Mary Allen.&lt;ref&gt;(May 22, 1916) [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E6D9113FE233A25751C2A9639C946796D6CF&amp;pagewanted=print "Theatre review"] ''The New York Times.'' Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization had disbanded by 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. (1959) ''God's image and man's imagination.'' Scribner. p 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[Roman Catholic]] [[creationist]] organisations.

==Circle Scientifique et Historique==
Circle Scientifique et Historique (CESHE), was founded in 1971 in [[Belgium]] to preserve and disseminate the work of French scholar Fernand Crombette,&lt;ref&gt;''Les droites nationales et radicales en France: répertoire critique'', Jean-Yves Camus, René Monzat, p162&lt;/ref&gt; whose works include 38 volumes and two atlases that deal with geography, the Flood, astronomy and the pre-history of Mediterranean peoples.  In 2008, an English-language affiliate was established in North America.

==Daylight Origins Society==
The Daylight Origins Society is a [[recent Earth creationist]] organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]] with ties to both the [[Traditionalist Catholic]] movement and conservative vernacular Catholics. The stated aims of the Society are "to inform Catholics and others of the scientific evidence supporting [[special creation]] as opposed to [[evolution]], and that the true discoveries of Science are in conformity with Catholic doctrines."&lt;ref name=theotokos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[British Centre for Science Education]], which maintains a list of anti-evolution groups, the Daylight Origins Society, "doesn't appear to cooperate at all with mainstream creationist groups which are all basically [[Protestant]], [[calvinist]]ic and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]]," and that "as far as [they] can make out, it is not very active."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10457">{{Islam and China|culture}}&lt;!-- '''Note''': When adding new mosques, please update the template [[Template:Mosques in China]]. --&gt;
This is a '''list of notable mosques in China'''. A [[mosque]] is a place of worship for followers of the religion of [[Islam]].  The first mosque in China was the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], built during the [[Tang Dynasty]] in the 8th century CE. Today there are over 39,000 mosques in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh |url=http://dzb.rmzxb.com/detail.aspx?id=352820 |title=Strengthen and promote the standardization of mosque management |publisher=[[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|CPPCC]] News |date=2014-12-18 |accessdate=2015-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222163343/http://dzb.rmzxb.com/detail.aspx?id=352820 |archivedate=2015-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25,000 of these are in [[Xinjiang]], a north-west [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language =zh|url=http://zqb.cyol.com/content/2009-07/17/content_2761116.htm|title=The amount of mosques in Xinjiang is increasing to near 25,000|publisher=Chinese Youth Daily|date=2009-07-17|accessdate=2015-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, mosques are called ''qīngzhēnsì'' ({{lang|zh|清真寺}}, "Pure truth temple"), a name which was also used by [[History of the Jews in China|Chinese Jews]] for [[synagogue]]s. Other names include ''huíhui táng'' ({{lang|zh|回回堂}}, "[[Hui people]]'s hall"), ''huíhui sì'' ({{lang|zh|回回寺}}, "Hui people's temple"), ''lǐbàisì'' ({{lang|zh|礼拜寺}}, "Temple of worship"), ''zhēnjiào sì'' ({{lang|zh|真教寺}}, "True teaching temple"), or ''qīngjìng sì'' ({{lang|zh|清净寺}}, "Pure and clean temple").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XULERYYEJo0C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=huihui+tang+mosque&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vfPRTdCHNsX10gHu1on5Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Islam in China|author=Shoujiang Mi, Jia You|year=2004|publisher=五洲传播出版社|location=|page=29|isbn=7-5085-0533-6|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wEMAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=mohammedan#v=onepage&amp;q=mohammedan%20temple%20arabic&amp;f=false|title=The Chinese repository, Volume 13|author=|year=1844|edition=|editor=|publisher=Printed for the proprietors|location=|page=31|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Qing Dynasty]], at the Mosque entrance of Hui Mosques, a tablet was placed upon which "''Huángdì wànsuì, wànsuì, wànwànsuì''" ({{lang|zh|皇帝萬歲，萬歲，萬萬歲}}) was inscribed, which means, "The Emperor, may he live forever". Wansui means [[Ten thousand years]], which means forever in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA290-IA1&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Broomhall 1910], p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Westerners traveling in China noted the presence of these tablets at mosques in [[Yunnan]] and [[Ningbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xX8jAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA33&amp;dq=happening+to+see+in+the+mosque,+threshold+as+you+enter+a+tablet+temple+inscription+the+emperor+may+he+live+for+ever+the+emperor+the+everliving&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vGnTTdn-I4zpgQfxqrEu&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=happening%20to%20see%20in%20the%20mosque%20threshold%20as%20you%20enter%20a%20tablet%20temple%20inscription%20the%20emperor%20may%20he%20live%20for%20ever%20the%20emperor%20the%20everliving&amp;f=false|title=The Chinese repository, Volumes 11-15|author=|year=1842|publisher=Printed for the proprietors.|location=|page=33|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;dq=ma+anliang&amp;q=wooden+tablet#v=onepage&amp;q=mosques%20tablets%20wishing%20the%20emperor%20long%20life%20prominent%20position%20entrance%20mosque&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=77|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mosques have certain aspects in common with each other however as with other regions Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture in its style. China is renowned for its beautiful mosques, which resemble temples. However, in western China the mosques resemble those of Iran and Central Asia, with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs, as well as the unique multi-layered portals. In northwest China where the Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] have built their mosques, there is a combination of eastern and western styles. The mosques have flared Buddhist style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and [[minaret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Aramco World, July/August 1985 , page 3035&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of architecture of Hui Mosques varies [[Muslim groups in China|according to their sect]]. The traditionalist [[Gedimu]] Hanafi Sunnis, influenced by Chinese culture, build Mosques which look like Chinese temples. The reformist modernist (but originally Wahhabi inspired) [[Yihewani]] build their Mosques to look like Middle Eastern Arab style Mosques.

'''Mangasar Magurditch Mangasarian''' (December 29, 1859 – June 26, 1943) was an [[United States|American]] [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Secularism|secularist]] of [[Armenia]]n descent.

== Biography ==

Born in Mashger (now within [[Turkey]]) in the [[Ottoman Empire]], he attended [[Robert College]] in [[Constantinople]], and was ordained as [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in [[Marsovan]] in 1878.  In about 1880 he enrolled at [[Princeton University]].  He was pastor at a [[Presbyterian]] church in Philadelphia from 1882 to 1885, when he resigned, becoming an independent preacher and a lecturer on "independent religion" in New York. In 1892 he became leader of the [[Ethical Culture Society]] of Chicago, a group established by [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]].   In 1900 he organized the [[Independent Religious Society of Chicago]], a [[rationalist]] group, of which he remained [[pastor]] until 1925.  He retired to [[Piedmont, California]], where he lived for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=atheists&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Mangasar Magurditch Mangasarian
 | work = American Atheists
 | url = http://www.atheists.org/Atheism/roots/mangasarian
 | accessdate =  2007-12-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life Mangasarian wrote a number of books. His most popular, including ''The Truth About Jesus — Is He a Myth?'' (1909) and ''The Bible Unveiled'' (1911), deal with the evidence against the existence of an historical [[Jesus]].  He also wrote hundreds of essays and lectures on questions of the times. His books and essays were translated into French, German, Spanish, and other foreign languages. The general subject of his writing was religious criticism and the philosophy of religion.

Mangasarian considered himself a Rationalist or a Secularist not an Atheist, since he considered atheism a non-verifiable belief system.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Mahabali''' ([[IAST]]: Mahābalī), or Great '''Bali''', also known as '''Māveli''', was a benevolent [[ Asura]] King in ancient [[Hindu mythology|Hindu antiquity]]. Mahabali was the great grandson of [[Hiranyakshipu]], the grand son of [[Prahlada]] and son of [[Virochana]]. After he failed to fulfill his promise to provide three paces of land for [[Vamana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Srimad Bhagavatam: Canto 8 - Chapter 21|url=http://bhagavata.org/canto8/chapter21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vamana sends Mahabali to live in netherworld for some period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/8/21/34|title=PrabhupadaBooks.com Srila Prabhupada's Original Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pleased by Mahabali's devotion, Vamana also blesses Bali to be the [[Indra]] during the period of the Manu known as Sāvarṇi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prabhupadabooks.com/sb/8/22/31|title=PrabhupadaBooks.com Srila Prabhupada's Original Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahabali was a beloved king and very kind. The time under his rule was considered one of great prosperity and happiness. It is in fact this success as a king that led the gods to be wary of him and bring his demise at the hands of [[Vamana]]. To appease his subjects who were distraught at his death, Mahabali is allowed to return to Earth once every year on the auspicious festival of [[Onam]] in kerala and in costal of Karnataka (Mangalore and Udupi)celebrating during festival of deepavali. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onamfestival.org/king-mahabali-onam.html|title=King Mahabali and Onam,Legend of King Mahabali,Story of King Mahabali|first=Siddhartha|last=Gupta|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12670">[[File:Hmongism, yeeb and yaj.svg|thumb|150px|''Yeeb'' and ''yaj'' symbol used by a Hmong American folk religious institution.]]
'''Miao folk religion''' or '''Hmong folk religion''' is the common [[ethnic religion]] of [[Miao people]]s, primarily consisting in the practice of ''ua dab'' ([[Hmongic languages|Hmongic]]: "worship of deities").&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The religion is also called '''Hmongism''' by a [[Hmong Americans|Hmong American]] church established in 2012 to organise it among Hmong people in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="TH-Bylaws"&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/4d2fcd_f09e3033c247cb316b7c7a26a34183d4.pdf Bylaws of the Temple of Hmongism]. Hmongism.org: published March 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a [[pantheism|pantheist]] theology,&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 59"&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; centered on worship of [[deity|deities]] and [[progenitor]]s of the Miao peoples. Throughout its history it has incorporated theoretical and ritual elements from [[Taoism]],&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and broader [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]], especially the emphasis on the pattern of the forces of the natural universe and the need of human life to be in accordance with these forces.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38"/&gt;

Most Hmong continue to practice the traditional religion, although many Hmong in [[Asia]] have converted to [[Buddhism]] or have mixed it with Buddhism,&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 38"/&gt; and many Hmong Americans and Hmong Australians have adopted [[Christianity]] or Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
===Deities and world===
The highest god of Hmong traditional religion is called ''Saub'' or ''Yawm Saub'',&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; who endows the [[shaman]]s with their abilities. The Saub god may be called in times of need and he can manifest in points of crisis throughout the course of history.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31"/&gt; The first shaman was ''Siv Yis'':&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Hmong shamans refer to themselves as "Siv Yis" when they are in [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]]. The gods of cosmic nature are simply called ''dab'', while ''dab neeb'' or ''qhua neeb'' are shamanic spirits that float through the worlds and work with the shamans operating within a specific sphere which is their domain.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The shamanic spirits include wild spirits of untamed nature and the tamed and friendly spirits of the house.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestral spirits (''Xwm Kab'') who reside in the world of the dead form another category,&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; though also involved in shamanic practice.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt;

The frog god ''Nplooj Lwg'' is considered the creator of humans. ''Ntxwj Nyug'' and ''Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem'' are the lords of the otherworld, determining life, death and [[reincarnation]] or rest in heaven. While ''Ntxwj Nyug'' is an indigenous deity, ''Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem'' is thought to derive from the [[Jade Lord]] of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 31"/&gt; Every house has an altar for the ''Dab Xwm Kab'' (god of good fortune).&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; ''Dab Pog'' is the goddess of babies.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; ''Zaj Laug'' is the "Old Dragon" or "[[Dragon King]]".&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt; ''Poj Ntxoog'' is a fearful female spirit associated with the tiger.&lt;ref&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yaj Yuam'' is an ancestral [[hero]], the "Heavenly Archer", corresponding to the Chinese [[Houyi]].&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt; Other gods are of nature, such as ''Xob'', the [[god of thunder]] and lightning, and ''Nkauj Hnub'' and ''Nraug Hlis'', "Lady Sun" and "Lord Moon".&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 30"/&gt; [[Chi You|Chiyou]] (or Txiv Yawg) is worshipped as an ancestral god of the Hmong nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmongism.org/#!hmong-history/c1i2c Chinese Odyssey: Summer Program Offers Students Rare Opportunity to Learn Hmong History in China]. Hmongism.org, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hmong house is a reflection of the [[cosmos]]. It is constructed around a central post (''ncej tas'') representing the [[world tree]], axis of the spirits, which god is ''Dab Ncej Tas''.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The roofs represent the heaven (the spiritual world) and the floor symbolises nature (the world of men). The axis of the building represents the male head of the household and his ancestral spirit, the ancestral unity.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"/&gt; Man is in the between of heaven and earth. The Hmong believe in various household spirits called ''dab nyeg'', meaning "tamed spirits", such as ''Dab Qhovcub'' (the god of the main hearth), ''Dab Qhovtxos'' (the god of the ritual hearth), ''Dab Nthab'' (the god of the loft), ''Dab Roog'' (the god of the framework of the front door).&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"/&gt; The ''Dab Txhiaj Meej'' is the god of wealth and richness.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 37"/&gt; Spirits of nature are called ''dab qus'', "wild spirits".

===Yeeb and Yaj===
"Yeeb and Yaj"&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; is the Hmong equivalent of the [[yin and yang]] found in [[Chinese traditional religion]] and [[Taoism]]. Differently from the context of Chinese thought, the Hmong "yeeb and yaj" is not represented by symbols such as the ''[[taijitu]]''. The concept represents the world of the living and the world of the gods: ''yeeb ceeb'' is the spiritual world, while ''yaj ceeb'' is the world of material nature.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; The Hmong also practice ''looj mem'', the Chinese [[feng shui]].&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

==Structure and practices==

===The shaman===
[[Shaman]] practice is called ''ua neeb'' (ua: "to heal through the, ''neeb: the spirit world", the ''dab neeb'' being specifically shamanic gods),&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; while the shaman is called ''txiv neeb'', meaning "father of the ''neeb''".

The position of a shaman is not inherited as shamans are chosen by the ''neeb'' class of gods, manifesting through trails experienced by those chosen. Chosen people are guided by elder shamans until they are able to perform the healing rituals themselves. A shaman has control on his spirits helpers.

In the spirit journey, the shaman calls on his helpers who are spirits to guide or assist him in the spirit world. He moves and sing on a spiritual horse (''nees'') represented in the living world by a shaman's bench (''rooj neeb'').&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt; He also calls on the forces of the [[cosmos]] to help him, such as the highest god ''Saub'', the First Couple, ''Pog Ntxoog'', Lady Sun and Lord Moon, the seven stars of the [[Pleiades]], and many animal spirits.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 25"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Divination horns (''kwam'') is one form or means of communication with the gods, and they are used in many rituals.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 26"/&gt;

The shamans perform two sessions of healing rituals: the diagnostic rituals (''ua neeb saib'') and subsequently the healing rituals (''ua neeb kho''), only if the patient shows no signs of recovery after the first ritual.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 27"&gt;Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===House altar===
The Hmong household altar is dedicated primarily to the ''Dab Xwm Kab'' (god of good fortune).&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; It is placed on the wall of the main room of the house.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; On the altar people make offerings of rice, chicken, soup and rice served in bamboo, with [[incense]] and joss paper.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; ''Txi dab'' is the general term for the sacrifice to the gods,&lt;ref&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; while ''laib dab'' is the ritual of sacrifice to the ancestors.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt; On the last day of the Old Year rice is offered to the ancestors, with a sacrificed chicken, and a soul-calling (''hu plig'') ritual is held.&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 36"/&gt;

The shaman's altar is a special hanging or standing altar, with two or three tiers depending on the status of the shaman.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"&gt;Tapp, 1989. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to represent Siv Yis' grotto near the top of the holy mountain, above a pool near of which grows the flower of immortality.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt; This pool is represented by a bowl of water placed upon the altar.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt; From the altar depart several cotton threads resulting attached to the central housepost, and it is along these threads that the ''neeb'' travel when they visit the altar.&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt;

A third type of Hmong altar is devoted to a special category of gods known as the ''dab tshuaj'', or gods of medicine, which are generally worshipped by women, since in Hmong culture they specialise in the knowledge of [[herbalism]].&lt;ref name="Tapp, 1989. p. 63"/&gt;

[[Joss paper]]s are a central element of Hmong altars. There are both joss paper used as offerings and decorative joss papers. The second ones are used as [[symbol]]s connecting with the gods, and they are usually composed of large white sheets, with smaller yellow or silver sheets, and sometimes little red squares.

===Rituals and psychology===
Miao religious rituals involving the worship of gods and ancestors are performed by the patriarch of each family or the spiritual leader of a clan or a cluster of male relatives.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; More difficult ceremonies such as soul-calling (''hu plig'') are performed by ritual experts the [[shaman]] (''txiv neeb'') for spiritual healing, and various experts in funeral rites like the reed pipe player (''txiv qeej''), the soul chanter (''nkauj plig'') and the blessing singers (''txiv xaiv'').&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; The soul is believed to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]].&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; The body (''cev'') is a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] believed to be constructed by a number of souls (''plig'' or ''ntsuj'') that mirror the [[macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]].&lt;ref name="Lee, Tapp, 2010. p. 27"/&gt;

Hmong religion includes specific rituals for the milestones of the life cycle: there are rituals for birth and baby naming, marriage, rename after marriage, trauma and sickness, extending the mandate of life for sick elderly, death and funeral.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; There are also festivals with corresponding ceremonies: the New Year (''Lwm Qaib'' or ''Ntoo Xeeb'', or also ''Noj Peb Caug'') in mid-November, ''Nyuj Dab'' (Ox Festival), ''Dab Roog'' (Door Festival) and ''Npua Tai'' (Pig Festival).&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''Padmanabh Shrivarma Jaini''' is an Indian born scholar of [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], currently living in [[Berkeley, California]], United States. He is from a [[Digambar]] Jain family; however he is equally familiar with both the Digambara and [[Svetambara]] forms of Jainism. He has taught at the [[Banaras Hindu University]], [[the School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS), the [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor and at the [[University of California]] at Berkeley, from which he retired in 1994. Professor Jaini is the author of several books and papers. His best known work is ''The Jaina Path of Purification'' (1979). Some of his major articles have been published under these titles: ''The Collected Papers on Jaina Studies'' (2000) and ''Collected Papers on Buddhist Studies'' (2001).

==Early life and education==
Jaini was born to a [[Digamabar Jain|Digambar Jain]] family residing in Nellikar, a small town near [[Moodabidri]], [[Karnataka]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Wiley | first =Kristi | title =The A to Z of Jainism | publisher =Vision Books (originally published by Scarecrow Press) | year =2006 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-7094-690-5 | oclc =422763446 }} p.103&lt;/ref&gt; His father had abandoned his title of Shetty and adopted the name of Jaini—after the famous Jain scholar,  Jugmandar Lal Jaini (1881-1927)—responding to calls within the community to change their names to foster a greater sense of Jain identity. After completing his elementary education, he was sent to Digambara Jain Gurukul, a boarding school in Vidharbha, Maharashtra. It was run on traditional Jain principles and here he came in contact with Jain scholars of his time like – Pandit [[Nathuram Premi]], Dr. Hiralal Jain, Dr. [[A.N. Upadhye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul | chapter = Foreword| title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =2000 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} pp. v–vi&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his secondary education here, he went to Arts College at Nashik where he took the degree of BA hons in 1947 in Sanskrit and Prakrit. During this time he supported himself by taking a job as a superintendent of a Jain Svetambara Hostel and thus coming in contact with the [[Svetambara]] community for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2000) p. vi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path to scholarship==
After graduation, he was invited to study with Pandit [[Sukhlal Sanghavi]], a renowned scholar belonging to the [[Sthanakvasi]] Jain tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Kristi (2006) p.103&lt;/ref&gt; His daily meeting with Sanghavi, involved not only a formal and rigorous instruction in Jain logic, but he was also exposed to Sanghavi's views on various sectarian debates and controversies. With Sukhlalji's encouragement he studied [[Pali canon]] and decided to continue his postgraduate studies in Sri Lanka, thus acquiring a thorough knowledge of Pali Canon and Buddhist scriptures. Here he became a Dharmananda Kosambi memorial Scholar and met Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]] (before his conversion to Buddhism) and was awarded Tripatakacarya degree in 1951 at the residence of the Prime Minister Senanayake. His years in Sri Lanka were the basis for his first publication in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], "Ceylonman Be Varsa" (Two years in [[Ceylon]]). It contains much information on the Theravada Buddhism philosophy and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2000) pp. vi–vii&lt;/ref&gt;

On returning he took up position as a lecturer in Ahmedabad and in 1952 he took up position as a lecturer in Pali in Benaras university. Subsequently he took up position as a lecturer in Pali and Sanskrit with SOAS, London from 1956 to 1957. There under [[John Borough]]'s supervision he completed his Ph.D. in Buddhist work, Abhidharmadipa. From there he travelled to Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand to collect various Buddhist manuscripts which he later edited and translated for [[Pali Text Society]]. Subsequently he moved to [[University of Michigan]] as professor of Indic Languages and Literature up to 1972. .Thereafter from 1972 to 1994 he served as a professor of Buddhist studies in Department of South and Southeast Asian studies, University of Berkeley, California.  After his retirement, he has continued as Professor Emeritus of the University.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2000) p.viii&lt;/ref&gt; The University has constituted "Padmanabh S. Jaini Graduate Student Award in Buddhist Studies" that supports high-achieving graduate students in Buddhist Studies at UC Berkeley and honors Professor Jaini's important legacy in the field of Buddhist studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ph.D. candidate Nancy Lin receives first Padmanabh S.

'''Padmaprabha''', also known as '''Padmaprabhu''',  was the sixth [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]] of the present age (''[[Avsarpini]]'').{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}} According to Jain beliefs, he became a [[siddha]] - a liberated soul which has destroyed all of its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].

In the Jain tradition, it is believed that Padmaprabha was born to King Shridhar and Queen Susimadevi in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]] at [[Kausambi]]{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}} which is in today's [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. Padmaprabha means ‘bright as a red lotus’ in [[Sanskrit]].It is said in Śvetāmbara sources that his mother had a fancy for a couch of red lotuses – padma – while he was in her womb.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/jina/padmaprabha.html&lt;/ref&gt;

His birth date was the twelfth day of the Kartik krishna month of the Indian calendar.{{cn|date=June 2016}} On the eleventh day of the dark half of the month of ''[[Margashirsh]]'', Bhagwan Padmaprabha, along with other 308 saints was liberated and attained [[moksha]] on Sammet Shikhar (mountain).

==Previous Births==
[[Maharaja]] Aparajit ruled over Susima town located in Dhatki realm in Purvavideh region in Vatsa country. He was a simple and religious person. He got detached after listening to the discourse of an [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]] and took ''[[diksha]]'' from ''[[Acharya]]'' Pihitashrava. As a result of long spiritual practices, he earned ''[[Tirthankar]]-nama-gotra-karma''. Completing his age, he reincarnated as a god in the Graiveyak realm.

== Biography as per Jain traditions ==
From the realm of gods, the being that was Aparajit descended into the womb of queen Susima, wife of the king of Kaushambi. One day, queen Susima had a desire to sleep on a bed made up of lotus flowers. As this was a desire of a pregnant mother, the gods made arrangements for its fulfillment. On ''[[Paksha#Krishna paksha|Krishna]]'' ''[[Dwadashi]]'' (twelfth day of the waning fortnight) of the month of ''[[Kartik (month)|Kartik]]'', the queen gave birth to a son. The new born had a soft pink glow like lotus flowers. The king named him as "''Padmaprabha''" (meaning one with lotus-like glow).

In due course, the prince became young and was married. When his father left for spiritual practices, Padmaprabh ascended the throne. After a long and successful reign, when through his threefold knowledge he knew that the right moment has come, he became an ascetic. After six months of spiritual practices, on the full moon day of the month of Chaitra he attained omniscience under a banyan tree. Propagating right religion for a long time, Bhagavan Padmaprabh wandered around and at last arrived at Sammetshikhar. He attained Nirvana on the eleventh day of the dark half of the month of Margshirsh.

==Association==
Padmaprabha is associated with Red Lotus emblem, Chatrabha tree,{{sfn|Krishna|Amirthalingam|2014|p=46}} Manovega (Dig.) &amp; Mangupta (Svet.) [[Yaksha]] and Syama Achyuta (Svet.) [[Yakshi]].{{sfn|Tandon|2002|p=44}}

A '''prayer blog''' is a [[blog]] where one blogs one's [[prayer]]s and only one's prayers, but not necessarily all of one's prayers. This activity is [[religion]] independent but does  particularly facilitate 'social prayers' and is not useful in the traditional prayer rituals of some religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keys to Prayer|url=http://www.goprayer.com/how-to-pray/keys-prayer/|publisher=www.goprayer.com|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Abrahamic religious traditions teach that prayer can be done spontaneously by any person at any moment. A prayer blog utilizes the more recent forms of human communication for this type of prayer. A prayer blog can be submitted by a variety of means, including text messaging, instant messaging, tweets, email, MP3 or blog entries. Prayer blogs can be either private or public, but they are usually not advertised by their authors to other people.

Religious ceremonies and rituals are directed by priests called ''duāngōng'' in Chinese. They are shamans who acquire their position through years of training with a teacher. ''Duāngōng'' are the custodians of Qiang theology, history and mythology. They also administer the [[coming of age]] ceremony for 18 year-old boys, called the "sitting on top of the mountain", which involves the boy's entire family going to mountain tops to sacrifice a sheep or cow, and to plant three cypress trees.&lt;ref name=Qiang2003/&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

Two of the most important religious holidays are the Qiang New Year, falling on the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar (though now it is fixed on October 1st), and the Mountain Sacrifice Festival, held between the second and the sixth month of the lunar calendar. The former festival is to give sacrifice to the God of Heaven, while the latter is dedicated to the god of mountains.&lt;ref name=Qiang2003/&gt;{{rp|14}}

The '''Sambas Treasure''' is a hoard of ancient gold and silver buddhist sculptures found near the town of [[Sambas (town)|Sambas]] in west [[Borneo]] that now form part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=136665&amp;peoA=136665-3-7 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dating from 8th-9th centuries AD, they pre-date the coming of Islam to the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago by four centuries and were probably made in [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-asia/southeast-asia/maritime-se-asia/a/a-cache-of-buddhist-figures-from-the-sambas-treasure "A Cache of Buddhist figures from the Sambas Treasure"] Khan Academy. Retrieved 2017-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Buddhism in Southeast Asia==
Until [[Islam]] became the dominant religion in Indonesia in the 13th Century, both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were adopted from the India subcontinent as the principal local religions. Over time, many  buddhist sculptures were transported to the islands by pilgrims returning from holy sites in eastern India.  These in turn inspired local craftsmen who developed their own styles and traits. The buddhist sculptures from Sambas Treasure was almost certainly made in Java based on artistic models that were developed in eastern [[India]] centuries before.

==Discovery and ownership==
The Sambas Treasure was found in a large earthenware pot on the south-west coast of Borneo sometime during the 1940s. It was then owned by the collector Tan Yeok Seong, a [[Singaporean]] historian of [[Southeast Asia]] and a collector of historical artefacts. The treasure was subsequently bought by the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, who donated it to the British Museum in 1956.

==Description==
The hoard is composed of nine gold and silver [[buddha]] and [[bodhisattva]] images. The largest figure is approximately 18&amp;nbsp;cm high and represents a standing Buddha made of sold silver. In addition to the Buddhist sculptures, the treasure includes a bronze [[incense burner]] in the shape of a house and a silver votive plaque with text in [[dhāraṇī]], which was found in the base of the large Buddha figure. The high quality of the craftsmanship and the use of precious metals such as gold and silver suggest they were originally made for an important local dignitary or patron.

'''Sesenebnef''' was an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian ''chief [[lector priest]]'' of the [[Thirteenth dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]], around 1750 BC. He is mainly known from his tomb at [[el-Lisht]] which was excavated around 1900. The tomb was found looted but still contained the remains of two wooden coffins, one placed inside the other. The remains of the coffins were found in a poor state of preservation. Therefore, the inscriptions on the coffin were copied and the coffins were left on the site. These texts belong to the longest [[religious text]]s of the late [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;J. P.

'''Setepenre''' or '''Sotepenre)''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian princess of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]; sixth and last daughter of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] and his chief queen [[Nefertiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{dodson}}, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Setepenre (her name means “Chosen of [[Ra|Re]]”) was born around the 9th&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce. Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen. Penguin. 1998. {{ISBN|0-670-86998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 11th year of her father [[Akhenaten]] in the city of [[Akhetaten]].&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt ,Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), {{ISBN|0-500-27621-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had five older sisters named [[Meritaten]], [[Meketaten]], [[Ankhesenpaaten]], [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]], and [[Neferneferure]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2004. {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
One of the earliest depictions of Setepenre is in a fresco from the King’s House in Amarna. She is depicted sitting on her mother [[Nefertiti]]'s lap. The fresco is much damaged and only a small hand of Setepenre remains The fresco is dated to ca. year 9 of [[Akhenaten]], and the entire family is depicted.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt;

The next time the six princesses appeared together was in Year 12, on the eighth day of the second month of winter, during the so-called “reception of foreign tributes”. This event was depicted in the Amarna tombs of [[Meryre II]] and [[Huya (Noble)|Huya]]. In the tomb of Meryre II, [[Akhenaten]] and [[Nefertiti]] are shown seated in a kiosk, receiving tribute from foreign lands. The daughters of the royal couple are shown standing behind their parents. Setepenre is the last daughter in the lower register. She is standing right behind her sister Neferneferure, who is holding a gazelle. Setepenre is shown reaching over to pet the gazelle.&lt;ref name="Murnane"&gt;Murnane, William J., Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt, Society of Biblical Literature, 1995 {{ISBN|1-55540-966-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
On Wall C in Room &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Royal Tomb of Akhenaten]] the names of five princesses are listed, that of [[Neferneferure]] is plastered over and only four of the princesses are depicted. This probably means that Setepenre predeceased Neferneferure, and it is likely that Setepenre died around Year 13 or 14, before she reached her sixth birthday. Since she is not shown on Wall B in Room &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, where the royal family mourns the death of the second princess [[Meketaten]], it is likely that she predeceased Meketaten as well, perhaps before the construction of the royal tomb was advanced enough to allow burial. She was possibly the first of the princesses to die.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt; It is possible that her body was later moved to Room &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Royal Tomb of Akhenaten|Royal Tomb]].&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;

'''Tenri Hospital''' (天理よろづ相談所病院 ''Tenri Yorozu Sōdanjo Byōin'') is an international hospital in [[Tenri City]], [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. 

[[File:Tenri Hospital 01.JPG|thumb|260px|left|Tenri Hospital]]
It was founded as part of the secular mission of [[Tenrikyo]]. In a [[Health care in Japan|nation where medical care]] is often highly specialized and cross-specialist treatment can be difficult, Tenri Hospital founded and developed the first department of general medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Hayasaki, T. M.D. and S. Koizumi, M.D. [http://www.jicef.or.jp/wahec/ful407.htm History and Current Condition of General Medicine in Japan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014123811/http://www.jicef.or.jp/wahec/ful407.htm |date=2007-10-14 }} Saga Medical School&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of Tenrikyo's [[oyasato-yakata]] complex surrounding the Jiba, and it is built in the same syncretic style as the rest of the complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">'''Tenshō Kōtai Jingūkyō''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] {{lang|ja|天照皇大神宮教}}) is a Japanese [[new religious movement]] which emerged from [[Shintoism]]. It was established by [[Sayo Kitamura]] ({{lang|ja|北村 サヨ}}) (1900–1967), with activities beginning in 1945. The movement consisted of 450,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/glossary/def_T.html|title=Glossary of Shinto Names and Terms: T|website=www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its headquarters are in [[Tabuse]] ({{lang|ja|田布施町}}, ''Tabuse-chō''), a town in the district of [[Kumage District, Yamaguchi|Kumage District]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture|Yamaguchi]], [[Japan]].

Followers practice a dance called ''muga no mai'' ({{lang|ja|無我の舞}}, "Dance of the non-self" or "Dance of the non-ego"), which is why the religion is called the "dancing religion" ({{lang|ja|踊る宗教}}, ''Odoru shūkyō'').

This concept is not clearly enunciated in the written [[Torah]], but was accepted by the [[Talmud]] as being a Biblical mandate. It is linked in the Talmud from the Biblical law requiring people to assist in unloading burdens from animals ({{Bibleref2|Exodus 23:5}}).&lt;ref&gt;Bava Metzia 32b&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literal meaning==
''Tza'ar'' is an (ancient) Hebrew word for "suffering" and is used in this context with the meaning of "suffering that does not advance some legitimate human good", according to The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Ethics and Morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Ethics and Morality |editor1= Elliot N.

==Slaughter==
In traditional Jewish law, kosher animals may be eaten if they're killed using the slaughter method known as [[shechitah]], where the animal is killed by having its throat cut swiftly using an extremely sharp and specially designed knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thekosheromnivoresquest.com/blog/deconstructing-kosher-slaughter-part-2-the-basics|title=Deconstructing Kosher Slaughter Part 2: The Basics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many rabbis assert that these regulations were put in place to reduce tza'ar ba'alei chayim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/51171|title=צער בעלי חיים בהלכה ובאגדה|last=אשכולי|first=יצחק נחמן|publisher=אופקים|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to ensure that the animal has the easiest possible death.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed, III:48&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the kosher knives as well as regulation relating to how the cut is made have been seen to greatly reduce or completely eliminate reaction from the kosher cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html|title=Religious slaughter and animal welfare: a discussion for meat scientists.|last=Grandin and Rogenstein|first=|date=1994|website=www.grandin.com|at=Reactions to the throat cut|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even modern day scientists that are critical of shechita agree that it greatly improved welfare at slaughter in historical periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Adams &amp; Sheridan |first= |date=2008 |title= specifying the risks to animal welfare associated with livestock slaughter without induced insensibility |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238762225_Specifying_the_Risks_to_Animal_Welfare_Associated_with_Livestock_Slaughter_without_Induced_Insensibility |journal= Prepared as a contribution from the Animal Welfare Branch, Product Integrity Animal and Plant Health Division, Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for the Animal Welfare Working Group of the Animal Health Committee, Primary Industries Standing Committee of Australia |volume= |pages=vii - 3. historical aspects}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, there is disagreement as to shechita's effectivity when compared to modern day slaughter methods, with some scientific experts in favor of the humanness of shechita&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html|title=Religious slaughter and animal welfare:a discussion for meat scientists.|website=www.grandin.com|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/reform-of-kosher-and-halal-slaughter-practices|title=Top vet calls for reform of kosher and halal slaughter practices|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|date=2014-03-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]'s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards banned the common slaughter method of "shackling and hoisting" (pulling a conscious animal into the air with a chain before slaughter). Rabbis [[Joel Roth]] and [[Elliot Dorff]] wrote a [[responsum]] on this topic which concluded that shackling and hoisting "unquestionably constitutes a violation of Jewish laws that forbid us to cause undue pain to animals."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/dorffroth_shackling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
===Magen Tzedek===
Enforcing a commitment to tza'ar ba'alei chayim in food production has been part of the effort of [[Conservative Judaism]]'s [[Magen Tzedek]] commission, formerly known as Hekshher Tzedek. The [[Magen Tzedek]] commission sees compliance with the [[Humane Farm Animal Care]] Standards (HFAC) as sufficiently preventing unnecessary suffering to animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/hekhsher%20tzedek/Hekhsher%20Tzedek%20Policy%20Statement%20and%20Working%20Guidelines_PUBLIC%20VERSION_draft2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Amid disputed claims of Orthodox opposition&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/176814/magen-tzedek-ethical-kosher-seal-stalled-amid-orth/]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Magen Tzedek]] commission has not been successful in recruiting any food producers into its certification program.

===The Jewish Initiative For Animals (JIFA)===
[http://jewishinitiativeforanimals.org/ The Jewish Initiative For Animals] supports innovative programs that seek to turn the Jewish value of tza'ar ba'alei chayim into action and build Jewish American communities in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishinitiativeforanimals.org/about-us/mission/|title=Mission - Jewish Initiative for Animals|work=Jewish Initiative for Animals|access-date=2017-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 JIFA partnered with kosher meat distributors [http://www.kolfoods.com/kosher-products/85-heritage-chicken/ KOL Foods] and [https://www.growandbehold.com/index.php?page=Heritage Grow and Behold] to bring the a run of kosher certified [https://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/heritage-chicken heritage breed] chickens to market for the first time in approximately 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishinitiativeforanimals.org/2016/11/15/return-heritage-kosher-chicken/|title=The Return of Heritage Kosher Chicken|date=2016-11-15|website=Jewish Initiative for Animals|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritage breed chickens and turkeys are able to achieve highest possible welfare outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://buyingpoultry.com/blog/heritage|title=BuyingPoultry.com - Products that match your values|website=BuyingPoultry.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the renewed availability of heritage chicken to kosher consumer has helped expand values of tza'ar ba'alei chayim within the modern kosher meat industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newfoodeconomy.com/you-can-finally-buy-ethical-heritage-and-kosher-meat-but-its-going-to-cost-you/|title=But is it kosher?|date=2017-06-08|work=New Food Economy|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; JIFA has also sought to spread the values of tza'ar ba'alei chayim into the Jewish world through its Ark Project, a service-learning curriculum for [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|b’nai mitzvah]]. This curriculum seeks to engages with Jewish teaching and real life problems about topics such as homeless animals, animals used in entertainment, farmed animal welfare, conservation of wildlife and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishinitiativeforanimals.org/2016/12/02/raising-new-generation-jewish-animal-advocates/|title=Raising a New Generation of Jewish Animal Advocates|date=2016-12-02|website=Jewish Initiative for Animals|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute===
[http://www.shamayimvaretz.org/ The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute] is a Jewish animal protection group that educates leaders, trains advocates, and leads campaigns for the humane treatment of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shamayimvaretz.org/|title=The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute {{!}} מכון שמים וארץ|website=The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute {{!}} מכון שמים וארץ|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamyim V'Aretz is led by activist rabbi [[Shmuly Yanklowitz]] and has run campaigns which seek to end: kosher certification of [[veal]], the controversial practice of [[kapparot]], and the  kosher certifying of cattle that are killed using [http://forward.com/news/12666/shackle-and-hoist-kosher-slaughter-comes-under-01274/ shackle and hoist] techniques.

==Animal research==
According to the [[Shulkhan Aruch]], "anything that is necessary for medical purposes, or for anything else, is exempt from the prohibition of causing suffering to animals" (Even ha-Ezer 5:14).

Most Jewish authorities allow medical research if it will help people in need, and if the animals do not undergo any unnecessary suffering. Reform Judaism's [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], for example, affirms that animal research is permissible if it will save human lives, so long as animals are subjected to little pain and not used in "frivolous" experiments such as cosmetic testing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanesociety.org/about/departments/faith/facts/statements/reform_judaism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Noachide Code==
A concern for suffering caused to animals is found in Judaism's [[Seven Laws of Noah]], which apply to all humankind. One of the seven laws, ''ever min ha chai,'' prohibits eating the flesh of live animals. This law is derived from the [[Book of Genesis]] ({{Bibleref2|Genesis 9:4}}), as interpreted in the [[Talmud]] ([[Sanhedrin]] 59a).

==In Jewish lore==
Compassion for animals is declared to have been the merit of [[Moses]], which made him the shepherd of his people,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus Rabbah 2&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Judah ha-Nasi]] saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112279/jewish/Rabbi-Judah-the-Prince.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other areas of concern for animals in Jewish law==
Resting on the Sabbath also meant providing rest for the working animals, and people are instructed to feed their animals before they sit down to eat.&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud, Tractate Gittin, Page 62A&lt;/ref&gt;

At harvest time, the working animals must not be muzzled, so that they can eat of the harvest as they work.&lt;ref&gt;Deut. 25:4.  See http://www.jewfaq.org/animals.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A prohibition against using two different kinds of animals teamed together, such as ploughing or doing other work, is derived from the [[Torah]] in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:10|HE}} and the [[Mishnah]] in [[Kil'ayim (Talmud)|tractate Kila'yim]] elaborates upon this prohibition. The underlying concern is for the welfare of the animals, particularly the weaker of the pair.&lt;ref name=EJ2&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Wald |first= Stephen |editor1-last= Skolnik |editor1-first= Fred |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Judaica |volume= |page= |title= Kilayim |year=2007 |edition= 2nd |publisher= Macmillan Reference |location= Detroit, MI. |isbn=978-002-865-928-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SoncinoKilayim&gt;{{cite book |last1= Israelstam |first1=I.|editor1-first=I. |editor1-last=Epstein |editor1-link= Isadore Epstein |others= |title= The Talmud |type= |volume= Zeraim vol.

'''Vajrasattva''' (Sanskrit: वज्रसत्त्व, Tibetan: རྡོ་རྗེ་སེམས་དཔའ། Dorje Sempa, short form is རྡོར་སེམས། Dorsem, Монгол: Доржсэмбэ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/rdo_rje_sems_dpa%27 |title=Rangjung Yeshe Dictionary Page |publisher=Rywiki.tsadra.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bodhisattva]]  in the [[Mahayana]], [[Mantrayana]]/[[Vajrayana]] Buddhist traditions. In the Japanese Vajrayana school of Buddhism, [[Shingon]], Vajrasattva is the esoteric aspect of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Samantabhadra]] and is commonly associated with the student practitioner who through the master's teachings, attains an ever-enriching subtle and rarefied grounding in their esoteric practice. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] Vajrasattva is associated with the [[sambhogakāya]] and purification practice.

Vajrasattva appears principally in two Buddhists texts: the ''[[Mahavairocana Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Vajrasekhara Sutra]]''.  In the [[Diamond Realm]] Mandala, Vajrasattva sits to the East near [[Akshobhya]] Buddha.

In some esoteric lineages, [[Nagarjuna]] was said to have met Vajrasattva in an iron tower in South India, and was taught [[tantra]], thus transmitting the esoteric teachings to more historical figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages = 131–133, 198, 221, 222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mantra]] =  । ॐ वज्रसत्त्व हूं॥ 
oṁ vajrasattva hūṁ

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
''Vajrasattva''' ({{lang-bo|Dorje Sempa, short form dorsem}}, {{lang-ja|Kongōsatta}}, {{zh|金剛薩埵  Jīn gāng sà duǒ}}) is a [[bodhisattva]] in the [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] buddhist traditions.  Vajrasattva's name translates to ''Diamond Being'' or ''Thunderbolt Being'', or, more appropriately considering that the term "vajra" often functions as a marker for tantric Buddhism, ''the Tantric Buddhist Being''.

==Newar Buddhism==
Vajrasattva is an important figure in the tantric Buddhism of the Newar Vajrācāryas of the Kathmandu Valley.  He represents the ideal guru, and he is frequently invoked in the ''guru maṇḍala'', the foundational ritual for all other Newar Buddhist rituals and the daily pūjā for Newar priests.  The śatākṣara (100 syllable prayer to Vajrasattva) is memorized early in life by most practicing Newar Buddhists.

==Shingon Buddhism==
[[File:Vajrasattva mantra 1310AD.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Vajrasattva seated on a lotus. [[Japan]], 14th century CE]]

In the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon Buddhist]] lineage, Vajrasattva is traditionally viewed as the second patriarch, the first being [[Vairocana]] Buddha himself.  According to [[Kukai]]'s writings in ''Record of the Dharma Transmission'' he relates a story based on [[Amoghavajra]]'s account that [[Nagarjuna]] met Vajrasattva in an iron tower in southern [[India]].  Vajrasattva initiated Nagarjuna into the [[abhiseka]] ritual and entrusted him with the esoteric he had learned from [[Vairocana]] Buddha, as depicted in the [[Mahavairocana Sutra]].  Kukai does not elaborate further on Vajrasattva or his origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Vajrasattva is an important figure in two esoteric Buddhist sutras, the [[Mahavairocana Sutra]] and the [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]].  In the first chapter of the [[Mahavairocana Sutra]], Vajrasattva leads a host of beings who visit [[Vairocana]] Buddha to learn the [[Dharma]].  Vajrasattva inquires about the cause, goal and foundation of all-embracing wisdom, which leads to a philosophical discourse by the Buddha.  The audience cannot comprehend the teaching, so the Buddha demonstrates through the use [[mandala]].  Vajrasattva then questions why rituals and objects are needed if the truth is beyond form.  Vairocana Buddha replies to Vajrasattva that these are expedient means to bring practitioners to experience awakening more readily, and so on.  In [[Shingon]] Buddhist rituals for initiation, the ''kechien kanjō'', the initiate re-enacts the role of Vajrasattva and recites [[mantra]] and dialogue from the sutras above. The Maha Acharya enacts the role of Mahavairocana Buddha bestowing wisdom upon the student.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Tibetan Buddhism==
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the Vajrasattva root tantra is ''Dorje Gyan'', or "Vajra Ornament".&lt;ref&gt;Becoming Vajrasattva, 2nd Edition: The Tantric Path of Purification (2004) by Lama Yeshe, {{ISBN|978-0-86171-389-9}}, Wisdom Publications.p.X&lt;/ref&gt; Vajrasattva practices are common to all of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism and are used both to purify obscurations so that the [[Vajrayana]] student can progress beyond [[Ngondro]] practices to the various [[yoga]] practices of [[tantra]] and also to purify any broken [[samaya]] vows after [[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|initiation]]. As such, Vajrasattva practice is an essential element of Tibetan Buddhist practice.

In addition to personal practice, the Vajrasattva mantra is regarded as having the ability to purify [[karma]], bring peace, and cause enlightened activity in general. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the [[United States]], The [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] announced a project, Prayer 4 Peace, to accumulate one billion six [[syllable]] Vajrasattva recitations by practitioners around the world. The six syllable mantra ([[Om|oṁ]] vajrasattva hūṁ ), is a less formal version of the one hundred syllable mantra on which it is based but contains the essential spiritual points of the longer mantra, according to [[lama]] and [[tulku]] [[Jamgon Kongtrul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prayer4peace.net/ |title=Welcome |publisher=Prayer4Peace.net |date=2001-12-11 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hundred Syllable Mantra===
In Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhist practice, Vajrasattva is used in the [[Ngondro]], or preliminary practices, in order to ''purify'' the mind's defilements, prior to undertaking more advanced [[tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric techniques]]. The ''yik gya'', the "Hundred Syllable Mantra" ({{bo|t=ཡིག་བརྒྱ|w=yig brgya}}) supplication of Vajrasattva, approaches universality in the various elementary Ngondro [[sadhana]] for [[sadhaka]]s of all Mantrayana and [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] schools bar the Bonpo. The pronunciation and orthography differ between lineages.

====Longchen Nyingtig====
The evocation of the Hundred Syllable Vajrasattva Mantra in the [[Vajrayana]] lineage of [[Jigme Lingpa]]'s (1729–1798) [[ngondro]] from the'' [[Longchen Nyingtig]]'' displays Sanskrit-Tibetan hybridization. Such textual and dialectical ''[[diglossia]]'' (Sanskrit: dvaibhashika) is evident from the earliest transmission of tantra into the region, where the original Sanskrit phonemes and lexical items are often orthographically rendered in the Tibetan, rather than the comparable indigenous terms (Davidson, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. (2002). ''Indian esoteric Buddhism: a social history of the Tantric movement.'' Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-12618-2}} (cloth)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Jigme Lingpa did not ''compose'' the Hundred Syllable Mantra, his scribal style bears a marked similarity to it as evidenced by his biographies (Gyatso, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Janet  (1998). ''Apparitions of the Self: The Secret Autobiographies of a Tibetan Visionary; a Translation and Study of Jigme Lingpa's 'Dancing Moon in the Water' and 'Ḍākki's Grand Secret-Talk'. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01110-9}} (cloth: alk. paper)''&lt;/ref&gt; Jigme Lingpa as ''[[pandit]]'', which in the Himalayan context denotes an indigenous Tibetan versed in Sanskrit, often wrote in a hybridized Sanskrit-Tibetan diglossia.

====Dzogchen====
"[[The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva]]" ({{bo|t=རྡོ་རྗེ་སེམས་དཔའ་སྙིང་གི་མེ་ལོང|w=rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long}}) is one of the [[Seventeen Tantras]] of [[Dzogchen]] [[Upadesha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rigpa Shedra |date=October 2009 |title= ''Seventeen Tantras |url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Seventeen_Tantras |accessdate= April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samantabhadra discourses to Vajrasattva and in turn Vajrasattva asks questions of Samantabhadra in clarification in the [[Kulayaraja Tantra]] (Wyl. kun byed rgyal po; Tib. künjé gyalpo) or "The All-Creating King Tantra", the main tantra of the Mind Series of Dzogchen.&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Neumaier-Dargyay, ''The Sovereign All-Creating Mind: The Motherly Buddha'', Albany, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consorts===
Vajrasattva is often depicted with various consorts, the peaceful one Vajragarvi aka Vajrasattvātmikā (Tib. ''Dorje Nyema''), Dharmadhatvishvari, Ghantapani ("Bell Bearer"), the [[wrathful]] one Diptacakra, Vajratopa, Vajrabhrikuti, and others.

The '''Wadiyar''' (alternatively spelt '''Wodeyer''' or '''Odeyer''') dynasty  was a [[Hindu]] [[Yadav]] dynasty in [[Indian people|Indian]] subcontinent that ruled the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] from 1399 to 1950, with a brief interruption in the late 1700s.  The kingdom was incorporated into the [[Dominion of India]] after its independence from British rule. The Wodiyar dynasty is the Yadav royal family from Mysore.

==Name==
'''Wadiyar'''

==History==
Historions say that they came to [[Karnataka]] from the northern territory near Himalayas and on seeing the natural beauty of the place made [[Mysore]] their abode.&lt;ref name="My Life, My Profession"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lURcCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=Wadiyar+yadava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oQZHVZjMMYKxuQT_oYH4CQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Wadiyar%20yadava&amp;f=false | title=My Life, My Profession | publisher=Lulu Press, Inc | author=H S Gururaja Rao | year=2014 | isbn=9781483410654}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty was established in 1399 by [[Yaduraya Wodeyar]]. He ruled [[Mysore]] under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] until 1423. After Yaduraya Wodeyar, the Mysore kingdom was succeeded by the Wadiyar rulers. The kingdom remained fairly small during this early period and was a part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, the Kingdom of Mysore became independent and remained so until 1799.

During the reign of [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]] (1799–1868), the region came under the control of the [[British Empire]]. His successors changed the English spelling of their royal name to Wadiyar and took the title of ''Bahadur''. The last two monarchs of the dynasty, [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV]] and [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], also accepted the British decoration [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Grand Cross of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]].

==Expansion==
The Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated in 1565. The power vacuum created soon after was exploited by Raja Wadiyar (ruled 1578–1617). He expanded the borders of the Mysore kingdom and in 1610 changed the capital city from Mysore to Srirangapatna; a rare island formed by the river [[Kaveri]], which provided natural protection against military attacks.

Later famous rulers of the dynasty included [[Kanthirava Narasaraja I]] (ruled 1638–1659), who expanded the frontiers of the Mysore kingdom to Trichy in Tamil Nadu. The dynasty reached its peak under [[Chikka Devaraja]] (ruled 1673–1704), who reformed the administration of the empire by dividing it into 18 departments (called Chavadis) and he also introduced a coherent system of taxation.

From 1760 to 1799, the rule of the dynasty was essentially nominal, with real power in the hands of the ''dalwai'', or commanders-in-chief, [[Hyder Ali]] and his son [[Tipu Sultan]], who expanded the kingdom aggressively, but clashed with the [[British East India Company]]. After Tipu Sultan was killed by the British in the [[Battle of Srirangapatna]] in 1799, the Wadiyars were restored to a reduced kingdom.

==British Rule==

After restoring the Wadiyars to the throne of Mysore, the British shifted the capital back to the city of Mysore from [[Srirangapatna]]. The four-year-old boy (Mummudi) Krishna Raja Wadiyar III, son of the last Wadiyar king, Khasa Chamaraja Wadiyar VIII, was anointed as the King of Mysore. Wadiyars were now subsidiaries of the British Raj and had to pay an annual subsidy to the British. However the British took over the administration of the kingdom on a specious plea of non-payment of the subsidy by Mummudi Krishna Raja Wadiyar in 1831, and British-appointed commissioners were then in charge of the kingdom.

British commissioners administered Mysore from 1831–1881. [[Mark Cubbon]] (1834–1861) and [[L. B. Bowring]] (1861–1870) are among the well-known commissioners of the period.

In 1868, the British Parliament heeded the king's plea and decided to restore the kingdom to his adopted son Chamaraja Wadiyar IX. In 1881, the transfer of power back to the Wadiyars heralded an important phase in the making of modern Mysore. For the first time in India, democratic experiments were introduced by the establishment of a representative assembly. The next king, Nalvadi Krishna Raja Wadiyar, earned great fame as a saintly King-Rajarishi, and his kingdom was hailed as Ramarajya by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] as an ideal kingdom comparable to the one ruled by the historical hero [[Lord Rama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Under British hegemony, the Wadiyars, freed from security concerns, shifted their attention to the patronage of the fine arts. They made Mysore a cultural center of Karnataka, fostering a number of famous musicians, writers and painters.

The last king of the Wadiyar dynasty was [[Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar]], who ruled from 1940 until Indian independence from British rule. In the year 1947, after India attained independence, he ceded his kingdom to the Dominion of India, but continued as the Maharajah until India became a Republic in 1950. He became the Raja Pramukh—a constitutional position—as the head of Mysore State in the Republic of India from 1950–1956. After the reorganization of the Indian states on a linguistic basis, he was appointed Governor of the integrated Mysore State (present Karnataka State) in 1956 and held the post until 1964.

Then he was Governor of Madras state (now [[Tamil Nadu]]) for two years. The Indian Constitution continued to recognize him as the Maharajah of Mysore, until 1971, when [[Indira Gandhi|Mrs. Indira Gandhi]], then Prime Minister of India, abolished the titles and Privy Purse of over 560 Maharajahs. The Maharajah died in 1974. His only son, Srikanta Datta Narasimha Raja Wadiyar (1953–2013), was a member of the Indian Parliament for many years.

== Curse on Wadiyars ==

A curse was believed to be cast on the Wadiyars in 1612 by Alamelamma, wife of King Tirumalaraja, who ruled the [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. It is believed that when her jewels were being taken under the orders of the Wodeyar ruler, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river and cursed before jumping to death — "Talakadu MaraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysooru Arasarige Makkalaagadirali" (May [[Talakadu]] become a barren land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool and may Mysore kings never beget children). 400 years since, the Wadiyar dynasty never had any children for alternate generations. Hence the adopted child becomes the king. Even till date, most parts of Talakadu (Talakad) lie under sand, and Malangi village in present Mysore district is slowly eroding due to whirlpools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Four hundred-year-old 'curse' returns to haunt Wadiyar royals with death of last heir |work= Daily Mail | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2522109/Four-year-old-curse-returns-haunt-Wadiyar-royals-death-heir.html |author= Vanu Dev|date=11 December 2013|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Does Alamelamma's curse continue to haunt Wadiyars? | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/373910/does-alamelamma039s-curse-continue-haunt.html |work=Deccan Herald|date=10 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 400-year-old curse haunts Wodeyar royals of erstwhile princely state of Mysore|work=India Today | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/wadiyar-royals-mysore-vijayanagara-empire-tirumalaraja-alamelamma-talakadu/1/330702.html |date=12 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cleanup section|reason=Needs to be rewritten|date=July 2013}}

The Mysore kingdom, founded by Yaduraya in the year 1399, consisted of only the areas surrounding the present Mysore City. The original fort was supposed to have been at a place known as haDadana — now a small village on the southern side of [[Chamundi Hill]]. The Wadiyars, like others at that time, were under the [[suzerainty]] of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Viceroy of the Vijayanagar kingdom was headquartered at [[Srirangapatna]]. Under Yaduraya, the Wadiyars increased their influence and territory over the next 200 years. Raja Wadiyar, the ninth ruler of the dynasty, was  known for his valour and patronage of art and culture. He ruled from 1578 to 1617. In 1610, he conquered the fort of Srirangapatna from Tirumala, then Viceroy of Vijayanagar. Tirumala is said to have retired to Talakad with his two wives. One of them, Alamelamma, was a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki, the consort of Sri Ranganatha, the presiding deity of the famous Adi-Ranga temple in the island fortress of [[Srirangapatna]].

Tirumala suffered from a terminal disease on his back known as the "disease of the kings". The condition of Tirumala deteriorated and he died. Alamelamma had a large amount of precious jewellery, including a fine nose ring studded with a large pearl. As a widow she was no longer permitted jewellery. She donated the jewels to the temple of Sri Ranganayaki. Every Friday and Tuesday Sri Ranaganayaki was decorated with a large pearl-studded nose ring and other precious jewellery, which was put into the safe custody of Alamelamma the rest of the week, since she was known to be a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki.

The temple authorities requested Raja Wadiyar to give them the custody of the jewels, as was the normal practice. The treasury officials informed the king of this fact. Raja Wadiyar thought these jewels were of no value to Alamelamma, as she was now a widow and didn't have children, she would no longer need them. Raja Wadiyar sent emissaries to Malangi, where Alamelamma was staying, with a request to return the jewels. Only the pearl-studded nose ring was returned by Alamelamma. Raja Wadiyar then sent his army to Talakad to ask her once again and, if she refused, to seize them by force. To escape the wrath of the Mysore army, Alamelamma uttered the legendary curse on Raja Wadiyar and jumped into a whirlpool in the river Kaveri at Talakadu with the rest of the jewels and escaped unscathed. The curse, as passed down in folklore over the last 400 years, is:

{{cquote|ತಲಕಾಡು ಮರಳಾಗಲಿ, ಮಾಲಂಗಿ ಮಡುವಾಗಲಿ, ಮೈಸೂರು ದೊರೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಹೋಗಲಿ}}
{{cquote|Talakadu maraLagali, Malangi Maduvagali, Mysuru Doregalige Makkallilade Hogali}}
{{cquote|May Talakad turn into (a barren expanse of) sand, may Malangi turn into a whirlpool, may the Rajas of Mysore not have children (for all time to come).}}

Hearing of this extreme step taken by Alamelamma, Raja Wadiyar was truly repentant. He wanted to return the jewellery to the temple and not confiscate it for his own use. In his grief he had an idol of Alamelamma made in gold, installed it in the palace, and worshiped it as a deity. A remnant of her hair was preserved in a box. To this day, Alamelamma’s idol can be found inside the Mysore Palace and is worshiped by the royal family. One can see the same huge pearl nose-stud adorning the Goddess Ranganayaki and Alamelamma today.

The Dasara festivities inside the palace end on the evening of Navarathri with a formal pooja to Alamelamma, and the kankana worn by the royal couple is removed thereafter paving the way for the Vijaya Dashami – Sami pooja the next day. For these nine days the royal couple are required to stay inside the precincts of the palace. Another interesting part of the story is that this Alamelamma temple is under the care of the legal heirs of Alamelamma: They live inside the Mysore Palace fort. Strangely, these priests/caretakers appear to be cursed, and they do not beget children and follow the same pattern afflicting the Wodeyars.

==The Curse from the Time of Raja Wadiyar==

After shifting to Srirangapatna, Raja Wadiyar is credited with holding the famous Dasara festivities for the first time in 1610. His only surviving son, Narasaraja Wadiyar, died (believed to be an effect of the curse in folklore) just a day before the commencement of Navaratri, but the king after consulting experts laid down the rule that the celebration of the ceremonies was not to be interrupted even by the death of members of the royal family. Raja Wadiyar was a devoted Vaishnavaite, and he donated the famous bejewelled crown to Lord Cheluvarayaswami of Melukote that is a feature of the Raja Mudi car festival even today. This is contrary to his own lineage as the Wadiyars regarded the temple of Karigiri Lakshmi Narasimha (Devarayana Durga, Tumkur) as their household deity. The mere fact that all the Wadiyars end their names by -"Narasimharaja Wadiyar" stands testimony to what was previously stated. This crown was confiscated from the royal Family by the Karnataka Government during an emergency. Legend has it that Raja Wadiyar, having entered the garbha–gruha (sanctum sanctorum) of Cheluvarayaswami Temple on 20 June 1617, became one with the deity (aikya). Even today one can find a Bhakthi Vigraha of the King inside the Temple. Another Bhakthi Vigraha of the King can be found inside the Lakshmi-Narayanaswami Temple inside the Mysore Palace Fort. Malangi and Talakad are two small towns near [[Tirumakudalu Narasipura]] on the banks of the Kaveri where the river takes a bend. Talakad's temples lie buried in a vast expanse of sand and are dug up and exposed every 12 years. At Malangi, on the other hand, the river is at its deepest. Whether these phenomena appeared only after Alamelamma's curse in 1610 is a matter of conjecture. What can be stated with certainty is that the curse on the royal family seems to have come true. Their chief courtier Ram Nath Molahalli was the army head.

From Raja Wadiyar’s death in 1617 to that of [[Chikka Devaraja|Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar]] in 1704 (there were four rulers in between) the kingdom was ruled by the surviving descendants of Yaduraya, but none could beget legal heirs. Incidentally, Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar is credited with the composition of Gita Gopala – an opera in Kannada. The sole exception to the curse was Chikka Devaraja's deaf and mute son Kantheerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II, also known as Mookarasu. He was succeeded by his son Dodda Krushna Raja Wodeyar, who ruled from 1714 to 1732. With him Yaduraya’s direct lineage came to an end. What followed was a succession of nominal rulers adopted by the surviving queens to continue the tradition. Traditional army commanders known as Dalvoys virtually ruled the kingdom and paved the way for the ascendancy of a foot soldier like Hyder Ali by 1762. There were five rulers from 1732 to 1796. In this period a definite pattern emerged under which no natural heir to the throne born to a king (adopted or otherwise) could beget children, whereas one who became king by virtue of adoption or other indirect inheritance was blessed with a legal heir. Hyder and Tipu continued the tradition of having a nominal Wodeyar King on the throne, and even the Dasara Celebrations continued as usual. After the famous [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] and the death of Tipu Sultan, a British army, in which the legendary [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (later Duke of Wellington, also known as the Iron Duke) was serving, conquered Srirangapatna in 1799.

In [[demonology]], '''Xezbeth''' (alternately '''Shezbeth''') is a [[demon]] of lies and legends, who invents untrue tales. Its name in Arabic is "The Liar" ({{lang-ar|الكذّاب}} ''al-Kadhāb'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Jan Knappert | last = Knappert | first = Jan | title = The Encyclopaedia of Middle Eastern Mythology and Religion | year = 1993 | page = 256 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9ooYAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26467">The '''Écône consecrations''' were a set of [[bishop|episcopal]] [[consecration]]s that took place in [[Écône]], [[Switzerland]], on 30 June 1988. They were performed by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] and Bishop [[Antonio de Castro Meyer]], and the priests raised to the [[episcopacy]] were four members of Lefebvre's [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX). The consecrations, performed against the explicit orders of [[Pope John Paul II]], represented a milestone in the troubled relationship of Lefebvre and the SSPX with the Church leadership. The [[Holy See]]'s [[Congregation for Bishops]] issued a decree signed by its Prefect Cardinal [[Bernardin Gantin]] declaring that Lefebvre had incurred automatic [[excommunication]] by consecrating the bishops without papal consent.

On 24 January 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] lifted the excommunications of the four bishops ([[Bernard Fellay]], [[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], and [[Alfonso de Galarreta]]) consecrated by Archbishop Lefebvre.&lt;ref name="Popelifts2009"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iQIJoUn9PMoY__fvU-gHPiR4Ku0QD95TFS580 | title = Pope lifts excommunications of 4 bishops | publisher = [[The Associated Press]] | date = 24 January 2009 | accessdate = 24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellay, superior general of SSPX, issued a statement in which the society expressed its "filial gratitude to the Holy Father for this gesture which, beyond the Priestly Society of Saint Pius X, will benefit the whole Church," and that the "{{interp|SSPX|orig=Our Society}} wishes always to be more able to help the pope to remedy the unprecedented crisis which presently shakes the Catholic world, and which Pope John Paul II had designated as a state of 'silent apostasy'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|last=Fellay|first=Bernard|date=2009-01-24|title=Press release from the Superior General of the Priestly Society of Saint Pius X|url=http://www.dici.org/accueil.php?loc=US|deadurl=yes|type=Press release|location=Menzingen, CH|publication-place=Paris, FR|publisher=Priestly Society of Saint Pius X|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124224451/http://www.dici.org/accueil.php?loc=US|archivedate=2009-01-24|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to the lifting of excommunications was divided. Many [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s attributed the decision to the intercession of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. But other Catholics, especially those of [[social progressivism|progressive]] stance, said they were surprised that the Pope had acted in such a positive way toward bishops holding such [[reactionary]] positions. The inclusion of Bishop Williamson in the measure was particularly controversial, because some of his remarks (which the Holy See claimed not to have been aware of at the time) were seen as constituting [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rabel|first=Andrew|date=2009-01-24|title=Excommunication lifted from dissident Catholics|work=|location=Houston, TX|publisher=Spero News|issn=|url=http://www.speroforum.com/a/17845/Excommunication-lifted-from-dissident-Catholics|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117115722/http://www.speroforum.com/a/17845/Excommunication-lifted-from-dissident-Catholic|archive-date=2016-01-17|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifting of his excommunication presented problems for [[relations between Catholicism and Judaism|Catholic-Jewish relations]], culminating in the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] severing ties with the Holy See on 28 January 2009 in protest.&lt;ref name="Israelchief"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gpbkisgs-EZ40shoCodJd4rfBNwAD960DPIG6 Israel's chief rabbinate severs ties with Vatican], January 24, 2009.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131185044/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gpbkisgs-EZ40shoCodJd4rfBNwAD960DPIG6 |date=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon law==
Criticism of the Écône consecrations centred on the fact that they were carried out against the explicit orders of the then reigning Pope John Paul II. Under the Catholic [[Code of Canon Law]], the consecration of a bishop requires the permission of the Pope,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3N.HTM#39 Canon 1013 of the ''Code of Canon Law'']&lt;/ref&gt; and (unless a papal dispensation has been granted) at least three consecrating bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3N.HTM Canon 1014 of the ''Code of Canon Law'']&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of the rule about the Pope's permission expressed in Canon 1013 has, since 1951, entailed automatic (''[[latae sententiae]]'') excommunication reserved to the [[Holy See]] both for the consecrator and for the recipient of the consecration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P52.HTM#5U Canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law]&lt;/ref&gt; and in this case there was not only an absence of permission but an actual prohibition by the Pope.&lt;ref name=telegram/&gt;

Lefebvre and his supporters argued that the circumstances under which the consecrations took place were such that none of the clergy involved were truly excommunicated. One of their arguments was that a 'state of necessity' existed in which the ordinary provisions of [[canon law]] could be set aside. The Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts rejected this argument, stating in a 1996 Explanatory Note that "there is never a necessity to ordain Bishops contrary to the will of the Roman Pontiff".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=1224|title=Library : The Excommunication of Followers of Archbishop Lefebvre|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consecrating a bishop without papal approval was also condemned by [[Pope Pius XII]] after the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] set up the state-controlled [[Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association]]. Pius XII stated that the [[sacrament]]al activity of illicitly consecrated bishops was "gravely illicit, that is, criminal and sacrilegious", and rejected the defence of necessity put forward by those involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061958_ad-apostolorum-principis_en.html Encyclical ''Ad Apostolorum Principis''])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement of the consecrations==
In the 1970s, [[Marcel Lefebvre|Lefebvre]] had stated that he would not consecrate bishops to continue his work with the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX). It is alleged that in 1974 (at the age of 69) he told a confidant that he could not take such a step, "for this would mean I would do what [[Martin Luther]] did, and I would lose the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]]".&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;Thomas W. Case, [http://sspx.agenda.tripod.com/id9.html The Society of St. Pius X Gets Sick], ''Fidelity'', October 1992. Retrieved from [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717102006/http://sspx.agenda.tripod.com/id9.html] on 2017-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Lefebvre's stance changed.  In 1983 (at the age of 78), while in the [[United States]], he reportedly sounded out his American priests about the prospect of him consecrating bishops.  Those superiors who objected to the idea were removed from their posts as a result.&lt;ref&gt;"But by 1983 he was in the United States, sounding out his priests on the possibility of consecrating bishops.  He asked each in turn for his view on the subject.  Those Society superiors who had objected to what he and they knew would be a formally schismatic act, in a year's time were all removed from their positions.  They were replaced by those priests who had gone along with the idea." Thomas W. Case, [http://sspx.agenda.tripod.com/id9.html The Society of St. Pius X Gets Sick], ''Fidelity'', October 1992. Retrieved from [https://web.archive.org/web/20110717102006/http://sspx.agenda.tripod.com/id9.html] on 2017-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986–1987, the Society's adherents in [[St Mary's, Kansas]] were required to attend a series of [[catechism|catechetical]] sessions in which they were prepared for the forthcoming consecrations and their fallout.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;[http://sspx.agenda.tripod.com/id9.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letters in response to "The Society of St. Pius X Gets Sick", ''Fidelity'', December 1992.

At the age of 82, Lefebvre first publicly announced his intention to consecrate bishops in a sermon at an ordination [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in [[Écône]] on 29 June 1987, in which he declared that "[[Rome]] is in darkness, in the darkness of error" and that "the bishops of the whole world are following the false ideas of the Council with their [[ecumenism]] and [[liberalism]]." He concluded: "This is why it is likely that before I give account of my life to the good Lord, ''I shall have to consecrate some bishops''."&lt;ref&gt;See the sermon "[http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Bishops-to-save-the-church.htm Bishops to Save the Church]", Marcel Lefebvre, June 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussions with Rome ==
Lefebvre and the Holy See engaged in dialogue and, on 5 May 1988, Lefebvre and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) signed the text of an agreement intended to end the dispute and open the way for the consecration of a successor to Lefebvre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unavoce.org/protocol.htm Protocol of Agreement between the Holy See and the Priestly Society of Saint Pius X] This is an English translation of the original French&lt;/ref&gt; In the first, doctrinal, part of the document, Lefebvre, in his own name and on behalf of the SSPX promised fidelity to the Catholic Church and to the Pope, accepted the doctrine contained in section 25 of the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' on the Church's [[magisterium]], pledged a non-[[polemic]]al attitude of communication with the Holy See on the problematic aspects of the Vatican II, recognized the validity of the revised sacraments and promised to respect the common discipline of the Church and her law.  The second, legal, part of the document envisaged that the SSPX would become a [[Society of Apostolic Life]] with certain exemptions,&lt;ref&gt;For public worship, care of souls and apostolic activity&lt;/ref&gt; it would have the faculty to celebrate the Tridentine rites, a special commission including two members of the SSPX to resolve conflicts and a member of the SSPX to be consecrated as a bishop.

This document was to be submitted to the Pope for his approval. However, Lefebvre quickly came to the view that he was being enticed into a trap. The very next day, he declared he was obliged in conscience to proceed, with or without papal approval, to ordain on 30 June a bishop to succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;''That is why, taking into account the strong will of the present Roman authorities to reduce Tradition to naught, to gather the world to the spirit of Vatican II and the spirit of Assisi, we have preferred to withdraw ourselves and to say that we could not continue. It was not possible. We would have evidently been under the authority of Cardinal Ratzinger, President of the Roman Commission, which would have directed us; we were putting ourselves into his hands, and consequently putting ourselves into the hands of those who wish to draw us into the spirit of the Council and the spirit of Assisi. This was simply not possible.'' [http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Episcopal-Consecration.htm  Sermon on the occasion of the Episcopal Consecration], Marcel Lefebvre, June 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

A further meeting took place in Rome on 24 May. Lefebvre was now promised that the Pope would appoint a bishop from among the members of the SSPX, chosen according to the normal procedures, and that the consecration would take place on 15 August, at the close of the [[Marian year]]. In return, Lefebvre would have to request reconciliation with the Pope on the basis of the protocol of 5 May. Lefebvre requested in writing that the consecration of three bishops take place on 30 June and that the majority of the members of the special commission must be from the SSPX.  On the Pope's instructions, Ratzinger replied on 30 May to Lefebvre concerning these requests, "[O]n the question of the commission, whose purpose was to favour reconciliation, not to make decisions, the Holy Father thought it best to keep to the agreement that Lefebvre had signed on 5 May"; on the question of the ordination of bishops, the Pope reiterated his readiness to speed up the usual process so as to nominate a member of the Society to be consecrated on 15 August, and Lefebvre was asked to provide the necessary information on candidates for this purpose, but, Ratzinger added, "Since you have announced again recently your intention to ordain three bishops on 30 June with or without the agreement of Rome, you must state clearly that you entrust yourself to the Holy Father's decision in full obedience."&lt;ref&gt;The full text of this letter, and of the whole exchange of correspondence from 8 April to 19 June can be found at SSPX site [http://www.dici.org/thomatique_read.php?id=000112 DICI]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consecration of four bishops ==
On 3 June, Lefebvre wrote from [[seminary at Ecône|Écône]], stating that he intended to proceed with the consecrations. On 9 June, the Pope replied to him with a personal letter, appealing to him not to proceed with a design that "would be seen as nothing other than a [[schism (religion)|schism]]atic act, the theological and canonical consequences of which are known to you." Lefebvre did not reply, and the letter was made public on 16 June.

On 17 June, Cardinal [[Bernardin Gantin]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] sent the proposed bishops a formal canonical warning that they would automatically incur the penalty of [[excommunication]] if they were ordained by Lefebvre without papal permission.

On 29 June, Cardinal Ratzinger sent the following telegram to Lefebvre:
{{quote|For the love of [[Christ]] and His Church, the Holy Father asks you paternally and firmly to depart today for Rome, without proceeding on 30 June with the episcopal ordinations that you have announced. He prays the Holy Apostles [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[St. Paul|Paul]] to inspire you not to be false to the episcopacy that has been placed in your charge and the oaths you have taken to remain faithful to the Pope, the successor of Peter.

On 30 June, Lefebvre consecrated four SSPX priests: [[Bernard Fellay]], [[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] and [[Alfonso de Galarreta]]. Bishop Emeritus [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] of [[Campos dos Goytacazes|Campos]], [[Brazil]] was co-consecrator with Lefebvre.

[[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma]] was present at the consecration ceremony and was the first to congratulate Lefebvre publicly.

==Excommunications==
The day after the consecration, 1 July 1988, the Vatican's [[Congregation for Bishops]] issued a decree signed by Cardinal [[Bernardin Gantin]], Prefect of the Congregation, declaring that Lefebvre, Fellay, Tissier de Mallerais, Williamson, and de Galarreta had incurred automatic excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/l-excomm.htm Decree of Excommunication]&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day [[Pope John Paul II]], in his apostolic letter ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'', condemned the Archbishop's action.&lt;ref name="EcclesiaDei1988"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pope John Paul II|date=1988-07-02|title=Ecclesia Dei|website=vatican.va|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope stated that, since schism is defined in [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2G.HTM#D7 canon 751] of the [[Code of Canon Law]] as "withdrawal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or from communion with the members of the Church subject to him", the consecration "constitute[d] a schismatic act." He declared: "In performing such an act, notwithstanding the formal canonical warning sent to them by the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops on 17 June last, Mons. Lefebvre and the priests Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta, have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication envisaged by ecclesiastical law", a reference to [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P52.HTM#5U canon 1382] of the Code of Canon Law.

Lefebvre declared that he had not withdrawn his submission to the Pope, and that canons 1323 and 1324 of the Code absolved him of culpability because of the crisis in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''In the state of necessity the duty to provide help arises independently of the cause of that necessity'' [http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/SiSiNoNo/1999_September/The_1988_Consecrations.htm The 1988 Consecrations], si si no no, SSPX Asia, September 1999 No. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 1324 provides that, when someone wrongly believes that there is a state of necessity that compels him to perform a canonically illegal act (even if his ignorance on this point is culpable, provided that the act in question is not inherently evil or tending to the harm of souls), the canonical penalty for the relevant act is to be reduced or replaced, and automatic penalties do not apply. The Holy See rejects this argument as irrelevant, both because Lefebvre had been served with express canonical warnings and because of the rule in canon 1325 that ignorance which is "crass or supine or affected" provides no defence under canons 1323 and 1324.

According to the SSPX, several churchmen and canon lawyers have affirmed that the consecration was not a schismatic act, on the basis that Lefebvre was merely consecrating auxiliary bishops rather than attempting to establish a parallel church. It has been claimed that Cardinal  [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]]&lt;ref name="CastrillonHoyos2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Castrillón Hoyos|first=Darío|others=Interview with Gianni Cardinale|date=2005|title=Rapprochement by unhasty stages, but not too slow either|website=30giorni.it|location=Rome|publisher=|url=http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo_stampa.asp?id=9360|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213203514/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo_stampa.asp?id=9360|archivedate=2006-02-13|deadurl=no|quote=Unfortunately Monsignor Lefebvre went ahead with the consecration and hence the situation of separation came about, even if it was not a formal schism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; agrees with this assessment. In line with general canonical opinion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=1220 Archbishop Lefebvre and Canons 1323:4° and 1324 §:5° A Canonical Study - Second Draft Edition] by Peter John Vere. His lengthy study ends with: ''In conclusion, having exhausted the issue from a canonical perspective, despite the Lefebvrite Movement's attempts to argue canons 1323 and 1324, there can be no doubt Archbishop Lefebvre incurred the latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the Holy See due his act of schism in consecrating bishops illicitly against the expressed instructions of the Roman Pontiff.''&lt;/ref&gt; the Holy See holds that Archbishop Lefebvre committed a schismatic act,&lt;ref&gt;''L'Osservatore Romano'' of 30.6-1.7.1988, p. 4, published the following:&lt;br&gt;"The following specific statement is made in relation to rumours circulating in Archbishop Lefebvre's circles concerning the ''latae sententiae'' excommunication envisaged in canon 1382:&lt;br&gt;
"In accordance with canon 1013, which states: 'No bishop is permitted to consecrate anyone as bishop, unless it is first established that a papal mandate has been issued', the episcopal consecrations that have taken place on 30 June at the hands of Archbishop Lefebvre, in spite of the admonition of 17 June, were carried out expressly against the will of the Pope by an act that, according to canon 751, was formally schismatic, seeing that Archbishop Lefebvre has openly withdrawn submission to the Supreme Pontiff and from communion with the members of the Church subject to him.&lt;br&gt;
"In consequence, both Archbishop Lefebvre and the bishops whom he consecrated, Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta, have ''ipso facto'' incurred ''latae sententiae'' excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See. Furthermore, canon 1323 cannot apply for them, since in this case none of the legal situations envisaged in that canon has been established, seeing that even the alleged "necessity" has been deliberately created by Archbishop Lefebvre for the purpose of maintaining an attitude of separation from the Catholic Church, in spite of the offers of communion and the concessions granted by the Holy Father John Paul II."&lt;/ref&gt; but not that he created a schismatic Church. Accordingly, when Cardinal [[Edward Idris Cassidy]] presented a revised edition of the Vatican's ''Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism'', he stated that "[t]he situation of the members of [the SSPX] is an internal matter of the Catholic Church." Viewing Lefebvre's action as schismatic, a number of former members and supporters of the SSPX resigned or withdrew their support from the Society and joined the newly founded (and Vatican-approved) [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter was founded in July 1988 by 12 clerics who had been members or associates of the Society of St. Pius X. Why did they leave? They left when Archbishop Lefebvre decided to consecrate four bishops against the express will of the Holy Father.''

==Lifting of excommunications ==

By a decree of 21 January 2009 (Protocol Number 126/2009), issued in response to a request that Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by Pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of Saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the Pope's Magisterium and authority.&lt;ref name="Popelifts2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/23251.php?index=23251&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; The decree, signed by Cardinal [[Giovanni Battista Re]], Prefect of the Congregation, is as follows:

{{quote|His Holiness Benedict XVI &amp;mdash; paternally sensitive to the spiritual unease manifested by the interested party due to the sanction of excommunication and trusting in the effort expressed by them in the aforementioned letter of not sparing any effort to deepen the necessary discussions with the Authority of the Holy See in the still open matters, so as to achieve shortly a full and satisfactory solution of the problem posed in the origin &amp;mdash; decided to reconsider the canonical situation of Bishops [[Bernard Fellay]], [[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], and [[Alfonso de Galarreta]], arisen with their episcopal consecration.

With this act, it is desired to consolidate the reciprocal relations of confidence and to intensify and grant stability to the relationship of the Fraternity of Saint Pius X with this Apostolic See. This gift of peace, at the end of the Christmas celebrations, is also intended to be a sign to promote unity in the charity of the universal Church and to try to vanquish the scandal of division.

It is hoped that this step be followed by the prompt accomplishment of full communion with the Church of the entire [[Society of St. Pius X|Fraternity of Saint Pius X]], thus testifying true fidelity and true recognition of the Magisterium and of the authority of the Pope with the proof of visible unity.

Based on the faculty expressly granted to me by the Holy Father Benedict XVI, in virtue of the present Decree, I remit from Bishops Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson, and Alfonso de Galarreta the censure of latae sententiae excommunication declared by this Congregation on July 1, 1988, while I declare deprived of any juridical effect, from the present date, the Decree emanated at that time.}}

Reaction to the decree varied. As SSPX general superior, Bishop Fellay expressed gratitude. Some [[traditionalist Catholic]]s attributed it to the intercession of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], while other traditionalists, maintaining that the excommunication was non-existent, blamed the four bishops for asking for its remission.&lt;ref&gt;This was the attitude, for example, of [[Florian Abrahamowicz]], who on 6 February 2009, within a month of the lifting of Williamson's excommunication, was expelled from the SSPX for  expressing opinions differing from the official views of the Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Others expressed surprise at the favour that the Pope had thus shown to bishops holding such positions, with particular regard to Bishop Williamson, who was accused as a [[Richard Williamson (bishop)#Holocaust denial controversy|Holocaust denier]]. The inclusion of this bishop presented problems for [[relations between Catholicism and Judaism|Catholic-Jewish relations]], culminating in the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] temporarily severing ties with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in protest.&lt;ref name="Israelchief" /&gt;
