== Plot == 
A young resident of Moscow, Kirill is a talented designer of computer games. One day, he is completely erased from the memory of everyone he knew and loved. Kirill learns that he is chosen for an important and mysterious mission. His purpose is to become a customs officer between parallel worlds, of which there are dozens in the universe.

Kirill learns to open the portals to a variety of parallel worlds which represent alternative versions of Moscow: a [[steampunk]] Imperial Russia, a [[post-apocalyptic]] tropic resort world, a [[dystopia]]n [[Gulag]] world, and a highly advanced [[utopia]]n world. Over time, Kirill learns that our Earth is a rough draft, a setting for social experiments secretly staged by the government of the utopian world, in order to avoid our mistakes. Learning this, Kirill rebels against his supervisors.

==Critical reception==
Although the film was one of the most anticipated Russian releases of 2018, it received mixed to negative reviews of professional critics, receiving 32% on [[KinoPoisk]]. The majority of criticism was focused on CGI, acting and an incomprehensible storyline.  Critics also panned the film for its changes from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kanobu.ru/articles/retsenziya-nachernovik-372052/ Рецензия на «Черновик» — бездарную адаптацию книги Лукьяненко]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.ru/culture/614338 Черновик: Нужна правка]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ria.ru/culture/20180525/1521256115.html?inj=1 Черновой вариант: почему не удалась экранизация романа Сергея Лукьяненко]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kritikanstvo"&gt;[http://www.kritikanstvo.ru/movies/chernovik/ Рецензии на фильм Черновик (2018), отзывы]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="megacritic"&gt;[https://www.megacritic.ru/film/chernovik Черновик (2018) — отзывы о фильме зрителей и критиков]&lt;/ref&gt; Observer of [[Kommersant]] Mikhail Trofimenkov in his review notes that by multiplying the fantasy worlds above the necessary number, the authors doomed the film to madness of entropy. Equally helpless, in the opinion of the author, is the actor's work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3641837 Переписанное начерно]&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Alexey Lytovchenko ([[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]) wrote that in some places it is impossible to differentiate the characters and understand their motives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rg.ru/2018/05/24/chernovik-plohaia-ekranizaciia-knigi-lukianenko-s-matreshkami-ubijcami.html Borschevik fields forever]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''Alvin Frank McDonald''' (1873 – December 15, 1893) was an early American [[caver]] and [[tour guide]] at what became [[Wind Cave National Park]] in [[South Dakota]], the sixth-longest [[cave]] system in the world, from 1889 to 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/Alvin_McDonald.htm Biography of Alvin McDonald], [http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/ Wind Cave National Park], [[National Park Service]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the age of 16 until his death at the age of 20, McDonald discovered and mapped the first {{convert|8|to|10|mi}} of Wind Cave using candlelight. His exploration and mapping was so extensive and thorough for the time that it was not until 1963, 70 years after his death, that major new passageways were discovered in Wind Cave.

== Early life ==
McDonald was born in [[Franklin County, Iowa]], and moved to Wind Cave, in the [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota, in 1890. His father, Jesse D. McDonald, had been hired in 1889 by the South Dakota Mining Company to oversee the company's "mining claim". It is not known if the mining company expected to find minerals of value in the cave or just planned on developing it for tourism. Regardless, the McDonald family eventually decided to attempt to make a living from the cave by developing it with enlarged passageways and wooden ladders and steps, with the hope of attracting travelers from the nearby resort town of [[Hot Springs, South Dakota|Hot Springs]].

== Wind Cave exploration ==
Alvin McDonald fell in love with Wind Cave, and in the few years he lived there he systematically explored about {{convert|8|to|10|mi}} of its subterranean passageways. He kept a [[Diary|journal]] in which he described his exploration of the cave and the naming of the rooms and passageways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/McDonald_Diary.htm Alvin McDonald's journal], [http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/ Wind Cave National Park], [[National Park Service]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald explored the cave entirely by candlelight and rolled out string to mark his way out of the cave. He shared his passion for the cave with visitors by becoming, in his own words, "the chief guide" at Wind Cave. Several of the modern tours offered by the [[National Park Service]] through the cave follow McDonald's original tour routes.

McDonald spent many hours almost every day for more than three years exploring and guiding within the cave. He was known to explore newly discovered passageways during his tours as well as on his own. Once, after being out of the cave for two days due to an illness, he wrote in his journal, "am homesick for the cave". He quickly realized the complex nature of the cave and wrote in his journal, "have given up the idea of finding the end of Wind Cave". Though he appreciated the beauty and natural features of the cave, McDonald, like others of his era, often removed samples of [[cave formations]] to sell to visitors. He would only remove samples from the cave in areas where he did not take visitors.

== Death ==
McDonald died of [[typhoid fever]] at the age of 20, on December 15, 1893. It is believed he contracted the disease in [[Chicago]], where he had been promoting the cave and exhibiting samples at the [[Columbian Exposition]] the previous summer. Some people{{who|date=October 2017}} have speculated that continued exposure to the cool, damp air of the cave caused him to yield to complications from the typhoid.

McDonald was buried near the entrance to the cave he loved so dearly. A bronze plaque on a stone marks his grave, which is located on a hill above the natural entrance to Wind Cave, {{convert|200|yd}} north of the park's visitor center. Photographs of Alvin McDonald, mementos, and his original journal are on display in the lower exhibit room of the visitor center.

== Legacy ==
Alvin McDonald's exploration of Wind Cave and eagerness to share it with others likely contributed to the creation and development of [[Wind Cave National Park]], the seventh national park in the [[United States]], in 1903.{{fact|date=March 2010}}

It is assumed that there are areas of Wind Cave that McDonald explored that no one else has since visited. Occasionally pieces of McDonald's string are discovered by survey teams in Wind Cave. As recently as August 2009, McDonald's signature was discovered carved into the ceiling of a room in the cave where it had been assumed no person had ever visited. The signature was dated July 1893, making it the latest known dated signature left by Alvin McDonald in Wind Cave.

An '''audition''' is a sample performance by an [[actor]], [[singer]], [[musician]], [[dancer]] or other performer. It typically involves the performer displaying their talent through a previously memorized and rehearsed solo piece or by performing a work or piece given to the performer at the audition or shortly before. In some cases, such as with a model or acrobat, the individual may be asked to demonstrate a range of professional skills. Actors may be asked to present a [[monologue]]. Singers will perform a [[song]] in a popular music context or an [[aria]] in a Classical context. A dancer will present a routine in a specific style, such as ballet, tap dance or hip-hop, or show his or her ability to quickly learn a choreographed dance piece.

The audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals select performers, which is in some ways analogous to a [[job interview]] in the regular job market. In an audition, the employer is testing the ability of the applicant to meet the needs of the job and assess how well the individual will take directions and deal with changes. After some auditions, after the performer has demonstrated their abilities in a given performance style, the audition panel may ask a few questions that resemble those used in standard job interviews (e.g., regarding availability).

Auditions are required for many reasons in the performing arts world. Often, employing companies or groups use auditions to select performers for upcoming shows or productions. An audition for a performing opportunity may be for a single performance (e.g., doing a monologue at a comedy club), for a series or season of performances (a season of a Broadway play), or for [[permanent employment]] with the performing organization (e.g., an orchestra or dance troupe). Auditions for performing opportunities may be for amateur, school, or community organizations, in which case the performers will typically not be paid. As well, auditions are used to select or screen candidates for entry to training programs (ballet school or circus school); university programs ([[B.Mus]], [[M.Mus]], [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Theater); performance-related scholarships and grants; or to be considered for representation by a talent agency or individual agent.

==Actors==
[[File:Владимир Назаров.jpg|thumb|For actors, monologues and speeches are the "calling card" that they use to demonstrate their skills to casting directors.]]

For actors in theater, film, and TV, the "audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals make final casting decisions.  Industry professionals may consist of casting directors, producers, directors or agency representatives".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auditionmonologues.com/Audition%20Tips.html|title=Audition Tips Monologues Actors Kids Teens Women Men|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In film and television, the audition is called a [[screen test]], and it is filmed so that the casting director or director can see how the actor appears on screen. Auditions are advertised in major media outlets (such as newspaper or radio), industry magazines and newsletters (e.g., auditions for musicians are advertised in the American Federation of Musicians newsletter), audition websites, and through a talent/casting agencies. Some performers hire an agent, to be able to draw on the agent's connections with casting directors and performing arts companies. However, the agent will take a cut (often 10–20%) of the performer's earnings. Although an actor's talents comprise crucial criteria in the casting process, an almost equal amount of attention is given to an actor's "type", (a combination of personality, looks and general casting intuition) as required for a particular production.

Actors who are selecting an audition piece may select a monologue by a character who is close to their own age. They may wear neutral clothing that allows freedom of movement. Auditionees may avoid going over the stated time limit. By convention, some actors choose to not direct their speech to the audition panel if they are doing an on-stage audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716210917/http://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the audition panel may request that the auditionee interacts with them (e.g., a director may ask the actor to speak the lines while looking directly at the director). An actor who is doing an audition may warm up before the audition, like an athlete would, although with an actor, a warm up might include vocal exercises in addition to stretching. Just as with any interview outside of the performing arts world, an auditionee may dress well. Even if the auditionee does not have expensive clothing, simple clothing may be acceptable if it is clean and of good quality. Auditionees know casting directors are also considering "whether or not the actor will be easy to work with, that they know what they are doing and can take direction well".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"/&gt;

Audition pieces are not always from the show the actor is being considered for; an actor wishing to be cast in ''[[Hamlet]]'' may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do have a range of audition pieces and select something appropriate; an actor auditioning for ''Hamlet'' would have a dramatic [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an [[Oscar Wilde]] [[comedy]], or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character).

For most auditions, it is expected that auditionees will bring a professional 8"x10" photo called a "head shot" and a resume that indicates their acting experience and training. Actors may bring additional copies of the head shot and resume, in case there are additional members of the casting team present at the audition. The casting agent or company may "call back" an auditionee days, weeks, or even months after the initial audition for a second audition. At a major audition for a professional company, the time limits are strictly enforced. A musical theater performer may be given a moment to tell the piano accompanist the tempo, and state their name and audition number to the audition panel. Then, once the auditionee starts acting or singing, the clock starts running. A buzzer sounds when the time limit runs out, which may be a minute and a half, two minutes, or three minutes, depending on the company. At this point, the auditionee is expected to stop and leave to free up the stage for the next auditionee.

Right before the audition, the casting director may give new instructions that were not in the advertisement; for example, due to time constraints, the time limit for the monologues might be cut in half, or the vocal selections might be cut. Actors know that it is important that they follow these last-minute instructions, and not be "thrown off balance" by these changes. At an audition, a director may ask for changes in the delivery of the lines or in other aspects of the performance. The goal may be to see if the auditionee is versatile or because the director disagrees with the initial approach used by the auditionee. In either case, the behavior of the auditionee is important; if the auditionee is cooperative in making the changes, it shows that he or she will be easy to work with. If a script is provided beforehand, actors often try to memorize as much as possible, because this shows that they have prepared and it allows them to look up from the script and show their facial expressions more.

Film auditions are different from theatre auditions. For film auditions, actors and actresses are given "sides" which are often a few pages of the script with the roles that they are auditioning for. These sides are often given to the actors 1–3 days before the audition.

In 2015, the widespread availability of relatively inexpensive video cameras has made video recordings of auditions feasible. To find their talent, casting directors are able to request video auditions from actors and actresses from a different state or country.

==Music==

===Popular music===

====Instrumentalists====
[[File:Wolfgang Schmid Unterfahrt-OhWeh-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play basslines from a range of different styles.]]
In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, instrumentalists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music at various levels of difficulty. In jazz groups, auditionees may be asked to perform standard pieces (e.g., a [[jazz standard]] such as "Now's the Time") with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play a rock or blues standard. An auditionee for a [[rhythm section]] role (rhythm guitar, electric bass, drumkit, etc.) will be asked to play a range of standard styles or "feels" which are used in a given style. For example, a drummer applying to play in a jazz band might be asked to play a slow [[ballad]], a medium "standard", and an up-tempo swing style. A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play in a [[Motown]] style [[bassline]], a syncopated 1970s [[funk]] "slapping" style line, and a [[reggae]]-style bassline. A person auditioning for a role as a rhythm section member in some styles of music may be expected to be able to demonstrate the ability to perform as a backup singer.

A performer auditioning for a solo or "lead" instrument role will typically perform prepared solos that showcase a range of skills, including the ability to perform a melody with sensitivity and expression; the ability to play virtuosic passages; and, in some styles (e.g., fusion jazz or blues), the ability to [[improvise]] a melody over a chord progression. In some popular genres, there is relatively less emphasis on "stage presence" and movement onstage, such as classic [[jazz]] or traditional 1950s-style country music. In these styles, there is more of a focus on the sound of the music and the expressiveness of the performer with their voice or instrument. In other genres, such as heavy metal "[[shred guitar]]" or [[hardcore punk]], it may be very important that a performer can move about in a dramatic fashion onstage. One of the differences between instrumentalist auditions in rock music styles and Classical styles is that in a rock context, the performers will be expected to have memorized most or all of the music. In a Classical context, most or all of the music is read from sheet music (with the exception of a solo Bach suite movement or a solo concerto movement).

====Singers====
[[File:Irving Berlin Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irving Berlin]], [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], and [[Helen Tamiris]] watching music theater auditions]]
For rock, country, and other forms of popular music, auditions are used to test the ability of an instrumentalist or singer to perform a specific style of music, or several styles. A singer auditioning for a role in a [[musical theatre]] production would not, unless instructed otherwise, need to sing [[opera]] or [[country music]], and a musician auditioning for a seat in an [[orchestra]] would not perform [[rock (music)|rock]].  Occasionally a musical theatre audition may require the performer to sing a song in the [[music genre|genre]] to which the musical pertains.  For instance, a singer auditioning for ''[[Destry Rides Again (musical)|Destry Rides Again]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[country-western]] song. A person auditioning for ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[rock music|rock]] song.  As well, in some cases, an audition may require a performer to demonstrate pieces in several styles. A hard rock band auditioning a new singer may request that the individual perform songs from [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and related styles such as [[blues rock]]. A pop or rock band that is selecting a new lead singer that has whittled the number of applicants down to the top two or three singers may test out how the singers perform in live shows by performing a few live concerts with each guest singer. This allows the band to see how the singer performs in a full multi-hour concert, including how well the singer can develop a rapport with the audience, deal with the inevitable problems that occur in live music (e.g., microphones failing or stage lights malfunctioning), and maintain their vocal endurance until the end of the evening.

[[File:ESC 2007 Denmark - DQ - Drama Queen.jpg|thumb|A contestant in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] tries to impress the judges at her live audition]]
For smaller roles in a large musical theater production, mass auditions are held at which many inexperienced or aspiring performers, most without [[talent agent|agents]], show up. These are popularly known as "cattle calls", since the hopefuls are often kept together in one large room. The musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' depicts this type of audition. ''[[American Idol]]'' also auditions its aspiring [[vocalists]] using this technique, since there are so many auditions. In musical theater and in pop music styles for which onstage dancing is part of the performance (e.g., hip hop), singers who are doing a vocal audition may also be required to demonstrate that they can dance while singing. In some popular music groups, such as a rock band, a [[backup singer]] may be expected to be able to play an instrument while singing, such as strumming a simple [[rhythm guitar]] part or playing a percussion instrument (e.g., tambourine or congas). While an ability to sing in multiple languages with the appropriate diction and pronunciation is more associated with Classical music than popular music, there are some popular styles where multiple languages are expected, including Latin jazz styles such as [[Bossa Nova]] (Portuguese songs may be requested); Tango (Spanish songs may be requested); folk music (French songs may be requested); and [[Celtic music]] (Irish songs may be requested).

===Classical music===
In classical music, auditions are used to screen candidates for positions as instrumentalists in chamber groups or orchestras or as soloists, and to screen singers for positions as members of a choir or as solo performers. In classical music, auditions are also used to screen candidates for entry to training programs, university or Conservatory programs or degrees, and training festival activities (e.g., classical summer camps). In comparison with some types of pop music auditions, classical auditions tend to be much more formal. The performer may, by tradition, wear a tuxedo or a formal dress, and the judges may sit behind a desk and write comments on clipboards.

====Instrumentalists====

In classical music, each instrument or vocal type has a standard repertoire of music which is commonly requested at auditions. Instrumentalists in an orchestral context are typically asked to perform excerpts from the orchestral literature, including both exposed solos and "tutti" parts which are particularly demanding. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], and a number of Principal players from the orchestra. Since the post-WW II era, professional orchestra auditions often include a musician's union representative, who ensures that the audition is being run in a fair manner. In many major orchestras, a cloth screen may be used at some stages of the audition process, to protect the audition panel from allegations of favouritism or sexism.

An orchestral audition will normally set out a list of orchestral excerpts which each performer has to prepare. As well, each performer plays a movement from a Sonata or Concerto which may be performed with piano accompaniment. When the performer plays the orchestral excerpts, he or she may be given a tempo, or asked to follow the gestures of the conductor. Orchestral auditions are often run in several stages, in order to screen candidates and reduce those who are less likely to meet the needs of the job. A large number of applicants typically apply for a professional orchestra job. The orchestra personnel manager then selects the most promising candidates based on the experience and training indicated in the applicants' CVs (and, in some cases, based on the performing ability demonstrated in a recording of the applicant).

This first "cut" of auditionees then perform in front of the audition panel. Typically in a professional orchestra, this would require the performance of excerpts representing stylistic and technical challenges drawn from repertoire typical to that orchestra. The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music.

If a candidate is successful in passing the audition, typically a Trial period of several months to a year takes place allowing the Chief Conductor and Principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

====Singers====
There is a standard repertoire of vocal literature for each voice type (e.g., soprano, alto) that is used at auditions for singers. Each sub-type of vocal activity has a separate standard audition repertoire (e.g., choirs, operas, etc.). A person auditioning for a role in a choir will be expected to be able to sight read choral parts. In auditions for opera, a singer will be expected to demonstrate the ability to act out the movements that are associated with the lyrics of the aria, which may include pretending to be dying from a stab wound, miming an activity (e.g., pouring wine), or doing a simple dance routine. Both choral and opera singers are expected to be able to follow the gestures of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] in regards to expression and tempo. Since microphones are not used in most classical music performances,&lt;ref&gt;The exception is [[acoustic enhancement]] systems which apply a subtle amplification in order to balance the volume in the hall and compensate for acoustic problems.&lt;/ref&gt; the audition panel will be assessing the auditionees ability to project a strong, room-filling vocal tone. In classical music, in addition to judging singing ability (e.g., tone, intonation, etc.), the audition panel will be judging the applicant's ability to use the appropriate diction and pronunciation of the major languages used in Art music: German, Italian, and French. Other languages that the applicant may be asked to sing in include English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin.

==Musical theatre==
In [[musical theatre]], a standard audition consists of two sixteen-measure selections of [[song]]s, contrasting in style, intention, characters, time period, or all of the above. There is also usually a monologue portion, where the actor is asked to perform a one-minute [[monologue]]. A headshot and résumé are almost always required. Although auditions vary depending on the theatre, program, or show, this formula is considered “the norm” in the musical theatre world. The purpose of an audition is two-fold. Practically, performers audition to get a callback. "Callbacks", or callback auditions, allow the artistic team to assess a performer’s skills in accordance with specific characters. During the callback, the panel has shortlisted a candidate, because they have noted his or her potential for particular parts. As such, during a callback audition, the candidate is asked to sing the songs performed by certain characters or read their lines. The first audition is not a platform for selling oneself as a particular character. Character-specific auditions take place during callbacks. Instead, the first audition is a chance for the performer to show off the songs she does best.

==Dance==
[[File:Two dancers.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Two dancers performing [[modern dance]], a style in which performers may be asked to demonstrate improvised movements at an audition.]]
There are many types of dance auditions for different performance venues. Dance companies hire employees for ballet and modern dance shows. Broadway companies hire dancers for traditional musicals (Rodgers and Hammerstein) and more modern dance musicals (e.g., ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''). Casinos, resorts, amusement parks, and cruise ships hire dancers for revue-style shows that can range from jazz dance to hip-hop. For these shows, some backup singing skills or acting skills may be required. Pop music concert producers and pop music video producers recruit dancers to perform onstage during concerts or during videos. For live pop concerts, onstage dancers may be required to perform simple backup singing. Movie and TV producers also hire dancers for short term shoots; even though a dancer may only get several days of work from a movie or TV show, there may be residual payments. Most auditions specify what type of dance skills are required (e.g., Classical, pointe, contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, etc.). In the case of modern dance, some dance companies ask applicants to demonstrate their ability to improvise dance moves.
[[File:Brazier Dancers 01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|These dancers from the Braziers troupe are performing [[Highland dancing]], a style at which auditionees must demonstrate a high degree of technique and the ability to quickly learn new steps.]]
Many dance auditions test the ability of applicants to learning new [[choreography]] in a short time period, rather than showcasing a prepared work. In other cases, a short prepared solo piece may also be required (about 90 seconds long). Applicants will be instructed in a technical routine or pattern in a group session. Some auditions require applicants to have completed training at a recognised dance school or conservatoire, and in some cases, auditionees may be requested to bring a reference letter from a dance teacher or dance company director (especially in the case of young dancers with little professional experience). At some auditions, applicants are asked to make a short verbal statement about their dancing goals or why they wish to join the troupe. Auditionees should ensure that they know the major dance terms, because the judges may request that certain dance moves be demonstrated.

Dancers are often asked to bring one or two photographs, such as a "headshot" and a full-body photo of the applicant in a dancing pose. The clothing that auditionees need to wear at auditions varies. At some auditions, particularly Classical auditions, there is a strict dress code: applicants wear dance leotards and [[pointe shoes]], and long hair is tied back. Other dance auditions specify loose clothing. For some contemporary dance auditions, applicants must dance barefoot. In some music theater roles, applicants need to bring tap shoes to demonstrate their [[tap dancing]] skills. Some auditions where there is a large number of applicants require the performers to wear a number pinned to their shirt, in a similar way to marathon runners. This way, if the casting director sees an exceptional dancer, he or she can take note of the number. Unless jewellery or make-up is an expected part of a dancer's appearance in a certain dance style, dance auditionees generally avoid jewellery and makeup.

In music theater and pop music, there is a lot of crossover between dancing and singing roles. Almost all dancers in music theater and many dancers in pop music will be expected to have some singing ability as a [[backup singer]] (singing harmony parts to accompany the solo vocalists). In rarer cases, dancers will be asked to demonstrate the ability to play a musical instrument (e.g., guitar), because there are some shows in which some of the dancer-actors have to play instruments onstage, such as the ''[[Threepenny Opera]]''. In music theater, there is also often crossover between dancing and acting roles. Dancers may be expected to be able to take on an acting role and speak lines (often in a supporting role).

Some major dance companies have "open calls" once a year, in which any or almost any applicant can come to demonstrate their dancing skills. At these open calls, the entire group of applicants are taught a dance routine by a choreographer, and then the group of dancers performs the routine while judges assess their performance. It can be hard for a good dancer to get noticed by the judges in such a large group of dancers. For this reason, some dance coaches encourage their students to wear outgoing clothes and bright things to stand out, so that the dancer will get personal attention during his or her audition. For any audition interviews, dancers should send their resume and headshot to the company director ahead of time.

==Circuses and amusement parks==
[[File:Acrobat.jpg|thumb|A [[high wire]] act by an acrobat]]

Performers auditioning for amusement parks world wide are generally viewed by one or more casting directors in a rehearsal hall or a large facility. Most theme park auditions, like other auditions, are closed to the public. This means that no one is allowed into the audition room who is not auditioning. Vocalists for Disney auditions are asked to prepare two separate vocal selections of contrasting styles. The singers do not sing the entire songs; instead they just need to sing the best 16 bars of each song. Disney provides a piano accompanist for all vocal auditions, and so singers have to bring sheet music in the correct key. Disney does not allow any pre-recorded accompaniment. The casting directors may also ask auditionees to learn additional music or learn a movement combination. Disney Parks &amp; Resorts casts performers for theme parks, resorts, and cruise ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/auditions/experience/prepare.html|title=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Cirque du Soleil]], depending on a performer's discipline, the audition may last an hour, a day or even two days. Depending on a performer's  discipline, he or she might have to perform a solo presentation in front of the group of participants and/or participate in individual and group exercises following the solo presentation. Auditions for Cirque du Soleil are filmed.

==Modeling==

[[Fashion model|Modelling]] agencies and other organizations that are looking for models, such as fashion designers and advertising agencies also use auditions to screen and select potential candidates. Aspiring female models for most fashion industry roles need to be in their teens or early twenties and be tall and slim. Although there are "niche markets" for non-svelte models ("plus size models" and "real life models" who model clothes for middle-market clothing catalogues), most female models need to be slender and between 108–125&amp;nbsp;lbs. Young men who are aspiring models should be between 18 and 25, tall, and fit. While male models who are selected at modelling auditions may well end up having careers that last till beyond age 25 (even into their 40s), modelling agencies prefer to recruit new models in the 18–25 age range. Most models work with an agent who arranges auditions, bookings, and negotiates fees. At an audition, casting agents will ask the model to demonstrate different poses, which a photographer may record with a digital camera.

For high fashion auditions, the model may be asked to demonstrate the "catwalk" style of modelling clothes on a raised runway. At most modelling auditions, models wear fairly simple clothes that will allow the talent agents to imagine the model in different garments. Typically, a model wears fairly body-hugging clothes, so that the judges can see the body type of the model. Some modelling agencies audition a large number of aspiring models in an "open call", in which agents consider applicants for under a minute or so each. Some agencies hold model searches, which is a type of beauty contest in which applicants audition for the opportunity of winning a model portfolio or a photo shoot.

'''Bahamian Creole''', known locally as '''Bahamian dialect''', is an [[English-based creole language]] spoken mainly in [[The Bahamas]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].

In comparison to many of the [[English language|English]]-based broken speech of the [[Caribbean]] region, limited research has been conducted on what is known as Bahamian dialect. This lack of research on Bahamian dialect is perhaps because for many years, Bahamians have assumed that this language is simply a variety of English. However, academic research shows that this is not the case. 
==Pronunciation==
There is a tendency for speakers to drop {{IPA|/h/}} or, in a [[hypercorrection]], to add it to words without it so ''harm'' and ''arm'' are pronounced the same. The merger occurs most often in the speech of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] and north [[Eleuthera]].&lt;ref name="Shilling1982"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|Shilling|1982|p=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speakers have merged {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} into a single phoneme and pronounce words with {{IPA|[v]}} or {{IPA|[w]}} depending on context (the latter appearing in word-initial position and the former appearing elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Outside of white acrolectal speech, speakers have no [[dental fricative]]s and English cognate words are usually pronounced with {{IPA|[d]}} or {{IPA|[t]}} as in  ''dis'' ('this') and ''tink'' ('think').&lt;ref name="Shilling1982" /&gt;  
Other characteristics of Bahamian Dialect in comparison to English include:&lt;ref name="Shilling1982" /&gt;
*Merger of the vowels of ''fair'' and ''fear'' into {{IPA|[ɛə]}}
*Free variation of the "happ'''y'''" vowel between {{IPA|[ɪ]}} and {{IPA|[i]}}.
*The vowel of ''first'' merges with that of ''fuss'' (into {{IPA|[ʌ]}}) among some and with the vowel of ''foist'' (into {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}}) in others.
*As the dialect is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]]; {{IPA|/r/}} is not pronounced unless it is before a vowel.
*Final clusters are often simplified, especially when they share voicing (''gold'' &gt; ''gol'', but not ''milk'' &gt; *''mil'').
* The [[pin–pen merger]] occurs.

==Grammar==
Pronouns in Bahamian Dialect are generally the same as in Standard English. However, the second person plural can take one of three forms:
*''yinna'',
*''y'all'' or
*''all a ya''

Possessive pronouns in Bahamian Dialect often differ from Standard English with: 
*''your'' becoming or ''ya''
*''his'' or ''hers'' becoming ''he'' or ''she''
and
*''their'' becoming ''dey''.
For example, ''das ya book?'' means 'is that your book?'

In addition, the possessive pronouns differ from Standard English:{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

When describing actions done alone or by a single group, ''only..one'' is used, as in ''only me one sing'' ('I'm the only one who sang') and ''only Mary one gern Nassau'' ('Mary was the only one who went to Nassau')

===Verbs===

Verb usage in the Bahamian Dialect differs significantly from that of Standard English. There is also variation amongst speakers.  For example, the word ''go'':

1) I'm going to [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]]: 
*''I goin ta Freeport''
*''I gern ta Freeport''
*''I gun go Freeport''

2) I am going to cook
*''I ga cook''
*''I goin cook''
*''I gern cook''
*''I gern go cook

3) Similarly, verb "to do" has numerous variations depending on tense and context: 
*''I '''does''' eat conch erry day'' ('I eat conch every day')
* ''Wa you '''does''' do?'' ('what kind of work do you do?')
* "he gone dat way" (used while pointing in a direction,means that is where the person went).

4) In the present tense, the verb "to be" is usually conjugated "is" regardless of the [[grammatical person]]:  
*I am – ''I is'' or "Ise” (pronounced "''eyes''")
*You are – ''You is'' or "You's", pronounced "''use''"
*We are – ''We is'' or "We's", pronounced "''weez''"
*They are – ''Dey is'' or "Dey's"

5) The negative form of "to be" usually takes the form "een" 
''I een gern'' ('I am not goin')

6) Bahamians commonly merge the negative "een" to the subject/person being used, turning "I een" to "Ine (sometimes spelled I'n)".
*I am not - "Ine" or "I'n"
*You are not - "Youne" or "You'n"
*He/She is not - "Hene/ Shene" or "He'n/ She'n"
*We are not - "Wene" or "We'n"
*They are not - "Deyne" or "Dey'n"
*That is not - "Dine" ( the 't' in "that" is usually left off, and the vowels in 'dat' + 'een' are often blended together, forming an /I/ sound)

7) While context is often used to indicate tense (e.g. ''I drink plenny rum las night'' = 'I drank a lot of rum last night'), the past tense can also be formed by combining "did", "done", "gone", or "been" with the verb:  
*''She tell him already'' (She already told him)
*''I dun (done) tell you''
*''He tell her she was fat''  ('he told her she was fat')
*''Why you do dat?'' ('why did you do that?')
*''I bin (been) [[Eleuthera]] last week'' ('I went to Eleuthera last week')

8) "Carry" is commonly substituted for "take"
*''Ine ga carry da ting ta John'' ('I am not going to take this thing to John')

==Lexicon==
{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|Shilling|1982}} features over 5,500 words and phrases not found in Standard English, with the authors attempting to link them to other English-based creoles, like Gullah.&lt;ref name="Reaser2010"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Reaser|2010|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words may derive from English, as well as some African languages.

===Examples===
*'''asue''': a cooperative savings system traced to a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] custom of ''éèsú'' or ''èsúsú'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|Shilling|1982|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar schemes are common in other Caribbean countries, e.g. the [[susu account|''susu'']] in [[Barbados]].
*'''benny''': [[sesame|sesame seed]], grown locally and used in the popular treat ''benny cake''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|Shilling|1982|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  found in various forms throughout the African Diaspora.
*'''Conchy Joe''' or '''Conky Joe''': a white Bahamian.&lt;ref name="Shilling1982a"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|Shilling|1982|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''jook''', '''juck''' or '''juke''': to stab or poke, possibly from the West African word of the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|Shilling|1982|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This word is found in many Caribbean creole languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">In the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' books, the '''Cataclysm''' (Great Destruction) was a catastrophic event that occurred when the [[Kingpriest of Istar]] demanded to be given godlike powers in order to eliminate evil from the world.

==Background==
Detailed in the novel ''[[Chosen of the Gods]]'', [[Beldinas Pilofiro]], last Kingpriest of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Istar|Istar]], never liked the concept of balance. He believed that [[Paladine (Dragonlance)|Paladine]] accepted it in a time when he was previously weak. As time passed, and the forces of good flourished after the [[Dragonlance#Fictional history|Third Dragon War]] in which [[Huma Dragonbane]] defeated [[Takhisis]], he thought the time to break that outdated [[pact]] was nearing.

His decision to end the balance became strengthened when the previous Kingpriest, known as [[Kurnos the Usurper]], sent Sathira, an evil [[spirit]], to kill him. [[Ilista]], First Daughter and the woman who traveled from far [[Istar (Dragonlance)|Istar]] led by a [[prophecy]] to find the true Kingpriest, sacrificed herself in order to save him.

Though at the beginning Beldinas only fought evil, as time passed, he began to include those who did not think exactly like him. Thus, he destroyed [[temple]]s and expelled followers of the Neutral Gods, as well. With time, his obsession drove him to also destroy even "heretic" followers of the Gods of Light. As detailed in the novel ''[[Divine Hammer]]'', this also caused the Kingpriest to try to destroy all [[Wizards of High Sorcery]], causing the Order to destroy the [[Towers of High Sorcery]] in [[List of Dragonlance locations#Losarcum|Losarcum]] and [[List of Dragonlance locations#Daltigoth|Daltigoth]] in self-defense. This also caused Andras Rannoch, who was being mind-controlled by [[Fistandantilus]], to curse the Tower of High Sorcery in [[List of Dragonlance locations#Palanthas|Palanthas]] upon his death.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==The Thirteen Warnings==
For thirteen days prior to the Cataclysm the gods sent warnings to the fanatical Kingpriest and his followers, all of which went unheeded. Following is a list, in order.

* The true clerics left the land for the realm of the gods beyond. This night became known as the ''Night of Doom''.
* The ''Durro Jolithas'', the Tower of the Temple of the Kingpriest dedicated to [[Kiri-Jolith]], was destroyed by a whirlwind.
* Dark fog spreads and settles in [[List of Dragonlance locations#Balifor|Balifor]] and [[List of Dragonlance locations#Hylo|Hylo]], the [[Kender (fantasy)|kender]] realms, breaking their spirits.
* In a full night [[eclipse]], [[Nuitari]] hides both [[Solinari (Dragonlance)|Solinari]] and [[Lunitari]].
* The [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]] of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Thorbardin|Thorbardin]] were hunted by an ancient beast of darkness.
* In [[List of Dragonlance locations#Solamnia|Solamnia]], no fires would burn.
* In [[List of Dragonlance locations#Abanasinia|Abanasinia]], fires '''spread''', destroying everything.
* In [[List of Dragonlance locations#Dargaard Keep|Dargaard Keep]], [[Lord Soth]] raised his arms against the [[Knights of Solamnia]].
* [[List of Dragonlance locations#Palanthas|Palanthas]] was covered in mist. The weather was oppressively hot and the seas were unsettlingly still. The mist was so thick the scribes in the Great Library stopped working.
* In the elven kingdom of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Silvanesti|Silvanesti]], trees wept blood.
* The forest animals near [[List of Dragonlance locations#Qualinesti|Qualinesti]] suddenly turned savage.
* In northern towns like Pesaro and Tucuri, the [[fish]] disappeared, and the water turned red.
* In the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Khalkist Mountains|Khalkist Mountains]], dormant volcanoes became active again.

The warnings had been prophesied by the First Son Revando before taking his own life. Emissary Quarath, though knowing about the warnings, did not tell the Kingpriest their true meanings.

==The Petition==
The Kingpriest misunderstood the warnings, utterly convinced of his own infallible truth. He believed those were the last efforts of the evil gods, and only hardened his resolution.

He regarded Paladine as too weak to completely destroy evil, but with the Kingpriest as his right arm, evil could be defeated.  The Kingpriest called for the genocidal destruction of the [[Ogre (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ogre]] races, and the relocation of the [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]] and [[Kender (fantasy)|kender]].  For his arrogance, the gods punished the city of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Istar|Istar]].

==Consequences==
Soon after the Kingpriest made his demand, a "fiery mountain"&lt;ref&gt;Time of the Twins&lt;/ref&gt; struck Istar. The city and all the land around it were driven deep into the ground, and the sea roared in to fill the gap. Thick, red soil was churned up by the water, giving it a reddish tint. This new body of water became known as the [[Blood Sea of Istar]]. Where the Temple of the Kingpriest once stood, there was a perpetual, massive [[whirlpool]] that kept the red soil churned up, leaving the Blood Sea permanently blood-colored. On the opposite side of the continent of [[Ansalon]], the Kingdom of Ergoth was broken from the mainland, and split in two. More water flooded inland and created the Newsea. The city of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Caergoth|Caergoth]], an inland farming city, suddenly found itself on the ocean's doorstep. To the south, the thriving [[port]] city of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Tarsis|Tarsis]] found that the sea had '''retreated''', and they were now surrounded by [[plain]]s as far as the eye could see. The effects of the Cataclysm continue to be felt on [[Krynn]] to this day.

Several cities, including [[List of Dragonlance locations#Xak Tsaroth|Xak Tsaroth]], were utterly destroyed.

Post-Cataclysm time in [[Krynn]] is often rendered ''AC'', to denote ''After Cataclysm''.

'''Cathedral''' is a two-player [[abstract strategy]] [[board game]] in which two factions ("dark" and "light") vie for [[territorial dispute|territorial supremacy]] within the bounds of a [[medieval]] city.  The game is produced by [[Chrisbo I.P. Holdings Limited]] in [[New Zealand]].

== History ==

Cathedral was invented between 1962 and 1979 by Robert Moore (16 August 1942 – 19 June 1998), a pilot in the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]].  Inspiration for the game was provided by [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|Christchurch Cathedral]] and its environs in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand.  From the air, Moore was fascinated by the way the [[cathedral]] and neighbouring buildings intricately fit together, like pieces of a [[jigsaw puzzle]].  He conceived of a game involving players trying to build interlocking buildings around a cathedral.

In 1979 Moore presented a prototype version of his game to Brightway Products, a New Zealand wooden toy and game company.  Two versions of the game were originally created: a "formal piece" using three-dimensional wooden models of mediaeval buildings and towers; and an "abstract piece" consisting of two-dimensional squares.  The formal piece proved more popular and is the only version produced today; in Standard, Tournalux (larger), and Grandelux (larger and higher quality) versions. The game was also recreated from as early as 1985 (from Mattel) in a more consumer accepted version in plastic moulded version with very highly detailed parts as well as a grided locking system added to the board.

It is generally accepted that the concept of the game is not subject to copyright. However, the name and specific wording of the rules and gameplay are copyright 1998 Chrisbo I.P. Holdings Limited.

== Overview ==

The idea of the game is to capture territory on the game board, allowing you to place all of your gamepieces while preventing your opponent from doing likewise.

== Equipment ==

Cathedral is played on a [[wood]]en board divided into a 10x10 [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]].  The board is enclosed by turreted walls and represents a medieval city.  There are 29 pieces, all small abstracts of buildings.  One building is the Cathedral, painted grey.  The rest of the buildings are divided into 14 dark and 14 light pieces, one set for each player.  Notable is the fact that two of the pieces are configured differently between colors: the Academy and the Abbey. In the standard and tournalux versions of the game the darker pieces are [[Wood stain|stained]], in the grandelux version they are made of a darker hardwood.  The pieces and the game board are covered with a [[lacquer]] finish.  A plastic version was produced for a short period in the mid 1980s.

== Rules ==

Whichever player is using the "light" pieces begins by placing the Cathedral anywhere within the play area, aligned with the squares.  Next the "dark" player places one of their game pieces on the board.  Play alternates between the two sides until one side is unable to make a move.  At this point, the other side attempts to place all of their remaining pieces in areas they have captured.

Players may capture territory within the city by completely enclosing it with their pieces alone, or with the help of the city walls.  Boundaries of these areas must be "wall to wall;" that is, if two of the surrounding pieces only touch on their corners, that's not a capture.  If the captured territory contains one and only one of the opponent's pieces or the cathedral, that piece may be removed and the opponent may no longer place pieces in that area.  An opponent's piece so removed can return to play at a later stage, but the cathedral will remain absent for the remainder of the game.  If the territory contains more than one piece (including the Cathedral), it is not captured and remains available for the opponent to use. Strategy: Use the largest pieces first, don't play into your captured space until you have no pieces left that will fit into the uncaptured areas.

The winner is the player who manages to place all of their pieces, while preventing their opponent from doing so.  If neither player is able to place all of their pieces, then the player whose remaining pieces would take up the smaller area is declared the winner.

When playing multiple games in a row, players alternate placing the Cathedral and moving first.  At the end of each game, each player gets a score based on the number of squares that their opponent's remaining buildings would occupy. Because of the different configuration in the two pieces mentioned above (in equipment), a good way to play multiple games is a 4-game set, with players playing each color twice, players alternating playing the Cathedral and moving first.

== Solved/fix ==

It is argued by [[ludologist]] Tom Lehmann that [https://sites.google.com/site/ptlehmann/gaming/hrules/cathedral Cathedral is "broken"], in that there is an opening strategy for the first player that cannot be countered by the second player. The [https://sites.google.com/site/ptlehmann/gaming/hrules/cathedral suggested fix] is for the second player to also place the Cathedral along with their first piece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19622">{{Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The '''culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo''' is extremely diverse, reflecting the great diversity and different customs which exist in the country. Congolese culture combines the influence of tradition to the region, but also  combines influences from abroad which arrived during the [[Belgian Congo|era of colonization]] and has continued to have a strong influence, without destroying the individuality of many tribal' customs.

==People, language and background==
[[File:Map - DR Congo, major languages.svg|thumb|350px|A map of the major [[Bantu languages]] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]
Like many African countries, the borders were drawn up by colonial powers, and bore little relation to the actual spread of [[ethno-linguistic]] groups. There are 242 [[languages]] spoken in the country, with perhaps a similar number of ethnic groups. Broadly speaking, there are four main population groups:
* [[Pygmy|Pygmies]], the earliest inhabitants of the Congo, are generally hunter-gatherers. Expert in the ways of the forest, where they have resided for thousands of years, they live by trading meat with their taller farming neighbors in exchange for agricultural products. Increasingly, they are assimilating into non-Pygmy society and adopting the latter's languages and customs.
* [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] arrived in the Congo in several waves from 2000 BC to 500 AD, mainly from the area in what is now southern Nigeria. They are by far the largest group, and the majority live as subsistence-farmers. They are present in almost every part of the country, and their languages make up three of the DRC's five officially recognized languages. Among these are [[Kongo language|Kikongo]], [[Lingala language|Lingala]] and [[Tshiluba language|Tshiluba]]. Kikongo is spoken by the [[Bakongo|Kongo]] people in the far west of the country, both on the coast and inland, and was promoted by the Belgian colonial administration. Elements of Kikongo have survived amongst the descendants of slaves in the Americas—for instance, the language of the [[Gullah]] people of [[South Carolina]] contains elements of Kikongo. Lingala, spoken in the capital [[Kinshasa]], is increasingly understood throughout the country, as the [[lingua franca]] of trade, spoken along the vast Congo river and its many tributaries. Lingala's status as the language of the national army, as well as its use in the lyrics of popular Congolese music, has encouraged its adoption, and it is now the most prominent language in the country. Tshiluba (also known as Chiluba and Luba-Kasai) is spoken in the southeastern [[Kasai regions]].
* Bantus also brought in the fourth of the DRC's official languages, [[Kingwana language|Kingwana]] — a Congolese dialect of [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. Note that the fifth language, [[French language|French]], is the official language of government, a result of Congo's colonial relationship with Belgium. These Swahili-speaking Bantus are related to the other Bantus mentioned above, but tend to differ in their way of life, in that they practice herding as well as farming. They came from the various countries to the east of Congo: [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Tanzania]], bringing with them many of the ethnic rivalries that have inflamed recent conflicts.
* The northeastern part of the country is inhabited by groups who are believed to have originally come from the southern Sudan region. In general, these are cattle herders and include the [[Tutsi]], possibly the tallest people in the world. These migrants also entered Rwanda and Burundi around the same time, often mixing with the settled groups.

The above descriptions are by necessity simplified. Many Congolese are multilingual, and the language used depends on the context. For instance, a government official might use French to set a tone of formality and authority with another official, use Lingala when buying goods at a market, and the local language when in his home village. [[English language|English]] is also spoken, especially in the east where eastern and southern African influences have spread in the post-Mobutu era. Among the [[slangs]] spoken in Congo, [[Indubil]] has been noted since around the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ghetto Blaster : Et la rumba congolaise rythma les indépendances|url=http://www.sebtheplayer.com/ghetto-blaster-et-la-rumba-congolaise-rythma-les-independances/|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to evolve nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The spread of Indubil through DR Congo: context and modalities|author=Georges Mulumbwa Mutambwa|url=http://www.vad-ev.de/2010/index.php/en/programme/zu-den-panels/panels-papers/doc_view/120-mutambwa-the-spread-of-indubil-through-dr-congo|accessdate=20 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719111839/http://www.vad-ev.de/2010/index.php/en/programme/zu-den-panels/panels-papers/doc_view/120-mutambwa-the-spread-of-indubil-through-dr-congo|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed marriages between ethnic groups are common, particularly in urban areas where many different groups live side by side. Europeans appear in small numbers throughout the country, as [[missionary|missionaries]] in the countryside, and as businessmen and traders in the cities. Also acting as merchants are small numbers of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Pakistan]]is.

==Religion and belief==
[[File:Ceremony in Lemba.jpg|thumb|250px|Branhamist worshippers in Kinshasa]]
{{Main|Religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The main religions in the DRC are:{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* Indigenous traditional beliefs: 11.5%
* [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Christianity: 50%
* [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christianity: 20%
* Indigenous [[Christianity]]: 13.5%, nearly all of whom (13%) are followers of [[Kimbanguism]].
* Other Christian denominations: 1%
* [[Islam]]: 1.5%

There are small communities of [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] who work in commercial urban areas. [[Atheism]] is very rare.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Indigenous traditional beliefs===
Though only 11.5 per cent of Congolese ''exclusively'' follow indigenous beliefs, these traditional belief systems are often intermingled with forms of [[Christianity]], and are familiar to the majority of Congolese. Throughout the DRC the beliefs take on a number of forms, but they have a number of things in common:
* A creator spirit is thought to be sovereign of the spirit world, but this god is rarely the direct cause of events. In many Congolese languages, the name of the creator god derives from the word ''father'' or ''maker''. Some groups regard the creator as being omnipresent, whilst others believe the god lives in the sky. For most believers in indigenous religions, contact with the creator god is made via ancestor spirits. A smaller number of groups believe that individuals can have direct contact.
*A belief in an essential life-force which animates the body; the force is thought to leave the body upon death and become an ancestor spirit. These spirits continue to be active in the lives of living relatives—by either punishing or rewarding them. In a similar way to saints in the Catholic tradition, some long-dead ancestors (for instance, great hunters or religious leaders) are venerated by people outside their former family.
* Nature spirits, worshiped mainly in forested regions, are often the embodiment of particular locations such as whirlpools, springs and mountains. The afterlife is believed to exist underground, especially under lakes, where ghostly replicas of Congolese villages reside.
* Diviners, witches, dream interpreters and healers act as conduits for supernatural forces.
* Ceremonies and collective prayers—to ancestors, nature spirits and the creator god—are generally performed at particular locations such as sacred trees, grottoes or crossroads. These ceremonies usually take place at a specific time of day. The location and times vary according to the ethnic group.

Belief in [[Witchcraft]] is common, and sometimes intersects with the more fundamentalist and evangelical versions of Christianity. In recent years, these beliefs have gained adherents in urban areas, whereas before they were mainly confined to the countryside. The increasing beliefs in witches and sorcery have tended to mirror the social decay caused by war and poverty. Many of the street children that roam the Congo's cities have been cast out of their families after being denounced as witches. These homeless 'witch children' often live in cemeteries and only come out at night, and follow occult practices. See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4727745.stm BBC News article] on Kinshasa's street children. For comparison, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20060110144046/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/issues/1997-06-05/feature.html article on beliefs of Miami street children].

===Catholic and Protestant Christianity===
[[File:Culture of DRC - religion.jpg|thumb|250px|A Congolese Christian.]]
Christianity has a long history in Congo, dating back to 1484, when the Portuguese arrived and convinced the king and entourage of the Kongo people to convert. In 1506, a Portuguese-supported candidate for kingship, [[Alfonso I of Kongo]] won the throne. Alfonso (the Kongo royal family had begun to take on Portuguese names), established relations with the Vatican. More widespread conversion occurred during the Belgian colonial era. Christianity varies in its forms, and is in some ways surprisingly similar to native beliefs.

During the colonial period, a European-style Christianity was at first promoted by the authorities. Native Congolese generally attended different churches or services from whites. If they worshiped under the same roof, the native Congolese sat on benches at the back, while the whites sat in chairs at the front. Towards the end of the colonial era, more African elements were incorporated into Christianity, including songs and dances which were formerly condemned as [[Paganism|pagan]]. Eventually, even native fables and myths were appropriated and merged into Congolese Christianity, in a similar process to that which occurred with Christianity in Europe.

Recent developments include the increasing popularity of the "Gospel of Prosperity"&amp;nbsp;– a form of Christianity in which the emphasis is on wealth acquisition and born-again Christianity. Adherents are led to believe that instant wealth and magical prosperity will result from giving tithes to their charismatic preacher. The leaders often draw on the techniques of American televangelists, and the message is appealing to those living in extreme poverty.

===Kimbanguism===
In the first half of the 20th century, prophetic movements sprang up. Their nature was both anti-colonial and Christian, and led to a rigorous crackdown by the authorities.

[[Simon Kimbangu]] was the prophet of the largest of these movements. He was born in a village near Kinshasa, raised and educated by a Protestant Christian mission and trained to become a priest. In April 1921, at the age of 39, he reportedly had a religious vision of Jesus Christ, who called on him to reconvert his people and dedicate his life to Christ. Kimbangu chose to try to ignore the vision, and fled to Kinshasa where he abandoned his life as a priest and took to menial work. More visions came, and eventually he heeded the calling and returned to his home village and started to devote his life to Christ.

Soon after, he is reported to have healed a sick woman by laying his hands on her. Dozens of apparent miracles were subsequently performed by Kimbangu, and he gained followers from surrounding villages and towns. The official Catholic organizations protested to the authorities, and the Protestant church abandoned him. The economic effects of Kimbangu's ministry were being felt, with thousands of Congolese leaving their work to listen to Kimbangu speak. In June the Belgians arrested him for inciting revolution and civil disobedience. Four months later he was sentenced to death. After an international outcry, [[Albert I of Belgium]] commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. He died 30 years later in prison, in 1951.

Colonial authorities assumed his movement would wither after his imprisonment and death, but the church continued to flourish underground, and was an effective weapon in the fight against colonialism. In the post-colonial era, its record has been more mixed. Instead of banning the church, Mobutu used a far more effective method of neutralizing it: namely co-opting the church and giving it an official status. Kimbanguism has now spread across the country, and now has branches in nine of the surrounding countries, making it the most popular "native" form of Christianity in Africa. Followers do not smoke, drink alcohol and abhor violence. [[Monogamy]] is practiced.

===Religion today===
Article 22 of the constitution allows for religious freedom. These rights are generally respected by the government. [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35348.htm] Religious tension exists in some areas because of the link between prophetic groups and [[paramilitary]] organizations. In the turbulent eastern region, where the [[Second Congo War]] still simmers, some [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] groups have a major religious element, believing for instance that they are able to turn enemy bullets into water by wearing certain fetishes.

==Media and literature==
The two main strands of Congolese [[literature]] are:
* A revival of ancestral and native traditions
* Addressing the themes of contemporary society

Only 2.86% of the land is cultivated, and most of this is used for [[subsistence farming]]. People gather wild [[fruit]], [[mushrooms]], and [[honey]], as well as hunt and fish. They will often sell these crops at markets or by the roadside. [[Cattle breeding]] and the development of large-scale agricultural businesses has been hindered by the recent war and the poor quality of the road system.

Congo's farmland is the source of a wide variety of crops. These include [[maize]], [[rice]], [[cassava]] (manioc), [[sweet potato]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[taro]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], [[tomato]], [[pumpkin]] and varieties of [[peas]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. These foods are eaten throughout the country, but there are also regional dishes. The most important crops for export are [[coffee]] and [[palm oil]].

==Music==
Congolese musicians, like [[Le Grand Kallé]], were extremely influential in pioneering the musical style of ''"African Rumba"''', a blend of South American and traditional African musical styles, more often known as ''[[Soukous]]'' in the years leading up to the independence of the [[Belgian Congo]]. Congolese musicians were supported by the [[Mobutu]] regime in [[Zaire]] during the Cold War, and musicians like [[Pépé Kallé]] became incredible popular in the international francophone market into the 1990s.

==Cinema==
{{See also|Cinema of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

In the years following independence, the nascent Congolese film industry was held up by many years of war. However, the first Congolese feature film ([[La Vie est Belle (1987 film)|''La Vie est Belle'']] by the celebrated director [[Mwezé Ngangura]]) was released in 1987. In recent years, Congolese cinema has reached a wider audience, though the growth of the industry is restricted by the small profits which directors can make (owing to unauthorized distribution) and rarity of credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Congo, quel cinéma !|url=http://www.fcat.es/FCAT/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=808&amp;Itemid=37|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual art==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}

The Congolese are known for their art. Traditional art includes masks, wooden statues, art of the [[Kuba Kingdom]], textiles and woven arts. Notable contemporary artists are [[Chéri Samba]] or [[Bodys Isek Kingelez]]. The best known artists successful inside and outside the country are [[Lema Kusa]] (painting), Alfred Liyolo (sculpture), Roger Botembe (painting), Nshole (painting), Henri Kalama Akulez (painting), Mavinga (painting), Freddy Tsimba (sculpture), Claudy Khan (painting). Some are teaching at the Académie de Beaux-Arts de Kinshasa, which is the only arts academy of a university level in Central Africa.

{{Cuisine of China}}

'''Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining''' are the traditional behaviors observed while eating in [[Greater China]]. Traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] customs have spread throughout [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]], but sometimes evolved differently {{ndash}} especially following the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist revolution]] that produced the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]]. Even within Mainland China, there are many customs and protocols involved in formal dining, applying to almost all aspects of the experience, from guest seating to paying the bill.

==Table and place settings==
[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun 名星海鮮酒家 Star Seafood Restaurant round table March-2012 Ip4.jpg|thumb|right|Place settings before a meal is served]]
In most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared communally. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups, particularly in restaurants, in order to permit easy sharing. [[Lazy Susan]] turntables are a common feature at the center of larger tables, to facilitate passing of serving dishes.
A basic place-setting consists of a small teacup; a large plate with a small, empty rice bowl; a set of chopsticks, usually on the right of the plate; and a spoon. Additions may include a chopstick holder; a large water or wine glass; and a smaller glass for ''[[baijiu]]''. At homes and low-end restaurants, napkins may consist of [[Tissue paper|tissue]]s or occasionally must be provided by the dinner. High restaurants often provide cloth napkins similar to western dining as part of the place-settings.
=== Formal seating order ===
There is a specific seating order to every formal dinner, based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The seat of honor, reserved for the host or oldest person, is usually the one in the center facing east or facing the entrance. Others with higher status then sit in close proximity to the seat of honor, while those with lower positions sit further away. The least prominent seat is generally the one nearest to the kitchen entrance or service door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internations.org/hong-kong-expats/guide/15908-culture-shopping-recreation/dining-in-hong-kong-etiquette-15914|title=Dining in Hong Kong: Etiquette|website=www.internations.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
Wide variations exist throughout China, but the vast majority of full-course dinners are very similar in terms of timing and dishes.

===Snacks===
Snacks are the first items presented. Two or more small dishes are brought to the table, holding boiled unsalted peanuts, salted roasted peanuts, or similar dishes. These may be consumed while ordering, or while waiting for other dishes to arrive.

===Beverages===
Tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. It can be consumed at leisure throughout the meal. (Water is sometimes served, but tea is the default beverage.) A verbal "thank you" ({{zh|s=谢谢|p=xiexie|labels=no}}) may be offered to the server pouring the refill or, if in the middle of a conversation where it would be rude to interrupt the speaker, the table may be [[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|tapped twice with two bent fingers]] instead.

===Main course===
{{see also|dim sum}}
This typically consists of many dishes, usually roughly one dish per person. White rice is provided in small bowls and food is often consumed over it, flavoring it with their sauces. The rice is consumed little by little along with the other dishes and not separately, unless the diner remains hungry after the last dish has been removed.

A soup may also be served as one of the dishes. At small meals, especially at home, it may replace the diners' beverage entirely.

===Starch===
Near the end of the meal, a starch dish {{ndash}} noodles, [[jiaozi|Chinese dumplings]], or ''[[baozi]]'' {{ndash}} is sometimes served, to ensure that guests are satiated.

==Manners and customs ==
Eating is a dominant aspect of [[Chinese culture]], and eating out is one of the most common ways to honor guests, socialize, and deepen friendships.&lt;ref name="Dob"&gt;Dobsons, Richard. ''China Cycle'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwBFSfy_f0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA20 p. 20]. 2006. 8 Feb 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper [[etiquette]] is very important to traditional Chinese people, who feel good manners invite [[luck]], and boorish conduct brings [[shame]]. Although many [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] programs aimed to curtail traditional social practices, today table etiquette is again taken as an indication of educational status, so that (for example) a child misusing their chopsticks at a formal dinner might embarrass their family, who are responsible for teaching the child.&lt;ref name="Dob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cha"/&gt;

===Inviting guests===
Although individual households may have their own house rules, the Chinese traditions used to welcome guests are largely the same throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Mor"&gt;Morse, Edward. ''Glimpses of China and Chinese Homes'', p. 65. Kegan Paul, Int'l (New York), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu"&gt;Hu Wenzhong &amp; al. ''Encountering the Chinese: A Guide for Americans'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gInx5N7gGg4C&amp;pg=PA39 35–40]. 1999. Accessed 21 Jan 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There are common rules for inviting guests over.&lt;ref name="Cha"&gt;Chai, May-Lee &amp; al. ''China A to Z'', p. 104. Plume Books (New York), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zho"&gt;Zhou, Cathy. ''Chinese Etiquette and Culture'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&amp;pg=PA26 p. 26]. 2005. Accessed 21 Jan 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dining===

====Drinking====
Water and other non-alcoholic beverages may be consumed at any time. However, in formal settings, alcohol should be consumed during [[toast (honor)|toasts]]. A modest toast may be followed by a single sip of wine or swallow of beer, but a ''baijiu'' toast is often ended with ''Ganbei!'' ({{lang|zh|干杯}}): an exhortation to drain the glass. Ideally, glasses are refilled immediately following a toast in preparation for the next.

====Lazy Susan====
[[File:Lazy Susan.jpg|thumb|A lazy Susan in use]]
A [[Lazy Susan]] is a circular rotating tray placed at the center of a table and used to easily share a large number of dishes among the diners. A Lazy Susan can be made from many materials, but most often they are constructed of glass, wood, or plastic.

It is typical for all the dishes for a course to be brought out together and placed around the Lazy Susan. If the dishes come out one at a time or if there is some special delicacy, they are typically served to the guest of honor first and then rotated clockwise around the table. The host will often wait to serve himself last. Dishes should typically not be removed from the Lazy Susan and placed on the table: at most, one should hold the dish aloft while serving and then return it to its place on the tray.

One should try to avoid moving the Lazy Susan even slightly when someone is in the act of transferring food from the dishes to their plate or bowl. Likewise, it is impolite to hoard or use up all of a dish until it has been offered to everyone and the other diners clearly do not care for it. For this reason, it is common to take a smaller amount from the dishes on the first round and to keep the other diners in mind when taking a larger second helping.

=====Personal=====
{{See also|Eating utensil etiquette}}
Since [[chopsticks]] (and [[spoon]]s) are used in place of [[fork]]s and [[knives]], [[Chinese cuisine]] tends to serve dishes in bite-size pieces or employ cooking techniques that render dishes such as fish or ''[[hong shao rou]]'' soft enough to be picked apart easily.&lt;ref name="Inn"&gt;Inness, Sherrie. "Home Cooking ." Kitchen Culture in America: Popular Representations of Food, Gender, and Race (2001): 14. Web. 21 Jan 2010. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Ik7w8jQhzHMC&amp;pg=RA4-PA14&amp;dq=chinese+table+etiquette&amp;lr=&amp;ei=7flXS7G0IaaolQTd3rCwAw&amp;cd=31#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20table%20etiquette&amp;f=false&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Some common etiquette is:&lt;ref name="Hu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sue"&gt;Fox, Sue. "Chapter 19: On the Go: Travel Manners for Land, Sea, and Air ." Etiquette for Dummies (2007): 319. Web. 21 Jan 2010. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=HGno_t1crwwC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=Dining+Etiquette+china&amp;lr=&amp;cd=34#v=onepage&amp;q=Dining%20Etiquette%20china&amp;f=false&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chopsticks should always be the same length and held so that the ends are even, a practice popularly explained as due to the former use of uneven boards ({{lang|zh|三長兩短}}) in Chinese coffins.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
*Similarly, do not leave chopsticks sticking upright out of dishes, owing to a [[Chinese veneration of the dead|Chinese practice]] of leaving such dishes for the dead, and visual similarity to burning incense for the dead.
*Do not chew on the ends of chopsticks, even if they are plastic.
*Chopsticks are not used to move [[bowls]] or [[Plate (dishware)|plates]].
*Do not bang your chopsticks as though you were playing a drum. It implies you are a beggar or a child.
*Treat chopsticks as extension of your [[finger]]s. It is impolite to use them to point at other people or to wave chopsticks around.
*Unless they are disposable, chopsticks will be washed and reused. Consequently, don't use them to pick at your teeth or for other unseemly endeavors.
*Avoid spearing food with the chopsticks.
*One should not 'dig' or 'search' through one's food for something in particular. This is sometimes known as "digging one's grave" or "grave-digging" and is extremely poor manners.
*When not in use, and if the restaurant provides them, place the front end of the chopsticks on the chopstick rests. These are usually small ceramic rests placed near your napkin on the right hand side of your bowl.
*Both hands should be above the table even when the left hand is not holding a utensil. For right-handed people who hold chopsticks in their right hand, their left hands either hold down the bowl on the table, or pick it up so that it is near the mouth. It is considered rude to leave the left hands on their laps, although exceptions are sometimes made when eating from a plate.

=====Communal=====
[[File:Spoon and chopsticks.jpg|thumb|upright|Photo showing serving chopsticks (''gongkuai'') on the far right, personal chopsticks (''putongkuai'') in the middle, and a spoon. Serving chopsticks are usually more ornate than the personal ones.]]
At most formal meals, there are likely pairs of communal serving chopsticks ({{lang|zh|公筷}}, ''gongkuai''). These are sets of chopsticks specifically for shared dishes only. Often, these will be distinct from the ''putongkuai'' (regular chopsticks) in that they will be longer and more ornate. There will sometimes be one set of communal chopsticks per dish or one set per course. The ratio varies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jt6u8RZw51cC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=chinese+table+manners&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20table%20manners&amp;f=false 9][https://books.google.com/books?id=0TV8ebayzNUC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=chinese+table+manners&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JjgsT7FHg8qEB4fynIUD&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20table%20manners&amp;f=false 10][https://books.google.com/books?id=npxUXbUg6uUC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=chopstick+manners&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=chopsticks&amp;f=false 11]
[https://books.google.com/books?id=32uyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=chopstick+etiquette&amp;dq=chopstick+etiquette&amp;hl=en 12]&lt;/ref&gt; If there are no gongkuai set on the table, it is never rude to request that they be provided.  People will just think that you are a stickler for formality and good manners.

==Bill==
In most restaurants in Chinese countries, there is no tip required unless it is explicitly posted. Usually, if there is a tip required, it will already be on the bill. In Chinese restaurants in the US though, tips are usually expected.

It is a common sight for families to fight for the bill, as paying the bill symbolizes generosity and sincerity.

[[File:AIP double feature.jpg|right|thumb|A poster advertising [[American International Pictures]]' double feature of ''[[Die, Monster, Die!]]'' and ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]''.]]
The '''double feature''', also known as a '''double bill''', was a [[motion picture]] industry phenomenon in which theatre managers would exhibit two films for the price of one, supplanting an earlier format in which one feature film and various short subject reels would be shown.

==Early opera use==
Opera houses staged two operas together for the sake of providing long performance for the audience. This was related to one-act or two-act short operas that were otherwise commercially hard to stage alone. A prominent example is the double-bill of  ''[[Pagliacci]]''  with ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' first staged on 22 December 1893 by the [[Metropolitan Opera|Met]]. The two operas have since been frequently performed as a double-bill, a pairing referred to in the operatic world colloquially as "Cav and Pag".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips-Matz, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and format==

The double feature originated in the 1930s. Previous to the 1930s, the dominant presentation model consisted of the following:  
* One or more live acts
* An [[animated cartoon]] [[short subject]]
* One or more live-action comedy shorts
* One or more novelty shorts
* A [[newsreel]]
* The main [[feature film]]
With the widespread arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model. [[Movie theaters]] suffered a downturn in business in the early years of the [[Great Depression]].

Theater owners decided they could both attract more customers and save on costs if they offered two movies for the price of one. The tactic worked, audiences considered the cost of a theater ticket good value for several hours of escapist and varied entertainment, and the practice became a standard pattern of programming.

In the typical 1930s double bill, the screening began with a variety program consisting of [[film trailer|trailer]]s, a [[newsreel]], a cartoon and/or a short film preceding a low-budget second feature (the [[B movie]]), followed by a short interlude. Lastly, the high-budget main feature (the A movie) ran.

A [[neighborhood theatre]] running a double feature won out over a higher-priced first-run theatre with only one feature film. The major studios took note of this, and began making their own B features using the technicians and sets of the studio and featuring stars on their way up or on their way down.  The major studios also made [[film series]] featuring recurring characters.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Although the double feature put many short comedy producers out of business, it was the primary source of revenue for smaller Hollywood studios, such as [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] and [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]], that specialized in B movie production.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The double feature arose partly because of a studio practice known as "[[block booking]]," a form of [[Tying (commerce)|tying]] in which major Hollywood studios required theaters to buy [[B-movie]]s along with the more desirable A-movies. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decided that this practice was illegal in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' in 1948, contributing to the end of the [[studio system]].

Even after the studio requirement was dropped, many smaller or independent [[neighborhood theatre]]s, especially [[drive-in theatre]]s, sought double features to bring in more patronage.  By the end of the 1940s double features were regular policy at 29 percent of American cinemas with 36 percent having them part-time. After the Paramount Decree the sources of the second feature had changed.&lt;ref&gt;p.78 Schatz, Thomas ''History of the American Cinema: American Cinema in the 1940s. Boom and Bust Volume 6'' University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; The second feature could be:
* a major studio re-release of an older feature, 
* an older feature re-released from firms that specialised in acquiring and rereleasing older films such as [[Realart]] and [[Astor Pictures]],
* a low budget feature contracted from a smaller studio.

[[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] formed their [[American International Pictures]] with the idea of providing a double feature of two [[B pictures]] for often less than the price of a single A feature, or taking a lower percentage of the cinema's grosses than the major studios.&lt;ref&gt;p.124 Doherty, Thomas ''Teenagers and Teenpics'' Unwin-Hyman 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, double features had been mostly abandoned in non–drive-ins in favor of the modern single-feature screening, in which only one feature film is exhibited. However, double bills of popular series that had previously been run as a single feature such as the [[James Bond]] and [[Matt Helm]] [[superspy]] genre and ''[[The Man With No Name]]'' and ''[[A Stranger in Town (1967 film)|The Stranger]]'' [[spaghetti western]]s were re-released together by the main studios.

While most cinemas have discontinued the practice of showing the double feature, it has nostalgia appeal. [[The Astor Theatre]] in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], established in 1936, continues the tradition of the double feature.

Short films still occasionally precede the feature presentation ([[Pixar]] films generally feature a short, for example), but the double feature is now effectively extinct in first-run movie theaters in the U.S.

Following the success of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', three [[Roger Rabbit]] cartoon shorts were created to be shown as preludes to other Disney films, in an effort to revive the viewing of cartoon shorts before major films. Only three were made and the scheme failed.&lt;ref&gt;Double Feature [https://doublefeature.fm/2009/dark-crystal-who-framed-roger-rabbit The Dark Crystal + Who Framed Roger Rabbit], September 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[repertory]] houses continue to show two films, usually related in some way, back to back.

During the 1990s, many [[VHS]] cassettes that showed two films on the same tape (the second was often a sequel to the first film) were self-named as "double features."

In 2007, filmmakers [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]] released their individual films ''[[Planet Terror]]'' and ''[[Death Proof]]'' as a double feature under the title ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', edited together with fake [[exploitation film]] trailers and 1970s-era [[Snipe (theatrical)|snipe]]s in order to replicate the experience of viewing a double feature in a [[grindhouse]] theater. Although ''Grindhouse'' received critical acclaim, it was a complete financial flop in the United States. The films were screened individually in international markets and on DVD.

Another recent double feature was the [[Duel Project]], when Japanese directors [[Ryuhei Kitamura]] and [[Yukihiko Tsutsumi]] created competing films to be shown and voted on by the premier audience.

More recently, two double features of re-released popular films hit the big screen. The first was of the re-release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' that started October 2, 2009 before the release of ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' in the following year. Both films were in [[Disney Digital 3D]] in select movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hartford Informer [http://media.www.hartfordinformer.com/media/storage/paper146/news/2009/10/22/Entertainment/toy-Story.ReRelease.Provides.Trip.Down.Memory.Lane-3810466.shtml 'Toy Story' Re-Release Provides Trip Down Memory Lane]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, October 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The second double feature, and the most recent one, was a re-release of ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon]]'' for one night only, on June 29, 2010, shortly before the midnight screening of ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]'' in select theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=twilightnewmooncombo.htm|title=Twilight/New Moon Combo (one-night-only)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, it was announced that the 14th [[Pokémon]] movie ''[[Victini and the Black Hero: Zekrom and Victini and the White Hero: Reshiram]]'', due in July, would be released as a double-feature, though both films are actually "versions" of each other, with differences related to plot points and character designs varying between the version being watched.

'''''Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Isaac Asimov]], published in 1987. It is about a group of scientists who shrink to microscopic size in order to enter a human brain so that they can retrieve memories from a comatose colleague.

==A retelling of the original story==
Despite the title, ''Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain'' is not a sequel to ''Fantastic Voyage'', which is a novelization that Asimov wrote from the 1966 [[Fantastic Voyage|film of the same name]].  Asimov was never quite happy with the original novel because although he was able to change some of the scientific details, it was not entirely his own work.  Therefore, he wrote ''Fantastic Voyage II'' as a new, separate story or [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] that shares only the central concept of miniaturized scientists entering a human body.

==Plot==
The story takes place in the mid to late 21st century: the [[Cold War]] has ended, yet the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regime remains strong and proud.  Americans and Soviets enjoy peace, but without fully accepting each other's ways, and with each always struggling for technological superiority and the prestige that accompanies it.

Under conditions of absolute secrecy, the Soviets have developed a [[Resizing (fiction)|miniaturization]] technology that can reduce a human to the dimensions of a molecule, or smaller.  However, the process requires an enormous input of energy to miniaturize even a small object for a short time.  So, although miniaturization has been shown to be scientifically possible, it also appears to be economically impracticable - a hollow triumph.

One Soviet scientist, Pyotor Leonovich Shapirov, a pioneer of the miniaturization process, had spoken vaguely of a way to make it affordable.  Unfortunately, he now lies in a [[coma]], with his secrets apparently locked away forever.

But Shapirov had been acquainted with an American scientist, Albert Jonas Morrison, who has his own peculiar theories regarding the brain's processing and storage of creative thought.  Shapirov had been greatly intrigued by Morrison's ideas, and it's this interest that led the Soviets to turn to Morrison for help.

After a great deal of coercion, Morrison agrees to be miniaturized along with four Soviet scientists, enter Shapirov's dying brain, and attempt to use his computer program to retrieve the thoughts contained therein.

Later, having returned safely to normal size, but without any usable information from Shapirov, Morrison has made a new, startling discovery, which may help the Americans beat the Soviets at their own game.

==Scientific details==
In the novel, [[Resizing (fiction)|miniaturization]] is achieved by reducing the value of [[Planck's constant]] within a finite field, which it claims is the only conceivable way to do it.  However, in reducing Planck's constant, the Soviet miniaturization process leaves the speed of light unchanged, and this is supposedly the reason for the extreme energy requirements.

The novel suggests two ways to solve the problem.  One is to capture the energy that's released during deminiaturization and convert it into an electromagnetic field.  That harnessed energy, then, could presumably be used to partially power the next miniaturization.  But this is only an off-the-cuff idea, and although helpful, it would not be enough to make miniaturization truly affordable.

The other idea, which is the idea that's locked away in Shapirov's brain, is to couple Planck's constant with the speed of light, so that when one is decreased, the other is increased.  Shapirov claimed that that would lead to a very low cost miniaturization, but nobody else has any idea of how to accomplish it.

During the mission inside Shapirov's body, Morrison discovers that his programmed computer, instead of reading Shapirov's thoughts, has actually been reading the thoughts of Morrison's shipmates.  This causes Morrison to theorize that if a number of people were united telepathically using his machine, those people might form a super-human [[think tank]] that could rediscover Shapirov's theories in short order.

As for practical applications for miniaturization, in addition to all of the obvious possibilities, the novel suggests that if a ship were reduced to the proper size, it could travel at many times the ordinary speed of light.  Controlling the direction of that flight would be a significant problem, because at a small enough size, the ship would simply radiate in a random direction.

==Relation to ''Robot'' series==
This novel is implied to be included in the fictional universe of the ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series; near the end of the novel, an American scientist describes fictional components of a [[robot]]ic [[positronic brain]].

==Reception==
''Kirkus Reviews'' said the novel "slips down easily enough but leaves no lingering impression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FANTASTIC VOYAGE II by Isaac Asimov |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/isaac-asimov/fantastic-voyage-ii/ |website=Kirkus Reviews |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=15 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of Guatemala''', often referred to as "Pabellón Nacional" (literally, "National Flag") or "Azuliblanco" ("Blue and White") features two colors: [[sky blue]] and [[white]]. The two sky blue stripes represent the fact that [[Guatemala]] is a land located between two oceans, the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[Caribbean sea]]); and the sky over the country (see [[Himno Nacional de Guatemala|Guatemala's national anthem]]). The white signifies peace and purity. The blue and white colors, like those of several other countries in the region, are based on the flag of the former [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. 

In the center of the flag is the [[Coat of arms of Guatemala|Guatemalan coat of arms]].  It includes the [[resplendent quetzal]], the national bird of Guatemala that symbolizes [[liberty]]; a [[parchment]] [[scroll]] bearing the date of Central America's independence from [[Spain]], 15 September 1821; crossed [[rifle]]s, indicating Guatemala's willingness to defend itself by force if need be; a [[bay laurel]] crown, the symbol for victory; and crossed swords, representing [[honor]]. The flag is one of only three national flags of [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]] to feature a [[firearm]], the others being those of [[Flag of Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Flag of Haiti|Haiti]].

== History ==
The  [[Federal Republic of Central America]] flag was used in Guatemala until 1851, when a pro-Spanish faction took over and added the Spanish colors of red and yellow to the flag. The original colors were restored on August 17, 1871, but as vertical (rather than horizontal) stripes in order to distinguish it from other flags and with a new coat of arms.

The resplendent quetzal previously appeared in the 1830s in the flag of [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], the sixth state in the Federal Republic.

[[File:Bandera de los Pueblos Guatemala.png|thumb|right|''Bandera de los Pueblos'', flag attributed to indigenous peoples.]]
In 2008 a flag called the ''Bandera de Los Pueblos'' (Flag of indigenous peoples) was adopted by law and is shown together with the national flag of Guatemala in all events featuring the [[President of Guatemala]] since then. The flag is divided in four parts, red, yellow, white and black, each colour representing [[Xinca people]], [[Garifuna people]], [[Maya peoples]] and [[Ladino people]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Flags of the World page [http://www.fotw.net/flags/gt.html "Guatemala"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117185333/http://www.fotw.net/flags/gt.html |date=2008-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These colours are also part of the ''Q'anil'', a Maya symbol in which each color represents a point of the compass, an element of nature and a part of the human being. ''Q'anil'' means "seed" in [[Maya script]], and is also used for one of the 20 days of the [[Maya calendar]].
Aimed at promoting "interculturality" in Guatemala, the ''Bandera de los Pueblos'' was received with coolness by the leaders of the peoples, who do not seem to have been consulted.&lt;ref&gt;Flags of the World page [http://www.fotw.net/flags/gt.html "Guatemala"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117185333/http://www.fotw.net/flags/gt.html |date=2008-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of Saint Lucia''' consists of a [[cerulean blue]] field charged with a yellow [[triangle]] in front of a white-edged black [[isosceles triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flag of Saint Lucia|url=http://www.govt.lc/stluciaflag|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopted in 1967 to replace the British [[Blue Ensign]] [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the arms of the colony, it has been the flag of [[Saint Lucia]] since the country became an [[West Indies Associated States|Associated State]] of the [[United Kingdom]] that year. Although the overall design of the flag has remained unchanged, specific aspects of it have been altered over the years.

==History==
The French colonised Saint Lucia in 1635 and subsequently signed a treaty with the local indigenous population 45 years later in 1680.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=St Lucia profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19833217|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=October 18, 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British vied for control with the French, and the island frequently switched hands between the two powers.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite web|title=History of St Lucia|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-lucia/history|date=|accessdate=September 26, 2014|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued until 1814, when the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed that saw France permanently relinquish Saint Lucia to the British,&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; and it became a [[crown colony]] of the [[United Kingdom]] within [[British Empire|its colonial empire]] in that same year.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; During this colonial period of French and British rule, Saint Lucia did not have its own [[National flag|unique colonial flag]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Whitney|last=Smith|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Flag of Saint Lucia|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355481/flag-of-Saint-Lucia|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=September 26, 2014|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British finally granted Saint Lucia its own unique [[Coat of arms of Saint Lucia|coat of arms]] in August 1939. The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] consisted of a black shield featuring two sticks of bamboo forming a cross, with two [[Tudor rose]]s symbolising [[England]] and two [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis]] symbolising [[France]] occupying the four quadrants. This emblem was utilised to [[Defacement (flag)|deface]] the British [[Blue Ensign]] in order to form the territory's flag.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The island became part of the [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 to 1962.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; However, this political union turned out to be unsuccessful, and on 1 March 1967 – five years after the federation was dissolved – Saint Lucia became an [[West Indies Associated States|Associated State]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; This gave the territory full control over domestic matters, while Britain retained responsibility for the island's [[Foreign policy|foreign affairs]] and [[National security|defence]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The territory's new flag, which was designed by native Saint Lucian artist [[Dunstan St Omer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHZ25JlDrjYC&amp;pg=PA96e|title=Saint Lucia|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2008|last=Orr|first=Tamra|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St Lucia: Michelangelo of the Caribbean|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/centralamericaandcaribbean/saintlucia/722278/St-Lucia-Michelangelo-of-the-Caribbean.html|date=February 12, 2000|first=Richard|last=Newton|accessdate=October 1, 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted on that same day.&lt;ref name=complete&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yahq8im86kC&amp;pg=PA36|title=Complete Flags of the World|publisher=Penguin|date=6 January 2009|last=Kindersley Ltd.|first=Dorling|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Saint Lucia became an independent country on 22 February 1979, the overall design of the flag from twelve years before remained unchanged,&lt;ref name=complete/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Island of St. Lucia fights independence from Britain|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GthBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LqoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4781,2860925&amp;dq=flag+of+saint+lucia&amp;hl=en|date=February 21, 1979|page=23|accessdate=October 1, 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph-Herald|location=Dubuque, Iowa|agency=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the blue colour's shade and the triangles' sizes were modified marginally.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Despite the fact that the island already had its own distinct flag by the time it became a sovereign state, the [[Union Jack]] was still lowered for the final time at the official ceremony marking independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Little Caribbean island goes it alone|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JJ8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8OkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4407,1161536&amp;dq=flag+of+saint+lucia&amp;hl=en|date=February 22, 1979|page=2A|accessdate=October 1, 2014|newspaper=The Miami News|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several distinct, although overlapping categories of '''fool''' as a stock character in [[creative works]] (literature, film, etc.) and [[folklore]]: simpleton fool, clever fool, and  serendipitous fool.

==Silly fool== 
&lt;!--cut and paste from WMoG article for now --&gt;
{{main|Simpleton; see also Adam Waller}}

A silly, stupid, simpleton, luckless fool is a butt of numerous jokes and tales all over the world.

Sometimes the foolishness is ascribed to a whole place, as exemplified by the  [[Wise Men of Gotham]]. The localizing of fools is common to most countries, and there are many other reputed imbecile centres in England besides Gotham. Thus there are the people of [[Coggeshall]], [[Essex]], the "carles" of [[Austwick]], [[Yorkshire]], the "gowks" of Gordon, [[Berwickshire]], and for many centuries the charge of folly has been made against silly [[Suffolk]] and [[Norfolk]] (''Descriptio Norfolciensium'' about twelfth century, printed in Wright's ''Early Mysteries and other Latin Poems'').&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Stapleton, ''All about the Merry Tales of Gotham''  (Kessinger Publishing, 2005), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]] there are the "{{Interlanguage link multi|Schildburgers|de|3=Schildbürger}}", from the fictitious town of "Schilda"; in the [[Netherlands]], the people of [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]]; in [[Bohemia]], the people of Kocourkov; and in [[Moravia]] the people of Šimperk. There are also the Swedish Täljetokar from [[Södertälje]] and Kälkborgare from Kälkestad, and the [[Denmark|Danish]] tell tales of the foolish inhabitants of the [[Molbo story|''Molboland'']]. In [[Latin America]], the people of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] are the butt of many jokes.{{cn|date=August 2015}} In Spain, the people of Lepe, a town in Andalusia, follow a similar fate.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Among the [[ancient Greeks]], [[Boeotia]] was the home of fools; among the [[Thracians]], [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]]; among the ancient [[Jews]], [[Nazareth]]; among modern Jews, [[Chełm#"Wise Jewish Men of Chelm"|Chełm]]; among the ancient Asiatics, [[Phrygia]].&lt;ref name=Seal2001&gt;G. Seal, ''Encyclopedia of folk heroes'' (ABC-CLIO, 2001), pp. 272-3
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subcategories===
In [[Jewish folklore]], [[Schlemiel]] and [[Schlimazl]] are two popular subtypes of a fool. The following saying helps to tell them apart:  a schlemiel is a man who spills hot soup on a schlimazl: the first one is clueless, while the second one is luckless.&lt;ref name=egge/&gt;

[[wikt:numskull|Numbskull]]/noodlehead stories are about well-meaning folks who take an advice too literally to their own grievance or who find the most complicated solution to the most simple problem. However, sometimes they may end with luck ("serendipitous fool"). These can vary from an  absent-minded professor (a stock character in itself) to Jack form ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' who exchanged cow for a bean. In that, numbskull stories overlap with [[trickster]] stories, where a numbskull is often a "mark" (victim) for a trickster.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Hamilton and Mitch Weiss, an introduction to "Noodlehead Stories: World Tales Kids Can Read And Tell", as cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=KdFlWZfpXRwC&amp;pg=PA99 ''Storytelling for Young Adults: A Guide to Tales for Teens'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wise and clever fools==
[[File:Altes Rathaus München - Fassade 005.jpg|thumb|left|150px|German jester depicted at [[Old Town Hall, Munich|Altes Rathaus]] ln [[München]] ]]

{{main|Jester|Wise fool|Shakespearean fool|Holy fool}}

Many tales are based on the idea that a simple nature of a fool is a guise of wisdom, or even the wisdom itself.&lt;ref name=egge/&gt;

On the other hand, the [[jester|mask of a fool]] may be used to utter wise but unpleasant truths. Some classify jesters into two categories: "natural fools" (people who lacked social awareness and could occasionally utter the truth simply being unaware of social conventions) and "licensed fools" (often picked to be jester for their physical handicap, and their telling the truth was simply part of "job description").&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to ''[[The Tragedy of King Lear]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521847915}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lP6o8VPZgogC&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to jesters, naturally stupid people gave rise to other categories of respected fools, such as [[holy fool]], e.g., ''[[yurodivy]]'' in Russian tradition, [[avadhuta]]  in some Indian religions, and other manifestations of "[[crazy wisdom]]" in various cultures.

==Serendipitous fool==

{{double image|right||150||150|Ivan the Fool in peasant's and in princely clothes}}

In scenarios of this kind a simpleton, a laughing stock in the end wins big, usually a princess or a kingdom, or wealth, or all the above. [[Brothers Grimm]] have three tales of a lucky simpleton. ''[[The Queen Bee]]'', ''[[The Three Languages]]'' and ''[[The Three Feathers]]''. In these the fool gets help from animals.&lt;ref name=egge&gt;[http://www.acjna.org/acjna/articles_detail.aspx?id=72 Stock Figures in Jewish Folklore: Universal Yet Uniquely Jewish], by Solveig Eggerz (retrieved January 24, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The luck of the Russian folk character ''[[Ivan the Fool]]'' comes from his simplicity.

==Heroes, villains and fools==

While some characters are archetypal fools, at the same time, the coordinates "[[hero]]/[[villain]]/fool may be seen as major measures of any character. Sometimes these traits mix or boundaries are blurred."&lt;ref&gt;Orrin Edgar Klapp, "Heroes, Villains, and Fools: The Changing American Character", 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach - Der Jungbrunnen (Gemäldegalerie Berlin).jpg|right|thumb|407x407px|[[The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)|The ''Fountain of Youth'']], 1546 painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

The '''Fountain of Youth''' is a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), and the stories of [[Prester John]] (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Age of Exploration]] (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of [[Bimini#The Fountain of Youth|Bimini]].

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]], first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now [[Florida]] in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de León was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.

==Early accounts==
[[Herodotus]] mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the [[Macrobians]], which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.{{Quote|The [[Ichthyophagi]]d then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond that age{{mdash}}they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. When the Ichthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 3|Book III]]: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

A story of the "Water of Life" appears in the Eastern versions of the [[Alexander romance]], which describes [[Alexander the Great]] and his servant crossing the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of [[Al-Khidr]], a sage who appears also in the [[Qur'an]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Aljamiado]] versions of the ''Alexander Romance'' were very popular in Spain during and after the period of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish rule]], and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern [[Kollam]]&lt;ref&gt;Kohanski, Tamarah &amp; Benson, C. David (Eds.) ''The Book of John Mandeville''. Medieval Institute Publications (Kalamazoo), 2007. "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/tkap2.htm Indexed Glossary of Proper Names]". Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, John. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/782/pg782.txt The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]''. Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly [[Gothic art]], appearing for example on the ivory [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European [[Age of Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peck, Douglas T|title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage|url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=New World Explorers, Inc|accessdate=2008-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:French - Mirror Cover with the Fountain of Youth - Walters 71170.jpg|thumb|French 14th-century ivory mirror case with a ''Fountain of Youth'']]

European [[iconography]] is fairly consistent, as the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. [[Eternal youth]] is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the [[philosopher's stone]], [[universal panacea]]s, and the [[elixir of life]] are common throughout [[Eurasia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1440837982|location=Westport, CT|pages=35–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in the [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus]] heals a man at the pool in [[Jerusalem]].

==Bimini==
{{main|Bimini#The Fountain of Youth}}
According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s in [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of ''Beimeni'' or ''Beniny'' (whence [[Bimini]]), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called ''la Vieja'' during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; This land also became confused with the [[Boinca]] or [[Boyuca]] mentioned by [[Juan de Solis]], although Solis's navigational data placed it in the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; [[Sequene]], an Arawak chief from [[Cuba]], purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water [[mangrove]] swamp that covers {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the shoreline of North Bimini is ''The Healing Hole'', a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, [[Mineral water|mineral-laden]] fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and [[magnesium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt;EPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATER MAGNESIUM;EVIDENCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH

==Ponce de León==
[[File:Ponce de León.jpg|thumb| 19th-century German artist’s impression of [[Juan Ponce de León]] and his explorers drinking from a spring in [[Florida]] while supposedly seeking the Fountain of Youth]]
In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]]. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of ''[[Bimini|Beniny]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]], the name{{mdash}}and legends about Boinca's fountain of youth{{mdash}}became associated with the [[Bahamas]] instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

The connection was made in [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]'s ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; A similar account appears in [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara. ''Historia general de las Indias'', second part.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Memoir'' of [[Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda]] in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda&gt;[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html "Fontaneda's Memoir"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his ''Memoir'' he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls "[[Jordan River (symbolism)|Jordan]]" and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda /&gt;

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his ''Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano''. Herrera states that local [[cacique]]s paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume "all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children." Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every "river, brook, lagoon or pool" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages 1492{{ndash}}1616'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
{{main|Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park}}
[[File:Fountain of Youth postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the Fountain of Youth in St. Augustine]]
The city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike gold rush]] of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as "Diamond Lil". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo.&lt;ref name="KimJonesNPS2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sujin Kim |author2=Robert 0.

The exact spot of the landing will probably never be known. The claim that the actual site of the landing has been definitely established at the Fountain of Youth Park seems unsupported by satisfactory evidence. The Fountain of Youth seems to be a well, not a spring, and to be without authenticated historical importance. One gets the impression that an effort is made to give the tourists their money's worth and to popularize history with such revisions as will best serve the gate receipts, and that in so doing historical accuracy has suffered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell later claimed to have "discovered" on the grounds a large cross made of [[coquina]] rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. 

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Clark|title=A Concise History of Florida|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBl3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22|date=23 September 2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-62585-153-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first archaeological digs at the Fountain of Youth were performed in 1934 by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. These digs produced a large number of Christianized [[Timucua]] burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the [[Mission Nombre de Dios]], this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]'s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.

== Plot ==
In the country of Amestris, [[Edward Elric]] and his younger brother [[Alphonse Elric|Alphonse]] live in the rural town of Resembool with their mother Trisha while self-learning alchemy at a young age. When the brothers commit the taboo act of Human Transmutation to resurrect Trisha after she dies of illness, it backfires and they suffer the consequences via the Law of Equivalent Exchange: Edward loses his left leg, while Alphonse is dragged into the Gate of Truth. Edward then sacrifices his right arm to save his brother's soul and bind it to a suit of armor via a blood seal, later replacing his missing limbs with "automail" prosthetics. Edward later receives an invitation by Colonel Roy Mustang to join the military so he can research a means of restoring Alphonse's body. After becoming a State Alchemist with the title "Fullmetal Alchemist", accompanied by their childhood friend and Automail mechanic Winry Rockwell, Edward begins his quest with Alphonse to find the legendary [[philosopher's stone]] which could repair their bodies.

Years later, Edward and Alphonse confront a cultist named Father Cornello, whom they believe is using a philosopher's stone to recruit the people of Liore. As Mustang arrives to personally handle the situation, Edward exposes Cornello while the stone is revealed to be a fake. After reaching East City and spending the night at the home of Major Maes Hughes and his pregnant wife, the brothers are provided with lodging when Major General Hakuro introduces them to Shou Tucker, a bio-alchemy authority who obtained his State Alchemist credentials by creating a talking chimera. As the brothers become fast friends with the man's young daughter Nina and their dog Alexander, Tucker suggests Edward to find Dr. Tim Marcoh as he created a philosopher's stone prior to going into hiding. Alphonse remains behind to be examined by Tucker, who causes Alphonse to question his existence, while Edward and Winry head to Marcoh's last known whereabouts.

Though Marcoh was murdered by Cornello's benefactor Lust as he and Winry find him, Edward acquires the man's notes and asks Hughes to decipher them while unknowingly alienating Alphonse to keep him safe. Hughes later makes a horrific discovery from his investigation and ends up being killed by Lust's associate Envy, who assumes Mustang's form to frame the colonel for the murder. Edward manages to escape being interrogated with help from Mustang's aide Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, using what he could deduce from the notes to investigate the clandestine Fifth Laboratory. At the same time, after revealing the new talking chimera that he created from Nina and Alexander, Tucker forces Alphonse and Winry to accompany him to the Fifth Laboratory, where they find Edward as he verbally realizes that the Philosopher's Stone is created from humans.

Tucker confirms Edward's realization, justifying their respective actions of selfishly manipulating life before Lust kills him while revealing herself as a homunculus. After Lust cryptically hints of her group's reach in the government and an upcoming event that Edward has a vital role in, Hakuro reveals the Mannequin Soldier homunculi and gets killed when he prematurely activates them. Mustang has Riza and their men keep the Mannequin Soldiers from flooding out of the laboratory while he confronts Lust and Envy, killing the former while ripping her philosopher's stone core from her body. While Mustang gives Edward the stone so he can restore Alphonse, Edward instead uses it to appear before his brother's body and promises to find another way to restore him. Edward then returns to his reality to reaffirm Alphonse's existence to him. Sometime after, as Gluttony mourns Lust's death, Envy is revealed to have survived Mustang's attack but has been diminished to its true parasitic form as a result.

== Production ==
[[File:Fumihiko Sori from acrofan.jpg|thumb|left|Director Fumihiko Sori]]
The film was originally planned to be produced in 2013 but because of low budget and also technology, it was delayed until it was officially announced for production in May 2016. According to the director's press conference in March 2017:

{{quote|
That’s right. Well, since the main characters are the two brothers, where there is Ed, there will always be Al. Even just based on that, the amount of CG used becomes enormous. In this work, I’m using a technology that was used in [[Hollywood]] movies such as ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. We’re using a lot new techniques that were never used in Japanese movies before, I would like to boost Japan’s CG level with this movie."

Since the original story consists of 27 volumes, I cut it down in to two hours, but we will stay faithful to the manga. I can’t tell you much details yet, but I think that you can guess what will be the main story based from the cast that was already announced. Since I’m a big fan of the original myself, I don’t plan to change the setting, the world view, and make a different story, so please don’t worry about that. Of course we will have the [[philosopher's stone]] coming out [somewhere in the story].&lt;ref&gt;https://hagarenmovie.tumblr.com/post/157573232695/translation-entermix-most-anticipated-japanese &lt;!--translate by aizawanika.com--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Long quote|date=June 2017}}
}}On adapting the source material, Fumihiko Sori said, "I want to create a style that follows the [[Fullmetal Alchemist|original manga]] as much as possible. The cast is entirely Japanese, but the cultural background is [[Europe]]. However, it's a style that doesn't represent a specific race or country." Regarding the faithfulness of the adaptation, which has characters of non-Japanese ethnicity, the director said, "There will never be a scene in which a character says something that would identify him/her as Japanese."

Sori told [[Oricon]] he has a deep affection for the story that tells the "truth of living," and said, "It is my dearest wish to turn this wonderful story into a film, and it is not an exaggeration to say that I am living for this reason." He added that he "wants to create a wonderful film that uses techniques that challenge [[Hollywood]]," and noted that nowadays Japanese filmmaking techniques have progressed greatly.&lt;ref name="ann" /&gt;
On 19 February 2018, the film released on Netflix as a [[Netflix original film|Netflix Original Film]].[[File:Stadt Panorama 1 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Filming was spotted in June 2016 in the Italian town of [[Volterra]]]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2093">'''Future generation''' or '''Future generations''' refers to the [[generation]] or generations to come in the [[future]], after the currently living generations of humans. The future generation is contrasted with past generations or generations past. 

The term started to be used in reference to the impact the currently living generations have on the world future generations will live in, the world they'll inherit from humans living today. 
Current generations have a moral obligation to provide for sustainable living conditions not just to the future of their own children (cf. [[Think of the children]]) but indirectly also to the future of their children's children.
This is referred to in the most widely quoted definition of [[sustainability]] as a part of the concept [[sustainable development]], is that of the [[Brundtland Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] on March 20, 1987: “sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly (1987) [http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm ''Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future''].

'''Greenhouse Sports''' aims to develop social, thinking, emotional and physical skills for young people in London’s communities through sports programmes delivered by coaches.

Greenhouse Sports (originally Greenhouse Schools Project and then later Greenhouse Charity) was founded in 2002 when Chief Executive and founder, Michael de Giorgio, set up a multisports pilot to give young people on a local housing estate something positive to do in the school holidays. In 2004 the organisation then moved their programmes full-time into schools.

[[Image:TorgPic.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team of Virginia Tech (2007)]]
The '''Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team of Virginia Tech''', better known as '''HEVT''', is a nationally recognized undergraduate student design team in the Department of [[Mechanical Engineering]] at [[Virginia Tech]].  HEVT was formed in 1994 to compete in the 1995 Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Challenge, one of the many competitions organized by the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] through the [[United States Department of Energy]].  HEVT has been involved in the Department of Energy Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions (AVTCs) ever since.     HEVT attributes a significant amount of its success to their Advisor, Professor Doug Nelson in Mechanical Engineering.  Dr. Nelson has received the Outstanding Faculty Advisor award at competition 3 times. He has greatly aided the education of students at [[Virginia Tech]] and helped the team succeed at competition The overall highlights of past competitions are as follows:

==Outreach==

HEVT devotes time each month to community outreach, in which they provide the community with information about sustainability, hybrid technology, AVTCS and the team. Outreach events target youth, community members, influencers, other students and the media. A few of HEVT's outreach events that have occurred within the past few years include National Odyssey Day, EcoDrive, Relay for Life and Innovation under the Hood.

==Competitions==

===FutureCar===
Virginia Tech's HEVT placed first in the 1996 challenge held in Detroit.  In 1996 HEVT also received awards for best workmanship, most energy efficient vehicle, lowest regulated tailpipe emissions, best use of alternative fuels, and overall best dynamic handling.  The 1996 vehicle was based on a 1995 [[Chevrolet Lumina]], donated through PNGV, which utilized a [[General Electric]] electric motor, a three-cylinder [[Geo Metro]] engine, and a large battery pack.  The vehicle, fueled by propane, could go 600 miles without refueling while getting between 40 and 50 [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|mpgge]] (Crumbley 1996).

HEVT placed second in the 1997 competition (UW 1997).

HEVT tied with the University of Wisconsin team for first place in the 1998 FutureCar Challenge (Launey 1998).  That year HEVT also won awards for best consumer acceptability, best vehicle design inspection, best acceleration, best dynamic handling, best overall engineering design, and best solo autocross (ECE News 1998).

During the 1999 FutureCar Challenge, HEVT's entry became the first vehicle during the competition series to operate as a functional [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]] vehicle; at the time the vehicle was considered to be one of only a handful of operable fuel cell vehicles in the world (Lypen 1999).  The fuel cell used in the vehicle was provided by the [[United States Department of Defense|U. S. Department of Defense]] and carried a price tag of $250,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] (VT Magazine 1999).  This 1999 entry was based on a 1998 Chevrolet Lumina and was designed as a series hybrid operating with the hydrogen fuel cell, a custom built lead acid battery, and an AC induction motor drivetrain. HEVT placed second in the 1999 competition.

===FutureTruck===
After the 1999 competition series ended, the FutureCar program was replaced with the FutureTruck program.  The FutureTruck program was created to address the environmental and energy related issues created by the increased demand of [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV's]] in the [[United States]].  Fifteen engineering schools from across [[North America]] were accepted as the participants in this five-year engineering program.  The goal of the competition was to re-engineer a popular SUV to a lower emissions vehicle with an improvement of at least 25% in [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]].  Each entrant vehicle also was required to meet safety, performance, and utility goals.  Main sponsors of the FutureTruck program include the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy's]] Office of Efficiency and Renewable Energy, [[General Motors]], and the [[Ford Motor Company]].  The program was managed by Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Transportation Research (FutureTruck).

HEVT had only five months to complete the conversion of their 2000 FutureTruck entry vehicle based on a stock [[Chevy Suburban]].  This entry from Virginia Tech won first place at the 2000 competition which began on June 7, 2000.  The 2000 FutureTruck competition was held at the [[General Motors]] [[GM Desert Proving Grounds|Desert Proving Grounds]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]].

During the 2002 competition, HEVT was awarded the MathWorks Teamwork &amp; Leadership Award.

During the 2003 competition, HEVT was awarded the Spirit of the Challenge Award, and also received a third place award in the National Instruments Most Innovative Use of Virtual Instrumentation category.

===ChallengeX===
[[File:Virginia Tech’s Challenge X vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|'''Virginia Tech's REV&lt;sub&gt;LSE&lt;/sub&gt;''']]
[[Challenge X|Challenge X: Crossover to Sustainable Mobility]] was a design competition completed in the Spring of 2008.

HEVT placed Fourth in the first year of the Challenge X competition series (Sharp), First in the second year, Third in the third year, and eighth in the final year.  Problems with heavy rains and the Belted Alternator Starter motor (BAS) caused the team to place lower than anticipated in the fourth year.

In the second year of the Challenge X competition, HEVT was the first place team (Gurski).  Virginia Tech's competition entry, the REV&lt;sub&gt;LSE&lt;/sub&gt; (Renewable Energy Vehicle, the Larsen Special Edition) is a split parallel hybrid using a Ballard Ranger 67&amp;nbsp;kW [[Electric motor#Three-phase AC induction motors|ACI]] rear traction motor, an 8&amp;nbsp;kW [https://web.archive.org/web/20061220010927/http://www.koncar-mes.hr/engl/project/home.aspx MES] belted alternator starter, and a Saab 2.0 L [[Flexible-fuel vehicle|Flex Fuel]] SI engine running on [[E85]] – an ethanol/gas blend.  Virginia Tech also won first place in lowest well-to-wheels petroleum energy usage, with an overall reduction of petroleum consumption of 74 percent over the stock vehicle, best written technical reports, lowest regulated tailpipe emissions, and lowest time braking and handling (Challenge X).

===EcoCAR===
[[EcoCAR|EcoCAR: The NeXt Challenge]] competition was completed in Spring of 2011. The following is cut from the EcoCAR website:

"EcoCAR seeks to advance the level of vehicle technology capable of reducing petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while demonstrating the real-world performance of a range of technology options."

This is the main goal of the EcoCAR competition.  General Motors donatated a crossover SUV to the team to use as a base vehicle.

HEVT is using a 4-cylinder, 2.4L E85-capable engine from a Chevrolet HHR to power a 4-speed automatic transmission from a Saturn Vue Green Line.  This engine powers the front axle and acts as a range extender for the extended-range electric vehicle.  The "VT-REX" vehicle has about a 45-mile all-electric range using a custom A123 Systems battery to power a Siemens electric traction drive capable of about 80&amp;nbsp;kW of power.  Since HEVT will have a large electric range with engine off operation, the air conditioning compressor will work off of high voltage and a DC-DC converter will create about 13.8 V from the high voltage bus to power the 12V accessory loads.

In 2009, HEVT placed 6th overall in the design year of competition. The Year 1 EcoCAR competition focused on hardware-in-the-loop simulation modeling of the design, and creating predictions of performance and fuel economy. The team placed first in the overall competition.

===EcoCAR 2===
[[EcoCAR 2: Plugging into the Future]] was a three-year collegiate engineering competition. Students were challenged to turn a 2013 Chevrolet Malibu Eco from a "mundane, mild hybrid" into an "incredible hypermilling prototype." Competition organizers strove to give participants a real-world, hands-on experience that would prepare them for the workforce. As of 2014, approximately 100 of General Motors's engineers had participated in EcoCAR or previous competitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/the-real-prize-for-gms-ecocar2-challenge-a-job-offer/&lt;/ref&gt; HEVT placed sixth in the overall competition.

===EcoCAR 3===
[[EcoCAR 3]] HEVT is currently taking part in EcoCAR 3 [http://ecocar3.org/vthevt/about-us/] a competition in which teams have four years to redesign, rebuild and refine a Chevrolet Camaro into a hybrid electric vehicle.

HEVT earned second place in the year 1 final competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://vtengineering.tumblr.com/post/122777586990/virginia-techs-hevt-wins-second-place-in-ecocar-3&lt;/ref&gt; EcoCAR 3 organizers evaluated each team on all of the required pre-competition deliverables, including a facility inspection,high voltage safety demonstration, an architecture selection proposal, and in-depth communication, business and engineering plans. The team won second place in the Stakeholder Status and Electrical presentations and third in the mechanical presentations
This fall (2015) HEVT enters the second year of the competition.

==Notes==
The main facilities for HEVT are located on the [[Virginia Tech campus]] in the [[Virginia Tech Campus#Ware Lab|Ware Lab]].  HEVT consistently participates in industry sponsored design events and is committed to the development and implementation of advanced vehicle technologies leading to green transportation.

It spread rapidly across the [[Hispanic America|Spanish-American]] countries during the 19th century.

Julepe is a variant of [[Tute]] and one of the many games of the tute family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ludoteka.com/julepe-en.html |title=Julepe |author=Jokosare S.L. |date= |work=Rules of the game |publisher=Ludoteka.com |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the game is played according to the same rules of tute. It is noted that the original Julepe, in which game three cards are dealt to each player, is the card game presently known as Tomate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acanomas.com/Reglamentos-Juegos-de-Naipes/971/Julepe.htm |title=Julepe - Reglamentos de Naipes |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Acanomas Networks |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five cards are dealt to each player from a [[Baraja (playing cards)|40-card pack]] lacking 8s, 9s, and 10s. The next card is turned up for trumps. Players may pass or play. Those who play must win at least two tricks,&lt;ref&gt;Parlett, David (1996). ''Oxford Dictionary of card Games'', [[Oxford University Press]], pg. 138. {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may first discard and draw any number of replacements.

== Objective ==

To win a game, a player should have the highest value [[trump (card games)|trump]] card at play, non-trump card, or the highest card of the suit played by the first player.  At least two tricks should be gained in game in order to gain chips toward your pot . If the opponent makes less than one, the chips wagered by this player will be subtracted from his pot. Most importantly, the name of the game is to ''hacer julepe'' or "Make the whist," i.e. winning '''at least two tricks''' during the game, as is the bare minimum.

== Playing the game ==

In each game, each player should play a card, and the one who plays the highest one wins the round and the wagers from that first round, keeping in mind:

a) if the first player to play a card has the Ace of the [[#trump|trump]] suit, it is recommended that it be played. Otherwise, you should [[#Dividing the Pot|Divide the Pot]], since with this action you [[#Force|Force]] the other players to play a trump card for this round.

b) if the first player leads with a card different from the [[#trump|trump]] suit, the other players are [[#Force|Forced]] to continue playing that suit. If the player is found to have played incorrectly, that player is forced to [[#Divide the Pot|split the pot]], which is also punishable by [[#Fall|Falling]], or, in the instance that the player does not have that suit, a trump card must be played. If the player has neither of the former cards, any card can be played.

c) if all the cards are of the same suit, the player with the highest value card wins.

d) if the round has begun with a suit different from the [[#trump|trump]] and a trump card is played subsequently, and the other players after the one who played the trump card are NOT required to play the trump, thus allowing them to play any card.

=== Dealing ===
Prior to beginning the game, cards are dealt to each player face-up, one-by-one around the table, until the first Coin suit (palo de Oro) card appears. The player whom receives this card is deemed the first dealer. The order of play is determined by the person to the dealer's RIGHT in the next round. The dealer deals 5 cards and selects the type of game that shall be played, being either a [[#Normal Wager|Normal Wager]] or a [[#Blind Wager|Blind Wager]] game. Depending on the type of game selected, the wager should be defined before beginning to deal and the players should place the same bet before receiving his/her cards. Following this, three cards are dealt to each player.

=== Trump (triumph) ===
After having dealt, the deck is placed in the middle of the table and the top card is flipped. The suit of this first card is thus considered the Trump suit, or ''triunfo,'' and any card of this suit automatically beats any card from another suit, despite its value. If the flipped trump card is an Ace or a Three, the player that deals can take this card, without seeing your{{Who|date=January 2012}} cards. This player is called the ''postre'' (lit. dessert) of the game. The ''postre'' takes the trump with the condition that the dealer win '''three tricks''' ''tres bazos'', as opposed to merely ''hacer julepe''. Otherwise, the dealer will [[#Fall|Fall]] for not having met this condition at the end of the round.

=== Normal wager ===
Now is where the real game begins. The player to the RIGHT of the dealer decides if he passes or plays, and every player afterward follows suit, until the round is over. If the decision to pass or play falls on the dealer, and if no player has selected to play, the dealer deals again and the dealer repeats the round. If only one player decides to play, the [[#Widow|Widow]] is offered, first to the [[#Fall|Fallen]]. If the Fallen player does not agree, the Widow is offered to the rest of the players, starting with the player RIGHT of the dealer. If no one wants the Widow, the player should play against the dealer. Within those players that decided to play, the first one to the RIGHT of the dealer plays a card first. The next player to his RIGHT plays a card, attempting to beat the previously played card, playing a card of the same suit or, if you have no cards from that suit, a trump card. The player that wins the first hand has thus won a trick, and three hands are to be played this way. (One card=One hand) If a player that chose to play did not win, did not meet the his bid, or the Widow, or chooses to [[#Divide the Pot|divide the pot]], this player [[#Fall|falls]].

=== Blind wager ===
The dealer deals three cards face-down to each player and each player is forced to play this round. The player RIGHT of the dealer starts the round, placing his card on the table. According to who wins this hand, that player begins the next round. The game is played like this until the whole game is played through. All the players whom did not win are considered Fallen.

=== Widow ===
When only one player elects to play (while all other players have elected to '''pass'''), the Widow is offered to the other players, which are required to meet the amount of Widows they bid. (A Widow=Three Cards=Three Hands)

=== Fall ===
It is when a player did not meet the bid made previously, with a Widow, or did not win any hands. This player must place an amount equal to the total amount of wagers made in that round into the collective wager pot. (Example: If three players played and bid 3 chips, the Fallen places 9 chips into the pot) All the Fallen must place this quantity of chips into the pot, absolving the other players  from betting.

=== Dividing the pot ===
You divide the pot when you do not play according to the rules and hence distribute the collected wager pot between the winners.

=== Force ===
Condition that forces you to play a card, as long as it is the same as the card thrown initially or not having to play a same-suit card if a trump suit is played before you.

The dealer is always allowed to force, forcing other players to play a face card (jack, horse, or king). The face card is taken and another card is discarded. The one who has forced, is forced himself to win at least 2 tricks.

The '''kakapo''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: '''''kākāpō''''') or ''night parrot'', also called '''owl parrot''' (''Strigops habroptila''), is a species of large, [[Flightless bird|flightless]], [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family [[New Zealand parrot|Strigopoidea]], [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] to [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Best1984"&gt;{{cite journal|first=H.

It has finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a distinct facial disc of sensory, [[vibrissa|vibrissa-like]] feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and wings and a tail of relatively short length. A combination of traits make it unique among its kind; it is the world's only flightless parrot, the heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] in body size, has a low [[basal metabolic rate]] and no male parental care, and is the only parrot to have a [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]] [[Lek (mating arena)|lek]] breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| year=2006| first1=Ralph G. |last1=Powlesland |first2=Don V. |last2=Merton |authorlink2=Don Merton| first3=John F. |last3=Cockrem| pages=3–26| title=A parrot apart: the natural history of the kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus''), and the context of its conservation management |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its anatomy typifies the tendency of bird evolution on oceanic islands, with few predators and abundant food: a generally robust physique, with accretion of [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] efficiency at the expense of flight abilities, reduced wing muscles, and a diminished [[Keel (bird)|keel]] on the [[sternum]].&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kakapo was historically important to the [[Māori people|Māori]], the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore; however it was also heavily hunted and used as a resource by Māori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. Kakapos were also occasionally kept as pets.

The kakapo is critically endangered; as of August 2018, the total known adult population was {{Number_of_Living_Kakapo}}&lt;!-- see link on talk page for editing this number --&gt; [[List of kakapo|living individuals]], as reported by the Kakapo Recovery programme, most of which have been given names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.anotherchancetosee.com/2006/08/kakapo-parrots-86-names.html| title=KAKAPO PARROTS – The 86 Names| publisher=anotherchancetosee.com| date=4 August 2006| accessdate=6 February 2007| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212012141/http://www.anotherchancetosee.com/2006/08/kakapo-parrots-86-names.html| archivedate=12 February 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Polynesian and European colonisation and the [[Invasive species in New Zealand|introduction of predators]] such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats, the kakapo was almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery plan in the 1980s. 

As of April 2012, surviving kakapo are kept on three predator-free islands, [[Codfish Island|Codfish (Whenua Hou)]], [[Anchor Island|Anchor]] and [[Little Barrier Island|Little Barrier]] islands, where they are closely monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/kakapo-habitat/|title=Kakapo Habitat|publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barrier"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kakapo relocated to raise chicks|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/6746273/Kakapo-relocated-to-raise-chicks|publisher=stuff.co.nz|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two large Fiordland islands, [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution]] and [[Secretary Island|Secretary]], have been the subject of large-scale [[Island restoration|ecological restoration]] activities to create self-sustaining [[ecosystem]]s with suitable habitats for the kakapo.

==Taxonomy, systematics and naming==
[[File:Kakapo2.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of a kakapo from the book "A History of the Birds of New Zealand" by Walter Lawry Buller, published in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzbirds.com/birds/kakapo.html |title=New Zealand Birds &amp;#124; Birds &amp;#124; Gallery &amp;#124; Kakapo, ''Strigops habroptilus'' |publisher=Nzbirds.com |date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The kakapo was originally described by English [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] [[George Robert Gray]] in 1845. The common English name "kakapo" comes from the [[Māori language]], where it is now spelled "kākāpō"; from ''kākā'' ("parrot") + ''pō'' ("night"). Its generic name ''Strigops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''strix'', genitive ''strigos'' "owl", and ''ops'' "face", while its specific [[epithet]] ''habroptila'' comes from ''habros'' "soft", and ''ptilon'' "feather".&lt;ref name=Liddell1980&gt;{{Cite book| authorlink1 = Henry George Liddell | last1=Liddell | first1=Henry George | authorlink2=Robert Scott (philologist) | first2=Robert | last2=Scott | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bird has so many unusual features that it was initially placed in its own [[tribe (biology)|tribe]], Strigopini. Recent [[phylogenetic]] studies have confirmed the unique position of this genus as well as the closeness to the [[kākā]] and the [[kea]], both belonging to the New Zealand parrot genus ''Nestor''.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grant-Mackie/&gt;&lt;ref name=deKloet/&gt; Together, they are now considered a separate superfamily within the parrots, Strigopoidea.&lt;ref name="revision"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2012/f/z03205p040f.pdf|author=Joseph, Leo|year=2012|title= A revised nomenclature and classification for family-group taxa of parrots (Psittaciformes)|journal= Zootaxa|volume= 3205|pages= 26–40|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the Strigopoidea, the kakapo is placed in its own [[family (biology)|family]], Strigopidae. The common ancestor of the kakapo and the genus ''[[Nestor (genus)|Nestor]]'' became isolated from the remaining parrot species when New Zealand broke off from [[Gondwana]], around 82 million years ago. Around 70&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the kakapo diverged from the genus ''Nestor''.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Multilocus Molecular Phylogeny of the Parrots (Psittaciformes): Support for a Gondwanan Origin during the Cretaceous|journal=Mol Biol Evol|year=2008|first=T.

Earlier ornithologists felt that the kakapo might be related to the [[Pezoporus|ground parrots]] and [[night parrot]] of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Schodde|Schodde, R.]] &amp; [[Ian J.

==Description==
[[File:Strigops habroptilus 1.jpg|thumb|left|A year-old kakapo on [[Codfish Island]].]]
The kakapo is a large, rotund parrot; the adult can measure from {{convert|58|to|64|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and weight can vary from {{convert|0.95|to|4|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} at maturity.&lt;ref name="Higgins1999"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Higgins |first=P.

The kakapo cannot fly, having relatively short wings for its size and lacking the [[Keel (bird anatomy)|keel]] on the [[sternum]] (breastbone), where the flight muscles of other birds attach. It uses its wings for balance and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt;

The upper parts of the kakapo have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity – museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''habroptilus''. The kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the "owl parrot". The beak is surrounded by delicate [[whiskers|vibrissae]] or "whiskers", which the bird uses to sense the ground for navigation as it walks with its head lowered. The mandible is mostly ivory-coloured, with part of the upper mandible being bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, [[dactyly|zygodactyl]] (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt;
[[File:New Zealand Kakapo Felix.jpg|upright|thumb|The "whiskers" around the beak.]]
Females are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller [[Beak#Cere|cere]] and [[Beak#Nares|nostrils]], more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a [[brood patch]] on the bare skin of the belly.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt;

The kakapo's altricial young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They then become fully feathered at approximately 70 days of age, when they fledge. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green coloration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resemble eyelashes.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006" /&gt;

Like many other parrots, kakapos have a variety of calls. As well as the ''booms'' (see [[Kakapo#Media|below]] for a recording) and ''chings'' of their mating calls, they will often loudly ''skraark'' to announce their location to other birds.&lt;ref name="CloseUp"/&gt;

The kakapo has a well-developed [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], which complements its nocturnal lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Hagelin04"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in only one other parrot species.&lt;ref name="Hagelin04"/&gt; The kakapo has a large olfactory bulb ratio (longest diameter of the olfactory bulb/longest diameter of the brain) indicating that it does, indeed, have a more developed sense of smell than other parrots.&lt;ref name="Hagelin04" /&gt; One of the most striking characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour.&lt;ref name="CloseUp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/up-close-and-personal/|title=Up Close &amp; Personal|publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a [[pheromone]]. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildinfo.net/facts/Kakapo.asp?page=/facts/Kakapo.asp|title=Kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'')|publisher=Wild Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a nocturnal species, the kakapo has adapted its senses to living in darkness. Its optic tectum, nucleus rotundus, and entopallium are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight. These modifications allow the kakapo to have enhanced light sensitivity but with poor visual acuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Internal anatomy===
The skeleton of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, [[vestigial]] keel and a shortened [[spina externa]]. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the [[furcula]] is not fused but consists of a pair of [[clavicles]] lying in contact with each [[coracoid]]. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.&lt;ref name="Livezey1992"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] musculature of the kakapo is also modified by flightlessness. The [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis]] and [[supracoracoideus]] muscles are greatly reduced. The [[propatagialis tendo longus]] has no distinct muscle belly. The [[sternocoracoideus]] is tendinous. There is an extensive [[cucularis capitis clavicularis]] muscle that is associated with the large crop.&lt;ref name="Livezey1992"/&gt;

==Ecology and behaviour==
[[File:Kakapohist.svg|thumb|250px|Historic distribution of the kakapo.
{{legend|#44a844|Maximum distribution since 1840}}
{{legend|#ced362|Fossil evidence}}]]
It seems that the kakapo – like many of New Zealand's bird species – has [[evolution|evolved]] to occupy an [[ecological niche]] normally filled by various species of mammal (the only non-marine mammals native to New Zealand are [[List of mammals of New Zealand#Order: Chiroptera (bats)|three species of small bats]]). Before the arrival of humans, the kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. It lived in a variety of habitats, including [[tussock grass|tussocklands]], scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited [[forest]]s dominated by [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] ([[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]], [[Prumnopitys taxifolia|matai]], [[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides|kahikatea]], [[Podocarpus totara|totara]]), [[Nothofagus|beeches]], [[tawa (tree)|tawa]], and [[Metrosideros umbellata|rata]]. In [[Fiordland]], areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, [[Aristotelia serrata|wineberry]], [[bush lawyer (plant)|bush lawyer]], [[tutu (plant)|tutu]], [[hebe (plant)|hebes]], and [[coprosma]]s – became known as "kakapo gardens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=P. N. |title=Vegetation associated with kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'' Gray) in Sinbad Gully, Fiordland, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Botany |volume=14 |pages=151–159 |date=1975 |doi=10.1080/0028825x.1976.10428889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kakapo is considered to be a "habitat generalist".&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006" /&gt; Though they are now confined to islands free of predation, they were once able to live in nearly any climate present on the islands of New Zealand. They survived dry, hot summers on the North Island as well as cold winter temperatures in the sub-alpine areas of Fiordland. Kakapos were mostly found in the areas adjacent to dense, temperate rainforests, but the species was not exclusively forest-dwelling. All kakapo that were transferred to predator-free islands in the last decades have adapted well to any changes in environment and food plants.

The kakapo is primarily nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night.&lt;ref name="Best1984"/&gt;

Though the kakapo cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also "parachute" – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres at an angle of less than 45 degrees.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; With only 3.3% of its mass made up of pectoral muscle, it is no surprise that the kakapo cannot use its wings to lift its heavy body off the ground. Because of its flightlessness, it has very low metabolic demands in comparison to flighted birds. It is able to survive easily on very little or on very low quality food sources. Unlike most other bird species, the kakapo is entirely herbivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, and rhizomes. The sex ratio of kakapo offspring is dependent on the diet of the mother. Higher protein diets tend to lead to higher percentages of males among the offspring. When foraging, kakapo tend to leave crescent-shaped wads of fiber in the vegetation behind them, called "browse signs".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Having lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs. [[Animal locomotion|Locomotion]] is often by way of a rapid "jog-like" gait by which it can move several kilometres.&lt;ref name="Higgins1999"/&gt; A female has been observed making two return trips each night during nesting from her nest to a food source up to {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powlesland |first1=R.

After mating, the two mated individuals separate to continue on alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://notornis.osnz.org.nz/reischeks-1890-paper-kakapo-strigops-habroptilus-wild-and-captivity|title=Reischek's 1890 paper on 'The Kakapo ( Strigops habroptilus ) in the wild and in captivity' {{!}} Notornis and Birds New Zealand|website=notornis.osnz.org.nz|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--might be able to get this simplified; someone familiar with the topic will have to do so.--&gt;

The kakapo was a very successful species in pre-human New Zealand,&lt;ref name="GOG"/&gt; and one of the reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day.&lt;ref name="GOG"/&gt; Apart from the two surviving New Zealand [[Bird of prey|raptors]], the [[New Zealand falcon]] and [[swamp harrier]], there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: [[Haast's eagle]] and [[Eyles' harrier]].&lt;ref name="GOG"/&gt; All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the [[laughing owl]] was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.&lt;ref name="LWOTM"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Worthy |first1=T.

[[File:051226-kakapo-billbooming.ogg|thumb|The sound of a kakapo booming]] 
Mammalian predators, in contrast to birds, rely on their sense of smell and hearing to find prey and often hunt by night.&lt;ref name="GOG"/&gt; The kakapo's adaptations to avoid avian predation have thus been useless against its new enemies – this is one of the reasons for its massive decline since the introduction of dogs, cats and [[Mustelidae|mustelids]] – see ''[[Kakapo#Human impact|Conservation: Human impact]]''. A typical way for humans to hunt down the kakapo is by releasing trained dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The habits of flightless birds of New Zealand: with notes on other flightless New Zealand birds| first=R. |last=Henry| year=1903| publisher=Government Printer| location=Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breeding===
[[File:Kakapo egg hatching.jpg|thumb|left|Hatching egg]] 
The kakapo is the only species of flightless parrot in the world,&lt;ref name="Merton1984"/&gt; and the only flightless bird that has a [[lek (mating arena)|lek]] breeding system.&lt;ref name="CFGNZW"&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins Field Guide to New Zealand Wildlife |first1=Terrence |last1=Lindsey |first2=Rod |last2=Morris |publisher=HarperCollins New Zealand |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-86950-300-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females listen to the males as they display, or "lek".&lt;ref name="Merton77"&gt;[[Don Merton|Merton, D. V.]] (1976). Conservation of the kakapo: a progress report. In ''Proc. Science in Nat. Parks.'' . National Parks Authority, Wellington, N.Z. National Parks Series No. 6: 139–148.&lt;/ref&gt; They choose a mate based on the quality of his display; they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed; males and females meet only to mate.

During the courting season, males leave their home ranges for hilltops and ridges where they establish their own mating courts. These leks can be up to {{convert|7|km|mi|0}} from a kakapo's usual territory and are an average of {{Convert|50|m|ft|-1}} apart within the lek arena. Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season. At the start of the breeding season, males will fight to try to secure the best courts. They confront each other with raised feathers, spread wings, open beaks, raised claws and loud screeching and growling. Fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0959270900001933 |last1=Clout |first1=M. N. |last2=Merton |first2=D. V. | authorlink2=Don Merton |date=1998 |title=Saving the kakapo: The conservation of the world's most peculiar parrot |journal=Bird Conservation International |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=281–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mating occurs only approximately every five years, with the ripening of the rimu fruit. In mating years, males making "booming" calls for 6–8 hours every night for more than four months.

Each court consists of one or more saucer-shaped depressions or "bowls" dug in the ground by the male, up to {{Convert|10|cm|in|0}} deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The kakapo is one of only a handful of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks.&lt;ref name="CFGNZW"/&gt; Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound:&lt;ref name="Merton1984"/&gt; the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males' booming mating calls.&lt;ref name="CFGNZW"/&gt; Each male's bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend {{Convert|50|m|ft|-1}} along a ridge or {{Convert|20|m|ft|-1}} in diameter around a hilltop.&lt;ref name="Merton1984"/&gt; Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. One way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl; if the male visits overnight, he will pick them up in his beak and toss them away.

To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a [[thorax|thoracic]] sac.&lt;ref name="Higgins1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockrem2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cockrem |first=J. F. |title=Reproductive biology and conservation of the endangered kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'') in New Zealand |journal=Avian and Poultry Biology Reviews |date=2002 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=139–144 |doi=10.3184/147020602783698548}}&lt;/ref&gt; They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After a sequence of about 20 loud booms, the male kakapo emits a high-frequency, metallic "ching" sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the kakapo: Breeding |url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/breeding/ |publisher=Kakapo Recovery |accessdate = 3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stands for a short while before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least {{Convert|1|km|mi}} away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least {{Convert|5|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Merton1984"/&gt; Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard.

Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.
[[File:Kakapo chicks.jpg|thumb|Hatchlings]] 
The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs (rarely 3) per breeding cycle, with long intervals between laying of first and second eggs.&lt;ref name="Cockrem2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=del Hoyo |first1=J. |last2=Elliott |first2=A. |last3=Sargatal |first3=J. |date=1997 |title=Handbook of the Birds of the World.

The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref name="Easton2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Breeding biology of kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'') on offshore island sanctuaries, 1990–2002 |last1=Eason |first1=Daryl K. |last2=Elliott |first2=Graeme P. |last3=Merton |first3=Don V.  | authorlink3=Don Merton |last4=Jansen |first4=Paul W. |last5=Harper |first5=Grant A. |last6=Moorhouse |first6=Ron J. |journal=Notornis |volume=54 |issue=1 |date=2006 |pages=27–36 |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_27.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after [[fledge|fledging]].&lt;ref name="Cockrem2002"/&gt; The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12&amp;nbsp;weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6&amp;nbsp;months.

Because the kakapo is long-lived, with an average life expectancy of 58&amp;nbsp;years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/life-cycle/|title=Life cycle – Kākāpō Recovery|work=Kākāpō Recovery|access-date=15 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rare Birds Yearbook 2008 |publisher=MagDig Media Limited |date=2007 |location=England |page=151 |isbn =978-0-9552607-3-5 |editor-last=Hirshfeld |editor-first=Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males start booming at about 5&amp;nbsp;years of age.&lt;ref name="Higgins1999"/&gt; It was thought that females reached [[sexual maturity]] at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs.&lt;ref name="FB328"&gt;Forest and Bird Magazine, Number 328, May 2008 (page 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old.&lt;ref name="Easton2006"/&gt; The kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. [[Dacrydium cupressinum|Rimu]] mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nutrient composition of the diet of parent-raised kakapo nestlings| first1=Yvette |last1=Cottam |first2=Don V. |last2=Merton  | authorlink2=Don Merton|first3=Wouter |last3=Hendriks| pages=90–99| journal=Notornis| volume=53| issue=1| year=2006| url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_90.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the kakapo's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt;). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females.&lt;ref name="berkeley_kakapo_reproduction"&gt;{{cite web

===Feeding===
The beak of the kakapo is adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, the kakapo has a very small [[gizzard]] compared to other birds of their size. It is generally [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food.&lt;ref name="Best1984"/&gt; It is particularly fond of the fruit of the [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]] tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray |first=R.

Kakapo diet changes according to the season. The plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of ''[[Lycopodium ramulosum]]'', ''Lycopodium fastigium'', ''Schizaea fistulosa'', ''Blechnum minus'', ''Blechnum procerum'', ''Cyathodes juniperina'', ''Dracophyllum longifolium'', ''Olearia colensoi'' and ''Thelymitra venosa''. Individual plants of the same species are often treated differently. Kakapo leave conspicuous evidence of their feeding activities, over feeding areas that range between {{Convert|10|×|10|m|ft|-1}} and {{Convert|50|×|100|m|ft|-1}} per individual.&lt;ref name="Best1984"/&gt; Kakapo feeding grounds almost always host [[Leptospermum scoparium|manuka]] and yellow silver pine (''[[Lepidothamnus intermedius]]'') scrubs.

==Conservation==
Fossil records indicate that in pre-Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird&lt;ref name="GOG"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ghosts of Gondwana; The history of life in New Zealand |first=George |last=Gibbs |publisher=Craig Potton Publishing |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was widespread on all three main islands. However, the kakapo population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1989 and continues.

===Human impact===
[[File:Naturhistorisches Museum, Kakapo.jpg|thumb| [[Zoological specimen|Specimens]] at the [[Vienna Museum of Natural History]]; thousands of kakapo were collected for museums across the world]]
The first factor in the decline of the kakapo was the arrival of humans. [[Māori mythology|Māori folklore]] suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the [[Polynesians]] first arrived in [[Aotearoa]] 700 years ago.&lt;ref name="Tipa2006"/&gt; [[Subfossil]] and [[midden]] deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island, South Island and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] before and during early Māori times.&lt;ref name="FGNZB"&gt;Barrie Heather and Hugh Robertson, illustrated by Derek Onley, ''The Field guide to the birds of New Zealand'', Viking, revised edition, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Māori hunted the kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into [[Māori traditional textiles|cloaks]].&lt;ref name="Tipa2006"/&gt; They used the dried heads as ear ornaments. 

Due to its inability to fly, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kakapo was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the [[Polynesian rat]] or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Merton77"/&gt; Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kakapo.

Beginning in the 1840s, European settlers [[Deforestation in New Zealand#European settlement|cleared vast tracts of land]] for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and [[Stoats in New Zealand|stoats]].&lt;ref name="Sutherland2002"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature| title=Conservation Biology: Science, Sex and the kakapo| volume=419|issue=6904| first=W.

As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct.

In the 1880s, large numbers of [[Mustelidae|mustelids]] (stoats, ferrets and weasels) were released in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=E.|last2=Dowding|first2=J.| year=1995 |title=Ecology of the stoat in ''Nothofagus'' forest: home range, habitat use and diet at different stages of the beech mast cycle| journal=New Zealand Journal of Ecology| volume=19 |issue=2| pages=97–109| url=http://www.nzes.org.nz/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol19_2_97.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the kakapo. Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the kakapo for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the [[Whanganui River]] as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the [[Kaimanawa Range]]s by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.&lt;ref name="FLM"/&gt;

===Early protection efforts===
In 1891, the New Zealand government set aside [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution Island]] in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed [[Richard Treacy Henry|Richard Henry]] as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and [[kiwi]] from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, [[stoat]]s had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within 6 years.&lt;ref name="Hill1987"&gt;Hill, S.; Hill, J. 1987. Richard Henry of Resolution Island. Dunedin, John McIndoe.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, three kakapo were moved from Resolution Island to the nature reserve of [[Little Barrier Island]] north-east of [[Auckland]], but [[feral cats]] were present and the kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three kakapo were moved to another reserve, [[Kapiti Island]], north-west of [[Wellington]]. One of them survived until at least 1936, despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period.&lt;ref name="Hill1987"/&gt;

By the 1920s, the kakapo was extinct in the [[North Island]] and its range and numbers in the [[South Island]] were declining.&lt;ref name="Williams1956"/&gt; One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and occasionally eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kakapo were becoming scarce.

===1950–89 conservation efforts===
[[File:Milford Sound and Sinbad Gully -New Zealand-9Jan2009.jpg|right|thumb|Sinbad Gully in Fiordland, seen between the mountains on the far side of a [[fjord]], was one of the last strongholds of the kakapo on mainland New Zealand.&lt;ref name=LCTSee-2009&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mg3qk |title =''Last Chance to See''|network=[[BBC]] | station=[[BBC Two]]| series=Last Chance to See | serieslink = Last Chance to See (TV series) |airdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 1950s, the [[New Zealand Wildlife Service]] was established and began making regular expeditions to search for the kakapo, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the [[Kahurangi National Park]] in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kakapo was caught and released in the [[Milford Sound]] catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the [[aviary|aviaries]] of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near [[Masterton]] in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of the kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Donald|first1=Paul F.|last2=Collar|first2=Nigel J.|last3=Marsden|first3=Stuart J.|last4=Pain|first4=Deborah J.|title=Facing Extinction: The World's Rarest Birds and the Race to Save Them|year=2010|publisher=T &amp; A D Poyser|location=London|isbn=978-0-7136-7021-9|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming. These observations led [[Don Merton]] to speculate for the first time that the kakapo had a [[Lek (mating arena)|lek]] breeding system.&lt;ref name="Merton77"/&gt; From 1974 to 1976, 14 kakapo were discovered but all appeared to be males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened "Richard Henry", and transferred to [[Maud Island]]. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped [[glaciated valley]]s flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt;

Before 1977, no expedition had been to Stewart Island/Rakiura to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified [[scrubland]] and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03014223.1995.9518039|last1=Powlesland|first1=R. G.|last2=Roberts|first2=A.|last3=Lloyd|first3=B.

[[Mustelid]]s have never colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was apparent that cats killed kakapo at a rate of 56% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karl |first1=B.J |last2=Best |first2=H.A. |title=Feral cats on Stewart Island: their foods and their effects on kakapo| journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology| volume=9| pages=287–294| year=1982 | doi=10.1080/03014223.1982.10423857}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kakapo were found.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1994"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=B.

In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery programme was developed and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.| year=1989 | title=Kakapo recovery plan 1989–1994| publisher=Department of Conservation| location=Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kakapo without [[Island restoration|rehabilitation]] by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: [[Maud Island|Maud]], [[Little Barrier Island|Hauturu/Little Barrier]], [[Codfish Island|Codfish]] and [[Mana Island, New Zealand|Mana]].&lt;ref name="Lloyd1994"/&gt; Sixty-five kakapo (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1994"/&gt; Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and [[weka]] kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/little-barrier-island/|title=Little Barrier Island |publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new kakapo sanctuaries: [[Chalky Island (New Zealand)|Chalky Island (Te Kakahu)]] and [[Anchor Island]].&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; The entire kakapo population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to [[Pearl Island (New Zealand)|Pearl Island]] in [[Port Pegasus]] while rats were being eliminated from Codfish.&lt;ref name="Whitehead"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Joanna K. | last = Whitehead | title = Breeding success of adult female kakapo (''Strigops habroptilus'') on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou): correlations with foraging home ranges and habitat selection | year = 2007 | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10182/640 | accessdate = 12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; All kakapo on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=223|title=Updates: June to September 2005 |publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=12 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616192606/http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=223|archivedate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kakapo-population-size.svg|thumb|400px|Cat control in 1982 arrested a sharp decline in kakapo numbers, and they have recently increased under the Kakapo Recovery plan. Red arrows indicate breeding years. Numbers become less precise before 1995, with the 1977 figure perhaps out by 50 birds.]]
A key part of the Recovery Plan is the supplementary feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily [[Dacrydium cupressinum|''Dacrydium cupressinum'' (rimu)]], produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's [[Mast (botany)#Mast seeding|mast year]] help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency.&lt;ref name="Elliott2001"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Elliott |first1=G.

Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 for the first time since 1982, although nesting success was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.

Supplementary feeding not only increases kakapo breeding frequency, but also affects the [[sex ratio]] of kakapo offspring, as maternal conditions influence this ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clout|first1=M. N.|last2=Elliott|first2=G. P.|last3=Robertson|first3=B.

This finding was subsequently used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=B.

Though breeding can be improved by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered by the presence of Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats.&lt;ref name="Elliott2001"/&gt; Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using [[rat trap|traps]] and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and [[Infrared|infra-red light source]] watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones&lt;!--years?--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Elliott2001"/&gt;

To monitor the kakapo population continuously, each bird is equipped with a [[radio transmitter]].&lt;ref name="Elliott2001"/&gt; [[List of kakapo|Every known kakapo, barring some young chicks, has been given a name]] by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials. It is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds, and a stark reminder of how few remain.

In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme presented a new management plan that would run from 2006 to 2016.&lt;ref name = "PFTF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/a-plan-for-the-future/|title=A Plan for the Future 2006–2016 |publisher=Kakapo Recovery|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key goals of this plan were to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the low number of individuals can be expected to result in [[inbreeding depression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=White|first1=K.

The Kakapo Recovery programme has been successful, with the numbers of kakapo increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme's inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of kakapo as a functional component of the [[ecosystem]] in a protected habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cresswell|first=M.| year=1996 |title=Kakapo recovery plan 1996–2005. Threatened Species Recovery Plan No. 21.| publisher=Department of Conservation| location= Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help meet this conservation challenge, two large Fiordland islands, [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution]] (20,860&amp;nbsp;ha) and [[Secretary Island|Secretary]] (8,140&amp;nbsp;ha), have been prepared for re-introduction of the kakapo with large-scale ecological restoration activities.&lt;ref name="Powlesland2006"/&gt; Ultimately, the Kakapo Recovery vision for the species is to restore the "mauri" (Maori for "life-force") of the kakapo by breeding 150 adult females.&lt;ref name = "PFTF"/&gt;

During the 2008–2009 summer breeding season, the total population of kakapo rose to over 100 for the first time since monitoring began,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=NZPA |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/2251118/Kakapo-population-over-100-mark|title=Kakapo population over 100 mark |work=stuff.co.nz |date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching {{Number of Living Kakapo}} by 2016, with 116 adults.

In 2012, seven kakapo were transferred to Little Barrier Island, in an attempt to establish a successful breeding programme. Kakapo were last on the island in 1999.&lt;ref name=barrier /&gt;

In March 2014, with the kakapo population having increased to 126, the bird's recovery was used by [[Melbourne]] artist Sayraphim Lothian as a metaphor for the [[February 2011 Christchurch earthquake|recovery of Christchurch]], parallelling the "indomitable spirit of these two communities and their determination to rebuild".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kakapo sculptures hidden in Christchurch|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/9834934/Find-a-kakapo-keep-the-love|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140317050015/http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/9834934/Find-a-kakapo-keep-the-love|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 March 2014|last=Harvie|first=Will|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journey – A new work by Sayraphim Lothian with support from Gap Filler|url=http://www.gapfiller.org.nz/journey-a-new-work-by-sayraphim-lothian-with-support-from-gap-filler/|accessdate=17 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317092202/http://www.gapfiller.org.nz/journey-a-new-work-by-sayraphim-lothian-with-support-from-gap-filler/|archivedate=17 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an April 2018 newsletter from the kakapo recovery program, after the death of 3 birds, the population has been reduced to 149.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://createsend.com/t/i-FE4939184088B7162540EF23F30FEDED|title=News and updates from the Kākāpō Recovery Team|website=createsend.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Māori culture==
The kakapo is associated with a rich tradition of Māori folklore and beliefs. The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or "[[Mast year|masting]]" events of particular plant species such as the [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]], which led Māori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future.&lt;ref name="MBL"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Murdoch |last=Riley |title=Maori Bird Lore; An introduction |publisher=Viking Sevenseas NZ LTD. |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the [[Elaeocarpus dentatus|hinau]] and [[Tawa (tree)|tawa]] trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the Māori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt;

===Use for food and clothing===
[[File:Stringops habroptilus 17.jpg|thumb|upright|Skeleton]] 
The meat of kakapo made good eating and was considered by Māori to be a delicacy&lt;ref name="Tipa2006"/&gt; and it was hunted for food when it was still widespread.&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Rod |last1=Morris |first2=Hal |last2=Smith |title=Wild South: Saving New Zealand's endangered birds |publisher=Random House |location=New Zealand |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source states that its flesh "resembles [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] in taste and texture",&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; although European settlers have described the bird as having a "strong and slightly stringent [sic] flavour".&lt;ref name="Tipa2006"/&gt;

In breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their [[Lek (mating arena)|mating arenas]] made it easy for Māori hunting parties to track the kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using [[Trapping (Animal)#Snares|snares]], pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated [[Kurī|Polynesian dogs]] which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt; Cooking was done in a [[hāngi]] or in gourds of boiling oil.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the [[Ngāi Tahu]] tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of [[totara]] tree or in containers constructed from [[kelp]].&lt;ref name="KM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/iwi-perspective/ |title=New Zealand Maōri and the kākāpō |publisher=Kakapo Recovery |year=2015 |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundles of kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents.&lt;ref name="Tipa2006"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_53_1_191.pdf |format=PDF |first=Rob |last=Tipa |title=Short note: Kakapo in Māori lore |journal=Notornis |volume=53 |pages=193–194 |year=2006 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt; Also taken by the Māori were the bird's eggs, which are described as whitish "but not pure white", and about the same size as a [[kererū]] egg.&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt;

As well as eating the meat of the kakapo, Māori would use kakapo skins with the feathers still attached or individually weave in kakapo feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Kakapo feather cloak | work = Search the collection database | publisher = British Museum | url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=497615&amp;partid=1&amp;IdNum=Oc1936,0607.1&amp;orig=/research/search_the_collection_database/museum_no__provenance_search.aspx | accessdate = 1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make.&lt;ref name="WNZB?"/&gt; Not only were these garments considered very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WNZB?"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Crowe |title=Which New Zealand Bird? |publisher=Penguin |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were highly valued, and the few still in existence today are considered ''[[taonga]]'' (treasures) – indeed, the old Māori adage "You have a kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold" was used to describe someone who is never satisfied.&lt;ref name="WS"/&gt; Kakapo feathers were also used to decorate the heads of [[taiaha]], but were removed before use in combat.&lt;ref name="Tipa2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WNZB?"/&gt;

Despite this, the kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the Māori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the 19th century, among them [[George Edward Grey]], who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet kakapo's behaviour towards him and his friends was "more like that of a dog than a bird".&lt;ref name="MBL"/&gt;

==In the media==
The conservation of the kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being ''Two in the Bush'', made by [[Gerald Durrell]] for the [[BBC]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="GeraldDurrellBBC"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.durrellwildlife.org/index.cfm?a=51 | title = Gerald Durrell's career | publisher = durrellwildlife.org | accessdate = 8 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature-length documentary, ''The Unnatural History of the Kakapo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.elwin.co.nz/kakapo-film/|title = The Unnatural History of the Kakapo|publisher = Elwin.co.nz|accessdate = 15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; won two major awards at the [[Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival]]. Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by [[NHNZ]], are ''Kakapo – Night Parrot'' (1982) and ''To Save the Kakapo'' (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the kakapo, including a sequence with [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]] in ''[[The Life of Birds]]''. It was also one of the endangered animals [[Douglas Adams]] and [[Mark Carwardine]] set out to find for the radio series and book ''[[Last Chance to See]]''. An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which [[Stephen Fry]] and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the kakapo on Codfish Island.&lt;ref name=LCTSee-2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/38869/fry-making-kakapo-doco|title=Fry making kakapo doco|last=McNeilly |first=Hamish |date=10 January 2009|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of a kakapo named [[Sirocco (parrot)|Sirocco]] attempting to mate with Carwardine's head was viewed by millions worldwide, leading to Sirocco becoming "spokes-bird" for New Zealand wildlife conservation in 2010, as part of the International Year of Biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismnewzealand.com/news-and-features/latest-news/2010/01/prime-minister-appoints-'spokesbird'-for-conservation/ |title=Prime Minister Appoints 'Spokesbird' for Conservation |publisher=Tourism New Zealand |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kakapo was featured in the episode "Strange Islands" of the documentary series ''[[South Pacific (TV series)|South Pacific]]'', originally aired on 13 June 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486170| title= Wild Pacific – Strange Evolutions| accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the episode "Worlds Apart" of the series ''[[The Living Planet]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Living Planet [episode 10]|url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-living-planet/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in episode 3 of the BBC's ''New Zealand Earth's Mythical Islands''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lslq4 New Zealand Earth's Mythical Islands]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kartvelian languages''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|t|v|ɛ|l|I|ɑ:|n}}; {{lang-ka|ქართველური ენები}}, {{lang|ka-Latn|Kartveluri enebi}}, also known as '''Iberian'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100251/Caucasian-languages Caucasian languages] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; and formerly&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Laks, Origin and Evolution of Languages: Approaches, Models, Paradigms, Equinox, 2008, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; '''South Caucasian'''&lt;ref name="Boe02"&gt;Boeder (2002), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;) are a language family [[Languages of the Caucasus|indigenous to the Caucasus]] and spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], with large groups of native speakers in [[Russia]], [[Iran]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=IL Languages of Israel]&lt;/ref&gt; and northeastern parts of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1194-16 Ethnologue entry about the Kartvelian language family]&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 5.2 million speakers of Kartvelian languages worldwide.
The Kartvelian family is not known to be related to any other language family, making it one of the world's primary [[language family|language families]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalby (2002), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The first literary source in a Kartvelian language is the [[Georgian language]] ''[[Bir el Qutt inscriptions|inscriptions of Bir el Qutt]]'', written in ancient Georgian ''[[Asomtavruli]]'' script at the Georgian monastery near [[Bethlehem]],&lt;ref name="Lan66"&gt;Lang (1966), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; which dates back to c. 430 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (1995), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Georgian script]] is the [[writing system]] used to write all Kartvelian languages, though the [[Laz language]] in [[Turkey]] is also written using a [[Latin script]].

==Social and cultural status==
Georgian is the official language of Georgia (spoken by 90% of the population) and the main language for literary and business use for all Kartvelian speakers in Georgia. It is written with an original and distinctive alphabet, and the oldest surviving literary text dates from the 5th century AD—the only Caucasian language with an ancient literary tradition{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The old [[Georgian script]] seems to have been derived from [[Aramaic]], with Greek influences.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

Mingrelian has been written with the Georgian alphabet since 1864, especially in the period from 1930 to 1938, when the Mingrelians enjoyed some [[cultural autonomy]], and after 1989.

The Laz language was written chiefly between 1927 and 1937, and now again in Turkey, with the Latin alphabet. Laz, however, is disappearing as its speakers are integrating into mainstream Turkish society.

==Classification==
{{Georgians}}
The Kartvelian language family consists of four closely related languages which form a [[dialect continuum]]:&lt;ref name="Boe02"&gt;Boeder (2002), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boe05"&gt;Boeder (2005), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gamkrelidze (1966), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fähnrich &amp; Sardzhveladze (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kajaia (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kli98b"&gt;Klimov (1998''b''), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Svan language|Svan]]''' (ლუშნუ ნინ, ''lušnu nin''), with approximately 35,000–40,000 native speakers mainly in the northwestern mountainous region of [[Svaneti]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and in the [[Kodori Valley|Kodori Gorge]] of [[Abkhazia]], Georgia.
* '''Georgian-Zan''' (also called '''Karto-Zan''')
** '''[[Georgian language|Georgian]]''' (ქართული ენა, ''kartuli ena'') with approximately 4.5 million native speakers, mainly in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. There are Georgian-speaking communities in [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], and [[European Union|EU]] countries, but the current number and distribution of them are unknown.
** '''[[Zan languages|Zan]]''' (also called '''Colchian''')
*** '''[[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]]''' (მარგალური ნინა, ''margaluri nina''), with some 500,000 native speakers in 1989, mainly in the western regions of Georgia, namely [[Samegrelo]] and [[Abkhazia]] (at present in [[Gali District, Abkhazia|Gali district]] only). The number of Mingrelian speakers in [[Abkhazia]] underwent a dramatic decrease in the 1990s as a result of heavy [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population]], the overwhelming majority of which were [[Mingrelians]]. The Mingrelians displaced from [[Abkhazia]] are scattered elsewhere in the Georgian government territory, with dense clusters in [[Tbilisi]] and [[Zugdidi]].
*** '''[[Laz language|Laz]]''' (ლაზური ნენა, ''lazuri nena''), with 22,000 native speakers in 1980, mostly in the [[Black Sea]] littoral area of northeast [[Turkey]], and with some 2,000 in [[Adjara]], Georgia.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The connection between these languages was first reported in linguistic literature by [[Johann Anton Güldenstädt]] in his 1773 classification of the languages of the Caucasus, and later proven by [[G. Rosen]], [[Marie-Félicité Brosset]], [[Franz Bopp]] and others during the 1840s. [[Zan languages|Zan]] is the branch that contains the [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] and [[Laz language|Laz]] languages.

On the basis of [[glottochronology|glottochronological analysis]], [[Georgi Klimov]] dates the split of the [[Proto-Kartvelian language|Proto-Kartvelian]] into [[Svan language|Svan]] and [[Proto-Karto-Zan language|Proto-Karto-Zan]] to the 19th century BC,&lt;ref name="Kli98b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kli94"&gt;Klimov (1994), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and the further division into [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Zan languages|Zan]] to the 8th century BC,&lt;ref name="Kli94"&gt;Klimov (1994), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; although with the reservation that such dating is very preliminary and substantial further study is required.&lt;ref name="Kli98b"/&gt;

The older name "South Caucasian" is no longer much used, as it derives from the idea that Kartvelian is related to the [[Northwest Caucasian]] and [[Northeast Caucasian]] languages, a position which is no longer maintained.

===Higher-level connections===
No relationship with other languages, including the two [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian language families]], has been demonstrated so far.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 15th edition (1986): [[Macropedia]], "Languages of the World", see section titled "Caucasian languages".&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguists, such as [[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze]], have proposed that the Kartvelian family is part of a much larger [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] language family, but both the concept of a Nostratic family and Georgian's relation to it are not considered likely by linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Allan R. Bomhard, John C. Kerns. (1994)'' The Nostratic Macrofamily: A Study in Distant Linguistic Relationship''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain grammatical similarities with [[Basque language|Basque]], especially in the [[declension|case system]], have often been pointed out. However, the hypothesis of a relationship, which also tends to link the Caucasian languages with other non-Indo-European and non-Semitic languages of the Near East of ancient times, is generally considered to lack conclusive evidence.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; Any similarities to other linguistic phyla may be due to [[Areal feature|areal]] influences. Heavy borrowing in both directions (i.e. from North Caucasian to Kartvelian and vice versa) has been observed; therefore it is likely that certain grammatical features have been influenced as well. If the [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]] hypothesis, which attempts to link [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Burushaski]], the [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian families]] and other phyla, is correct, then the similarities to Basque may also be due to these influences, however indirect. Certain Kartvelian–[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] lexical links are revealed at the protolanguage level,&lt;ref&gt;Gamkrelidze &amp; Ivanov (1995), pp. 774–776&lt;/ref&gt; which are ascribed to the early contacts between [[Proto-Kartvelian language|Proto-Kartvelian]] and [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Gamkrelidze &amp; Ivanov (1995), p. 768&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verb===
Kartvelian verbs can indicate one, two, or three [[grammatical person]]s. A performer of an action is called the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and affected persons are objects ([[direct object|direct]] or [[indirect object|indirect]]). The person may be singular or plural. According to the number of persons, the verbs are classified as unipersonal, bipersonal or tripersonal.

*Unipersonal verbs have only a subject and so are always intransitive.
*Bipersonal verbs have a subject and one object, which can be ''direct'' or ''indirect''. The verb is:
**transitive when the object is ''direct'';
**intransitive if the object is ''indirect''.
*Tripersonal verbs have one subject and both ''direct'' and ''indirect'' objects and are ditransitive.

By means of special markers Kartvelian verbs can indicate four kinds of action intentionality ("version"):
*subjective—shows that the action is intended for oneself,
*objective—the action is intended for another person,
*objective-passive—the action is intended for another person and at the same time indicating the passiveness of subject,
*neutral—neutral with respect to intention.

A '''[[proverbial phrase]]''' or a '''[[proverbial expression]]''' is type of a conventional [[saying]] similar to [[proverb]]s and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed [[Expression (language)|expression]], while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvo Krikmann "the Great Chain Metaphor: An Open Sezame for Proverb Semantics?", ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium:Yearbook of International Scholarship]]'', 11 (1994), pp. 117-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1768, John Ray defined a proverbial phrase as:
{{quotation|A proverb [or proverbial phrase] is usually defined, an instructive sentence, or common and pithy saying, in which more is generally designed than expressed, famous for its peculiarity or elegance, and therefore adapted by the learned as well as the vulgar, by which it is distinguished from counterfeits which want such authority|John Ray|A Compleat Collection of English Proverbs, 1798&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=John |title=A compleat collection of English proverbs |publisher=W.

'''Nwaran''' is a child naming ceremony celebrated in [[Nepal]].

In the [[Hindu]] tradition, the Nwaran is celebrated on the 11th day after a child is born. This ceremony is performed to give a birthname to a child, according to his/her lunar horoscope, which is usually not the name by which he/she is known. Typically, a priest is invited to perform the ceremony at home, and divines finds the child's lunar horoscope from his birth details, as the mother is still recovering at home with the child. Until the mother and child are 'purified' (from past birth etc. in the religious sense), they should not visit the temple. 

One can also perform a ''nwaran'' on the 21st or 41st day after birth, if for some reason the 11th day was not observed. 

Before the ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]]'', the ''Pooja'' materials should be washed and kept clean and ready in the ''Pooja'' place. You can select a place for the ''Pooja'', depending on the number of people you are going to call. The ''Pooja'' should be done facing east or west. A carpeted area covered with a clean, washed cloth like a bed sheet, can be used; unless there is going to be the ''[[Havan]]'' (''Homam'') ceremony, in which case it should be on a wooden, vinyl or tiled floor. 
 
After the ceremony, the area can be cleaned up after sunset, or the next day. The fruits can be used as ''[[Prasad]]'', whilst the ''Pooja'' flowers and Paan leaves are spread in the  backyard near trees.  Kalash coconut, the ''Pooja vasthra'' (cloth), the coins and the rice should be packed separately, and all other grains mixed together.  These should be given, neatly packed, to the temple within 11 days; but the used fruits, flowers and pan leaves should not be taken inside the temple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">'''Open Synthetic Biology''' (Open SynBio) is the idea that scientific knowledge and data should be openly accessible through common rights licensing to enable the rapid development of safe, effective and commercially viable [[synthetic biology]] applications.

Its foundational concepts are:

# [[Open science]] is the idea that scientific research should be openly shared to enable massive collaboration (e.g., the [http://polymathprojects.org/ Polymath Project], and [http://Therapoid.net/ open therapeutic effort]).
# The [[Bermuda Principles]] (1996, Rev. 2003) - a private accord declaring that all DNA sequence data should be released in publicly accessible databases within 24 hours after generation.

Open SynBio is a theoretical framework supporting a global ecosystem of responsible and capable research scientists working collaboratively on synthetic biology application development projects to reduce cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost to Develop and Win Marketing Approval for a New Drug Is $2.6 Billion|url=http://csdd.tufts.edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014_cost_study|website=Tufts Center for the study of Drug Development|publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt; time, and risks of developing new synthetic biology applications (including Open [[SynBio]] therapeutics) from the inception of primary science to applications reaching market readiness and commercial viability.

Its general principle is that participating research scientists agree to share research, data, findings and results with the [[Open Synthetic Biology]] community and the public generally. The Open [[SynBio]] community will set standards and expectations of the participants and their "science to market" process and the community will work collaboratively with downstream stakeholders (e.g., investors and business advisors) to ensure public safety and general availability of new synthetic biology applications.

One example of open synthetic biology is when [[DNA2.0]] donated several artificial gene sequences into an open-access repository run by the [[BioBricks Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledford|first=Heidi|date=2013-07-04|title=Bioengineers look beyond patents|url=http://www.nature.com/news/bioengineers-look-beyond-patents-1.13320|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=499|issue=7456|pages=16–17|doi=10.1038/499016a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of  [[recorded history]]).


== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==
* [[Archaeology]] – study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
* [[Archontology]] – study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
* [[Art history]] – study of changes in and social context of art
* [[Chronology]] – locating events in time

* [[Diplomatic history]] – study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states 
* [[History of science]] – study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
* [[Economic history]] – the study of economics in the past
* [[Environmental history]] – study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
* [[Futurology]] – study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world
* [[Historiography]] &amp;ndash; both the study of the methodology of historians and development of history as a discipline, and also to a body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.
* [[Intellectual history]]
* [[History painter|History painting]] – painting of works of art having historical motifs or depicting great events

'''''Pasar malam'''''  ({{lang-nl|'''Nacht Markt''' or '''Avondmarkt'''}}) is an [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] word that literally means "[[night market]]" (the word comes from ''[[bazaar]]'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It brings together a collection of stalls that usually sell goods such as [[snack]]s, local favourite dishes, [[fruits]], clothes, shoes, [[toy]]s, balloons, watch and alarm clocks, knick-knacks and ornaments at cheap or at least reasonable prices. Unauthorized copies of DVDs, CDs and computer software are often sold at a pasar malam. 

Pasar malam might resemble a night [[festival]] or a [[fair|fairground]], where fair games and kiddy rides, like mini [[carousel]] or mini train ride may also present. Several quintessential fair snacks like [[cotton candy]], [[ice cream]], [[hot dog]]s and grilled sausages are also popular, next to the offerings of traditional local delicacies. A pasar malam often takes place only one to a few days of the week, as the traders rotate around different neighbourhoods on different days of the week. [[Bargaining|Haggling]] over prices is a common practice at such markets.

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bezoekers op de Pasar Malam te Batavia TMnr 60022441.jpg|thumb|Pasar Malam in Batavia, [[Dutch East Indies]], period 1900-1940]]
In Indonesian archipelago, markets are traditionally held in different days with locations rotating among participating villages. This traditional economic custom is known as ''Hari Pasaran'' (lit. "market days") in [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. After being further developed, market was established more permanently like it is today. The night market is regarded as the continuation of this non-permanent market culture. Night market are usually held during special occasion or festival, such as [[Sekaten]] festival in Java, or held in [[Ramadhan]] nights, approximately a week before [[Lebaran]]. 

After the discovery of [[electricity]] and [[lightbulb]], the night markets were held more frequently in colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] in early 20th century. The most notable one is [[Pasar Gambir]], a night market fair held in 1906 and yearly from 1921 until the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1942, in the Koningsplein, Batavia, [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]], [[Jakarta]], Indonesia) to celebrate the birthday of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]. It has become the predecessor of the annual [[Jakarta Fair]] and [[The Hague|Den Haag]]'s [[Tong Tong Fair]] which are actually a night market and festival held for several weeks.

In [[Java]], especially in the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] royal cities [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]], the grand week-long pasar malam is usually held annually during the [[Sekaten]] festival to celebrate [[Mawlid]] or the birthday of prophet [[Muhammad]]. During colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] the annual Pasar Malam was held in [[Pasar Gambir]] (today [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka square]]) and become the predecessor of modern [[Jakarta]]'s annual [[Jakarta Fair]]. 

Today, several ''[[kecamatan]]'' (district) in Jakarta and also other provinces in Indonesia, hold weekly pasar malam, usually every Saturday night in a nearby ''[[alun-alun]]'' square, open fields or marketplaces. In Indonesia, pasar malam has become a weekly recreational place for local families. Other than selling variety of goods and foods, some pasar malam also offer kiddy rides and carnival games, such as mini [[carousel]] or mini train ride. In [[Palembang]], a popular pasar malam is located on front of Kuto Besak Fort on the bank of [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]]. This pasar malam sells local dishes and snacks such as [[pempek]], lenggang and tekwan, and also offers souvenirs and handy crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Indonesia Kaya | title = Pasar Malam Sungai Musi, Representasi Kearifan Lokal Palembang | language = Indonesian | url = http://www.indonesiakaya.com/kanal/detail/pasar-malam-sungai-musi-representasi-kearifan-lokal-palembang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Netherlands==
[[File:PasarMalamBesar2006.jpg|thumb|right|Music performance in Pasar Malam Besar 2006, The Hague]]
In the [[Netherlands]], a yearly [[Indo people|Indo Eurasian]] festival is held in [[The Hague]] under the name ''[[Tong Tong Fair]]'', formerly known as the ''Pasar Malam Besar'' (''besar'' meaning "big"). Due to the high number of Indo-Eurasians and the successive success of this event since 1959, dozens of pasar malam are held each year in the Netherlands. Recently the Indonesian embassy has started sponsoring a yearly "pasar malam Indonesia", mainly to promote Indonesian business and enhance Dutch-Indonesian relations.&lt;ref&gt;The Netherlands has the largest number of pasar malam outside Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pleat''' (older '''plait''') is a type of fold formed by doubling [[textile|fabric]] back upon itself and securing it in place.  It is commonly used in [[clothing]] and [[upholstery]] to gather a wide piece of fabric to a narrower circumference.&lt;ref&gt;Picken, Mary Brooks, ''The Fashion Dictionary'', Funk and Wagnalls, 1957, pp. 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;

Pleats are categorized as ''pressed'', that is, [[Ironing|ironed]] or otherwise heat-set into a sharp crease, or ''unpressed'', falling in soft rounded folds.

Pleats sewn into place are called [[tuck (sewing)|tucks]].

==Fullness==
A vertically hanging piece of fabric such as a skirt or a drape will often be described in terms of its "fullness."  Fullness represents the thickness/ depth of the pleats in relation to the original width of the fabric: fabric sewn at "zero fullness" would actually be flat and have no pleats; fabric sewn at "100% fullness" is pleated so that it takes up exactly half as much width as it would if it were not pleated at all (i.e., 24 inches would be pleated down to 12 inches); if sewn at "150% fullness," the unpleated fabric would be two and a half times wider than the final pleated piece (i.e., an unpleated 30 inches would end up as 12 pleated inches of fabric: 12+1.50(12)=30); if fullness were to be "50%", the original fabric would be one and a half times the width of the pleated (i.e., 18 inches of width would end up as 12 pleated inches: 12+0.50(12)=18), etc.

==Types==

===Accordion===
[[File:Knifepleat.svg|thumb|100px|Knife pleat]]
Accordion     pleats or knife pleats are a form of tight pleating which allows the garment to expand its shape when moving. Accordion pleating is also used for some dress sleeves, such as pleating the end of the elbow, with the fullness of the pleat gathered closely at the cuff. This form of pleating inspired the "skirt dancing" of [[Loie Fuller]].&lt;ref name="CummingCunnington2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valerie Cumming|author2=Valerie Cumming, C.W. Cunnington, P. E. Cunnington|author3=C. W. Cunnington|author4=P. E. Cunnington|title=The Dictionary of Fashion History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glBf_El4Qd4C|accessdate=10 January 2012|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-738-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordion pleats may also be used in hand fans.

===Box===
[[File:Boxpleats.svg|thumb|100px|Box pleats]][[File:2boxpleats.svg|thumb|100px|Double box pleats]]
Box pleats are knife pleats back-to-back, and have a tendency to spring out from the waistline.&lt;ref name="Picken, Mary Brooks p. 257"&gt;Picken, Mary Brooks, ''The Fashion Dictionary'', p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;  They have the same 3:1 ratio as knife pleats, and may also be stacked to form "stacked-" or "double-box pleats".  These stacked box pleats create more fullness and have a 5:1 ratio.  They also create a bulkier seam. Inverted box pleats have the "box" on the inside rather than the outside.

===Cartridge===
[[File:Cartpleats.svg|thumb|Cartridge pleats]]
Cartridge pleats are used to gather a large amount of fabric into a small waistband or armscye without adding bulk to the seam.  This type of pleating also allows the fabric of the skirt or sleeve to spring out from the seam.  During the 15th and 16th centuries, this form of pleating was popular in the garments of men and women.  Fabric is evenly gathered using two or more lengths of basting stitches, and the top of each pleat is whipstitched onto the waistband or armscye.  Cartridge pleating was resurrected in [[1840s in fashion|1840s fashion]] to attach the increasingly full bell-shaped skirts to the fashionable narrow waist.&lt;ref&gt;Tozer, Jane and Sarah Levitt, ''Fabric of Society: A Century of People and their Clothes 1770–1870'', Laura Ashley Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Janet: ''Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560–1620'', Macmillan 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Janet: ''Patterns of Fashion 1 (cut and construction of women's clothing, 1660–1860)'', Wace 1964, Macmillan 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluted===
Fluted pleats or "flutings" are very small, rounded or pressed pleats used as [[trim (sewing)|trimmings]].&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield and Saward, ''The Dictionary of Needlework'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from their resemblance to a [[pan flute]].

===Fortuny===
Fortuny pleats are crisp pleats set in silk fabrics by designer [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Mariano Fortuny]] in the early 20th century, using a secret pleat-setting process which is still not understood.

===Honeycomb===
Honeycomb pleats are narrow, rolled pleats used as a foundation for [[smocking]].

===Kick===
Kick pleats are short pleats leading upwards from the bottom hem of garments such as skirts or coats, usually at the back. They allow the garment to drape straight down when stationary while also allowing freedom of movement.

===Organ===
Organ pleats are parallel rows of softly rounded pleats resembling the pipes of a [[pipe organ]].  Carl Köhler&lt;ref&gt;Köhler, Carl: ''A History of Costume'', Dover Publications reprint, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that these are made by inserting one or more gores into a panel of fabric.

===Plissé===
Plissé pleats are narrow pleats set by gathering fabric with stitches, wetting the fabric, and "setting" the pleats by allowing the wet fabric to dry under weight or tension.  [[Linen]] [[chemise|chemises or smocks]] pleated with this technique have been found in the 10th century [[Viking]] graves in [[Birka]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale Owen-Crocker|Owen-Crocker, Gale R.]], ''Dress in Anglo-Saxon England''revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-84383-081-7}}, p. 42, 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rolled===
Rolled pleats create tubular pleats which run the length of the fabric from top to bottom.  A piece of the fabric to be pleated is pinched and then rolled until it is flat against the rest of the fabric, forming a tube.  A variation on the rolled pleat is the stacked pleat, which is rolled similarly and requires at least five inches of fabric per finished pleat.  Both types of pleating create a bulky seam.

===Watteau===
Watteau pleats are one or two box pleats found at the back neckline of [[1700–1750 in fashion|18th century]] [[sack-back gown]]s and some late [[1890s in fashion|19th century]] [[tea gown]]s in imitation of these.  The term is not contemporary, but is used by costume historians in reference to these styles as portrayed in the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]].&lt;ref&gt;Picken, Mary Brooks, ''The Fashion Dictionary'', pp. 257, 370&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingussie===
[[File:Kinguissie pleats.svg|thumb|Kingussie pleats]]
Kingussie pleats, named after [[Kingussie|the town in Scotland]], are a very rarely seen type of pleat used in some Scottish [[kilt]]s.  They consist of a single centrally located box pleat in the rear of the kilt with knife pleats fanning out on either side.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern usage==
Clothing features pleats for practical reasons (to provide freedom of movement to the wearer) as well as for purely stylistic reasons.

===Shirts, blouses, jackets===

[[dress shirt|Shirts]] and [[blouse]]s typically have pleats on the back to provide freedom of movement and on the arm where the sleeve tapers to meet the cuff. The standard men's shirt has a box pleat in the center of the back just below the shoulder or alternately one simple pleat on each side of the back.

[[Jacket]]s designed for active outdoor wear frequently have pleats (usually inverted box pleats) to allow for freedom of movement.  [[Norfolk jacket]]s have double-ended inverted box pleats at the chest and back.

===Skirts and kilts===
[[Skirts]], [[dress (garment)|dresses]] and [[kilt]]s can include pleats of various sorts to add fullness from the waist or hips, or at the hem, to allow freedom of movement or achieve design effects.

*One or more '''kick pleats''' may be set near the hem of a straight skirt to allow the wearer to walk comfortably while preserving the narrow style line.
*Modern kilts may be made with either box pleats or knife pleats, and can be ''pleated to the stripe'' or ''pleated to the sett'' (see main article [[Kilt#Pleating and stitching|Kilts: Pleating and stitching]]).

===Trousers===

Pleats just below the waistband on the front of the garment are typical of many styles of formal and casual [[trousers]] including [[suit (clothing)|suit]] trousers and khakis. There may be one, two, three, or no pleats, which may face either direction. When the pleats open towards the pockets they are called '''reverse pleats''' (typical of khakis and corduroy trousers) and when they open toward the zipper, they are known as '''forward pleats'''.

Utilitarian or very casual styles such as [[jeans]] and [[cargo pants]] are flat-front (without pleats at the waistband) but may have bellows pockets.

Pleated trousers were popular before World War II; fabric rationing during the war precluded the style, and flat front became the standard by necessity of cloth shortages.  Pleats on men's trousers remains a classic style option suited for more traditional looks, while flat front pants are a more recent on-trend fashion.

===Pockets===
A '''bellows pocket''' is patch [[pocket]] with an inset box pleat to allow the pocket to expand when filled.  Bellows pockets are typical of cargo pants, [[safari jacket]]s, and other utilitarian garments.

The [[lyrics]] were written by [[Józef Wybicki]] in [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Cisalpine Republic]] in [[Northern Italy]], between 16 and 19 of July 1797, two years after the [[Third Partition of Poland]] erased the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from the map. It was originally meant to boost the morale of Polish soldiers serving under General [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski]]'s [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legions]] that served with [[Napoleon]]'s [[French Revolutionary Army]] in the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars]]. "Dabrowski's Mazurka", expressing the idea that the nation of Poland, despite lacking an [[independence|independent]] state of their own, had not disappeared as long as the Polish people were still alive and fighting in its name, soon became one of the most popular patriotic songs in Poland.&lt;ref name="MFAoP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trochimczyk2000" /&gt;

The music is an unattributed [[mazurka]] and considered a "[[tune (folk music)|folk tune]]" that Polish [[composer]] Edward Pałłasz categorizes as "functional art" which was "fashionable among the gentry and rich bourgeoisie". Pałłasz wrote, "Wybicki probably made use of melodic motifs he had heard and combined them in one formal structure to suit the text".&lt;ref name="MFAoP" /&gt;

It is "one of the most important songs of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] nations."&lt;ref name="MFAoP" /&gt; The text of the hymn was modified to suit new occasions and socio-political contexts" throughout the song's history.&lt;ref name="Trochimczyk2000" /&gt; When Poland re-emerged as an independent state in 1918, "Dabrowski's Mazurka" became its ''de facto'' national anthem. It was officially adopted as the national anthem of the [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="Trochimczyk2000" /&gt; It also inspired similar songs by other peoples struggling for independence during the 19th century,&lt;ref name="MFAoP" /&gt; such as the Ukrainian national anthem "[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina|The Glory and The Freedom of Ukraine Has Not Yet Perished]]" and the [[Pan-Slavic]] song "[[Hey, Slavs]]" which was used as the national anthem of Yugoslavia during that state's existence.

== Lyrics ==

[[File:Mazurek Dąbrowskiego manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Facsimile of [[Józef Wybicki|Wybicki's]] manuscript of the ''Song of the Polish Legions in Italy'']]

The original lyrics, authored by Wybicki, were a poem consisting of six [[stanza]]s and a [[refrain|chorus]] repeated after all but last stanzas, all following an ABAB [[rhyme scheme]]. The official lyrics, based on a variant from 1806,&lt;ref name=kuczyn&gt;{{cite book|location=Warsaw, PL|publisher=Wiedza Powszechna|last1=Russocki|first1=Stanisław|last2=Kuczyński|first2=Stefan|last3=Willaume|first3=Juliusz|title=Godło, barwy i hymn Rzeczypospolitej.

show a certain departure from the original text. It misses two of the original stanzas and reverses the order of other two. Notably, the initial verse, "Poland has not yet died" was replaced with "Poland has not yet perished", suggesting a more violent cause of the nation's possible death.&lt;ref name=davies&gt;{{cite book|location=|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|last=Davies|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Davies|title=God's Playground: A History of Poland|volume=Volume II: 1795 to the Present|edition=Revised|year=2005|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=jeszcze+polska+god%27s+playground|accessdate={{date|2013-03-05}}|isbn=0-19-925340-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Wybicki's original manuscript was in the hands of his descendants until February 1944, when it was [[Lost works|lost]] in Wybicki's great-great-grandson, Johann von Roznowski's home in [[Charlottenburg]] during the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|Allied bombing of Berlin]]. The manuscript is known today only from [[facsimile]] copies, twenty four of which were made in 1886 by Edward Rożnowski, Wybicki's grandson, who donated them to Polish libraries.&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt;

The main theme of the poem is the idea that was novel in the times of early [[nationalism]]s based on centralized [[nation-state]]s{{spaced ndash}}that the lack of political sovereignty does not preclude the existence of a nation. As [[Adam Mickiewicz]] explained in 1842 to students of Slavic Literature in Paris, the song "The famous song of the Polish legions begins with lines that express the new history: Poland has not perished yet as long as we live. These words mean that people who have in them what constitutes the essence of a nation can prolong the existence of their country regardless of its political circumstances and may even strive to make it real again..."&lt;ref name="MFAoP" /&gt; The song also includes a call to arms and expresses the hope that, under General Dąbrowski's command, the legionaries would rejoin their nation and retrieve "what the alien force has seized" through armed struggle.

[[File:Pieśń Legionów 3.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] has shown us ways to victory'']]

The chorus and subsequent stanzas include heart-lifting examples of military heroes, set as role models for Polish soldiers: [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski]], Napoleon, [[Stefan Czarniecki]] and [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]]. Dąbrowski, for whom the anthem is named, was a commander in the failed 1794 [[Kościuszko Uprising]] against Russia. After the Third Partition in 1795, he came to Paris to seek French aid in re-establishing Polish independence and, in 1796, he started the formation of the Polish Legions, a Polish unit of the French Revolutionary Army. Bonaparte was, at the time when the song was written, a commander of the Italian campaign of [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and Dąbrowski's superior. Having already proven his skills as a military leader, he is described in the lyrics as the one "who has shown us ways to victory." Bonaparte is the only non-Polish person mentioned by name in the Polish anthem.

[[File:Pieśń Legionów 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Like [[Stefan Czarniecki|Czarniecki]] to [[Poznań]]...'']]

Stefan Czarniecki was a 17th-century [[hetman]] (military commander), famous for his role in driving the [[Sweden|Swedish]] army out of Poland after an occupation that had left the country in ruins and is remembered by Poles as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]. With the outbreak of a [[Dano-Swedish War (1657–58)|Dano-Swedish War]], he continued his fight against Sweden in Denmark, from where he "returned across the sea" to fight the invaders alongside the king who was then at the [[Royal Castle in Poznań]]. In the same castle, Józef Wybicki, started his career as a lawyer (in 1765). Kościuszko, mentioned in a stanza now missing from the anthem, became a hero of the [[American Revolutionary War]] before coming back to Poland to defend his native country from Russia in the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|war of 1792]] and a [[Kościuszko Uprising|national uprising he led]] in 1794. One of his major victories during the uprising was the [[Battle of Racławice]] where the result was partly due to Polish peasants armed with [[war scythe|scythes]]. Alongside the scythes, the song mentioned other types of weaponry, traditionally used by the Polish ''[[szlachta]]'', or nobility: the [[sabre]], known in Polish as ''[[szabla]]'', and the [[backsword]].

Basia (a female name, [[diminutive]] of [[Barbara (given name)|Barbara]]) and her father are fictional characters. They are used to represent the women and elderly men who waited for the Polish soldiers to return home and liberate their fatherland. The route that Dąbrowski and his legions hoped to follow upon leaving Italy is hinted at by the words "we'll cross the [[Vistula]], we'll cross the [[Warta]]", two major rivers flowing through the parts of Poland that were in [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] hands at the time.

== Music ==
The melody of the Polish anthem is a lively and rhythmical [[mazurka]]. Mazurka as a musical form derives from the stylization of traditional melodies for the folk dances of [[Mazovia]], a region in central Poland. It is characterized by a [[triple meter]] and strong accents placed irregularly on the second or third beat. Considered one of Poland's national dances in pre-partition times, it owes its popularity in 19th-century West European ballrooms to the [[List of compositions by Frédéric Chopin#Mazurkas|mazurkas]] of [[Frédéric Chopin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Polish Music Center.

The composer of "Mazurek Dąbrowskiego" is unknown. The melody is most probably Wybicki's adaptation of a folk tune that had already been popular during the second half of the 18th century. The composition used to be erroneously attributed to [[Michał Kleofas Ogiński]] who was known to have written a [[march (music)|march]] for Dąbrowski's legions. Several historians confused Ogiński's "{{lang|fr|Marche pour les Légions polonaises|italic=no}}" ("March for the Polish Legions") with Wybicki's mazurka, possibly due to the mazurka's chorus "March, march, Dąbrowski", until Ogiński's sheet music for the march was discovered in 1938 and proven to be a different piece of music than Poland's national anthem.&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt;

The first composer to use the anthem for an artistical music piece is always stated to be [[Karol Kurpiński]]. In 1821 he composed his piano/organ [[Fugue]] on "Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła" (it was published in 1821 in Warsaw; the first modern edition by [[Rostislaw Wygranienko]] was printed only in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Culture.pl|location=Warsaw, PL|publisher=[[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]]|date=October 2006|last=Kosińska|first=Małgorzata|title=Karol Kurpiński|url=http://www.culture.pl/web/english/resources-music-full-page/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/karol-kurpinski|accessdate={{date|2013-03-18}}|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FCetxciR?url=http://www.culture.pl/web/english/resources-music-full-page/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/karol-kurpinski|archivedate=18 March 2013|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=Lublin, PL|publisher=Polihymnia|year=2009|language=Polish|editor-last=Wygranienko|editor-first=Rostislaw

{{ill|Wojciech Sowiński|pl}} was the next who arranged "Mazurek Dąbrowskiego" for the piano. The arrangement, accompanied by the lyrics in Polish and French, was published 1829 in Paris.&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt; The current official musical score of the national anthem was arranged by [[Kazimierz Sikorski]] and published by the Polish [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]]. Sikorski's harmonization allows for each vocal version to be performed either ''[[a cappella]]'' or together with any of the instrumental versions. Some orchestra parts, marked in the score as ''[[ad libitum]]'', may be left out or replaced by other instruments of equivalent musical scale.&lt;ref name="MFAoP" /&gt;

In 1908, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], later to become the first Prime Minister of independent Poland, [[musical quotation|quoted]] the anthem in a disguised way in his [[Symphony in B minor (Paderewski)|Symphony in B minor "Polonia"]].  He scored it in [[duple meter]] rather than its standard triple meter.

The anthem was quoted by [[Edward Elgar]] in his symphonic prelude [[Polonia (Elgar)|Polonia]], composed in 1915.

{{see also|Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)}}

In 1795, after a prolonged decline and despite last-minute attempts at constitutional reforms and armed resistance, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was ultimately [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] by its three neighbors: [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. A once vast and powerful empire was effectively erased from the map while monarchs of the partitioning powers pledged never to use the name "Poland" in their official titles. For many, including even leading representatives of the [[Polish Enlightenment]], this new political situation meant an end of the Polish nation.&lt;ref name=czaplin&gt;

[[File:Wybicki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Józef Wybicki]] (1747–1822)]]

Meanwhile, Polish patriots and revolutionaries turned for help to [[French First Republic|France]], Poland's traditional ally, which was at war with Austria (member of the [[First Coalition]]) at the time. [[Józef Wybicki]] was among the leading moderate émigré politicians seeking French aid in re-establishing Polish independence. In 1796, he came up with the idea of creating Polish Legions within the [[French Revolutionary Army]]. To this end, he convinced General [[Jan Henryk Dąbrowski]], a hero of the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1794)|Greater Poland campaign]] of the 1794 [[Kościuszko Uprising]], to come to Paris and present the plan to the [[French Directory]]. Dąbrowski was sent by the Directory to Napoleon who was then spreading the [[French Revolution]] in northern Italy. In January 1797, the newly created French-controlled [[Cisalpine Republic]] accepted Dąbrowski's offer and a Polish legion was formed. Dąbrowski and his soldiers hoped to fight against Austria under Napoleon and, subsequently, march across the Austrian territory, "from Italy to Poland", where they would ignite a national uprising.&lt;ref name=czaplin/&gt;

[[File:Lapide Wybicki.jpg|thumb|right|A commemorative plaque in [[Reggio Emilia]]]]

In early July 1797, Wybicki arrived in Reggio Emilia where the Polish Legions were then quartered and where he wrote the ''Song of the Polish Legions'' soon afterwards. He first sung it at a private meeting of Polish officers in the Legions' headquarters at the episcopal palace in Reggio. The first public performance most probably took place on 16 July 1797 during a military parade  in Reggio's Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). On 20 July, it was played again as the Legions were marching off from Reggio to [[Milan]], the Cisalpine capital.&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt;

With its heart-lifting lyrics and folk melody, the song soon became a popular tune among Polish legionaries. On 29 August 1797, Dąbrowski already wrote to Wybicki from [[Bologna]]: "soldiers gain more and more taste for your song."{{efn|Polish: {{lang|pl|Żołnierze do Twojej pieśni coraz więcej gustu nabierają}}.&lt;ref name=kuczyn /&gt;}} It appealed to both officers, usually émigré noblemen, and simple soldiers, most of whom were [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]] peasants who had been drafted into the Austrian army and captured as [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] by the French. The last stanza, referring to Kościuszko, who famously fought for freedom of the entire nation rather than the nobility alone, and the "scythes of Racławice", seems to be directed particularly at the latter. Wybicki may have even hoped for Kościuszko to arrive in Italy and personally lead the Legions which might explain why the chorus "March, march, Dąbrowski" is not repeated after the last stanza. At that time Wybicki was not yet aware that Kościuszko had already returned to [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt;

=== Rising popularity ===
The song became popular in Poland as soon as late 1797 and quickly became an object of variations and modifications. A variant from 1798 introduced some stylistic changes, which have since become standard, such as replacing ''{{lang|pl|nie umarła}}'' ("not dead") with ''{{lang|pl| zginęła}}'' ("not perished") or ''{{lang|pl|do Polski z ziemi {{Not a typo|włoski}}}}'' ("to Poland from the Italian land") with ''{{lang|pl|z ziemi włoskiej do Polski}}'' ("from the Italian land to Poland"). It also added four new stanzas, now forgotten, written from the viewpoint of Polish patriots waiting for General Dąbrowski to bring freedom and human rights to Poland.

[[File:Pieśń Legionów 5.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Father, in tears, says to his Basia...'']]

The ultimate fate of the Polish Legions in Italy was different from that promised by Wybicki's song. Rather than coming back to Poland, they were exploited by the French government to quell uprisings in Italy, Germany and, later, in [[Haiti]] where they were decimated by [[Haitian Revolution|war]] and disease.&lt;ref name=czaplin/&gt; Polish national hopes were revived with the outbreak of a Franco-Prussian war (part of the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]) in 1806. Napoleon called Dąbrowski and Wybicki to come back from Italy and help gather support for the French army in Polish-populated parts of Prussia. On 6 November 1806, both generals arrived in [[Poznań]],&lt;ref name=czaplin/&gt; enthusiastically greeted by locals singing "Poland Is Not Yet Lost".&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt; The ensuing [[Greater Poland Uprising (1806)|Greater Poland Uprising]] and Napoleon's victory over Russian forces at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] led to the creation of a French-controlled Polish puppet state known as the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=czaplin/&gt;

"Poland Is Not Yet Lost" was one of the most popular patriotic songs in the duchy, stopping short of becoming that entity's national anthem. Among other occasions, it was sung in Warsaw on 16 June 1807 to celebrate the battle of Friedland, in [[Kraków]] as it was liberated by Prince [[Józef Poniatowski]] on 19 July 1809, and at a ball in Warsaw on 23 December 1809, the birthday of [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus]], King of Saxony and Duke of Warsaw. On the occasion of Dąbrowski's [[name day]] on 25 December 1810 in Poznań, Dąbrowski and Wybicki led the mazurka to the tune of "Poland Is Not Yet Lost". Although the melody of Wybicki's song remained unchanged and widely known, the lyrics kept changing. With the signing of a Franco-Russian alliance at [[Treaties of Tilsit|Tilsit]] in 1807, the fourth stanza, specifically mentioning Russians as Poland's enemies, was removed. The last stanza, referring to Kościuszko, who had grown suspicious of Napoleon and refused to lend his support to the emperor's war in Poland, met the same fate.&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
The blow struck with such skill, with such force unsurpassed,
That the strings rang out boldly, like trumpets of brass,
And from them to the heavens that song wafted, cherished,
That triumphal march: Poland has never yet perished!

Clapped, and all "March Dąbrowski!" cried out as a choir.&lt;/poem&gt;

The anthem is mentioned twice in ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]'', the Polish [[national epic]] written by Adam Mickiewicz in 1834, but set in the years 1811–1812. The author makes the first reference to the song when Tadeusz, the main protagonist, returns home and, recalling childhood memories, pulls the string of a chiming clock to hear the "old Dąbrowski's Mazurka" once again. [[Musical box]]es and [[musical clock]]s playing the melody of ''Poland Is Not Yet Lost'' belonged to popular patriotic paraphernalia of that time. The song appears in the epic poem again when Jankiel, a Jewish [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimerist]] and ardent Polish patriot, plays the mazurka in the presence of General Dąbrowski himself.&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt;

[[File:Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Michel Guilbert d'Anelle, ''Expiring Soldier of Liberty'' (1849). The painting shows a dying [[freedom fighter]] scrawling "Poland is not yet lost" in his blood.]]

With Napoleon's defeat and the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 came a century of foreign domination over Poland interspersed with occasional bursts of armed rebellion. ''Poland Is Not Yet Lost'' continued to be sung throughout that period, especially during national uprisings. During the [[November Uprising]] against Russia in 1830−1831, the song was chanted in the battlefields of [[Battle of Stoczek|Stoczek]], [[Battle of Olszynka Grochowska|Olszynka Grochowska]] and [[Battle of Iganie|Iganie]]. In peacetime, Polish patriots performed it at homes, official functions and political demonstrations. New variants of the song, of various artistic value and length of life, abounded. At least 16 alternative versions were penned during the November Uprising alone. At times, Dąbrowski's name was replaced by other national heroes: from [[Józef Chłopicki]] during the November Uprising to [[Józef Piłsudski]] during the First World War to [[Władysław Sikorski]] during the Second World War. New lyrics were also written in regional dialects of Polish, from [[Silesia]] to [[Warmia|Ermland]] and [[Masuria]].&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt; A variant known as ''Marsz Polonii'' ("March [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]") spread among Polish immigrants in the Americas.

Mass political emigration following the defeat of the November Uprising, known as the [[Great Emigration]], brought ''Poland Is Not Yet Lost'' to Western Europe. It soon found favor from Britain to France to Germany where it was performed as a token of sympathy with the Polish cause. It was also highly esteemed in Central Europe where various, mostly [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], peoples struggling for their own independence, looked to the Polish anthem for inspiration. Back in Poland, however, especially in the parts under Russian and Prussian rule, it was becoming increasingly risky to sing the anthem in public. Polish patriotic songs were banned in Prussia in 1850; between 1873 and 1911, German courts passed 44 sentences for singing such songs, 20 of which were specifically for singing ''Poland Is Not Yet Lost''. In Russian Poland, public performance of the song often ended with a police intervention.&lt;ref name=kuczyn/&gt;

=== Choice of national anthem ===
When Poland re-emerged as an independent state after World War I in 1918, it had to make a decision about its national symbols. While the coat of arms and the flag were officially adopted as soon as 1919, the question of a national anthem had to wait. Apart from "Poland Is Not Yet Lost", there were other popular patriotic songs which could compete for the status of an official national anthem.

[[File:Bogurodzica rekopis1407.png|thumb|Sheet music for ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' from 1407]]

In the Middle Ages, the role of a national anthem was played by hymns. Among them were "[[Bogurodzica]]" ({{Lang-en|"Mother of God"}}), one of the oldest (11th-12th century) known literary texts in Polish, and the Latin ''[[Gaude Mater Polonia]]'' ("Rejoice, Mother Poland"), written in the 13th century to celebrate the canonization of Bishop [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów]], the patron saint of Poland. Both were chanted on special occasions and on battlefields. The latter is sung nowadays at university ceremonies. During the [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], several songs, both religious and secular, were written with the specific purpose of creating a new national anthem. Examples include the 16th-century Latin prayer ''{{lang|la|Oratio pro Republica et Rege}}'' ("Prayer for the Commonwealth and the King") by a Calvinist poet, Andrzej Trzeciński, and "{{lang|pl|Hymn do miłości Ojczyzny|italic=no}}" ("Hymn to the Love of the Fatherland") written in 1744 by Prince-Bishop [[Ignacy Krasicki]]. They failed, however, to win substantial favor with the populace. Another candidate was "{{lang|pl|[[Bóg się rodzi]]|italic=no}}" ("God is Born"), whose melody was originally a 16th-century coronation [[polonaise]] for Polish kings.

The official anthem of the Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] was "{{lang|pl|Pieśń narodowa na pomyślność Króla|italic=no}}" ("National Song to the King's Well-being") written in 1816 by [[Alojzy Feliński]] and Jan Kaszewski. Initially unpopular, it evolved in the early 1860s into an important religious and patriotic hymn. The final verse, which originally begged "Save, Oh Lord, our King", was substituted with "Return us, Oh Lord, our free Fatherland" while the melody was replaced with that of a Marian hymn. The result, known today as "{{lang|pl|Boże, coś Polskę|italic=no}}" ("God Save Poland"), has been sung in Polish churches ever since, with the final verse alternating between "Return..." and "Bless, Oh Lord, our free Fatherland", depending on Poland's political situation.

A national song that was particularly popular during the November Uprising was "[[Warszawianka (1831)|Warszawianka]]", originally written in French as "{{lang|fr|La Varsovienne|italic=no}}" by [[Casimir Delavigne]], with melody by [[Karol Kurpiński]]. The song praised Polish insurgents taking their ideals from the French [[July Revolution]] of 1830. A peasant rebellion against Polish nobles, which took place in western [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] in 1846 and was encouraged by Austrian authorities who wished to thwart a new uprising attempt, moved [[Kornel Ujejski]] to write a mournful [[chorale]] entitled "{{lang|pl|Z dymem pożarów|italic=no}}" ("With the Smoke of Fires"). With the music composed by {{ill|Józef Nikorowicz|pl}}, it became one of the most popular national songs of the time, although it declined into obscurity during the 20th century. In 1908, [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Feliks Nowowiejski]] created "[[Rota (poem)|Rota]]" ("The Oath"), a song protesting against the oppression of the Polish population of the [[German Empire]], who were subject to eviction from their land and forced assimilation. First publicly performed in 1910, during a quincentennial celebration of the Polish–Lithuanian victory over the [[Teutonic Knights]] at [[Battle of Grunwald|Grunwald]], it too became one of the most treasured national Polish songs.

&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Polish pianist [[Artur Rubinstein]], who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference did not have a delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]]. He then sat down to the piano and played ''Poland Is Not Yet Lost'' loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous ''forte''. When he had finished, the public rose to their feet and gave him a great ovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|location=Stevens Point, Wisconsin|publisher=Point Publications|journal=[[Gwiazda Polarna]]|issn=0740-5944|date={{date|2008-10-11}}|volume=99|issue=21|last=Ulanowska|first=Elżbieta|title=Na cześć Artura Rubinsteina: Pianistyczna gala w Łodzi|trans-title=In Honor of Artur Rubinstein: Piano Gala in [[Łódź]]|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 60 years later, on {{date|2005-09-22}}, [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], [[President of Poland]], said: {{bq|For the [[United Nations|UN]] is rightly criticised for being anachronistic, for reflecting the old world that is drifting away into the past.

This time it was the orchestra that played the Dąbrowski Mazurka, and at that moment the memories of the great Artur Rubinstein and his performance came back with full force and it was very touching indeed for me.

== Influence ==
During the European [[Revolutions of 1848]], "Poland Is Not Yet Lost" won favor throughout Europe as a revolutionary anthem. This led the [[Slovaks|Slovak]] poet [[Samo Tomášik]] to write the ethnic anthem, "[[Hey, Slavs]]", based on the melody of the Polish national anthem. It was later adopted by the [[Pan-Slavic Congress of 1848|First Congress of the Pan-Slavic Movement]] in [[Prague]] as the Pan-Slavic Anthem. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], a translation of this anthem became the [[national anthem]] of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and later, [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The similarity of the anthems sometimes caused confusion during these countries' football or volleyball matches. However, after the 2006 split between the two, neither [[Serbia]] nor [[Montenegro]] kept the song as its national anthem, instead choosing "[[Bože pravde]]" and "[[Oj, svijetla majska zoro]]" respectively. The Polish anthem is also notable for influencing the lyrics of the Ukrainian anthem, "[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]" (''Ukraine's glory has not yet perished'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location={{bracket|s.l.}}|publisher={{bracket|s.n.}}|work=NationalAnthems.me

The line "Poland is not lost yet" has become proverbial in some languages. For example, in German, ''[[wikt:noch ist Polen nicht verloren|noch ist Polen nicht verloren]]'' is a common saying meaning "all is not lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Polen|title=Duden - Polen - Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition|work=[[Duden]]|accessdate=30 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621122236/http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/polen|archive-date=21 June 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pravo Ljudski Film Festival''' ({{lang-bs|Pravo ljudski festival / Право Људски Фестивал}}) is an annual [[human rights]] documentary [[film festival]] held in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoljudski.org/2017/home/film-festival/about-pljff/|title=Sarajevo / Sutra počinje Pravo Ljudski Film Festival koji donosi 90 filmova|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/sutra-pocinje-pravo-ljudski-film-festival-koji-donosi-90-filmova/243747|title=About PLJFF|publisher=official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name translates to ''Totally Human''. It was established in 2006 with the goal of promoting socially engaged non-fictional audiovisual projects, dedicated to the development of critical spectatorship through socially engaged documentaries and independent art cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/bs/pravo-ljudski/a-17238892|title=Pravo Ljudski panorama|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held for two weeks in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/the-8th-human-rights-film-festival/|title=The 8th Human Rights Festival|publisher=sarajevotimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival has developed an independent [[non-profit]] civic association under the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/pravo-ljudski-ne-bismo-mijenjali-ni-za-najcrveniji-tepih|title='Pravo Ljudski' ne bismo mijenjali ni za najcrveniji tepih|publisher=Al Jazeera Balkans}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest festival of its kind in [[Southeastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ubrzaj.me/o-nama/|title=Ubrzaj Festival|publisher=ubrzaj.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/bs/pravo-ljudski/a-17238892|title=Pravo Ljudski panorama|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival takes its roots from a 2005 documentary film screening for students of the European Regional MA in Democracy and Human Rights in South East Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoljudski.org/2017/home/about/history/|title=Festival History|publisher=official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established one year later as an international documentary festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoljudski.org/2017/home/about/history/|title=Festival History|publisher=official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was held in June 2006 and it organized screenings of 17 films, while hosting 7 international filmmakers. The next year's edition widened the program and launched numerous annual workshops as part of the festival. Pravo Ljudski screens over 100 films from 45 different countries a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhrt.ba/kultura/film/veceras-pocinje-11-film-festival-pravo-ljudski/|title=Večeras počinje 11. film festival Pravo Ljudski|publisher=bhrt.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and programs==
The festival is made up of several programs, of which only one carries a competition format: the Best New Film program and it awards the Extra Muros Award to the best young director of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/za-tri-dana-pocinje-pravo-ljudski-film-festival/121104072|title=Za tri dana počinje Pravo ljudski film festival|publisher=klix.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zoom Rights Youth Program is an experience-sharing platform merging socially engaged cinema and art, youth activism and experiential and non-formal educational opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=22308|title=Fade In documentaries at the Human Rights Film Festival in Sarajevo|publisher=culturenet.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an educational program, it functions on three levels: critical (understanding and analysing films and themes covered by different films or artworks through interactive discussions and workshops); cultural (widening youth experiences of film through interactive lectures) and creative (young people creating films themselves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/za-tri-dana-pocinje-pravo-ljudski-film-festival/121104072|title=Za tri dana počinje Pravo ljudski film festival|publisher=klix.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Zoom Rights Youth Program functions as a year-long platform of activities run by the Pravo Ljudski civic association, its festival activities, in the form of a three-day youth festival within the annual Pravo Ljudski Film Festival aimed at audience aged 14 to 25 is the most prominent activity. Central to Zoom Rights is Zoom Documentary Film, which features screenings of creative documentary cinema covering a range of topics. The Zoom Lights is another program that presents socially engaged audio projects from across the world and organizes sound design workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oslobodjenje.ba/o2/kultura/pravo-ljudski-film-festival-prijavite-se-na-projekat-hoces-kod-mene|title=Pravo Ljudski Film Festival: Prijavite se na projekat Hoćeš kod mene?|publisher=oslobodjenje.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oslobodjenje.ba/o2/kultura/muzika/sloboda-kretanja-radionica-zvuka-pravo-ljudski-film-festivala|title=Sloboda kretanja: Radionica zvuka Pravo Ljudski Film Festivala|publisher=oslobodjenje.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-Lab Activist Art Laboratory===
The A-Lab is an annual multi-discipline workshop designed to promote collaborations between artists that use different media such as photography, film, sound design and animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oslobodjenje.ba/o2/kultura/pravo-ljudski-film-festival-prijavite-se-na-projekat-hoces-kod-mene|title=Pravo Ljudski Film Festival: Prijavite se na projekat Hoćeš kod mene?|publisher=oslobodjenje.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is structured around three creative disciplines – photography, creative documentary film and comic book art. Participants focus on one chosen discipline, but rely on experience sharing and an interdisciplinary approach to execute their respective projects. The working language for all projects must be English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoljudski.org/2017/home/film-education/a-lab-activist-art-laboratory/|title=A-Lab Activist Art Laboratory|publisher=official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychogeography''' is an exploration of urban environments that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting".  It has links to the [[Situationist International]].  Psychogeography was defined in 1955 by [[Guy Debord]] as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/2 Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life". Another definition is "a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities... just about anything that takes [[pedestrians]] off their predictable paths and jolts them into a new [[awareness]] of the urban landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Joseph (July/August 2004). [http://www.utne.com/2004-07-01/a-new-way-of-walking.aspx "A New Way of Walking"]. ''[[Utne Reader]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychogeography was originally developed by the avant-garde movement [[Lettrist International]] in the journal ''Potlatch''.  The originator of what became known as [[unitary urbanism]], psychogeography, and the [[dérive]] was [[Ivan Chtcheglov]], in his highly influential 1953 essay "Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau" ("Formulary for a New Urbanism").&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"]. Full text at bopsecrets.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lettrists' reimagining of the city has its precursors in aspects of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]].  The idea of urban wandering relates to the older concept of the [[flâneur]], theorized by [[Charles Baudelaire]].  Following Chtcheglov's exclusion from the Lettrists in 1954, [[Guy Debord]] and others worked to clarify the concept of unitary urbanism, in a bid to demand a revolutionary approach to architecture.  At a conference in Cosio di Arroscia, [[Italy]] in 1956, the Lettrists joined the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] to set a proper definition for the idea announced by [[Gil J. Wolman]]: "Unitary Urbanism - the synthesis of art and technology that we call for — must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;Wolman, Gil (1956). ''Address by the Lettrist International Delegate to the Alba Conference of September 1956'' ALba: Lettrist International.&lt;/ref&gt;  It demanded the rejection of functional, [[Euclid]]ean values in [[architecture]], as well as the separation between art and its surroundings.  The implication of combining these two negations is that by creating abstraction, one creates art, which, in turn, creates a point of distinction that unitary urbanism insists must be nullified.  This confusion is also fundamental to the execution of unitary urbanism as it corrupts one's ability to identify where "function" ends and "play" (the "ludic") begins, resulting in what the Lettrist International and [[Situationist International]] believed to be a utopia where one was constantly exploring, free of determining factors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;!-- These last few sentences need referencing. Who is making these arguments? --&gt;

In "Formulary for a New Urbanism", Chtcheglov had written "Architecture is the simplest means of articulating time and space, of modulating reality, of engendering dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan (1953). [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Situationists found contemporary architecture both physically and ideologically restrictive, combining with outside cultural influence, effectively creating an undertow, and forcing oneself into a certain system of interaction with their environment: "[C]ities have a psychogeographical relief, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes which strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones".{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}

The Situationists' response was to create designs of new urbanized space, promising better opportunities for experimenting through mundane expression.  Their intentions remained completely as abstractions.  Guy Debord's truest intention was to unify two different factors of "ambiance" that, he felt, determined the values of the urban landscape: the soft ambiance — light, sound, time, the association of ideas — with the hard, the actual physical constructions.  Debord's vision was a combination of the two realms of opposing ambiance, where the play of the soft ambiance was actively considered in the rendering of the hard.  The new space creates a possibility for activity not formerly determined by one besides the individual.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

However, the Situationist International may have been [[tongue-in-cheek]] about some parts of psychogeography.  "This apparently serious term 'psychogeography'", writes Debord biographer Vincent Kaufman, "comprises an art of conversation and drunkenness, and everything leads us to believe that Debord excelled at both."{{Sfn|Kaufman|2006|p=114}}

Eventually, Debord and [[Asger Jorn]] resigned themselves to the fate of "urban relativity".  Debord readily admits in his 1961 film ''A Critique of Separation'', "The sectors of a city…are decipherable, but the personal meaning they have for us is incommunicable, as is the secrecy of private life in general, regarding which we possess nothing but pitiful documents".  Despite the ambiguity of the theory, Debord committed himself firmly to its practical basis in reality, even as he later confesses, "none of this is very clear. It is a completely typical drunken monologue…with its vain phrases that do not await response and its overbearing explanations. And its silences."&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of Separation'' (1961). Complete Cinematic Works ([[AK Press]], 2003, Trans. Knabb. K)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before settling on the impossibility of true psychogeography, Debord made another film, ''On the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time'' (1959), the title of which suggests its own subject matter.  The film's narrated content concerns itself with the evolution of a generally passive group of unnamed people into a fully aware, anarchistic assemblage, and might be perceived as a biography of the situationists themselves.  Among the rants which construct the film (regarding art, ignorance, consumerism, militarism) is a desperate call for psychogeographic action:
{{cquote
|When freedom is practised in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself. The ambiance of play is by nature unstable. At any moment, "ordinary life" may prevail once again. The geographical limitation of play is even more striking than its temporal limitation. Every game takes place within the boundaries of its own spatial domain.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Moments later, Debord elaborates on the important goals of unitary urbanism in contemporary society:
{{cquote
|The atmosphere of a few places gave us a few intimations of the future powers of an architecture that it would be necessary to create in order to provide the setting for less mediocre games.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Quoting [[Karl Marx]], Debord says:
{{cquote
|People can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is animated. Obstacles were everywhere. And they were all interrelated, maintaining a unified reign of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

While a reading of the texts included in the journal ''Internationale Situationniste'' may lead to an understanding of psychogeography as dictated by Guy Debord, a more comprehensive elucidation of the term would come from research into those who have put its techniques into a more developed practise.  While Debord's influence in bringing Chtchglov's text to an international audience is undoubted, his skill with the 'praxis' of unitary urbanism has been placed into question by almost all of the subsequent protagonists of the Formulary's directives.  Debord was indeed a notorious drunk (see his Panegyrique, Gallimard 1995) and this altered state of consciousness must be considered along with assertions he made regarding his attempts at psychogeographical activities such as dérive and constructed situation.  The researches undertaken by WNLA, AAA and the London Psychogeographical Association during the 1990s support the contention of Asger Jorn and the Scandinavian Situationniste (Drakagygett 1962 - 1998) that the psychogeographical is a concept only known through practise of its techniques.  Without undertaking the programme expounded by Chtchglov, and the resultant submission to the urban unknown, comprehension of the Formulary is not possible.  As Debord himself suggested, an understanding of the 'beautiful language' of situationist urbanism necessitates its practice.

==Dérive==
{{Main|Dérive}}
Psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies.  Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of dérive ("drift").

{{cquote
|In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there… But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}
}}

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops — the geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, ed. (1998). ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel Pub.. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".{{Sfn|McDonough|2004|p=259}}  To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation.  The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the {{clarify|text=situationist city|date=August 2016}}.

==Contemporary psychogeography==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] serves as the focal point of local psychogeography oriented groups]]Since the 1990s, as situationist theory became popular in artistic and academic circles, [[avant-garde]], [[neoist]], and [[revolutionary]] groups emerged, developing psychogeographical [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in various ways.  Influenced primarily through the re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] and the foundation of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]], these groups have assisted in the development of a contemporary psychogeography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychogeography.org |title=psychogeography.org weblog and archive |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1996 The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture undertook an extensive programme of practical research into classic (situationist) psychogeography in both [[Glasgow]] and London.  The discoveries made during this period, documented in the group's journal ''Viscosity'', expanded the terrain of the psychogeographic into that of [[urban design]] and architectural performance.

The journal ''[[Transgressions: A Journal of Urban Exploration]]'' (which appears to have ceased publication sometime in 2000) collated and developed a number of post-avant-garde revolutionary psychogeographical themes.  The journal also contributed to the use and development of psychogeographical maps&lt;ref&gt;"The production of psychogeographical maps, or even the introduction of alterations such as more or less arbitrarily transposing maps of two different regions, can contribute to clarifying certain wanderings that express not subordination to randomness but total insubordination to habitual influences (influences generally categorized as tourism, that popular drug as repugnant as sports or buying on credit)." from ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography'', Debord 55&lt;/ref&gt; which have, since 2000, been used in political actions, drifts and projections, distributed as flyers. Since 2003 in the [[United States]], separate events known as [[Provflux]] and [[Psy-Geo-conflux]] have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments, under the academic umbrella of psychogeography.

Psychogeography also become a device used in [[performance art]] and [[literature]].  In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in particular, psychogeography has become a recognised descriptive term used in discussion of successful writers such as [[Iain Sinclair]] and [[Peter Ackroyd]] and the documentaries of filmmaker [[Patrick Keiller]].  The popularity of Sinclair drew the term into greater public use in the United Kingdom.  Though Sinclair makes infrequent use of the jargon associated with the Situationists, he has certainly popularized the term by producing a large body of work based on pedestrian exploration of the urban and suburban landscape.  Sinclair and similar thinkers draw on a longstanding British literary tradition of the exploration of urban landscapes, predating the Situationists, found in the work of writers like [[William Blake]], [[Arthur Machen]], and [[Thomas de Quincey]].  The nature and history of [[London]] were a central focus of these writers, utilising [[Romanticism|romantic]], [[gothic novel|gothic]], and [[occult]] ideas to describe and transform the city.  Sinclair drew on this tradition combined with his own explorations as a way of criticising modern developments of urban space in such key texts as ''Lights Out for the Territory''.  Peter Ackroyd's bestselling ''London: A Biography'' was partially based on similar sources.  [[Merlin Coverley]] gives equal prominence to this literary tradition alongside Situationism in his 2006 book ''Psychogeography'', not only recognising that the situationist origins of psychogeography are sometimes forgotten, but that via certain writers like [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Daniel Defoe]], and Charles Baudelaire, they had a shared tradition. Novelist [[Will Self]] had a column "Psychogeography" which started out in the [[British Airways]] [[Inflight magazine]] and then appeared weekly in the Saturday magazine of ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper until October 2008.

The concepts and themes seen in popular comics writers such as [[Alan Moore]] in works like ''[[From Hell]]'' are also now seen as significant works of psychogeography.  Other key figures in this version of the idea are [[Walter Benjamin]], [[J. G. Ballard]], and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]].  Part of this development saw increasing use of ideas and terminology by some psychogeographers from [[Charles Fort|Fort]]ean and occult areas like [[earth mysteries]], [[ley lines]], and [[chaos magic]], a course pioneered by Sinclair.  A core element in virtually all these developments remains a dissatisfaction with the nature and design of the modern environment and a desire to make the everyday world more interesting.

After a few years of practicing, the psychogeography group that gravitates around the Urban Squares Initiative and Aleksandar Janicijevic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/07author.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033354/http://urbansquares.com/07author.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330183148/http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html |date=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the initiator of, and main figure in organizing and leading this group, came up with the working definition of this procedure as: "The subjective analysis–mental reaction, to neighbourhood behaviours related to geographic location. A chronological process based on the order of appearance of observed topics, with the time delayed inclusion of other relevant instances". In 2013 Aleksandar Janicijevic published "Urbis - Language of the urban fabric" as a visual attempt to rediscover lost or neglected urban symbols. In 2015 another book was published "MyPsychogeography", an attempt to synthesize sketches and ideas which have informed his art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |title=psychogeography now – window to the urban future &amp;#124; …… |publisher=Photoblog.urbansquares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606150623/http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |archivedate=2013-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate making dérives, a number of applications for mobile devices have been created over the last few years.  Most notably, Dérive app,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deriveapp.com/ Dérive app]&lt;/ref&gt; Serendipitor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serendipitor.net/ Serendipitor]&lt;/ref&gt; Drift,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brokencitylab.org/drift/ Drift]&lt;/ref&gt; and Random GPS&lt;ref&gt;[http://nogovoyages.com/random_gps.html Random GPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Samshvilde Sioni inscription''' ({{lang-ka|სამშვილდის სიონის წარწერა}}) is the [[Georgian language]] inscription written in the Georgian ''[[Asomtavruli]]'' script on the Sioni Church in [[Samshvilde]], a ruined [[basilica]] located in the [[Tetritsqaro Municipality]], [[Kvemo Kartli]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Originally the inscription was 35 ''[[metre|metres]]'' long but only 10 metres of inscription survived.&lt;ref&gt;N.

Several scholars differently dated the inscription because of its damage. [[Sargis Kakabadze]] dates it to 778 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Kakabadze 1924: 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgi Chubinashvili]] - 8th century, [[Ekvtime Takaishvili]] - 958 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Taqaishvili 1905: 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Marie-Félicité Brosset]] thought the inscription was dated to 1313 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Brosset 1856: 99-102&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scabbling'''—also called '''scappling'''—is the process of reducing stone or concrete. In masonry, it refers to shaping a stone to a rough square by use of an [[axe]] or [[hammer]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Scabbling |volume=24 |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kent, [[rag-stone]] masons call this "knobbling".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It was similarly used to shape [[grindstones]]. 

In modern construction, scabbling is a mechanical process of removing a thin layer of concrete from a structure, typically achieved by [[compressed air]] powered machines. A typical scabbling machine uses several heads, each with several [[carbide]] or steel tips that peck at the concrete. It operates by pounding a number of tipped rods down onto the concrete surface in rapid succession. It takes several passes with the machine to achieve the desired depth. 

Scabbling is used to remove road markings, surface [[contamination]] (used in the [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] industry), to add a decorative or textured pattern to concrete, or to prepare a concrete surface prior to the installation of [[grout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Masterflow Expoxy Grouts | publisher = BASF | url = http://www.basf-cc.ae/en/products/Grouting/EpoxyGrouts/Documents/TDS%20-Masterflow%20Epoxy%20Grouts.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-03-30}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Southern man Dignan.jpg|thumb|"Southern Man" (2002) painting by James Dignan]]
In [[New Zealand]], the '''southern man''' is a stereotypical male from the more rural south island, well used to the solitude and conditions of open mountain or hill country, and completely out of his depth in the city. He is usually depicted as wearing an oilskin duster, [[Swanndri]] and [[slouch hat]], an image closely related to Kiwi stockmen. This stereotype is closely connected with a common trope in New Zealand fiction, the [[man alone]]. 

The stereotype draws on images of [[High country (New Zealand)|high country]] farmers and hunters, particularly from areas such as [[Central Otago]] and the [[Mackenzie Basin]], who work large [[sheep station]]s, often employing the horse and dog rather than mechanised transport, due to the terrain they have to cover.&lt;ref&gt; Bishop, D. "[http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/rural-women/76620222/what-makes-the-perfect-southern-man What makes the perfect Southern Man?]", ''stuff.co.nz'', 9 February 2016. Retrieved 13 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricelli, E. ''[http://aspiringguides.com/AG/media/documents/Blog%20Documents/Wild-Walks-by-Aspiring-Guides-Islands-Magazine-Article_1.pdf Moving south]'', ''aspiringguides.com'', 2014. Retrieved 13 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This archetypal New Zealand character, though strong in tradition, is one currently facing a threat to its existence in the real world, thanks to changes in New Zealand's traditional rural ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Van Beynen, M. "[https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2018/01/last-of-the-southern-men/ Last of the southern men]," ''stuff.co.nz''. Retrieved 6 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The stereotype became better known through the advertising campaign of [[Otago]]'s best known pale lager beer, [[Speight's]], in a series of advertisements which have been running since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, C. "[https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ephemera/29266/southern-man Southern man]", ''Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand'', 5 May 2011. Retrieved 13 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Speight's sponsored the production of a bronze statue personifying the stereotype, "Southern Man" by [[Sam Mahon]], which has stood at the entrance to [[Dunedin International Airport]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Dingwall, R.

The stereotype was later acknowledged in a song regarded as an unofficial anthem of [[Dunedin|Dunedin City]] and [[Otago]] in general.

The semi-autobiographical novels of [[Barry Crump]], though set in the North Island, conform strongly to the southern man stereotype. The character of Uncle Hec (played by [[Sam Neill]]) in the [[Taika Waititi]] film ''[[Hunt for the Wilderpeople]]'' — based on a Crump novel — is a big-screen personification of the southern man character.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">The '''Spanish era''' or '''era of Caesar''' was a dating system commonly used in the states of the [[Iberian peninsula]] until the 14th–15th centuries, when it was phased out in favour the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system. The calendar began with year one in what is 38 BC,&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"&gt;Roth, Norman. ''Medieval Iberia An Encyclopedia''. Routledge, 2003, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the date of a new tax imposed by the [[Roman Republic]] on the subdued population of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].{{cn|date=October 2017}} Whatever the case, the date signifies the beginning of the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' in Iberia. To convert from an ''Anno Domini'' date to the corresponding year in the Spanish era, add 38 to the ''Anno Domini'' year.&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt; A date in the Spanish era was written thus: "Era CMXLI" for "anno domini 903".

The use of the Caesar Era probably began in Iberia in the 3rd century. The reason for its particular popularity is unknown. Official usage ceased in different parts of the Iberian peninsula at different times: in [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in 1349, [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] 1358, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] 1383 and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] 1422. While the year officially began on 1 January under the Spanish era, that was changed to 25 December when the ''Anno Domini'' system was adopted. (The church, however, used 11 January.)&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt;

'''Synthetic phonics''' (UK) or '''blended phonics''' (US), also known as '''inductive phonics''',&lt;ref name="sedl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of teaching reading which first teaches the letter sounds and then builds up to blending these sounds together to achieve full pronunciation of whole words. This article relates to the [[English language]] only.
{{toc limit|3}}

==Overview==

Synthetic phonics refers to a family of programs which aim to teach literacy through the following methods:&lt;ref name="phonicsplay Glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phonicsplay.co.uk/SubjectKnowledge.htm |title=Subject Knowledge: Glossary |work= |accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching students the correspondence between graphemes and phonemes.
* Teaching students to read words by '''blending''': identifying the graphemes in the word, recalling the corresponding phonemes, and saying the phonemes together to form the sound of the whole word.
* Teaching students to write words by '''segmenting''': identifying the phonemes of the word, recalling the corresponding graphemes, then writing the graphemes together to form the written word.

Synthetic phonics programs have some or all of the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="vanderbilt Phonics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://my.vanderbilt.edu/specialeducationinduction/files/2011/09/1-Literacy-teaching-guide-phonics.pdf |title=Literacy teaching guide: Phonics |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Teaching grapheme-phoneme correspondence out of alphabetic order, following an order determined by perceived complexity (going from easiest to hardest to learn).
* Teaching the reading and writing of words in order of increasing irregularity, teaching words which follow typical grapheme-phoneme correspondence first, and teaching words with idiosyncratic or unusual grapheme-phoneme correspondence later.

Synthetic phonics programs do not have the following characteristics:
* Encouraging students to guess the meaning of words from contextual clues (see [[whole language]] method). 
* Encouraging students to memorise the shape of words, to recall them by sight (see [[Look say]] method). 
* Teaching grapheme-phoneme correspondence on an ad-hoc basis and as applied to particular groups of words, when these words arise in other forms of reading instruction (see embedded phonics).

==Methodology==

Synthetic [[phonics]] teaches the [[phoneme]]s (sounds) associated with the [[grapheme]]s (letters) at the rate of about six sounds per week. The sounds are taught in isolation then blended together (i.e. synthesised), all-through-the-word. For example, learners might be taught a short [[vowel sound]] (e.g. /a/) in addition to some [[consonant]] sounds (e.g. /s/, /t/, /p/). Then the learners are taught words with these sounds (e.g. sat, pat, tap, at). They are taught to pronounce each phoneme in a word, then to blend the phonemes together to form the word (e.g. /s/ - /a/ - /t/; "sat"). Sounds are taught in all positions of the words, but the emphasis is on all-through-the-word segmenting and blending from week one. It does not teach whole words as shapes ([[Sight words|initial sight vocabulary]]) prior to learning the alphabetic code.

Synthetic phonics develops [[phonemic awareness]] along with the corresponding letter shapes. It involves the learners rehearsing the writing of letter shapes alongside learning the letter/s-sound correspondences preferably with the tripod pencil grip. [[Dictation (exercise)|Dictation]] is a frequent teaching technique from letter level to word spelling, including [[pseudoword|nonsense word]]s (e.g. choy and feep)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/spr/pdf/spr373fien.pdf |title=Using Nonsense Word Fluency to Predict Reading Proficiency in Kindergarten Through Second Grade for English Children and Native English Speakers |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ByrneFielding-Barnsley1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Brian|last2=Fielding-Barnsley|first2=Ruth|title=Evaluation of a program to teach phonemic awareness to young children.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=83|issue=4|year=1991|pages=451–455|issn=1939-2176|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.451}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually extending to [[Written language|text]] level. It does not teach letter names until the learners know their letter/s-sound correspondences thoroughly and how to blend for reading and [[segment (linguistics)|segment]] for spelling. Often when letter names are introduced it is through singing an alphabet song.

Synthetic phonics teaches phonics at the level of the individual phoneme from the outset; not [[syllable]]s and not [[Syllable onset#Onset|onset]] and [[Syllable rhyme|rime]]. Synthetic phonics does not teach anything about reading as a meaning-focused process. It highlights decoding and pronunciation of words only. Teachers are to put accuracy before speed, because [[fluency]] (i.e. speed, accuracy,expression, and comprehension) will come with time.&lt;ref name="nichd findings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/reading/reading.pdf |title=Ontario Early Reading Strategy 2003 |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic phonics involves the teaching of the transparent alphabet (e.g. /k/ as in "cat") before progressing onto the opaque alphabet (e.g. /k/ as in "school"). In other words, learners are taught steps which are straightforward and 'work' before being taught the complications and variations of [[pronunciation]] and [[spelling]] of the full alphabetic code. It introduces irregular words and more tricky words (defined as words which cannot be pronounced phonically – English has a surprisingly large number of these, usually the commonest words of all such as 'to', 'of', etc.) slowly and systematically after a thorough introduction of the transparent alphabet code (learning the 44 letter/s-sound correspondences to [[automaticity]] and how to blend for reading and segment for spelling). Phonics application still works at least in part in such words.

Synthetic phonics involves a heavy emphasis on hearing the sounds all-through-the-word for spelling and not an emphasis on "look, cover, write, check".  This latter, visual form of spelling plays a larger part with unusual spellings and spelling variations although a phonemic procedure is always emphasised in spelling generally.  Teachers read a full range of literature with the learners and ensure that all learners have a full range of experience of activities associated with literacy such as [[role play]], [[drama]], [[poetry]], but the learners are not expected to 'read' text which is beyond them, and the method does not involve guessing at words from context, picture and initial letter clues.

===Typical programme===

*learning letter sounds (as distinct from the letter names);
:For example, mmm not em, sss not es, fff not ef. The letter names can be taught later but should not be taught in the early stages.
*learning the 40+ sounds and their corresponding letters/letter groups;

==Systematic phonics==
'''Systematic phonics''' is not one specific method of teaching phonics; rather, it is a family of phonics instruction that includes the methods of both synthetic phonics and analytical phonics. They are "systematic" because the letters, and the sounds they relate to, are taught in a specific sequence; as opposed to incidentally or on a 'when-needed' basis. However, it should be noted that, in most instances, the term systematic phonics appears to refer to synthetic phonics because of the specific instruction methods it uses. (In the United Kingdom, the term "systematic phonics" is "generally understood as synthetic phonics" according to the reading review which was conducted in 2006.&lt;ref name="UK Gov PDF-EN-01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006PDF-EN-01.pdf |title=Independent review of the teaching of early reading |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Systematic phonics does ''not'' include methods such as ''embedded phonics'' and ''phonics mini lessons'' which are found in [[Whole language|the ''Whole Language'' approach]] and the [[Balanced Literacy|''Balanced Literacy'' approach]].

===Analytical phonics===
'''[[Analytical phonics]]''' practitioners do not teach learners to pronounce sounds "in isolation" as is the practice with Synthetic Phonics. Furthermore, consonant blends (separate, adjacent consonant phonemes) are taught as units (e.g., in the word 'shrouds' the shr would be taught as a unit). Some analytical phonics programs (referred to as analogy phonics) teach learners to break-down words into their common components which are referred to as the "onset" and the "rime". In the word "ship", "sh" is the "onset"  and "ip" is the "rime" (the part starting with the vowel). In other words, analytical phonics teaches the learner to say /sh/ - /ip/ (ship) and /sh/ - /op/ (shop), whereas synthetic phonics, teaches the learner to say /sh/ - /i/ - /p/ (ship) and /sh/ - /o/ - /p/ (shop). In analytical phonics, learners are also taught to find the similarities among words (e.g. man, can, tan, fan, and ran), whereas synthetic phonics devotes most of its time to learning the letter/sound relationships (i.e. grapheme/phoneme).

===Synthetic phonics===
Synthetic Phonics uses the concept of 'synthesising', which means 'putting together' or 'blending'. Simply put, the sounds prompted by the letters are synthesised (put together or blended) to pronounce the word.&lt;ref name="sedl"/&gt;

==Common terminology==
Some common terminology used within this article includes:
*'''alphabetic code''' (in synthetic phonics): The relationship between sounds (phonemes) and the letter/s (graphemes) that represent them are referred to as a "code". For example, the sound /ay/ can be represented in many ways (e.g. cake, may, they, eight, aid, break, etc.).&lt;ref name="NELP 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lincs.ed.gov/publications/pdf/NELPReport09.pdf |title=Developing Early Literacy |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Alphabetic principle]]
*'''decoding skills''' (in phonics): Without the use of context, to pronounce and '''read''' words accurately by using the relationship between the letter(s) and the sounds they represent. (i.e. "cat" is /k/-/a/-/t/, "plough" is /p/-/l/-/ow/, and "school" is /s/-/k/-/oo/-/l/. "Encoding skills" (i.e. '''spelling''') is the same process in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/springsummer1998/moats.pdf |title=Teaching Decoding 1998|format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Direct instruction]]''' (also known as Explicit Instruction ): A teaching style that is characterized by "carefully designed instruction" that usually includes a fast pace, small steps, demonstrations, active participation, coaching, immediate correction, and positive feedback.&lt;ref name="dest AU Gov"/&gt; (Pg. 85)
*'''intensive instruction''': teaching or tutoring that include some of the following: more time; peer-assisted strategies; and instruction in small groups or one-on-one.&lt;ref name="bestevidence 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestevidence.org/word/strug_read_Jun_02_2010.pdf |title=Effective Programs for Struggling Readers 2010|format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pg. 209)
*'''[[Supplemental Instruction|peer-assisted literacy strategies]]''': learners work in pairs (taking turns as teacher and learner) to learn a "structured sequence" of literacy skills, such as phonemic awareness, phonics, sound blending, passage reading, and story retelling.&lt;ref name="bestevidence 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestevidence.org/word/begin_read_Jun_23_2009.pdf |title=Effective Programs for Struggling Readers 2009 |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pg. 33)
*'''supportive instruction''': teaching or tutoring that supports the student both emotionally and cognitively. This includes encouragement, immediate feedback, positive reinforcement, and [[instructional scaffolding]] (i.e. clear structure, small steps, guiding with questions).&lt;ref name="bestevidence 2010"/&gt; (Pg. 209)

==History==
The teaching of reading and writing has varied over the years from [[spelling]] and [[phonetic]] methods to the fashions for [[look-say]] and [[whole language]] methods. In America in the eighteenth century, [[Noah Webster]] introduced spelling approaches with syllabaries and in England the use of [[James Pitman]]'s [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]] was popular in the 1960s. Recently phonic methods have been revived.

===Australia===
In December 2005 the Department of Education, Science and Training of the Australian Government published a report entitled a National Inquiry into the Teaching of Reading.&lt;ref name="dest AU Gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf |title=Teaching Reading |format=PDF |work=Australian Government Department of Education, Science and Training. |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024503/http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommends direct and systematic instruction in phonics as the foundation of early reading instruction. Some of the findings (not always supported by reliable evidence){{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} are:

* Among the successful schools visited, there were a number of key similarities. Three of those similarities are:
:# a belief that each child can learn to read and write regardless of background;
:# an early, systematic, and "explicit" (i.e. specific and clear) teaching of phonics;
:#the phonics instruction was followed by "direct teaching".
* Students learn best from an approach that includes phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary knowledge and comprehension. (Executive Summary)
* A whole-language approach, "on its own, is not in the best interests of children, particularly those experiencing reading difficulties". (Pg. 12)
* Where there is unsystematic or no phonics instruction, children do not perform as well in such areas as reading accuracy, fluency, writing, spelling and comprehension. (Pg. 12)
* A recommendation that teachers provide "systematic, direct and explicit phonics instruction".(Pg. 14)

===Canada===

In Canada, public education is the responsibility of the Provincial and Territorial governments.  There is no evidence that ''systematic phonics (including synthetic phonics)'' has been specifically adopted by any of these jurisdictions. However, the curriculum of all of the Canadian provinces include most or all of the following: phonics, phonological awareness, segmenting and blending, decoding, phonemic awareness, graphophonic cues, and letter-sound relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/teach/curriculum	|title=British Columbia Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.alberta.ca/k-12-education.aspx	|title=Alberta Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edonline.sk.ca/webapps/moe-curriculum-BBLEARN/CurriculumHome?id=28	|title=Saskachewan Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/cur/ela/docs/outcomes/index.html	|title=Manitoba Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/language.html|title=Ontario Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/site_web/documents/PFEQ/educprg2001-051.pdf|title=Quebec Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/education/k12/content/anglophone_sector/curriculum_anglophone.html|title=New Brunswick Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/education-early-learning-and-culture/language-arts-curriculum|title=Prince Edward Island Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ednet.ns.ca/files/curriculum/AYRP-3-RAR.pdf|title=Nova Scotia Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov.nl.ca/edu/k12/curriculum/guides/index.html|title=Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, systematic phonics and synthetic phonics received attention in the following publications:

* In 2005 the Ministry of Education for the government of [[Ontario]] published a report entitled ''Early Reading Strategy: The Report of the Expert Panel on Early Reading in Ontario and Early Math Strategy:''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oafccd.com/documents/educationforall.pdf  |title=Early Reading Strategy - The Report of the Expert Panel on early Reading in Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states "This Expert Panel supports the position of the National Reading Panel (2000) that phonics instruction should be integrated into a comprehensive and balanced reading program. Instruction in phonics and decoding should not be conceived of as a total reading program, but neither should it be neglected." Pg 104
* In 2009, the Ministry of Education for the province of [[British Columbia]] posted a discussion paper on their Read Now website entitled ''Reading: Breaking Through the Barriers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readnowbc.ca/assets/pdfs/k12/reading_breaking_through_the_barriers.pdf |title=Reading: Breaking Through the Barriers A Discussion Guide |format=PDF |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper states that explicit and synthetic phonics needs to be taught directly in the classroom because it works "for all students but are particularly helpful for students at risk for reading difficulty".  (Pg. 8) There appears to be no evidence, however, that systematic phonics (or synthetic phonics) is a part of the teaching pedagogy.
* Dr. Robert Savage, formerly of [[McGill University]] and now at [[UCL Institute of Education]], [[University College London]], concludes that, with respect to remedial programs, we should not wait for children to fail before using phonics programs. He also recommends the teaching of such skills as segmenting and blending alongside the [[Direct instruction|"explicit teaching"]] of letter sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literacyencyclopedia.ca/index.php?fa=items.show&amp;topicId=247 |title=Word Reading Instruction Methods: The Evidence Concerning Phonics |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says there is a need for more [[Randomized controlled trial]]s in order to produce more definitive conclusions.

===United Kingdom===
A review of the teaching of early reading was undertaken by Sir Jim Rose at the request of the [[Department for Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006pdf-EN-01.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130401151715/http://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/0201-2006pdf-EN-01.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-01 |title=Independent review of the teaching of early reading |format=PDF |year=2006|accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the report often uses the term "''Systematic'' Phonic work", it appears to support "''Synthetic'' Phonics" as evidenced in the Rose Review.  In fact, the Department of Education, England uses the term "systematic synthetic phonics". The following is a summary of the report's observations and recommendations concerning phonics:
#The skills of speaking, listening, reading and writing are used by (and are supported by) what it refers to as "high quality, systematic phonics".
#Young children should receive sufficient pre-reading instruction so they are able to start systematic phonics work "by the age of five".
#High quality phonics work should be taught as "the prime approach" to teaching reading, writing, and spelling.
#Phonics instruction should form a part of "a broad and rich language curriculum". Note: critics of this report point out that the report does not explain what they mean by this, nor does it offer any details on how to achieve this within the framework of synthetic phonics' instruction.

====Critics of the report====
* In a report dated April 2007,&lt;ref name="Wyse, Styles, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyse|first1=Dominic|last2=Styles|first2=Morag|title=Synthetic phonics and the teaching of reading: the debate surrounding England's ?Rose Report? |journal=Literacy |volume=41|issue=1 |year=2007|pages=35–42|issn=1741-4350|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9345.2007.00455.x |url=http://www.edalive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/RoseEnquiryPhonicsPaperUKLA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; professors Dominic Wyse&lt;ref name="Wyse, Goswami, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyse|first1=Dominic |last2=Goswami |first2=Usha |title=Synthetic phonics and the teaching of reading|journal=British Educational Research Journal|volume=34|issue=6 |year=2008 |pages=691–710|issn=0141-1926|doi=10.1080/01411920802268912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/staff/EYPE/59721.html |title=Professor Dominic Wyse |work=Institute of Education University of London |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Morag Styles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/styles/ |title= Morag Styles |format= |work=Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that the evidence "supports" systematic phonics; however, the Rose Report's assertion that synthetic phonics should be the "preferred method" is "not supported by research evidence".  This criticism is based on the way the research was conducted and how the results were interpreted.&lt;ref name="Wyse, Styles, 2007"/&gt;
* In October 2011, The ''National Campaign for Real Nursery Education'' web site (U.K.) comments on the U.K. government's intent to impose a specific type of phonics teaching (i.e. systematic, synthetic phonics) in the nursery and reception years, and suggests that this decision was not supported by the "research evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncne.co.uk/|title=National Campaign for Nursery Education and Childrens Rights and Needs|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919060517/http://www.ncne.co.uk/|archivedate=2011-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developments following the Rose Review====

* Following the adoption of the phonics approach in its schools, the Department of Education, England provided a great deal of online support for teachers wishing to learn more.
* In March 2011 the Department of Education, England released its White paper entitled "The Importance of Teaching". In the Executive Summary, item 12 of the curriculum section states their commitment to support "systematic synthetic phonics, as the best method for teaching reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/schoolswhitepaper/b0068570/the-importance-of-teaching/executive-summary/curriculum |title=Curriculum, assessment and qualifications (2012) |format= |work=Department of Education, England |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study]] (PIRLS 2016) report was released in December 2017. It reports on the reading abilities of students aged 9 and 10 in 50 countries, and shows that England has risen to Joint 8th place in 2016; its best since 2001. This confirms "that our approach is working", according to Minister Nick Gibb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/12/04/phonics-revolution-reading-standards-england-best-generation/ | title= Telegraph 2017/12/04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PIRLS 2016 has a summary of England's Language/Reading Curriculum in the Fourth Grade that shows the increased emphasis on "phonic knowledge and skills as the route to decode words until automatic decoding has become embedded and reading is fluent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-results/encyclopedia/countries/england/languagereading-curriculum-in-the-fourth-grade/ |title=England's language reading curriculum in the fourth grade}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016 the London School of Economics published a paper that supports the teaching of synthetic phonics to disadvantaged children because it helps to close the literacy gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/25/phonics-method-helps-close-attainment-gap-study-finds|title=Phonics helps to close the attainment gap:The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1425.pdf|title=Teaching to teach literacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
[[Education Scotland]] found that explicit, systematic phonics programs, usually embedded in a rich literacy environment, give an additional four months progress over other programs such as whole language, and are particularly beneficial for young learners (aged 4–7). There is evidence, though less secure, that synthetic phonics programs may be more beneficial than [[analytical phonics]] programs; however it is more important to systematically teach to the children's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.gov.scot/improvement/pages/EEF-Toolkit-Results.aspx?911459f09ef0012d8e7c32f03e32d003d881d45febd1eba332753219e922d8f5|title=National Improvement Hub:Phonics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic phonics in Scotland has its roots in the Clackmannanshire Report, a seven-year study that was published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/02/20682/52383|title=Insight: A Seven Year Study of the Effects of Synthetic Phonics Teaching on Reading and Spelling Attainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the report claim that the results were exaggerated and due to more than just synthetic phonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://reclaimingschools.org/2016/06/04/the-scottish-phonics-miracle-myths-and-evidence/|title=The Scottish phonics miracle, myths and evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States has a long history of debate concerning the various methods used to teach reading, including [[Phonics]]. In 1999, The [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|''National Institute of Child Health and Human Development'']] (NICHD) appears to conclude that systematic phonics programs are "significantly more effective" than non-phonics programs. It also concludes that they found no significant difference between the different phonics approaches, while suggesting that more evidence may be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/upload/ch2-II.pdf |title=Phonics Instruction |format=pdf |work=National Reading Panel |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NICHD has come out in support of phonics instruction. The institute conducts and supports research on all stages of human development. The institute conducted a [[meta-analysis]] and, in 2000 it published a report entitled ''Report of the [[National Reading Panel]]: Teaching Children to Read''.&lt;ref name="nichd findings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/nrp|title=NICHD Archive January 2018, National Reading Panel Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''findings and determinations'' of this report are:

*Teaching [[phonemic awareness| phonemic awareness(PA)]] to children was "highly effective" with a variety of children under a variety of conditions. (Note: Phonemic Awareness/PA is the ability to manipulate [[phoneme]]s in spoken [[syllable]]s and words. Phonemes are the smallest units composing spoken language. For example, the words "go" and "she" each consist of two sounds or phonemes, /g/-/oe/ and /sh/-/ee/.)
*Reading instruction that taught PA improved the children's reading ability significantly more than those that lacked this instruction.
*PA helped normally achieving children to spell, but was not effective in helping disabled readers to spell better.
*"Systematic synthetic phonics" instruction had a positive and significant effect on helping disabled readers, low achieving students, and students with low socioeconomic status to read words more effectively than instruction methods that lacked this approach.
*Systematic Phonics instruction improved the ability of good readers to spell. Poor readers experienced a small improvement in spelling.

Other findings of this report are:

* Guided Oral Reading (reading out loud and receiving systematic and explicit feedback from a teacher) "had a significant and positive impact on word recognition, fluency, and comprehension".
* The value of Independent Silent Reading is unclear; however it is clear that it should not be the only type of reading instruction to develop fluency and other reading skills.
* Vocabulary, both oral and print, should be taught directly and indirectly because it leads to gains in comprehension.
* Teaching a combination of reading comprehension techniques is the most effective, however more research is needed to determine which techniques are the most effective.

In 2014 the California Department of Education stated "Ensuring that children know how to decode regularly spelled one-syllable words by mid-first grade is crucial". It goes on to say that "Children need to be phonemically aware (especially able to segment and blend phonemes)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter3.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 1, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills of segmenting and blending phonemes are a central aspect of synthetic phonics. In grades two and three children receive explicit instruction in advanced phonic-analysis and reading multi-syllabic and more complex words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter4.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Pedagogy Grades Two and Three, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the New York State Public School system began a process to revise its English Language Arts Learning Standards. The new standards call for teaching involving "reading or literacy experiences" as well as [[phonemic awareness]] from prekindergarten to grade 1 and phonics and word recognition from grade 1 to grade 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-next-generation-english-language-arts-learning-standards|title=2015 New York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Ohio Legislature set minimum standards requiring the use of phonics as a technique in teaching reading. It includes guidelines for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Operating-Standards/Table-of-Contents/Instruction/Phonics|title=Rules for Phonics, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Early-Learning/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-District-Resources/Approved-List-of-Research-Based-Reading-Instructio/Reading_Competencies.pdf.aspx|title=Reading Competencies, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Literacy/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee/Third-Grade-Reading-Guarantee-Teacher-Resources|title=Third grade reading guarantee, Ohio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Taijin kyofusho''''' (対人恐怖症 taijin kyōfushō, '''TKS''', for ''taijin kyofusho symptoms'') is a [[Japan]]ese [[culture-specific syndrome]]. The term taijin kyofusho translates into the disorder (sho) of fear (kyofu) of interpersonal relations (taijin).&lt;ref&gt;Slayor, A. (2012, July 20). Taijin Kyofusho in Japan and South Korea. Retrieved June 19, 2013 from [http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp204-us12/2012/07/20/taijin-kyofusho-in-japan-and-south-korea/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have taijin kyofusho are likely to be extremely embarrassed about themselves or fearful of displeasing others when it comes to the functions of their bodies or their appearances. These bodily functions and appearances include their faces, odor, actions, or even looks. They do not want to embarrass other people with their presence. This culture-bound syndrome is a [[social phobia]] based on fear and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Nobuo Kiriike. (2003, February 3). Open Trial Of Milnacipran For Taijin-Kyofusho In Japanese Patients With Social Anxiety Disorder. Retrieved June 17, 2013 from EBSCOhost.[http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;sid=dcb03d77-cc80-4fbc-b7c7-4f666f44fab1%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=116]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of this disorder include avoiding social outings and activities, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, panic attacks, trembling, and feelings of dread and panic when around people. The causes of this disorder are mainly from emotional trauma or psychological defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;James, R. (2006). Culture-bound syndromes: Taijin Kyofusho. In Y. Jackson (Ed.), Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. (pp. 146-147).

==Subcategories==
''Taijin kyofusho'' is commonly described as a form of [[social anxiety]] (social [[phobia]]), with the person dreading and avoiding social contact, and as a subtype of ''shinkeishitsu'' ([[anxiety disorder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1363461504047933 |title=Taijin Kyofusho in University Students: Patterns of Fear and Predispositions to the Offensive Variant |year=2004 |last1=Tarumi |first1=S. |journal=Transcultural Psychiatry |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=533–46 |pmid=15709650 |last2=Ichimiya |first2=A |last3=Yamada |first3=S |last4=Umesue |first4=M |last5=Kuroki |first5=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of a fear of [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]] themselves or being harshly judged by others because of their social ineptness, sufferers of ''taijin kyofusho'' report a fear of offending or harming other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=520018 |year=1979 |last1=Tanaka-Matsumi |first1=J |title=Taijin Kyofusho: Diagnostic and cultural issues in Japanese psychiatry |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=231–45 |journal=Culture, medicine and psychiatry |doi=10.1007/bf00114612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kawai, T., Minabe, Y., ori, N., Suzuki, K., Takei, N., (2003)., Is Taijin Kyofusho a Culture-Bound Syndrome?. http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=176343&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is thus on avoiding harm to others rather than to oneself.

In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]), variants of ''taijin kyofusho'' (shubo-kyofu and jikoshu-kyofu) are listed under 300.3 (F42) "Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders".&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5.|year=2013|publisher=Amer. Psychiatric Pub. Incorporated.|location=Arlington, VA|isbn=9780890425541|edition=5th|pages=263–264, 837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source{{which|date=July 2014}} even breaks ''taijin kyofusho'' into two different subtypes: neurotic and offensive. The first subtype can be broken into two parts that are classical type and avoidant type. The classical type being afraid of being judged negatively because of physical signs of anxiety and feeling shame due to anxiety. The physical signs that can cause fear of being judged include sweating and tremors. The second subtype deals with people thinking something about them is offensive. Some of their fears include body odor, gas, excessive or insufficient eye contact, blushing, etc.

In the official Japanese diagnostic system, ''taijin kyofusho'' is subdivided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2012 |chapter=Culture specific diagnoses |chapterurl=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/328181.html |editor1-first=Sana |editor1-last=Loue |editor2-first=Martha |editor2-last=Sajatovic |title=Encyclopedia of Immigrant health |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-5659-0}}{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sekimen-kyofu ({{lang-ja|赤面恐怖}}), the phobia of [[blushing]] (ereuthophobia)
* Shubo-kyofu ({{lang-ja|醜貌恐怖}}), the phobia of a deformed body, similar to [[body dysmorphic disorder]]
* Jikoshisen-kyofu ({{lang-ja|自己視線恐怖}}), the phobia of [[eye contact]]
* Jikoshu-kyofu ({{lang-ja|自己臭恐怖}}), the phobia of having foul [[body odor]] (also termed [[olfactory reference syndrome]], osmophobia or bromidrosiphobia)

Japan psychology also recognizes additional types of ''taijin kyofusho'' based on severity:

* Transient: This type of ''taijin kyofusho'' is short-lived and moderately severe. It most commonly appears in teens, but may occur at any time.
* Delusional: This is the most common type of ''taijin kyofusho'' and is the most similar to social phobia. It is chronic, often begins before the age of 30, and varies in severity from moderate to severe.
* Phobic with [[schizophrenia]]: This is a more complicated disorder. In such cases, rather than a phobia, ''taijin kyofusho'' is a manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Fritscher, L. (2013, April 01). Taijin Kyofusho. Retrieved from www.about.com. June 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Typically, this disease is presaged by a childhood history of social inhibition and [[shyness]].&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt; It is possible that it could result from a humiliating traumatic experience, or it could emerge from a lifelong onset of the illness that only comes to the surface after time.&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt;

Clinical data indicates that more males have the condition than females, despite the fact that females scored higher on a [[social phobia]] scale than men, and report higher scores on proclivity towards feelings of embarrassment. This differs from Western society where the prevalence of females with social phobias is to some extent greater than that of males.&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt; The lifetime prevalence of the disorder falls anywhere between 3% and 13% with changes in severity occurring throughout one's lifetime. It is estimated that about 17% of individuals with taijin kyofusho have fears of releasing foul body odor.&lt;ref name="Feusner"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.20688 |title=Olfactory reference syndrome: Issues for DSM-V |year=2010 |last1=Feusner |first1=Jamie D. |last2=Phillips |first2=Katharine A. |last3=Stein |first3=Dan J. |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=592–9 |pmid=20533369 |pmc=4247225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
A person may be diagnosed with taijin kyofusho if they feel as if their attitudes, behavior, and physical characteristics are inadequate in social situations. As a result of these feelings, they also experience persistent suffering in the form of emotional distress through [[shame]], embarrassment, anxiety, fear, and other tense feelings that occur when confronted with social circumstances. In addition, individuals also worry about being unable to maintain healthy relationships with others. When it comes to socializing, taijin kyofusho sufferers avoid painful social and interpersonal situations, while simultaneously being averse to doing so.&lt;ref name="Saunders, D. 2013"/&gt; Those likely to develop taijin kyofusho have more of a temperamental characteristic of being hypochondriacal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 10454167| year = 1999| author1 = Maeda| first1 = F| title = Understanding taijin kyofusho through its treatment, Morita therapy| journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research| volume = 46| issue = 6| pages = 525–30| last2 = Nathan| first2 = J. H. | doi=10.1016/S0022-3999(98)00113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between introversion and extroversion in hypochondriacal temperament is geared more towards introversion. The introversion causes sufferers to focus on themself and problems they have, and by fixating on their weaknesses they become more anxious and depressed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A problem with culture-bound syndromes is that they are resistant to some medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Kincaid, A., (2012). Taijin Kyofusho- "The Disorder of Fear".&lt;/ref&gt;{{better_source|date=October 2014}}}{{medical_citation_needed|date=October 2014}} The standard Japanese treatment for taijin kyofusho is [[Morita therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kora |first=T. |title=Morita Therapy |publisher=The ToDo Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Shoma Morita]] in the 1910s as a treatment for the Japanese mental disorders taijin kyofusho and shinkeishitsu ([[Anxiety|nervousness]]). The original regimen involved patient isolation, enforced [[bed rest]], diary writing, manual labor, and lectures on the importance of self-acceptance and positive endeavor. Since the 1930s, the treatment has been modified to include out-patient and [[Group psychotherapy|group treatments]]. This modified version is known as neo-Morita therapy. Medications have also gained acceptance as a treatment option for taijin kyofusho. Other treatments include [[systematic desensitization]], which includes slowly exposing one self to the fear, and learning relaxation skills, to extinguish fear and anxiety.

[[Milnacipran]], a [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI), is currently used in the treatment of taijin kyofusho and has been shown to be efficacious for the related [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name=amn&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13651500510029228 |title=Effect of milnacipran on insight and stress coping strategy in patients with Taijin Kyofusho |year=2005 |last1=Nagata |first1=Toshihiko |last2=Wada |first2=Akira |last3=Yamada |first3=Hisashi |last4=Iketani |first4=Toshiya |last5=Kiriike |first5=Obuo |journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=193–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary aspect of treating this disorder is getting patients to focus their attention on their body parts and sensations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''''Team Galaxy, le Collège de l'Espace''''' or '''''Galaxie Académie''''' (in [[Quebec]]) is a [[France|French]]-[[Italy|Italian]]-[[Canada|Canadian]] animated series made by [[Marathon Production]], [[Rai Fiction]] and [[Image Entertainment Corporation]]. It blends 2D animation with CG elements, and is set at "Galaxy High" (not to be confused with the school in the 1980s animated series of the [[Galaxy High School|same name]]), where a [[Group (sociology)|trio]] of young [[student]]s try to balance their regular teenage lives and their [[training]] to become Space Marshals. The concept and animation style is similar to that of both ''[[Totally Spies!]]'' and ''[[Martin Mystery]]'', other series created by the same production company.

''Team Galaxy'' is co-produced by a number of international broadcasters, such as [[France 3]] which was the first to begin airing the full series from 28 August 2006. In the [[United States]], [[Cartoon Network]] paid Marathon about $16–$17 million for 52 episodes, for a premiere in fall 2006. It also appears on Canada's [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[CBBC]]/[[Disney XD (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney XD]] in the UK.

==Plot==
"Team Galaxy" is about a group of friends who try to balance both their school work and their free time. The three protagonists, Josh, Yoko, and Brett, are among the students of a school called "Galaxy High", a galactic justice authority, which defends the galaxy against criminals. The school teaches subjects suitable for these types of missions, which their students endure. The series apparently takes place during the present day, but in an episode where they go through a time skip, a calendar says that the year is 2051, hinting that the actual series takes place in 2050.

Since the final 3 episodes of season 2 of Team Galaxy 'Predator Plants from Outer Space', a new plot has been introduced where Omni, an android as well as a student of another space school, is searching for his fellow schoolmates after his school has been destroyed by an alien bounty hunter named Gangus. He is convinced to stay at Galaxy High for the time being and is promised by Josh, Brett, Yoko, and the rest of GH to help him. Unfortunately, due to the show currently ending at 52 episodes, this plot hasn't been addressed any further.

==Characters==

===Students===
* '''Josh Kirkpatrick''' ([[Kirby Morrow]]): A rebellious 17-year-old adrenaline junkie, who prefers space training to classroom theory. He mostly fails his classes but succeeds on his missions. He was afraid of water after a childhood incident involving losing his swimming trunks, but has since overcome it after facing it head-on. But for all his wild stunts, Josh’s independent thinking is a perfect fit for the team. Although he has repeatedly said he wants to be out of GH, he has never really meant it. His father is the GH's principal, Principal Kirkpatrick. His suit as a space marshal is dark blue. He is in the same team as Brett and Yoko.
* '''Yoko''' ('''Kiko''' in the French dub) ([[Katie Griffin]]): A 15-year-old karaoke-loving wannabe pop singer (who can't carry a tune) and amazingly creative artist who sees Galaxy High as just a step on her way to stardom. Her main weapon is her sonic blaster. Yoko's terrible singing is a running gag in the show, and despite how bad it is, she wins many interstellar competitions with it (aliens think her voice is music while Josh and Brett start crying in pain.) Often, Yoko is distracted on missions when a talent competition or something that could boost her career pops up. She is also a fashion wizard who is always conscious of her looks and style.  Her desire for stardom and fame often lead to her capture or place the group in danger. She had a crush on Seth, until she heard his voice. Her suit as a space marshal is light purple.  She is in the same team as Josh and Brett.
* '''Brett''' ([[Tabitha St. Germain]]): A 10-year-old headstrong genius, who despite his brilliance feels restricted by his young age. He hates to be called a "kid". He uses his own personal computer to control the hornet, to analyze DNA, and to use Gluefoam. Brett takes missions more seriously than Yoko and Josh, and often scoffs when they shirk their mission. He is the most sensible of the group, but due to his youth and fun-loving partners, he is often ignored. Josh often uses him to do his own homework or for other selfish reasons. His suit as a space marshal is red. He is in the same team as Josh and Yoko.
* '''Bobby''' ([[Samuel Vincent|Sam Vincent]]): One of Josh's rivals from Galaxy High. He is by far the most competitive student, and with his high grades and sharp skills (and big ego), he isn’t shy about telling everyone who’s the top gun on campus. His suit as a space marshal is purple. He is in the same team as Toby and Kimball.
* '''Toby''': Always out to prove that she is the toughest student on campus, Josh describes her as the cutest and most popular girl in school. She always has to be the center of attention, which annoys Yoko.  Her suit as a space marshal is yellow. She is in the same team as Bobby and Kimball.
*'''Princess Kimball''': Kimball is a princess. Her privileged upbringing has made her a bit naive and oblivious about the other students. Much like her friend Toby, her suit as a space marshal is yellow.  She is in the same team as Bobby and Toby.
* '''Spavid''' ([[Samuel Vincent|Sam Vincent]]): Spavid is one of the few alien students at Galaxy High. He is well liked by all in spite of his general clumsiness. After growing into adulthood, he developed superhuman powers and enhanced reflexes but chose to suppress them after he let them get to his head. His suit as a space marshal is purple. He is in the same team as Ryan (Orion) and Andi (Andromeda).
* '''Orion and Andromeda''': They are also known as twin brother and sister, Ryan and Andi. They are from outer space, but on Earth they are known as "global citizens". Ryan's suit as a space marshal is presumably purple, meanwhile Andi's suit as a space marshal is presumably yellow, like other typical space marshalls. They are both Spavid's teammates.
* '''Seth''': A talented musician and Yoko's love interest. He once seemed to be cold and to have no interest in Yoko, but it turned out that he simply did not speak so as to not strain his voice, and was too shy to ask her out. His suit as a space marshal and his team remain unknown.

===Teachers===
* '''Principal Kirkpatrick (Sarge)''' ([[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]): A former commander of a military academy who was brought in to be principal at Galaxy High, whose students are determined to get on his last nerve. He has a jolly personality amid his usual strict demeanor. He is afraid of speaking to large crowds, but has since overcome his fears after reading Yoko's book about overcoming stage fright. Captain Smith is also his longtime buddy; it is unknown whether it's true or not.
* '''Mrs. Schragger''': Galaxy High's astronomy teacher. She has unusually accurate senses of hearing and vision, which makes cheating and chatting in her classroom utterly impossible.
* '''Mr. S (Spzoerscliipw’)''': The team's favorite teacher, despite his unattractive physical appearance by human standards.
* '''Mr. Fitch''' ([[Trevor Devall]]): A fast-talking space cowboy who is head of showing the new equipment for marshals. He is infamous among the students for assigning huge amounts of homework.
* '''Ms. Roskoff''': A Russian ex-cosmonaut who teaches Space Investigation Training. She is the school’s most athletic instructor.

===UltraPets===
On the first day of school at Galaxy High, each student is assigned a pet robot that serves as an aide and companion to them. Although they’re cute, if provoked an Ultrapet can transform into a powerful fighting machine and, in the blink of an eye, can immobilize an alien foe upon its master’s orders.

* '''Fluffy''' ([[Cathy Weseluck]]): Yoko's ultrapet, a cute robotic [[weasel]] (who behaves like a dog) which helps the students throughout their missions. He is capable of transforming into a bipedal attack mode. Bears a strong resemblance to Latias, the female of the Eon Duo from the Pokemon Franchise.
* '''Spike''': Spike is Toby's ultrapet.

{{main|List of Team Galaxy episodes}}

==Technology==

===Galaxy High===

====Hornet====
:The standard issue mission ship for interplanetary travel. Loss of a Hornet while not completing a mission means expulsion from Galaxy High unless it is recovered. The Hornet is armed with two forward missile launchers, two manned turrets and one automated one on the top. It can be flown by one person, though standard issue is three. In the back, the Hornet can carry a Six-by-Six or a cargo container.

====Shuttle====
Massive aerospace aircraft carrier, owned by Galaxy High. The ship serves as the personal flagship of Director Kirkpatrick. Its main purpose is the transportation of Defenders at a distance exceeding the radius of autonomous flight. For some missions the ship carries "Hornets", which have a much greater range of flight.

====Gluefoam====
:A purple glue-like substance. It is meant to incapacitate a person or patch a planet together. On skin contact, it eventually dissolves.

====Defender====
:Small lightweight craft that are mainly used in the defence of Earth and Galaxy High. Josh, Yoko, and Brett each have one of the three main types of Defender. These craft need shuttles to carry them to its destination.

:Each Defender is equipped with a variety of weapons which include hidden laser blasters and varying numbers of missiles.

'''''The Number Devil: A Mathematical Adventure''''' ({{lang-de|Der Zahlenteufel. Ein Kopfkissenbuch für alle, die Angst vor der Mathematik haben}}) is a book for children and young adults that explores [[mathematics]]. It was originally written in 1997 in German by [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] and illustrated by [[Rotraut Susanne Berner]]. The book follows a young boy named Robert, who is taught mathematics by a sly "number devil" called Teplotaxl over the course of twelve dreams.

The book was met with mostly positive reviews from critics, approving its description of math while praising its simplicity. Its colorful use of fictional [[mathematical notation|mathematical terms]] and its creative descriptions of concepts have made it a suggested book for both children and adults troubled with math. ''The Number Devil'' was a [[bestseller]] in Europe, and has been translated into English by [[Michael Henry Heim]].

==Plot==
Robert is a young boy who suffers from [[mathematical anxiety]] due to his boredom in school. His mother is Mrs. Wilson. He also experiences [[recurring dream]]s—including falling down an endless slide or being eaten by a giant fish—but is interrupted from this sleep habit one night by a small [[devil]] creature who introduces himself as the Number Devil. Although there are many Number Devils (from Number Heaven), Robert only knows him as the Number Devil before learning of his actual name, Teplotaxl, later in the story.

Over the course of twelve dreams, the Number Devil teaches Robert mathematical principles. On the first night, the Number Devil appears to Robert in an [[resizing (fiction)|oversized]] world and introduces the number [[1 (number)|one]]. The next night, the Number Devil emerges in a forest of trees shaped like "ones" and explains the necessity of the number [[0 (number)|zero]], [[negative number]]s, and introduces ''hopping'', a fictional term to describe [[exponentiation]]. On the third night, the Number Devil brings Robert to a cave and reveals how ''prima-donna'' numbers ([[prime number]]s) can only be [[division (mathematics)|divided]] by themselves and one without a [[remainder]]. Later, on the fourth night, the Number Devil teaches Robert about ''[[rutabaga]]s'', another fictional term to depict [[square root]]s, at a beach.
[[File:Number devil and robert.jpg|left|200px|thumb|An illustration by Rotraut Susanne Berner depicts the Number Devil showing a mathematical proof to Robert.]]
For a time after the fourth night, Robert cannot find the Number Devil in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where the Number Devil teaches him about [[triangular numbers]] through the use of coconuts. On the sixth night, the Number Devil teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of [[Fibonacci numbers]], which the Number Devil shortens to ''Bonacci numbers'', by counting brown and white rabbits as they [[Rabbit#Reproduction|reproduce]] multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother has noticed a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins going to sleep earlier to encounter the Number Devil. The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where the Number Devil presents [[Pascal's triangle]] and the patterns that the [[triangular array]] displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. The Number Devil arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about [[permutation]]s, and what the Number Devil calls ''vroom numbers'' ([[factorial]]s).

On the ninth night, Robert dreams he is in bed, suffering from the flu, when the Number Devil appears next to him. The Number Devil teaches Robert about [[natural numbers]], which the Number Devil calls ''garden-variety numbers'', the unusual characteristics of [[Infinity|infinite]], and [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]]. Robert finds himself at the [[North Pole]], where the Number Devil introduces [[irrational number]]s (''unreasonable numbers''), as well as aspects of [[Euclidean geometry]], such as [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] (''dots'') and [[Edge (geometry)|edges]] (''lines''). By the eleventh night, Robert has shown considerable increased interest in mathematics, but questions its validity, to which the Number Devil introduces the concept of [[mathematical proof]]s, ending with the Number Devil showing Robert a complicated proof of basic [[arithmetic]]. On the twelfth night, Robert and the Number Devil receive an invitation (which names the Number Devil as Teplotaxl) to Number Heaven, as Robert's time with the Number Devil has finished. At Number Heaven, Robert learns of [[imaginary number]]s, which Teplotaxl describes as ''imaginative numbers'', as well as the [[Klein bottle]]. Walking through Number Heaven, Teplotaxl introduces Robert to various famous [[mathematician]]s, such as [[Fibonacci]], whom Teplotaxl calls ''Bonacci'', and [[George Cantor]], or ''Professor Singer''. The book ends with Robert in class using his newfound mathematical knowledge.

==History==
[[File:Hans Magnus Enzensberger (cropped).jpg|right|125px|thumb|Hans Magnus Enzensberger]]
Enzensberger fostered a passion for mathematics and numbers, although he was not a mathematician by trade. In 1998, he delivered a speech at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] criticizing the isolation of mathematics from popular culture.&lt;ref name=speech&gt;{{cite web|last=Enzensberger|first=Hans Magnus|title=Zugbrücke außer Betrieb, oder die Mathematik im Jenseits der Kultur—eine Außenansicht|url=http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/~hebisch/cafe/zugbruecke.html|publisher=Deutsche Mathematiker Vereinigung|language=German|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ams /&gt; ''The Number Devil'' was ultimately written on suggestion from Enzensberger's eleven-year-old daughter Theresia.

The translation was particularly difficult in that it required special attention to the numerical aspect of the book. He was also challenged by the necessity to use simple English words appropriate for the target audience of ''The Number Devil''—that is, children aged eleven to fourteen.&lt;ref name=ucla&gt;{{cite web|last=Matsumoto|first=Valerie J.|title=Faculty Show Depth, Breadth of the Written Word|url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/990422faculty.aspx|work=UCLA Today|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=23 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404062136/http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/990422faculty.aspx|archivedate=4 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematics book was then published in English in 1998.&lt;ref name="publisher" /&gt;

The German author has since stated he will not write any more young adult's books, but instead direct his effort towards [[poetry]].&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; [[Viva Media]] later published an [[educational game|educational]] [[computer game]], similarly titled ''The Number Devil: A Mathematical Adventure'', based on the book.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|title=The Number Devil - PC|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/709/709282.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[audiobook]] was also released for ''The Number Devil''.&lt;ref name=brde&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisenbichler|first=Ernst|title=Der "Fliegende Robert" der Literaten|url=http://www.br.de/themen/kultur/inhalt/literatur/hans-magnus-enzensberger-80-jahre-portraet100.html|language=German|work=Bayerischer Rundfunk|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Number Devil'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. Mathematics professor [[John Allen Paulos]] of [[Temple University]] wrote an article for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', praising ''The Number Devil'' as a "charming numerical fairy tale for children."&lt;ref name=nybooks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paulos|first=John Allen|authorlink=John Allen Paulos|title=The Way to Numerical Heaven|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=18 November 1999|volume=46|issue=18|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1999/nov/18/the-way-to-numerical-heaven/|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, mathematics writer [[Martin Gardner]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' applauded Enzensberger's introduction of mathematics "in such an entertaining way."&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Michael|title=It All Adds Up|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/08/books/bk-40457|accessdate=3 September 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=8 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a book review for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Michael Pakenham approved of the book's simplicity, writing, "it's not incomprehensible. Not for a minute."&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite news|last=Pakenham|first=Michael|title=Does your head need exercise? Here's just the book for you|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-10-11/features/1998284003_1_magnus-enzensberger-number-devil-gaarder|accessdate=3 September 2011|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=11 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all reviews were positive, however. The [[American Mathematical Society]]'s [[Deborah Loewenberg Ball]] and [[Hyman Bass]] reviewed the book from a mathematical perspective. Although they praised its "attractive and imaginative [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]]," the two mathematicians found several issues. Ball and Bass were concerned with ''The Number Devil''{{'s}} negative characterization of [[mathematics education|math teacher]]s, its apparent presentation of mathematics as [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] rather than [[Mathematical proof|factual]], and a number of other contentions.&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deborah Loewenberg Ball and Hyman Bass|title=The Number Devil book review|journal=Notices of the AMS|date=January 2000|volume=47|issue=1|pages=51–56|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200001/rev-ball.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Dewan]], writing for the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'', believed it to be "far more compelling than a standard text," but found it less adventurous than he hoped for. He also criticized its use in mathematics education, stating "I suspect this is the sort of book that well-meaning adults will mistakenly thrust upon children because it will be good for them."&lt;ref name=tes&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewan|first=Ted|title=Book of the week|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/Book-of-the-week-338455/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421090744/http://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/Book-of-the-week-338455/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 April 2013|work=[[Times Educational Supplement]]|publisher=TSL Education Ltd.|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venetian literature''' is the corpus of [[literature]] in [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the [[vernacular]] language of the region roughly corresponding to [[Venice]], from the 12th century. Venetian literature, after an initial period of splendour in the sixteenth century with the success of artists such as [[Ruzante]], reached its zenith in the eighteenth century, thanks to its greatest exponent, dramatist [[Carlo Goldoni]]. Subsequently, the literary production in Venetian underwent a period of decline following the collapse of the [[Republic of Venice]], but survived nonetheless into the twentieth century to reach peaks with wonderful lyrical poets such as [[Biagio Marin]] of Grado.

== Origin ==
The first evidence of the birth of vernacular Venetian (and Italian) is the [[Veronese Riddle]], dating between the end of the eighth and the early ninth century, written in a language halfway between [[Latin]] and the vernacular.

The first fragment entirely in Venetian, dating to circa 1198, is the ''[[Ritmo bellunese]]'' which deals with events at [[Belluno]] in the years 1183 to 1196.

Also dating to the twelfth century are the verses of the love song ''[[Quando eu stava in le tu' cathene]]''.

== Thirteenth century ==
In the thirteenth century we witness in the Venetian an explosion of compositions designed to meet the literary tastes of the emerging urban classes. Especially remarkable is the production of the ''Veronese School'', with [[Giacomino da Verona]], author of the poem in two parts, ''De Gerusalem Celesti'' ("On the Heavenly Jerusalem") and  ''De Babilonia Civitate Infernali'' ("On Babylon, the Infernal City").  Published anonymously from this era are ''Lamento della Sposa Padovana'' or ''Bona çilosia''

== Fourteenth century ==
Throughout the 14th century, the centre of literary production Venetian continued to be [[Padua]].  At the end of the 14th century, [[Count Carraresi]] commissioned ''Bibbia Istoriata Padovana'' and ''Liber agregà of Serapion'' also called "Erbario Carrarese" (held at the British Library, London), a translation from the Latin ''[[Carrara Herbarium]]'', a treatise of medicine originally in Arabic.  An important writer from this period is [[Francesco di Vannozzo]] (~1330-1389).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe | author = Glanville Price | pages = 264 | isbn = 0-631-22039-9 | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cronaca de la guera tra Veniciani e Zenovesi'' by [[Daniele da Chinazzo]] is a chronicle of the [[War of Chioggia]] between 1379 and 1381.

Original works of the fourteenth century include those that go together under the name of [[Franco-Venetian literature]] characterized by a unique mix of vulgar Venetian with medieval French. Among the best known works are the anonymously authored l''Entrée d'Espagne'' and its continuation, ''La prise de Pampelune'' by [[Niccolò da Verona]].

== Later ==
Notable is a manuscript titled "[[Dialogo de Cecco di Ronchitti da Bruzene in perpuosito de la stella Nuova|Dialogue ... on the New star]]" attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1564–1642). 

The language enjoyed substantial prestige in the days of the [[Venetian Republic]], when it attained the status of a [[lingua franca]] in the [[Mediterranean]]. Notable Venetian-language authors are the playwrights [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzante]] (1502–1542) and [[Carlo Goldoni]] (1707–1793).  Both Ruzante and Goldoni, following the old Italian theater tradition (''[[Commedia dell'Arte]]''), used Venetian in their comedies as the speech of the common folk. They are ranked among the foremost Italian theatrical authors of all time, and Goldoni's plays are still performed today. Other notable works in Venetian are the translations of the [[Iliad]] by [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] (1725–1798) and [[Francesco Boaretti]], and the poems of [[Biagio Marin]] (1891–1985). 

Nowadays Venetian is still vigorous even in [[Brazil]], where it is called [[Talian dialect|Talian]]. This Venetian language version, spoken by hundreds of thousands of emigrants from Veneto living in Brasil, is written by dozens of writers, especially in Rio Grando and Santa Cattarina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6906">The '''Wassmann Foundation''', Washington, D.C, is an arts collective based in [[Melbourne, Australia]].  Founded in 2001, the collective has a rotating membership from a range of fields, including artists, writers, curators, musicians and film-makers.  The foundation oversees the estate of the fictitious [[Leipzig]] modernist and sewerage engineer [[Johann Dieter Wassmann]] (1841–1898).  More broadly, it uses its art practice to call into question the growing role of artist, curator and art institution alike, as interconnected and synergetic brands.

==History==
[[File:Freundschaftstempel, Potsdam, 1896.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Jeff Wassmann's fictional artist Johann Dieter Wassmann, ''Freundschaftstempel, Potsdam, 1896''. Albumen silver print, 18 x 23 cm. The Wassmann Foundation, Washington, D.C.]]

The Wassmann Foundation was publicly launched at the [[Melbourne International Arts Festival]] in 2003 in an exhibition titled "Bleeding Napoleon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065676092105.html|title=Hoax most perfect|last=Crawford|first=Ashley|work=Melbourne Age, October 11, 2003.|date=2003-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of Johann Dieter Wassmann were exhibited by the Wassmann Foundation across three floors of the 19th century [[Melbourne Observatory|Old Melbourne Observatory]] in a show curated by Kirsten Rann and overseen by Juliana Engberg (curator of the [[Sydney Biennale]] 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/04/1064988452601.html|title=Best of the fest|work=Melbourne Age, October 5, 2003.|date=2003-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All works were by the American [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] artist [[Jeff Wassmann]].  A [http://www.wassmannfoundation.com/ website] was established to coincide with the exhibition, which still exists today.

The popularity of the website gave rise to a range of new media efforts on the part of collective members including blogs, videos, [[MySpace]] and later [[Facebook]] sites.  After the [[U.S. Department of State]] withdrew funding from the [[Venice Biennale|Venice Biennale's]] American Pavilion in August 2004, the Wassmann Foundation turned lobbyist, leading an email campaign from "inside the Beltway" to successfully reinstate funding to the Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/03/arts/american-art-is-adrift-for-biennale-in-venice.html|title=American Art is Adrift for Biennale in Venice|last=Vogel|first=Carol|work=New York Times, August 3, 2004|date=2004-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Film Victoria]] provided a funding grant from the Documentary Development program to pursue the project as a film.  In the same year it was decided to add photography to the character's talents.  Jeff Wassmann travelled extensively through eastern Germany in March and April of that year photographing the landscapes and cityscapes in a style recognizable as turn-of-the-century modernist.  
MuseumZeitraum Leipzig was also created in the same year, ostensibly by a disgruntled employee of the Wassmann Foundation who convinced Leipzig relatives to fight for the repatriation of the character's work to Germany.  The Foundation agreed to repatriate all assemblage works in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25977/early-modern-works-returning-to-germany|title=ArtInfo, Nov. 1, 2007.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its November 1 issue, the art blog ArtInfo announced:
{{cquote|In the first accord of its kind, an American foundation is returning to a German museum works removed from the country. The Washington D.C.-based Wassmann Foundation will turn over to the MuseumZeitraum Leipzig more than 100 19th-century assemblage works by the early modernist Johann Dieter Wassmann (1841–1898) that were taken from storage in Weimar in 1912 without the knowledge or consent of the artist’s Leipzig descendants.}}

During these years [http://museumzeitraum.blogspot.com.au/2006/09/sein-und-zeit-being-and-time.html MuseumZeitraum] operated a highly popular English-language blog out of Leipzig reporting on contemporary art in eastern Europe.

With Deductible Gift Recipient status from the [[Australian Tax Office]], the Wassmann Foundation has also financed many outside performance and theater groups.

According to the Foundation's fictional narrative, the key character, Johann Dieter Wassmann, had a number of siblings who were also involved in music and the arts.  The work of these further characters is now being developed by revolving members of the collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wassmannfoundation.com/section03print.htm|title=A Carpenter's Tale|last=Stombock|first=Maime|work=Wassmann Foundation website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recently, the collective has begun distributing portfolios of the character's photographic works to museums around the world.

==Historical perspective==

The Wassmann Foundation is part of a long history of artists using fictional identities in contemporary art, although the practice has not been as widely accepted as the use of pseudonyms in the literary world, where a much richer and more established tradition has prospered.

[[Rrose Sélavy]] was the pseudonym used by the artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] in the 1920s.  In the late 1990s, the artist [[Walid Raad]] began constructing elaborate fictions chronicling the contemporary history of his native Lebanon, signing his work [http://www.theatlasgroup.org/ The Atlas Group] and presenting it as a body of collective scholarship.  In 2004 the [[Bruce High Quality Foundation]], an anonymous artists collective made up of former [[Cooper Union]] students, began a highly ambitious practice in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/arts/design/bruce-high-quality-skewers-and-seduces-the-art-world.html|title=Fake Artifact by an Unknown? Sold!|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|work=The New York Times, December 5, 2013|date=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 the [[Brooklyn Museum]] showed a retrospective of the collective's work and later in the year a silkscreen by the group, "Hooverville," depicting the New York City skyline with hobos, sold at [[Sotheby's]] for $425,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2013/nov-2013-contemporary-evening-n09037/lot.2.html|title=Sotheby's, 13 November 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Banksy]] is the pseudonym of a [[Bristol]]-born graffiti artist and political activist working since the late 1980s. For over twenty years Banksy has successfully hidden his identity from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/arts/design/banksy-makes-new-york-his-gallery-for-a-month.html|title=Mystery Man, Painting the Town|last=Smith|first=Roberta|work=New York Times, October 30, 2013|date=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Welsh Language Act 1967''',&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Welsh Language Act 1967|path=ukpga/1967/66/contents/enacted|asmade=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which gave some rights to use the [[Welsh language]] in legal proceedings in [[Wales]] (including [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]) and gave the relevant Minister the right to authorise the production of a Welsh version of any documents required or allowed by the Act. 

==Act==
The Welsh Language Act 1967 is a short Act, consisting of a Preamble and five sections. The Preamble states that "it is proper that the Welsh language should be freely used by those who so desire in the hearing of legal proceedings in Wales". The first section gives the right to use Welsh orally in court proceedings in Wales provided that the person who wishes to do so has notified the court in advance. The second and third sections allowed but did not require Ministers to provide Welsh versions of forms or wordings. The fourth section of the Act repealed the provision in Part 3 of the [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] that the term "England" should include Wales. 

==History==
The Act was based on the Hughes Parry report into the status of Welsh, published in 1965, which advocated equal validity for Welsh in speech and in written documents, both in the courts and in public administration in Wales. However, the Act did not include all of the report's recommendations. 

The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]] had made English the only language of the [[law court]]s and other aspects of public administration in Wales, even though most of the population spoke Welsh and few spoke English. The 1967 Act was the first alteration to this situation, but the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]],&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Welsh Language Act 1993|path=ukpga/1993/38/contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to put Welsh on an equal basis with English in public life.

[[File:General Vot.jpg|thumb|A General Vot]]

The '''Wot'''  (RTGS: wot, pronounced [wòːt] also written as '''Vot''') is a circular panpipe used in the traditional music of Laos and the Isan region of northeastern Thailand. It is often a major component in Pong-Lang ensembles.

==History==
The wot, a small compact instrument, inexpensive and beautifully shaped, became one of the musical instruments in Thailand a few decades ago, according to Songsak Pratumsin (Lecturer, College of Dramatic Arts) who invented in 1968.

The wot is typically made of bamboo or Ku (a kind of wood) trunk. In general, the sound is generated by blowing. High or low pitches of volume depend on the diameter and the length of wot or, more specifically, it depends on the volume capacity of the wind that goes through the wot. If the capacity is high, it gives a low tone of sound and vice versa.

The standard wot is composed of 13 pieces of wood and can make four notes following the Isan note scales, which are Sol, La, Do, and Re that can play main music or just a few strokes. The keys can also be adjusted by increasing the notes for the higher key patterns which are La, Do, Re, Mi, Fa, and Sol. The wot generally can create the voice keys up to 6 notes, which can be played for the bigger pattern. Moreover, the customized wots with seven notes can be played for the full musical scale, which is usually more difficult than the normal ones.

==Types of Wot==
The wot characteristics of form classification are

1. Tail Swing Wot

The former wot is a device for recreation which is typically not considered to be a professional musical instrument because it functions more as a toy. In the past, this type of wot includes the core, which is made of bamboo stalk that has grown in a proper time.

2. Circular Wot (general)

This wot was improved by Songsak Pratumsin by using the main features of the Tail Wot. It produces only five notes, according to the characteristics of the folk pattern.

3. Panel Wot

4. Tail Wot (used to play for fun and joyful rhythm and easy to play)

This wot is used during the harvest season when the farmers have a popular activity called “Wot Throwing Competition”. The one who throws the wot farthest is the winner. The Tail Wot makes two types of noise which are bass and treble, but does not sort into notes nor adjusts the tone playing music. Thus, it is not considered to be a musical instrument.
