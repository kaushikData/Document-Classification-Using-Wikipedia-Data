The '''abacost''', abbreviation for the French ''"à bas le costume"'' (literally "down with the suit"), was the distinctive clothing for men that was promoted by [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] as part of his ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticité]]'' programme in [[Zaire]], between 1972 and 1990. Zairians were banned from wearing Western-style [[suit (clothing)|suits]] with [[shirt]] and [[necktie|tie]] to symbolise the break with their colonial past. The abacost was a lightweight suit, worn without a tie, though sometimes with a [[cravat]]. It closely resembled a [[Mao suit]]. It was seen in long-sleeved and short-sleeved versions.

The abacost was seen as the uniform of Mobutu's supporters, especially those who had benefited from his regime. When Mobutu announced a transition to multiparty democracy in 1990, he said that the Western suit and tie would be allowed, but that he continued to favor the abacost and it would still be considered the national dress. Subsequently, when the transitional government was sworn in, all of the ministers were wearing abacosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0148) ''Zaire: A Country Study'' POLITICAL REFORM IN THE 1990s - Proclamation of the Third Republic]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arzoni]] in [[Asse|Zellik, Belgium]] produced the world's "chicest" abacosts.&lt;ref name=dvr&gt;{{cite book| author=[[David van Reybrouck]]| title=[[Congo: The Epic History of a People]]| publisher=[[HarperCollins]], 2012 |page=381f |isbn=978-0-06-220011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfons Mertens, employed by Arzoni, became Mobutu's personal tailor, also making uniforms for him and his entourage.&lt;ref name=dvr/&gt;

The abacost fell out of favour after Mobutu's fall from power.

The '''act-of-state doctrine''' or '''foreign act of state doctrine''' is a principle in [[English law|English]] and United States law which states that every [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state, and the courts will not sit in judgment of another government's acts done within its own territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Twomey|first=David|title=Business Law: Principles for Today's Commercial Environment|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Masson, OH|isbn=978-0-324-78669-9|pages=G-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=DLA&gt;Chalk, E., ''et al'', [https://www.lexology.com/library/document.ashx?g=315b1de8-df72-49ff-8b66-829a697c3df9 A reliable decision: foreign act of state doctrine applies in English arbitration], published 16 July 2018, accessed 23 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine is not required by [[international law]] (neither [[customary international law]] nor [[treaty]] law), but it is a principle recognized and adhered to by [[United States federal courts|United States federal and state courts]].&lt;ref&gt;''3rd Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States,'' §443, comment g (citing ''Sabbatino'': "the act of state doctrine . . . must be treated exclusively as an aspect of federal law," 376 U.S. at 425, and stating that "State courts are bound by the federal doctrine, and a decision of a State court sitting in judgment on the act of a foreign state would be subject to review by the Supreme Court.")&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the rationales for the doctrine include respect for other nations' sovereignty and protection of the U.S. [[executive (government)|Executive]]'s prerogative in foreign affairs, both of which may be frustrated by a decision issuing from U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;''3rd Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States,'' §443, comment a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act of State Doctrine enters consideration most often in cases where a foreign sovereign has expropriated the property of a U.S. national located in that foreign territory (e.g. through nationalization). Rather than pursuing recourse through the courts, United States nationals are to take their claims against foreign sovereign governments to the Executive so that the government can either espouse the claims of all U.S. nationals as a group or seek recourse through diplomatic channels. The United States employs the Act of State Doctrine more broadly and with more frequency than other countries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Background==
The Act of State Doctrine, which arose out of [[Thirteen American colonies|colonial]] practice in the 17th Century, entered into American jurisprudence in the case '''''Underhill v. Hernandez''''', {{ussc|168|250|1897}}.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis A. Bradley and Jack L. Goldsmith. ''Foreign Relations Law, 4th ed.''  Wolters Kluwer, 2011. p96&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1892 revolution, General [[José Manuel "Mocho" Hernández]] expelled the existing [[Venezuela]]n government and took control of [[Ciudad Bolivar]], where plaintiff Underhill lived and ran a waterworks system for the city. Underhill, an American citizen, repeatedly applied to Hernandez for an exit passport, but his requests were refused, and Underhill was forced to stay in Ciudad Bolivar and run the waterworks. Hernandez finally relented and allowed Underhill to return to the United States, where he instituted an action to recover damages for his detention in Venezuela. In finding for the Defendant, a New York Court determined that Hernandez had acted in his official capacity as a military commander so his actions were those of the Venezuelan government. The Court therefore refused to hear Underhill's claim against the government based on the Act of State Doctrine. The Court reasoned, "Every sovereign state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign state, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another, done within its own territory."&lt;ref&gt;''Underhill v. Hernandez'', 168 U.S. 250, 252 (1897).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino''==

In ''[[Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino]]'', {{ussc|376|398|1964}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] applied the Act of State Doctrine even where the state action likely violated international law. The case arose when [[Cuba]] nationalized its [[sugar]] industry, taking control of sugar refineries and other companies in the wake of the Cuban revolution. A large number of Americans who had invested in those companies lost their investments without compensation when the Cuban government assumed control. However, despite the loss suffered by United States nationals, the Supreme Court upheld the Act of State Doctrine by assuming the validity of Cuba's domestic action and therefore rejected the claim of US nationals against Cuba for their lost investments.

The ''Sabbatino'' Court stated that although the Doctrine is not found in the [[Constitution]], explicitly or implicitly, it does have "constitutional underpinnings" in the concept of [[separation of powers]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] reasoned that because the Executive had exclusive authority to conduct foreign affairs with other nations on behalf of [[the United States]], disputes arising from the official actions of foreign sovereign powers should not be settled by the Judiciary because those decisions could interfere with the Executive's conduct of foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino'', 376 U.S. 398 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Hickenlooper Amendment==
In response to the outcome of the case, Congress enacted {{UnitedStatesCode|22|2370}}, more commonly referred to as the "Second Hickenlooper Amendment", named after the bill's sponsor, [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]], an [[Iowa]] Senator. Generally, under the Hickenlooper Amendment, courts are not to apply the Act of State Doctrine as a bar against hearing cases of expropriation by a foreign sovereign. There is an exception if the Executive requests that the courts consider the Act of State Doctrine because foreign policy interests may be damaged by judicial interference:
:"this subparagraph shall not be applicable . . . (2) in any case with respect to which the President determines that application of the act of state doctrine is required in that particular case by the foreign policy interests of the United States and a suggestion to this effect is filed on his behalf in that case with the court." &lt;ref&gt;22 U.S.C. 2370(e)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==English law==
The foreign act of state doctrine applies in English law.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom Supreme Court, [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2017/3.html Belhaj and another (Respondents) v Straw and others (Appellants); Rahmatullah (No 1) (Respondent) v Ministry of Defence and another (Appellants)] 17 January 2017, accessed 26 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the English [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]] ruled that it also applies in English [[arbitration]].&lt;ref name=DLA /&gt;

{{Distinguish|Ademption by satisfaction}}

'''Ademption''', or '''ademption by extinction''', is a [[common law]] doctrine used in the [[law]] of [[will (law)|wills]] to determine what happens when property bequeathed under a will is no longer in the [[testator]]'s [[estate (law)|estate]] at the time of the testator's death.&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Roger| last1=Andersen| first2=Ira Mark| last2=Bloom|title=Fundamentals of Trusts and Estates | edition=4th |publisher=LexisNexis| year=2012| isbn=978-0-7698-4728-3 |pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a devise (bequest) of a specific item of property (a [[specific gift]]), such property is considered ''adeemed'', and the gift fails. For example, if a will bequeathed the testator's car to a specific beneficiary, but the testator owned no car at the time of his or her death, the gift would be ''adeemed'' and the aforementioned beneficiary would receive no gift at all.

General bequests or '''general gifts''' - gifts of cash amounts - are never adeemed. If the cash in the testator's estate is not sufficient to satisfy the gift, then other assets in the [[residuary estate]] will need to be sold to raise the necessary cash.

Some property lies in a "gray" area, in which the testator's specific intent must be determined. For example, where the testator bequeathes "500 shares of stock" in a company, this may be read as a general bequest (that the estate should purchase and convey the particular stocks to the beneficiary), or it may be read as a specific bequest, particularly if the testator used a possessive ("''my'' 500 shares").  Such a gift is deemed to be a [[demonstrative gift]].  Such demonstrative gifts are deemed to be a hybrid of both specific and general gifts.  If one were to bequeath "500 shares of stock," most states would deem that to be a demonstrative gift.  The resultant gift to the heir receiving "500 shares," would be the date of death value of 500 shares of that particular stock.

Ademption may be waived if the property leaves the estate after the testator has been declared incompetent. Furthermore, in some cases the beneficiary will be entitled to the proceeds from the sale of property, or to the [[insurance]] payout for property that is lost or destroyed.

To avoid confusion as to what may or may not be adeemed, sometimes the phrase "if owned by me at my death" is placed into the articles of a will in which property is being bequeathed.

As for the sale of land under an [[executory contract]], traditional [[case law]] agrees that ademption occurs upon the death of the testator and that the proceeds of sale, when the closing occurs, should not pass to the specific devisee of the property.  However, the more modern view and the [[Uniform Probate Code]], which has been adopted by some states, disagrees.  These jurisdictions find that when property subject to specific devise is placed under contract of sale before the decedent's death, the proceeds of the sale will pass to the specific devisee.

==Statutory variations==
Many US jurisdictions have ameliorated the effects of the common law doctrine by statute.

In [[Wisconsin]], state law (854.08) attempts to abolish the common law doctrine of ademption by extinction, by, for example, awarding beneficiaries the balance of the purchase price of the item sold (subject to some limitations).

In [[Virginia]], ademption occurs with respect to most forms of property, but if the property at issue is [[stock certificate]]s, then the buyout of the issuer of the stock by another company, and the swapping of the stocks for a new issue by that company, will not adeem the gift of stock. Similarly, if the shares of stock that existed at the time the gift was made have split (for example, where the holder of 500 shares receives a reissue of 1,000 shares each having half the value of the original), then the beneficiary of that gift will be entitled to the number of shares that exist ''after'' the split.

'''Bowen v Paramount Builders (Hamilton) Ltd''' [1977] 1 NZLR 394 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability in tort defective products.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is infamous among New Zealand law students for being one of the hardest and longest cases they have to study in their first year, though this has drawn sharp mockery from third year law students around the country.

==Background==
Due to a shortage of land to build on around [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], developers were now subdividing land that had previously been deemed unsuitable for building on. This included the subdivision on [[peat]] that Paramount Builders were building a house on a section purchased by the MacKays.

The Mackay's had purchased the section from the developer on the condition that they lay a sand base for the building foundations.

The MacKay's then arranged Paramount to build a house on top of this foundation. During construction though, the local building inspector recognized that a sand base would not be strong enough and ordered Paramount to cease construction.

Paramount then redesigned a new concrete foundation, and restarted [[construction]].

As construction was near completion, the MacKay's complained to the builders that there was a sag in the building, but they were told it was just an "optical illusion".

The Mackay's however did not believe this, and on sold the house to the hapless Bowen's as soon as they could.

The Bowen's eventually discovered their house had subsided due to inadequate foundations.

They sued the builders for negligence.

==Held==
The court awarded the buyers of the house damages.

'''Cary Sherman''' is Chairman and CEO of the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], an organization representing the nation’s major music labels. The trade group’s member companies are responsible for creating, manufacturing, or distributing approximately 85 percent of all legitimate{{dubious|date=March 2018}} sound recordings sold in the United States.

==Education==
Sherman graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1968, and [[Harvard Law School]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="riaabio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/aboutus.php?content_selector=about_us_exec_bios|title=RIAA 'Executive Bios'|work=|format=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012002611/http://riaa.com/aboutus.php?content_selector=about_us_exec_bios|archivedate=October 12, 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RIAA==
Sherman was hired as general counsel for RIAA in 1997. Throughout his tenure, Sherman has helped guide the industry’s efforts to facilitate new ways for fans to access music and to ensure that music creators are properly compensated as [[streaming media]] became the dominant format of the business.  He was instrumental in the enactment of the [[Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act]] in 1995, which along with his work on the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in 1998, established a new right for artists and labels to be compensated by digital music services. That right has since become the core legal foundation obligating streaming services to pay royalties for their subscription services – services that have become the [https://www.riaa.com/reports/news-notes-2016-riaa-shipment-revenue-statistics/ primary catalyst for growth in the business]. His work involved coordination and regulation of the industry's business, policy and legal objectives while his obligations remain primarily in technology, government affair issues, licensing and enforcement of rules and regulations.  In 2010, Sherman helped the RIAA secure a $105 million settlement from [[LimeWire]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hau|first=Louis|title=Billboard Power 100: Cary Sherman|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/features/billboard-power-100-cary-sherman-1006007162.story|publisher=Billboard.biz|date=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman replaced [[Mitch Bainwol]] as CEO in August 2011.&lt;ref name="nyt8811"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/sherman-takes-over-at-recording-industry-group/|title=Sherman Takes Over at Recording Industry Group|last=Sisario|first=Ben|date=August 8, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Jennifer|last2=Boliek|first2=Brooks|title=RIAA names Cary Sherman its CEO|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60901.html|accessdate=February 9, 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman is a strong advocate of [[Stop Online Piracy Act|SOPA]] and [[PROTECT IP Act|PIPA]].

'''''Case of Prohibitions''''' [1607] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1607/J23.html EWHC J23 (KB)]  is a historical [[English court]] decision by [[Sir Edward Coke]]. Before the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, when the [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|sovereignty of Parliament]] was confirmed, this case wrested supremacy from the King in favour of the courts.

==Facts==
King [[James I of England|James I]] placed himself in the position of judge for a dispute, a "controversy of land between parties was heard by the King, and sentence given".

==Judgments==
When the case went before [[Edward Coke]], the Chief Justice of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], he overturned the decision of the King, and held that cases may be tried only by those with legal training and subject to the [[rule of law]]. Coke stated that common law cases were "not to be decided by natural reason but by artificial reason and judgment of law, which law is an art which requires long study and experience":&lt;ref&gt;Cook, C. (2001). Laying down the law. Sydney: [[LexisNexis Butterworths]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}

{{quote|A controversy of land between parties was heard by the King, and sentence given, which was repealed for this, that it did not belong to the common law: then the King said, that he thought the law was founded upon [[reason]], and that he and others had reason, as well as the Judges: to which it was answered by me, that true it was, that [[God]] had endowed His Majesty with excellent [[science]], and great endowments of nature; but His Majesty was not learned in the [[laws]] of his realm of England, and causes which concern the life, or inheritance, or goods, or fortunes of his subjects, are not to be decided by natural reason but by the artificial reason and judgment of law, which law is an act which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it: that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that [[Bracton]] saith, ''quod Rex non debed esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege'' [That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.].}}

In another report, Coke is quoted as saying all causes were "to be measured by the golden and straight met-wand of the law, and not to the incertain and crooked cord of discretion".&lt;ref&gt;4 Institutes 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cave of Dogs''' (in Italian ''Grotta del Cane'', literally "Cave of the Dog") is a small [[cave]] on the eastern side of the [[Phlegraean Fields]] near [[Pozzuoli]],  [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grotta del Cane: Italy|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-175146&amp;fid=3091&amp;c=italy|website=Geographical Names|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the cave is a [[fumarole]] that releases [[carbon dioxide]] of [[volcanic]] origin.  It was a famous, if gruesome, [[tourist attraction]] for travellers on the [[Grand Tour]].  The [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas, being denser than air, tends to accumulate in the deeper parts of the cave.  Local guides, for a fee, would suspend small animals inside it—usually dogs—until they became unconscious.  Because humans inhaled air from a higher level they were not affected.  The dogs might be revived by submerging them in the cold waters of the nearby [[Lake Agnano]].  Famous tourists who came to see this attraction included [[Goethe]], [[Alexandre Dumas]] père, and [[Mark Twain]]. The lake became polluted and it was drained in 1870; the spectacle fell into disuse and the cave was closed.  However the area is now being restored by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Alfred Swaine, An Account of the Grotta del Cane; With Remarks Upon Suffocation by Carbonic Acid, The London Medical and Physical Journal, 1832, 278-285.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eegEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=An+account+of+the+Grotta+del+Cane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uHmS5DBVLg&amp;sig=xizJ0VWyEyWaAedKYknv1pxUI0c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1zMNVeeKIsvcapCcgoAC&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20account%20of%20the%20Grotta%20del%20Cane&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming &amp; Johnson, Toxic Airs: Body, Place, Planet in Historical Perspective,  Pittsburgh, 255-256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroonenberg, Why Hell Stinks of Sulfur: Mythology and Geology of the Underworld, Chicago, 2013, 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Matthews, Naples: Life, Death &amp; Miracles: Agnano &amp; the Grotto of the Dog.

I drove by the baths hundreds of times over the years and never knew about the lake, never knew that I was 100 yards from the Grotto of the Dog ...".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grotta del Cane

[[File:From Taylor, 1832.png|thumb|'''The principle of the Cave of Dogs''' sketched by [[Alfred Swaine Taylor]], 1832]]
The cave was often described in nineteenth century science textbooks to illustrate the [[density]] and toxicity of carbon dioxide,&lt;ref&gt;The above image is from L'air et le monde aèrien, an 1865 textbook by Arthur Mangin, p.162 [https://archive.org/details/lairetlemondear00manggoog]&lt;/ref&gt; and its reputation has given rise to a popular [[scientific demonstration]] of the same name.  Stepped candles are successively extinguished by tipping carbon dioxide into a transparent container.

The cave was recently investigated by Italian [[speleologists]] including Rosario Varriale who interpreted it as a man-made cavity constructed in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], possibly as a [[sudatorium]]. The carbon dioxide level was measured at 9.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Napoli Underground, Grotta del Cane Nuove Ricerche.

Smith, a concentration of 5-10% produces in humans “Violent panting and fatigue to the point of exhaustion merely from respiration &amp; severe headache. Prolonged exposure at 5% could result in irreversible effects to health. Prolonged exposure at &gt; 6% could result in unconsciousness and death.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Garry K|title=Naked Flame Tests for, and Human Tolerance to, Foul Air in Caves|journal=Helicitite.

Located on a former [[quarry]] site, the [[Urban planning|urban]]-style village is organized around a {{convert|19|acre|ha|adj=mid}} community park that cascades down the terraced property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sand and gravel quarry becoming a sustainable, urban village|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/14/sand-and-gravel-quarry-becoming-a-sustainable/|publisher=U-T San Diego|access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civita development plans call for 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;acres of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 [[Affordable housing|affordable]] units), an approximately 480,000-square-foot [[Lifestyle center (retail)|retail center]], and 420,000&amp;nbsp;square feet for an office/business campus.&lt;ref name = urbanland&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirk|first=Patricia|title=Civita: San Diego’s New City within the City|url=http://urbanland.uli.org/planning-design/civita-san-diego-s-new-city-within-the-city/|publisher=Urban Land Magazine|access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = leung&gt;{{cite web|last=Leung|first=Lily|title=Mission Valley's 230-acre Civita to debut|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/dec/07/an-open-house-at-civita/|publisher=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civita project is budgeted at $2&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt; and being developed by Sudberry Properties, in partnership with the Grant family, which has operated the former quarry since 1937.&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt;

== Location ==

Civita is located just north of Friars Road between [[California State Route 163|SR 163]] and [[I-805 (CA)|I-805]] in San Diego’s Mission Valley,&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt; which was the site of the first Spanish settlement in California, established in 1769. Mission Valley is named for [[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]], the first [[Spanish missions in California|California Mission]].

Civita is located about seven miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from downtown [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and [[San Diego International Airport]].&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt;

=== Geography ===

The Civita property is located in a former quarry north of the [[San Diego River]]. The property slopes down toward the river. The Civita plan calls for development on a series of terraces. Each terrace contains housing and a level footpath leading to a central park.&lt;ref name = nytimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Morris|title=Terraced Living in a San Diego Quarry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/realestate/commercial/in-san-diego-terraced-living-in-an-old-quarry.html|publisher=New York Times |date=February 28, 2012 |access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;-

== History ==

During the first half of the twentieth century, Mission Valley was a largely undeveloped expanse of dairy farms and agricultural operations. In the early 1900s, Franklin and Alta Grant purchased land along the San Diego River, hoping to find oil. Instead, they discovered rock and the family mined the quarry for about 70&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt; The Grants' grandchildren decided to turn the family property into a walkable village. They partnered with Sudberry Properties, a longtime San Diego developer.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

After nine years of planning, a plan to develop the Quarry Falls community (now called Civita) was approved by the [[San Diego City Council]] by a vote of 7-1. More than 130 people attended the meeting.&lt;ref name = jvigil&gt;{{cite web|last=Vigil|first=Jennifer|title=Quarry Falls development gets City Council's backing|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/20081022-9999-1m22quarry.html|publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters, including representatives from environmental and smart-growth groups, outnumbered opponents 4-to-1.&lt;ref name = jvigil/&gt;

In 2010, the [[Real estate development|developers]] broke ground on Civita&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Showley|first=Roger|title=2010 a year of big plans for homes, hospitals and public buildings|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/Dec/29/2010-year-big-plans-homes-hospitals-and-public-bui/|publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune|access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first homes were occupied in 2011.&lt;ref name = leung/&gt;

== Land planning ==

The 230-acre Civita project is one of the largest examples of “urban [[infill]],” which is the development of vacant or underused city sites, in the U.S.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

Civita development plans call for 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;acres of parks and open space, 4,780 residences (including approximately 478 affordable units), an approximately 480,000-square-foot retail center, and 420,000&amp;nbsp;square feet for an office/business campus.&lt;ref name = leung/&gt;&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

The $2&amp;nbsp;billion project embraces San Diego’s “City of Villages” concept – compact, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods that are located within walking distance of [[public transit]] and other needs.&lt;ref name = leung/&gt;

The Civita master plan was designed by local architect and planner Gordon Carrier, a principal at Carrier Johnson + Culture. Carrier’s plan will ultimately create a high-density urban village organized around a network of parks and open space, with housing, retail, office, and civic components linked by pedestrian trails, walkable streets, and bike paths.&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt;

Carrier commented that the goal of the Civita design is to create a “real” neighborhood that “combines topography, walkability and the ability to live, work and play in the same place…[T]he design makes it convenient for residents to walk or ride bicycles rather than use cars, by locating shopping, parks and recreation facilities within walking distance of their homes.”&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

“Civita serves as a perfect model for the future growth of the region,” said Brian Schoenfisch, a senior planner for the city of San Diego.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

== Sustainability ==

=== Green building practices ===

Sudberry Properties, the developer of Civita, incorporated numerous [[green building]] practices in the Civita design. For example, more street trees have been planted than were required by the city of San Diego. Sudberry also specified low-energy LED lights for traffic signals and street lighting.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

Sudberry’s Civita master plan also encourages people to walk by rearranging the sloping site in a series of terraces, each containing housing and level footpaths to and from the central park and stream, which are expected to experience heavy use.&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;

In 2012, Sudberry Properties entered into an agreement with [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]] to create a “Smart Energy Community” for Civita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SDG&amp;E And Sudberry Properties Work Together To Create Smart Grid Community|url=https://www.smartgrid.gov/recovery_act/news/sdge_and_sudberry_properties_work_together_create_smart_grid_community|publisher=SmartGrid.gov|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agreement specifies potential installation of new [[smart grid]] technologies that will make Civita more sustainable and energy efficient. The technologies include [[solar panels]], [[electric vehicle]] [[charging station]]s, [[fuel cell]] generation, battery storage, and enhanced energy management tools for residents. They are expected to help residents and businesses conserve electricity, preserve the environment, and establish Civita as a model for future [[Low-carbon economy|low-carbon]] communities.&lt;ref name = ut817&gt;{{cite web |title=Civita In Mission Valley Is Designed For Sustainability |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/aug/17/tp-civita-in-mission-valley-is-designed-for/ |publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homes and commercial buildings ===

Energy-conservation and sustainability are high priority goals for Civita’s home and commercial building designs.&lt;ref name = ut817/&gt; Homebuilders are required specify [[Energy Star]] appliances and exceed [[Title 24 (California code)|California’s Title 24]] energy requirements by 15 percent.&lt;ref name = ut817/&gt;

The first apartment neighborhood in Civita, Circa 37, exceeded the Title 24 requirements, achieving energy efficiency of almost 20 percent. For Circa 37, Sudberry Properties made extensive use of energy-efficient lighting, windows and [[HVAC]] systems, a 145&amp;nbsp;kW solar array that powers 80 percent of the common area electricity consumption, and “[[Reflective surfaces (geoengineering)|cool roofs]]” that minimize heat transfer.&lt;ref name = ut817/&gt;

Storm water runoff from residential areas in Civita and parts of [[Serra Mesa, San Diego|Serra Mesa]] are primarily directed to a unique [[bioswale]] system in Civita’s central park. The bioswale, which has the appearance of a natural streambed, will remove silt and pollution from the runoff through natural [[biofiltration]] and reestablish plant and animal habitats.&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt;&lt;ref name = ut817/&gt;

=== Ride sharing ===

In 2013, Civita launched a [[Carpool|ride-sharing]] program that featured a fleet of [[Electric car|smart electric drive vehicles]] through [[Car2Go|car2go]]. Currently, six public electric car [[charging station]]s are onsite, and more are scheduled to come online as development progresses.&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt;

=== Awards ===

In 2009, Civita achieved a Stage 1 Gold rating for the U.S. [[Green Building Council|Green Building Council’s]] 2009 LEED-ND (Neighborhood Development) pilot and received the California Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award.&lt;ref name = urbanland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCandless|first=Catherine|title=No Longer Just A Hole In The Ground|url=http://www.mit.edu/people/spirn/Public/Ulises-11-308/Quarrying.pdf|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Civita was designated as a California Catalyst Community by the [[California Department of Housing and Community Development]] to support innovation and test sustainable strategies that reflect the interdependence of environmental, economic, and community health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalyst Projects for California Sustainable Communities|url=http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/catayst_summaries082510.pdf|publisher=California Department of Housing and Community Development|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civita Park ==

In 2013, following hundreds of public meetings and 10&amp;nbsp;years of planning, the San Diego Parks and Recreation Board approved the design of Civita’s central park, Civita Park.&lt;ref name = jvigil/&gt; Construction of the park began in 2014 and was completed in 2015.&lt;ref name = ut215&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansions At Civita To Enhance Community|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/feb/15/tp-expansions-at-civita-to-enhance-community/|publisher=San Diego Union-Tribune|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civita Park will slope down the former quarry property in a series of mesas that provide residents with well-defined areas to exercise, relax, gather, and play. The park will be connected by finger trails to adjoining neighborhoods. Vista points will offer visitors panoramic views of the community and the San Diego River valley.&lt;ref name = ut215/&gt;

The initial construction phases will include a dog park, outdoor amphitheater, interactive water feature, community garden, exercise nodes, jogging path, two basketball half-courts, restrooms and parking lot.&lt;ref name = ut215/&gt; Hazard Construction Co. began work on Phases I and IV on Aug. 18, 2015. This part of the project is expected to take 12 to 14 months to complete and another couple of additional months will be needed so the landscaping can mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://missionvalleynews.com/work-on-civita-park-gets-underway/ |title=Work on Civita Park gets underway |work=Mission Valley News |first=Ken |last=Williams |date=September 11, 2015 |access-date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Commission v Italy''''' (2003) [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62000CJ0014&amp;lang1=en&amp;type=TXT&amp;ancre= C-14/00] is an [[EU law]] case, concerning the [[free movement of goods]] in the European Union.

==Facts==
An Italian rule limited name ‘[[chocolate]]’ to products without vegetable fats. Those with vegetable fats, mainly British, Irish, and Danish chocolate, were made to label themselves ‘chocolate substitutes’. The Commission argued this breached Directive 73/241, passed under what is now article 115 [[TFEU]], where article 1 said cocoa and chocolate products mean those in Annex 1, within minimum cocoa content to be described as chocolate. It also argued it infringed TFEU article 34, as the word ‘substitute’ devalued the good. Italy, under point 7(a) of the Annex said the free movement clause only applied to products without vegetable fats.

==Judgment==
The [[ECJ|Court of Justice]] held that the requirement was contrary to article 34. Under the Directive, the UK, Ireland, Denmark could authorised manufacturers to add vegetable fats to chocolate made there, but it could not benefit from the free movement clause. [[TFEU]] article 34 applied to obstacles to marketing products. The Italian rule would make British producers adjust their products and incur additional packaging costs. The Italian law had to be justified by a mandatory requirement, and steps must be proportionate. On the facts, the addition of vegetable fat did not substantially modify the product. So a ‘neutral and objective statement’ informing consumers would be enough. Obliging a change of the sale name was going further than necessary to protect consumers.

{{Cquote|82 It is therefore important to ascertain whether the addition to cocoa and chocolate products of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter substantially alters their composition, so that they no longer present the characteristics expected by consumers buying products bearing the name chocolate and that a label providing appropriate information as to their composition cannot be considered sufficient to avoid confusion in the minds of consumers.

83 The characteristic element of cocoa and chocolate products within the meaning of Directive 73/241 is the presence of a certain minimum cocoa and cocoa butter content.

84 In particular, it should be recalled that, in accordance with point 1.16 of Annex I to Directive 73/241, products meeting the definition of chocolate within the meaning of the directive must contain a minimum total dry cocoa solids content of 35%, with at least 14% of dry non-fat cocoa solids and 18% of cocoa butter.

85 The percentages set by Directive 73/241 are minimum contents which must be complied with by all chocolate products manufactured and marketed under the name chocolate in the Community, independently of whether the legislation of the Member State of production authorises the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter.

86 In addition, it must be pointed out that, since Directive 73/241 explicitly permits Member States to authorise the use, in the manufacture of cocoa and chocolate products, of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter, it cannot be claimed that the products to which those fats have been added, in compliance with that directive, are altered to the point where they no longer fall into the same category as those which do not contain such fats.

87 Therefore, the addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter to cocoa and chocolate products which satisfy the minimum contents required by Directive 73/241 cannot substantially alter the nature of those products to the point where they are transformed into different products.

88 It follows that the inclusion in the label of a neutral and objective statement informing consumers of the presence in the product of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter would be sufficient to ensure that consumers are given correct information.

89 In those circumstances, the obligation to change the sales name of those products which is imposed by the Italian legislation does not appear to be necessary to satisfy the overriding requirement of consumer protection.}}

'''Community standards''' are local [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s bounding acceptable [[Behavior|conduct]], possibly going beyond legal minimum requirements in relation to either limits on acceptable conduct itself or the manner in which the community will enforce acceptable conduct. Sometimes these standards can be itemized in a list that states the community's values and sets guidelines for participation in the community. Alternatively, informal standards may be imprecisely described as "I'll know it when I see it."

Often, such standards are invoked in [[law|legal]] situations to resolve disputes, especially around [[pornography]]. Critics argue that puritanical [[morality|moralists]] have used community standards to wrongly punish minorities such as [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] or those in [[interracial marriage]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=Who?  Extremely vague.  POV.|date=June 2018}}
&lt;!-- what are some legal precedents in various countries --&gt;

Some [[social media]] companies operate community standards providing rules or guidance on what it is and what it is not acceptable to post online. On 25 April 2017 the UK House of Commons [[Home Affairs Committee]] stated:
:We welcome the fact that [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] &lt;ref&gt;Facebook (2017), [https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/ Community Standards]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Twitter]] all have clear community standards that go beyond the requirements of the law. We strongly welcome the commitment that all three social media companies have to removing [[hate speech]] or graphically violent content, and their acceptance of their social responsibility towards their users and towards wider communities."&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, [https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/609/609.pdf Hate crime: abuse, hate and extremism online], published 1 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Colleges and universities enforce their standards through conduct offices in their [[Student Affairs]] divisions.&lt;ref&gt;E.g.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12817">{{for|the role of administrative assistant|Secretary}}
A '''company secretary''' is a senior position in a private sector [[company]] or public sector organisation.  In large American and Canadian publicly-listed corporations, a company secretary is typically named a '''corporate secretary''' or '''secretary'''.  The company secretary is responsible for the efficient administration of a company, particularly with regard to ensuring compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements and for ensuring that decisions of the board of directors are implemented.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://www.companysecretary.com.au/articles/WhatIsCS.pdf What is a Company Secretary?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, the role is not clerical or [[secretary|secretarial]]. The company secretary ensures that an organisation complies with relevant legislation and regulation, and keeps board members informed of their legal responsibilities. Company Secretaries are the company’s named representative on legal documents, and it is their responsibility to ensure that the company and its directors operate within the law. It is also their responsibility to register and communicate with [[shareholder]]s, to ensure that [[dividend]]s are paid and to maintain company records, such as lists of [[director (company)|director]]s and shareholders, and annual accounts.

In many countries, private companies have traditionally been required by law to appoint one person as a company secretary, and this person will also usually be a senior board member.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Roles and responsibilities==
Company secretaries in all sectors have high level responsibilities including governance structures and mechanisms, corporate conduct within an organisation's regulatory environment, board, shareholder and trustee meetings, compliance with legal, regulatory and listing requirements, the training and induction of non-executives and trustees, contact with regulatory and external bodies, reports and circulars to shareholders/trustees, management of employee benefits such as [[pension]]s and [[employee stock options|employee share schemes]], insurance administration and organisation, the negotiation of contracts, [[risk management]], property administration and organisation and the interpretation of financial accounts.

Company secretaries are the primary source of advice on the conduct of business and this can span everything from legal advice on conflicts of interest, through accounting advice on financial reports, to the development of strategy and corporate planning.

Among public companies in North America, providing advice on corporate governance issues is an increasingly important role for  [[corporate secretary]]. Many shareholders, particularly institutional investors, view sound corporate governance as essential to board and company performance. They are quite vocal in encouraging boards to perform frequent corporate governance reviews and to issue written statements of corporate governance principles.  The corporate secretary is usually the executive to assist directors in these efforts, providing information on the practices of other companies, and helping the board to tailor corporate governance principles and practices to fit the board's needs and expectations of investors.  In some companies, the role of the corporate secretary as corporate governance adviser has been formalised, with a title such as Chief Governance Officer added to their existing title.&lt;ref name=duties&gt;[http://www.governanceprofessionals.org/society/The_Corporate_Secretary_-_Duties_and_Responsibilit.asp?SnID=83705163 The Corporate Secretary - Duties and Responsibilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the important roles the company secretary plays in business, [[public limited company|PLC]]s and large companies require the company secretary to be suitably trained, experienced and professionally qualified for these responsibilities.

In the UK, the company secretary may be qualified by virtue of examination and membership of the [[Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators]] (ICSA), which is the main qualification specifically for company secretaries. ICSA is the body dedicated to the advancement and recognition of professional administration based on a combination of degree-level studies, carefully vetted experience and sponsorship by two people of professional status. Only a person thus qualified is entitled to be designated a 'Chartered Secretary' or 'Chartered Company Secretary'. The Faculty of Secretaries and Administrators founded in 1930 is the second body of corporate secretaries in the United Kingdom and now has a strong emphasis on equality work and governance and its members are designated 'corporate secretaries' or 'certified public secretaries'. It is expected that company secretaries of publicly quoted companies will be professionally qualified through ICSA, one of the chartered professional bodies in the accountancy profession, or have appropriate training and experience through another body.

In India, the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) regulates the profession of company secretaries . ICSI is a statutory professional body which has more than 50,000 associate members.

Chartered Secretaries are employed as chairs, chief executives and non-executive directors, as well as executives and company secretaries.  Some chartered secretaries are also known in their own companies as corporate secretarial executives/managers or corporate secretarial directors.

Chartered Secretaries are the sixth highest paid employees in the UK according to the Office for National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (March 2010).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Many corporate secretaries of North American public companies are lawyers and some serve as their corporation's [[general counsel]]. While this can be helpful in the execution of their duties it can also create ambiguity as to what is legal advice, protected by privilege, and what is business advice.&lt;ref name=duties/&gt;
http://www.icsi.edu

===United Kingdom===
Since 8 April 2008 there has been no legal requirement for a private company in the UK to have a company secretary unless the company's [[articles of association]] state otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;section 270 Companies Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt; If a private company doesn't have a company secretary then the company secretarial duties and responsibilities fall upon the directors of the company. With the increase in the number of social enterprises and community interest companies there is often a demand for a company secretary in the voluntary and community sectors as well as ordinary private trading companies. A public company in the UK must still have a formally appointed company secretary.&lt;ref&gt;section 271 Companies Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact responsibilities of the company secretary depend on the size and nature of the company and there is no statutory definition of what these are, but it generally includes some or all of the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elementalcosec.com/guides/roles-and-responsibilities-of-a-company-secretary/ Roles and Responsibilities of a company secretary]&lt;/ref&gt;

::* maintaining the company's statutory registers;
::* updating the records held by [[Companies House]];
::* maintaining the company's [[registered office]];
;;* advising the board of directors on their legal and corporate responsibilities and matters of [[corporate governance]];
::* organising the company’s board meetings and [[annual general meeting]];
::* minuting board meetings;
::* ensuring company compliance with legal obligations;  
::* managing and storing the company's records, e.g. re investments, property, payroll, insurance, accounting, taxation ([[VAT]], [[PAYE]], [[Corporation Tax]]); and
::* liaison between the company and its [[Stakeholder_(corporate)|stakeholders]] and [[shareholders]]

===India===
{{Cleanup|section|reason=Poor grammar and coherence. Also, needs references.|date=October 2018}}
In India, every listed company and other class of companies (i.e. non-listed public companies with share capital of 50 million (5 Crore) &amp; private Companies with share capital of 50 million [5 crore]) are required to have a Qualified Company Secretary be appointed as Key Managerial Personnel to perform the Functions of Company Secretary under section 203 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 8 of Companies (Appointment and Remuneration of Key Managerial Personnel) Rules, 2014.But later it is clarified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs company secretary would be appointed as earlier i.e. a company having  a paid up capital of 5 crore or more should appoint a whole time basis in its notification.

=== China ===
In China, every listed company is required to have a board secretary. According to article 124 of 2005 Company Law, every listed company is required to have a secretary to the board of directors. The responsibilities of board secretary include preparing meetings of shareholders and boards of directors, maintaining company records and shareholders information, dealing with information disclosure etc. Relevant listing rules in China further clarify that the secretary of the Board is a managerial position. Such listing rules discuss duties of board secretary in details. According to “''Special Provisions of the State Council Concerning the Flotation and Listing Abroad of Stocks by Limited Stock Companies''”, “''Guidance for the Articles of Listed Company”, “Stock Listing Rules of the Shanghai Stock Exchange” and “Stock Listing Rules of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange”,'' the secretary of the Board is classified as the senior management team. From those listing rules, the board secretary, or the secretary of the board of directors, in China is comparable as the company secretary in many other countries.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, all public and [[State-owned enterprise|state-owned company]] must appoint a company secretary. The roles and responsibilities of the company secretary are defined in the ''Companies Act, No 71 of 2008''. For publicly listed companies, these roles were clarified and expanded by the [[King Report on Corporate Governance|King IV report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Moore Stephens South Africa|title=The role of the Company Secretary|url=https://southafrica.moorestephens.com/services/business-outsorcing/company-formation-secretarial/the-role-of-the-company-secretary|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, non-profit companies that have voluntarily adopted the "Enhanced Accountability and Transparency" provisions of the Companies Act must appoint a company secretary whose role is comparable to that of a public company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naidoo|first=Melanie|title=SOUTH AFRICA’S NEW COMPANIES ACT : Key features for non-profit companies|url=http://www.gaaaccounting.com/south-africas-new-companies-act-key-features-for-non-profit-companies/|journal=GAA Accounting|access-date=29 August 2017|date=21 June 2012|publisher=South African Institute of Chartered Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, the ''Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007'' requires that each registered company has a company secretary. A company secretary is required to be registered with the Department of Registrar of Companies, to function as a company secretary. Eligibility to function as a secretary are;

*Sri Lankan citizen
*An [[Attorney at law]], a [[Chartered Accountant]] or any person demanded have followed a program of study by the Subject Minister. 
*Applicants with over 20 years experience in the company secretaries field may be appointed after an interview with the Registrar of Companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9764">{{short description|A portion of a continent that is submerged under an area of relatively shallow water known as a shelf sea}}
{{ocean habitat topics|image=Southeastern United States continental shelf.jpg|caption=Anatomy of a continental shelf of the south eastern coast of the United States}}

A '''continental shelf''' is a portion of a [[continent]] that is submerged under an area of relatively shallow water known as a '''shelf sea'''. Much of the shelves were exposed during [[glacial period]]s and [[Ice age|interglacial periods]].

The shelf surrounding an [[island]] is known as an '''insular shelf'''.
	
The [[continental margin]], between the continental shelf and the [[abyssal plain]], comprises a steep continental slope followed by the flatter continental rise. [[Sediment]] from the continent above cascades down the slope and accumulates as a pile of sediment at the base of the slope, called the continental rise. Extending as far as 500&amp;nbsp;km (310&amp;nbsp;mi) from the slope, it consists of thick sediments deposited by [[turbidity current]]s from the shelf and slope.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 39, Gross 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The continental rise's [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] is intermediate between the slope and the shelf. 

Under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], the name continental shelf was given a legal definition as the stretch of the [[seabed]] adjacent to the shores of a particular country to which it belongs.

==Geographical distribution==
[[File:Elevation.jpg|thumb|left|350px|{{legend|#03FCDE|The global continental shelf, highlighted in cyan}}]]

Width of the continental shelf varies considerably – it is not uncommon for an area to have virtually no shelf at all, particularly where the forward edge of an advancing [[oceanic crust|oceanic plate]] dives beneath [[continental crust]] in an offshore [[subduction zone]] such as off the coast of [[Chile]] or the west coast of [[Sumatra]]. The largest shelf – the [[Siberian Shelf]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] – stretches to {{convert|1500|km|mi|sp=us}} in width. The [[South China Sea]] lies over another extensive area of continental shelf, the [[Sunda Shelf]], which joins [[Borneo]], Sumatra, and [[Java (island)|Java]] to the Asian mainland. Other familiar bodies of water that overlie continental shelves are the [[North Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The average width of continental shelves is about {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The depth of the shelf also varies, but is generally limited to water shallower than {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The slope of the shelf is usually quite low, on the order of 0.5°; vertical relief{{clarify |date=October 2018 |reason=Define this term (vertical relief). It is not widely known with precision and it is not precisely understood directly from context. The cited source is not on line and thus not easy to refer to.}} is also minimal, at less than {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the continental shelf is treated as a [[physiography|physiographic]] province of the [[ocean]], it is not part of the deep ocean basin proper, but the flooded margins of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Passive continental margin]]s such as most of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coasts have wide and shallow shelves, made of thick sedimentary wedges derived from long erosion of a neighboring continent.  [[Active continental margin]]s have narrow, relatively steep shelves, due to frequent [[earthquake]]s that move sediment to the deep sea.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topography==
[[File:Continental shelf.png|350px|thumb]] 	
The shelf usually ends at a point of increasing slope&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/539632/shelf-break|title=shelf break – geology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the ''shelf break''). The sea floor below the break is the ''continental slope''. Below the slope is the ''continental rise'', which finally merges into the deep ocean floor, the [[abyssal plain]]. The continental shelf and the slope are part of the [[continental margin]].
	
The shelf area is commonly subdivided into the ''inner continental shelf'', ''mid continental shelf'', and ''outer continental shelf'', each with their specific [[geomorphology]] and [[marine biology]].
	
The character of the shelf changes dramatically at the shelf break, where the continental slope begins. With a few exceptions, the shelf break is located at a remarkably uniform depth of roughly {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=on}}; this is likely a hallmark of past ice ages, when sea level was lower than it is now.&lt;ref&gt;Gross 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The continental slope is much steeper than the shelf; the average angle is 3°, but it can be as low as 1° or as high as 10°.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 36, Gross 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The slope is often cut with [[submarine canyon]]s. The physical mechanisms involved in forming these canyons were not well understood until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 98, Gross 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sediments==
The continental shelves are covered by [[terrigenous]] sediments; that is, those derived from erosion of the continents. However, little of the sediment is from current [[river]]s; some 60–70% of the sediment on the world's shelves is ''relict sediment'', deposited during the last ice age, when sea level was 100–120 m lower than it is now.&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 84–86, Gross 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediments usually become increasingly fine with distance from the coast; sand is limited to shallow, wave-agitated waters, while silt and clays are deposited in quieter, deep water far offshore.&lt;ref&gt;Gross 121-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  These accumulate 15–40&amp;nbsp;cm every millennium, much faster than deep-sea [[pelagic sediments]].&lt;ref&gt;Gross 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biota==
Continental shelves teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' [[abyssal plain]]. The [[pelagic]] (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the [[neritic zone]], and the [[benthic]] (sea floor) province of the shelf is the [[sublittoral zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinet 316-17, 418–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the shelves are usually fertile, if [[Anoxic event|anoxic]] conditions prevail during sedimentation, the deposits may over [[geologic time]] become [[Source rock|sources]] for [[fossil fuel]]s.

==Economic significance==
The relatively accessible continental shelf is the best understood part of the ocean floor. Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and [[hydrocarbon]] extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the [[Convention on the Continental Shelf]] drawn up by the UN's [[International Law Commission]] in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf
| title = ''Treaty Series'' – Convention on the Continental Shelf, 1958

| accessdate = 2016-01-13 | date = 1958-04-29| publisher = [[United Nations]]
}} vol. 499, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone, plus continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

The legal definition of a continental shelf differs significantly from the geological definition. UNCLOS states that the shelf extends to the limit of the [[continental margin]], but no less than 200 nautical miles and no more than 350 nm from the [[baseline (sea)|baseline]]. Thus inhabited volcanic islands such as the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], which have no actual continental shelf, nonetheless have a legal continental shelf, whereas uninhabitable islands have no shelf.

In [[parliamentary procedure]], a '''division of the assembly''', '''division of the house''', or simply '''division''' is a[[Voting methods (parliamentary)| method]] for taking a better estimate of a vote than a [[voice vote]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 280|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a division is taken when the result of a voice vote is challenged or when a [[two-thirds vote]] is required.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

A division is also called a ''rising vote'', where members stand up from their seats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised (RONR), the numbers for and against are not counted in a division.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they may be counted by order of the [[chairman]] or by order of the [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] through [[majority vote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly may also have a rule that the division is counted.

Historically, and often still today, members are literally divided into physically separate groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was the method used in the [[Roman Senate]], and occasionally in [[Athenian democracy]]. [[Westminster system]] parliament chambers have separate ''division lobbies'' for the "Ayes" and "Noes" to facilitate physical division. In several assemblies, a [[division bell]] is rung throughout the building when a division is happening, in order to alert members not present in the chamber.

== Australia ==

=== House of Representatives ===
In the [[Australian House of Representatives]] divisions follow a form similar to that of the United Kingdom, but the requirements are generally more stringent. For instance, a Member in the Chamber when the tellers are appointed must vote, while a Member not then present may not. Furthermore, members must vote in accordance to their voice votes.

The voice vote is held as in the British House of Commons. If a Member objects, then the division bells are rung throughout the Parliamentary estate. When not less than four minutes have elapsed since the question was first put, the Speaker orders that the doors to the Chamber be locked, and directs that the Ayes proceed to the right side of the Chamber, and that the Noes proceed to the left.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Infosheet 14 - Making decisions - debate and division|url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_14_-_Making_decisions_-_debate_and_division|website = www.aph.gov.au|access-date = 2016-02-19|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members then take seats on the appropriate side of the Chamber, rather than entering a lobby, and then the Speaker appoints tellers for each side, unless fewer than five Members are seated on one side, in which case the Speaker calls off the division and declares the result for the side with the greater number of Members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If the division is still on, the tellers count and record the names of the Members. The Speaker announces the result, but does not vote unless there is an equality of votes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Senate ===
In the [[Australian Senate]], a procedure similar to that of the House of Representatives is followed. The voice vote is taken, and, if ''two'' Senators object, a division is held. Senators take seats in the right or left of the Chamber as in the House, and the President of the Senate appoints one teller for each side to record the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter 18 - Divisions|url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/aso/so098|website = www.aph.gov.au|access-date = 2016-02-19|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President may vote by stating to the Senate the side on which he intends to vote. If the result of the division is an equality of votes, then the motion is in all cases disagreed to.

== Canada ==
The procedure used in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] is similar to that in the British House of Commons, with a few differences. The [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker]] reads the question aloud, and then asks, "Is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion?"  If anyone dissents, the Speaker then states "all those in favour of the motion will please say yea."  After the cries of 'yea', the Speaker says "all those opposed will please say nay," and all members opposed to the question cry out 'nay' all at once. The Speaker then announces his opinion of the outcome of the vote. If five or more MPs challenge the Speaker's opinion, a formal division follows.

A formal division is invoked by the Speaker asking to "call in the members." Bells are rung throughout the [[Parliament Hill|Parliament Buildings]] for either 15 or 30 minutes to allow all present MPs time to enter the chamber and take their seats.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Debate and Voting|url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/House/compendium/web-content/c_g_debatevoting-e.htm|website = www.parl.gc.ca|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division begins with the whips from both the government and the official opposition bowing to the Speaker and each other before returning to their seats.

There are no division lobbies in the House of Commons, so each member votes by simply standing up from his or her seat. "Yea" votes are recorded first, followed by the "Nay" votes, on the Speaker's order. Finally, the clerk of the house reads the result of the vote aloud to the Speaker.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Germany ==
[[File:Landtag-duesseldorf-07112014-10.JPG|thumb|Three doors marked “Yes”, “Abstention” and “No” in the [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia]]]]In the German [[Bundestag]] and some state parliaments the president can call for the so-called ''{{lang|de|Hammelsprung}}'' (literally, ''wether’s leap'') if an undisputed majority couldn't be established by either MPs raising their hands or standing in order to cast their votes.
In this voting procedure the MPs leave the plenary hall and re-enter through one of three doors designated for “yes“, “no”, or “abstention”.

According to the Duden dictionary, the expression refers to the MPs grouping themselves like sheep behind their respective [[bellwether]]s before re-entering the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Universalwörterbuch. 4th edition, Mannheim 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure was introduced in 1874 by a Reichstag vice president. In 1894 the architect of the new Reichstag building made a reference to the ''{{lang|de|Hammelsprung}}'': above the door for "yes", he depicted Ulysses and his friends escaping from [[Polyphemus]].

== Ireland ==
In [[Dáil Éireann]], the lower house of the [[Oireachtas]], a division is a formal count that can be called for if a voice vote is deemed insufficient. The procedure for divisions is specified by standing orders 70–77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webarchive.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/about/standingorders/consolidated-version-of-all-of-the-standing-orders-of-d%C3%A1il-%C3%89ireann,-9-may-2017.pdf#page=36 |title=Dáil Éireann Standing Orders Relative to Public Business together with Oireachtas Library and Research Service Rules |year=2016|publisher=Oireachtas|pages=36–39 |language=English |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ceann Comhairle]] (chair) puts the question and [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s (deputies) present say the Irish word ''Tá'' (yes) or ''Níl'' (no) respectively if they agree or disagree.&lt;ref&gt;SO 70(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ceann Comhairle then gives an opinion on the voice vote. Any TD may demand a division by calling ''Vótáil'' (vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/education/glossary/|title=Glossary|work=Education|publisher=Oireachtas|page=Division|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, in an effort to reduce delays, many divisions are deferred until a weekly division time on Thursdays when they are taken one after another.

When divisions are taken the division bell sounds around [[Leinster House]] and the adjoining Oireachtas buildings, calling TDs to the chamber to vote. The bells ring for between two and six minutes,&lt;ref&gt;SO 71&lt;/ref&gt; and the doors to the chamber are locked after a further four minutes. The Ceann Comhairle then appoints two tellers for each side and deputies present are given one minute to vote. Voting is usually electronic, with deputies pressing either the ''Tá'' or ''Níl'' button on their desks. After the voting time has concluded a Division Paper recording the result and each TD's vote is signed by the four tellers and given to the Ceann Comhairle, who declares the result. Electronic voting was introduced in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Electronic Voting in Dáil Chamber is part of Major Oireachtas Reform Programme|publisher=Oireachtas|date=26 February 2002|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=121|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional practice of voting by physically entering division lobbies is retained for some symbolically important votes: [[Confidence motions in Dáil Éireann |confidence motions]], and nomination of [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister) and [[Government of Ireland|cabinet ministers]].

A group of at least 20 TDs may demand a non-electronic repeat of an electronic vote. A summer 2016 upgrade to the electronic voting system allowed a change to standing orders such that TDs may have an abstention from voting formally recorded; for other purposes this is treated the same as not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/committees/sub-committeeondailreform/Report-of-sub-Committee-on-Dail-Reform-regarding-changes-to-Standing-Orders-8th-June-2016.pdf#page=25|title=Abstentions|date=8 June 2016|work=Report of the sub-Committee on Dáil Reform regarding changes to Standing Orders |publisher=Oireachtas|page=25|accessdate=8 December 2016}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/about/standingorders/Consolidated-version-of-all-of-the-Standing-Orders-of-D%C3%A1il-%C3%89ireann,-15-November-2016.pdf#page=56|title=Consolidated version of all of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann currently in effect|date=15 November 2016|publisher=Oireachtas|pages=40, sec.77|accessdate=8 December 2016}}; {{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/why-is-does-the-dail-chamber-need-an-upgrade-2879194-Jul2016/|title=We'll be hearing a lot more from politicians after the summer recess|last=Ní Aodha|first=Gráinne|date=15 July 2016 |quote=The electronic voting system in the Dáil chamber also needs to be upgraded to provide a button for TDs who want to abstain on votes.

Since 2016, the Ceann Comhairle is elected by means of an [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] by [[secret ballot]]. The winner of this vote is then approved by a physical division in an [[uncontested election]]. Previously a physical was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/debates/?id=2016-01-28a.158|title=Standing Orders: Motion|date=28 January 2016|work=Dáil debates|publisher=KildareStreet.com|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, in 1969, when [[Jack Lynch]] sought the nomination of the Dáil to be appointed Taoiseach by the President, after the division had been called and the doors locked, the bells continued to ring and several Fianna Fáil deputies subsequently entered the chamber through an unlocked door. After other deputies objected, The Ceann Comhairle called the division again. Lynch won the nomination 74 votes to 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1969/07/02/00005.asp|title=Nomination of Taoiseach.

In [[Seanad Éireann]], the upper house, a similar procedure is laid out by standing orders 56–63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/proceduraldocuments/SeanadSO2007.pdf#page=75|title=Seanad Standing Orders relative to Public Business|year=2007|publisher=Oireachtas|pages=56–63|language=English, Irish|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relayed sound of the bell for Seanad divisions differs from that of the Dáil bell.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==New Zealand==

In the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]], division of the assembly occurs when the result of a voice vote on a motion is split, and a member disagrees with the Speaker's call. There are two methods for handling a division: a ''party vote'' and a ''personal vote''.&lt;ref name="NZHR-vote" /&gt;

A ''party vote'' is the most common method, and occurs for non-conscience issues and some conscience issues. In this method, the Clerk of the House reads out each party's name in order of the number of seats each party has, starting with the largest party, followed by any independent members and any members wishing to [[cross the floor]]. A member of the party (usually a whip) will respond to their party's name by stating how many members of the party are in favour or opposed. The Clerk tallies up the votes and gives the results to the Speaker, who declares the result. A ''split party vote'' is a variation of the party vote, used for some conscience issues. The main difference is voting members state how many members of their party are in favour and how many members are opposed, and once the voting is completed, must table a list of the members of the party and how they voted.&lt;ref name="NZHR-vote" /&gt;

A ''personal vote'' is used mainly for conscience issues, and follows similar procedures to other Westminster systems. In the event of a personal vote, the division bells are rung for seven minutes, and after the bells stops, members are instructed to move to one of two lobbies, "Ayes" or "Noes", to have their vote recorded as such. Once all the votes are tallied, the results are handed to the speaker who declares the result.&lt;ref name="NZHR-vote"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/Features/b/0/0/00NZPHomeNews061120091-Voting-in-the-House-of-Representatives.htm |title= Voting in the House of Representatives |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |date= 6 November 2009 |accessdate= 30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual division occurred on 30 August 2012, with a three-way conscience vote on New Zealand's [[legal drinking age]]. All members were directed to the Noes lobby, where the Clerk of the House recorded each member's vote (either for keeping the age at 18, raising the age to 20, or raising the off-licence age to 20 while keeping the on-licence age at 18) as they passed back into the main debating chamber. The votes were tallied and handed back to the Speaker, who declared the results as 50 votes for 18 years, 38 votes for 20 years, and 33 votes for an 18/20 split. As no option acquired the 61-vote majority needed, the option with the lowest number of votes (18/20 split) was dropped, and the members voted again as per a normal personal vote, using the Ayes lobby for 18 years and Noes lobby for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/9/c/6/50HansD_20120830_00000020-Alcohol-Reform-Bill-In-Committee.htm |title= Alcohol Reform Bill — In Committee |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |date= 30 August 2012 |accessdate= 2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== House of Commons ===
[[File:Commons Division 2012.jpg|thumb|A division, circa 2012]]
In the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] says "The Question is that…", then states the question. Next, he/she says, "As many as are of that opinion say Aye." Then, following shouts of "Aye", he says, "of the contrary, No," and similar shouts of "No" may follow. If one side clearly has more support, the Speaker then announces his/her opinion as to the winner, stating, for example, "I think the Ayes have it, the Ayes have it". Otherwise, the Speaker declares a division.

Any member may object to the Speaker's determination. If the Speaker feels that the division is unnecessary, he/she may first ask those who support his/her determination of the voice vote to rise, and then ask those who oppose the opinion to rise. Then, the Speaker may either declare that his ruling on the voice vote stands, or proceed to a division.

If a division is to be taken, the Speaker first states, "Division!  Clear the Lobbies!". Like all parliamentary procedure, there is a historical reason for the tradition. In this case it was a division that took place on 27 February 1771 when a non MP (known as a 'stranger'), one Thomas Hunt, was included in the 'Noes' vote.&lt;ref name="SN06401"&gt;Divisions in the House of Commons: House of Commons Background Paper. Document ref:SN/PC/06401  (Last updated: 2 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  It subsequently transpired that he had voted several times previously.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Henry Cavendish, Debates of the House of Commons during the 13th Parliament, vol. 2, P.333, 1841&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Division bell]] then sounds across the [[Parliamentary Estate]] as well as several buildings in the vicinity, such as restaurants and pubs (For a full list see [[Division bell#External division bells|External bells]]). The lobbies are cleared of [[Strangers (Parliament of the United Kingdom)|strangers]], these days primarily journalists who have access to the Lobby, but historically could have been members of the public. Division bells notify any members not currently in the chamber that a vote is about to start. A recent development has been the use of [[pagers]] and [[mobile phones]] by party [[whip (politics)|whip]]s, to summon members from further afield.

Two minutes into the division the Speaker puts the question to the House again.&lt;ref name="SN06401" /&gt; If it is clear that a division is still required, the Speaker announces the Tellers, two each for the "ayes" and "nos". These are appointed by those voting.&lt;ref name="SN06401" /&gt;  The tellers are automatically included in the tally of those voting. Some Parliamentary sources will report the vote, for instance as, "247 + 2 tell".&lt;ref name="SN06401" /&gt; 

MPs have to walk through one of the two Division Lobbies on either side of the House and give their name to the Division Clerks at the end of the respective Lobbies to vote. They are then counted by the Tellers as they leave the Lobby. The Whips keep check on which MPs enter which Lobby and try to persuade them to enter the Lobby that the Party would like them to enter.

An MP is prohibited from voting on any matter in which he or she has a direct financial interest. In order to act as a disqualification, the matter must be immediate and personal and not a general or remote matter.&lt;ref name="SN06401" /&gt;  An example might be that a member is disqualified from voting on legislation affecting the rents that can be charged by landlords, if that member owns properties that he or she rents out.

Whips have historically been brutal to [[backbenchers]] to secure their vote. The whip's offices to this day display the [[whip]]s that were once used to 'encourage' MPs to vote according to their party line.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Originally, there was only one lobby. In ''A Manual of Parliamentary Practice'', Thomas Jefferson writes:

{{quote|The one party goes forth, and the other remains in the House. This has made it important which go forth, and which remain; because the latter gain all the indolent, the indifferent and inattentive. Their general rule therefore is, that those who give their votes for the preservation of the orders of the House, shall stay in, and those who are for introducing any new matter or alteration, or proceeding contrary to the established course, are to go out.}}

After the [[Burning of Parliament#The 1834 Fire|fire of 1834]], the House of Commons Chamber was rebuilt. At that time, a second lobby was added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/p09.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211023648/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/p09.pdf |date=11 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight minutes after the question has been put for the first time, the Speaker declares, "Lock the Doors." The lobby entrances are locked, and only those within the Lobbies may continue to vote.

After all members have voted in the lobbies, the vote totals are written on a card and the numbers are read out to the House by the Tellers. The Speaker then announces these numbers a second time, announcing the final result by saying 'The Ayes/Noes have it, the Ayes/Noes have it'. The Speaker does not vote, except in the case of a tie and then only strictly in accordance to precedent. This means that the Speaker will let vote in accordance with these principles:
* Legislation remains unchanged unless there is a majority in favour of amendment,
* Legislation is allowed to proceed to the next stage unless there is a majority in favour of rejection, and
* All other motions are rejected unless there is a majority in favour of passage.

Members may signify, but not record, an abstention by remaining in their seats during the division. Though the practice is traditionally frowned upon, MPs can also pass through both lobbies, effectively registering their abstention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowther |first=Ed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21591602 |title=BBC News - Yes but, no but... MPs who vote both ways |publisher=BBC |date=5 March 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is stipulated that all [[Members of Parliament]] are required to stay in or around the premises of the House of Commons until the main business of the day has ended, however long that may be. In the unlikely event that fewer than forty members participate in the division (including the speaker and the tellers),&lt;ref name="SN06401" /&gt; the division is declared 'inquorate', the question at hand is postponed until the next sitting, and the House proceeds to the next business.

The nature of divisions in the House of Commons is one which traditionally could go on well into the night, sometimes past midnight. However, in 2000 the House introduced, on an experimental basis, the procedure of "Deferred Divisions." Essentially, some divisions are delayed until the next Wednesday. The procedure is used for very few matters; most divisions still occur normally.

There have been suggestions that electronic voting may be easier and quicker to do than physically going through a [[division lobby]]. However, MPs have often found that a division is the best way to interact for senior members of the government. And it can be considered a way to sort out problems for the Member's [[wikt:constituent|constituents]].

There are two variations to the normal practice of an MP voting by walking through the respective lobby.

====Nodding through====

There have been cases where Members of Parliament are wheeled from far afield to vote for their party in a crucial vote. For members who are too ill to reach the lobby, there is a procedure called 'nodding through' provided the tellers agree.&lt;ref name="SN06401" /&gt;  The whips will ensure that the MP's name is added to the list of those voting. There are only two conditions. The MP must be within the precincts of the Palace of Westminster, and must be alive. Former MP [[Joe Ashton]] remembered a case from the dying days of [[James Callaghan]]'s government:

{{quote|I remember the famous case of [[Leslie Spriggs]], the then Member for [[St Helens (UK Parliament constituency)|St. Helens]]. We had a tied vote and he was brought to the House in an ambulance having suffered a severe heart attack. The two Whips went out to look in the ambulance and there was Leslie Spriggs laid there as though he was dead. I believe that [[John Stradling Thomas]] said to [[Joseph Harper (English politician)|Joe Harper]], "How do we know that he is alive?" So he leaned forward, turned the knob on the heart machine, the green light went around, and he said, "There, you've lost—it's 311.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970604/debtext/70604-49.htm|title=House of Commons debate 4 Jun 1997 : Column 506|year=1997|publisher=Hansard by request of UK Parliament|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Pairing====

'Pairing' is an arrangement between two opposing MPs where both agree not to participate in any divisions because their votes would cancel each other out anyway. Pairing agreements can last anything from days to the life of the Parliament (now fixed at five years).&lt;ref name="SN06401" /&gt;  All pairings have to be registered with the party whips so that they know not to pursue their member for failing to vote.

=== House of Lords ===
{{update section|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|400px|thumb|right| An important vote: the [[House of Lords]] voting for the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. ''From the Drawing by S. Begg'' ]]

In the [[House of Lords]], the [[Lord Speaker of the House of Lords|Lord Speaker]] proposes the question and announces the result as in the Commons, but substitutes "Content" for "Aye" and "Not-Content" for "No". A Lord may object to the Lord Speaker's determination. The Lord Speaker then announces a division by stating, "Clear the Bar!" The Bar of the House is then cleared. Tellers are appointed as in the Commons.

Three minutes after the question was first proposed, the Lord Speaker again proposes the question as above. If his opinion is not challenged, then the question is decided without a division. But if his decision is once again disputed, the Lord Speaker may again ask the question. The question may be repeated as many times as the Lord Speaker pleases; the process is referred to as "collecting the voices". But if a single Lord maintains an objection, the Lord Speaker, not having the [House of Commons] Speaker's power to declare a division unnecessary, must eventually announce, "The Contents to the right by the Throne, the Not-contents to the left by the Bar". Lords then vote in the lobbies, as it is done in the Commons. Unlike the Speaker, the Lord Speaker may vote during a division; he does so from his seat rather than in a lobby. In the event that the votes are equal, then the following principles apply:

* Legislation remains unchanged unless there is a majority in favour of amendment,
* Legislation is allowed to proceed to the next stage unless there is a majority in favour of rejection, and
* All other motions are rejected unless there is a majority in favour of passage.

The quorum for divisions is three Lords on a procedural vote and thirty Lords on a substantive one.

==United States ==
In the [[United States Congress]], divisions are used, but not in the same manner as in the British Parliament. In Congress, lobbies are not used, and the division is not a final determination of the question. The vote is first taken by voice vote, as is the case in Parliament. Then, any member may demand a division. If a division is demanded, then the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] (or, more commonly, a Representative of the majority party designated by the Speaker to preside as Speaker pro tempore) or the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|Presiding Officer of the Senate]] asks those voting ''Yea'' to rise and remain standing until counted, and then asks those voting ''Nay'' to do the same. A division is the least common method of voting in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Senate: Reference Home &gt;|url = https://www.senate.gov/general/Features/votes.htm|website = www.senate.gov|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(The [[Vice President of the United States]] is constitutionally designated as the [[President of the United States Senate]], and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] presides over its sessions or appoints another senator to do so when the Vice President does not preside. Ordinarily, neither the Vice President nor the president pro tempore preside, but instead the president pro tempore appoints a junior Senator of the majority party to preside).

A [[recorded vote]] must take place upon the demand of one-fifth of members present under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 5]] of the [[United States Constitution]]: "the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal." In the Senate, a recorded vote is accomplished by the [[Secretary of the United States Senate|clerk's]] call of the roll. In the House, an electronic voting device is typically used to take recorded votes, although occasionally roll calls take place; the House is historically too large to conduct roll calls on a regular basis (435 members versus 100 in the Senate). When voting to override a Presidential veto, the yeas and nays are required under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 7]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

It was established in EU Regulation 910/2014 of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and repeals [[directive (European Union)|directive]] [[Electronic Signatures Directive|1999/93/EC]] from 13 December 1999.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

eIDAS oversees electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Union's [[internal market]]. It regulates [[electronic signature]]s, electronic transactions, involved bodies, and their embedding processes to provide a safe way for users to conduct business online like [[electronic funds transfer]] or transactions with [[public services]]. Both the [[signature|signatory]] and the recipient can have more convenience and [[information security|security]]. Instead of relying on traditional methods, such as mail or [[facsimile]], or appearing in person to submit paper-based documents, they may now perform transactions across borders, like "[[1-Click]]" technology.&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SecureIdentityAlliance"&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Zijp|first1=Jacques|title=Is the EU ready for eIDAS?|url=https://www.secureidentityalliance.org/index.php/blog/item/20-eidas-eu-identity-assurance/20-eidas-eu-identity-assurance|publisher=Secure Identity Alliance|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eIDAS has created standards for which electronic signatures, [[qualified digital certificate]]s, [[electronic seal|electronic seals]], [[timestamp]]s, and other proof for [[authentication]] mechanisms enable electronic transactions, with the same legal standing as transactions that are performed on paper.&lt;ref name="Turner-eIDAS-from-directive-to-reg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=eIDAS from Directive to Regulation - Legal Aspects|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/eidas-from-directive-to-regulation-legal-aspects|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation came into effect in July 2014, as a means to facilitate secure and seamless electronic transactions within the European Union. Member states are required to recognise electronic signatures that meet the standards of eIDAS.&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-EIDAS" /&gt;

==Vision==

eIDAS is a result of the European Commission's focus on Europe's Digital Agenda. With the Commission's oversight, eIDAS was implemented to spur digital growth within the EU.&lt;ref name="EUR-Lex-digital agenda"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Digital Agenda For Europe|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A52010DC0245R(01)|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent of eIDAS is to drive innovation. By adhering to the guidelines set for technology under eIDAS, organisations are pushed towards using higher levels of [[information security]] and [[innovation]]. Additionally, eIDAS focuses on the following:&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-EIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bender|first1=Jens|title=eIDAS Regulation: EID - Opportunities and Risks|url=https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/ElekAusweise/SmartCard_Workshop/Workshop_2015_Bender.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|website=Bunde.de|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AshiqJA-eIDAS-agenda"&gt;{{cite web|last1=J.A.|first1=Ashiq|title=The eIDAS Agenda: Innovation, Interoperability and Transparency|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/the-eidas-agenda-innovation-interoperability-and-transparency|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Interoperability]]'': Member states are required to create a common framework that will recognize eIDs from other member states and ensure its authenticity and security. That makes it easy for users to conduct business across borders.
*''[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]]'': eIDAS provides a clear and accessible list of trusted services that may be used within the centralised signing framework. That allows security stakeholders the ability to engage in dialogue about the best technologies and tools for securing digital signatures.

==Regulated aspects in electronic transactions==

The Regulation provides the regulatory environment for the following important aspects related to electronic transactions:&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex" /&gt;

*''[[Advanced electronic signature]]'': An electronic signature is considered advanced if it meets certain requirements:
**It provides unique identifying information that links it to its signatory.
**The signatory has sole control of the data used to create the electronic signature.
**It must be capable of identifying if the data accompanying the message has been tampered with after being signed. If the signed data has changed, the signature is marked invalid.
**There is a certificate for electronic signature, electronic proof that confirms the identity of the signatory and links the electronic signature validation data to that person.
**Advanced electronic signatures can be technically implemented, following the [[XAdES]], [[PAdES]], [[CAdES (computing)|CAdES]] or ASiC Baseline Profile ([[Associated Signature Containers]]) standard for digital signatures, specified by the [[ETSI]].&lt;ref name="Turner_Diff-Electronic-Digital-Sig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=The Difference Between an Electronic Signature and a Digital Signature|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/the-difference-between-an-electronic-signature-and-a-digital-signature|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Qualified electronic signature]]'', an advanced electronic signature that is created by a [[secure signature creation device|qualified electronic signature creation device]] based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures.
*''[[Qualified digital certificate]] for electronic signature'', a certificate that attests to a qualified electronic signature's authenticity that has been issued by a qualified trust service provider.
*''[[Trust service provider|Trust service]]'', an electronic service that creates, validates, and verifies [[electronic signature|electronic signatures]], [[timestamp|time stamps]], [[electronic seal|seals]], and [[qualified digital certificate|certificates]]. Also, a trust service may provide website authentication and preservation of created electronic signatures, certificates, and seals. It is handled by a [[trust service provider]].

==Evolution and legal implications==

The eIDAS Regulation evolved from Directive 1999/93/EC, which set a goal that EU member states were expected to achieve in regards to electronic signing. The directive made [[EU member states]] responsible for creating laws that would allow them to meet the goal of creating an electronic signing system within the EU. As it is a [[regulation (European Union)|regulation]], it became directly binding as law throughout the EU from July 1, 2016.&lt;ref name="EU-difference-regulation-directive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations, Directives and other acts|url=http://europa.eu/eu-law/decision-making/legal-acts/index_en.htm|website=Europa.eu|publisher=The European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eIDAS provides a tiered approach of legal value. It requires for no electronic signature to be denied legal effect or admissibility in court solely because it is not an advanced or qualified electronic signature.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 25 (1) and definitions in article 3 (10) to 3 (12)&lt;/ref&gt; Qualified electronic signatures must be given the same legal effect as handwritten signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Article 25 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;

For electronic seals (legal entities' version of signatures), [[relevance (law)|probative value]] is explicitly addressed, as seals should enjoy the presumption of integrity and the correctness of the origin of the attached data.&lt;ref&gt;Article 35 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity number==
Database information has to be linked to some kind of identity number. To certify that a person has the right to access some personal information involves several steps.
*Connecting a person to a number, which can be done through methods developed in one country, such as digital certificates.
*Connecting a number to specific information, done in databases.
*For eIDAS it is needed to connect the number used by a country having information, to the number used by the country issuing the digital certificates.

eIDAS has as minimum identity concept, the name and birth date. But in order to access more sensitive information, some kind of certification is needed that identity numbers issued by two countries refer to the same person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elegnamnden.se/download/18.769a0b711614b669f29f2/1518186851374/Hur_skapar_du_en_koppling_mellan_utlandska_och_svenska_personidentiteter.pdf Hur skapar du en koppling mellan svenska och utländska eID:n?] (in Swedish.

'''Etimesgut''' or '''Etimesut''', formerly '''Ahimesut''', is a metropolitan district of [[Ankara Province]] in the [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolia]] region of [[Turkey]], mainly consisting of large public housing projects, {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Ankara]] city centre. According to 2010 census, population of Etimesgut is 386,879 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2=&amp;ENVID=adnksdb2Env&amp;report=idari_yapi_09sonrasi.RDF&amp;p_il1=6&amp;p_yil=2010&amp;p_dil=2&amp;desformat=html]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Statistical Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/turkey.aspx?levels=Ic%20Anadolu|title=Statistical information on Turkey's administrative units|accessdate=2008-03-29|author=GeoHive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district covers an area of {{convert|49|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ytr.html|title=Statistical information on districts of Turkey|accessdate=2008-05-01|author=Statoids}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the average elevation is {{convert|807|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

==History==
Archaeological research shows habitation since 2000 BC, including a [[Phrygia]]n settlement in the 8th century BC. Then of course the district began to share the history of the city of Ankara with its [[Lydians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Galatia]]ns, [[Ancient Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and finally [[Turkish peoples|Turks]]. Etimesgut is on the ancient [[Silk Road]] to the orient, and still today the road and railway from Ankara to [[Istanbul]] pass through the district.

[[Atatürk]] was fond of the area and would come here to ride horses and chat to the locals. He had a room in the building that is the public health laboratory today, and many other public buildings, including the hospital and the post office, that were built by his order still stand today.

Etimesgut began as a housing project of 50 homes ordered by Atatürk in 1924 to accommodate [[Turks in Bulgaria|Turkish]] refugees from [[Bulgaria]]. From the 1950s, as poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city much illegal housing [[gecekondu]] was thrown up in this district. Some of this has been replaced by public housing projects such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[Güzelkent, Etimesgut|Güzelkent]] and also military and civil service accommodation. However much ''gecekondu'' remains, inhabited by working-class people from cities such as [[Erzurum]], many of whom commute to jobs in the city of Ankara.
The Islamic terrorist organisation [[Hizbullah (Turkey)|Hizbullah]] had a number of hidden cells here in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Present==
The area has only the most basic shops and amenities.  Almost all of the housing in Etimesgut is apartment buildings except for the Güzelkent project. As building land in the city of Ankara is now impossible to find, areas like this on the fringes of the city, where building land is cheap, are growing faster and faster.

Public buildings include the sugar factory, the Turkish aviation authority headquarters at Etimesgut Airport and a military training camp.

The local football team [[Etimesgut Şekerspor]] has a chequered history; in recent years it has gained popularity by hiring former national team player [[Sergen Yalçın]].

==Planned security campus==
The construction of a new building in Etimesgut is underway, to serve as the joint new headquarters of the Turkish [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]] (MİT), the [[Ministry of National Defence (Turkey)|Ministry of National Defence]], and the [[Turkish General Staff]] together with the commands of the Army, Navy and Air Force branches of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. Reportedly, the move, which will turn the area into a "security campus" comparable to the [[US Pentagon]], is part of measures taken after the failed [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MİT, MSB ve komutanlıklar Etimesgut'ta toplanacak |author=Deniz Çiçek |url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1305407-mit-msb-ve-komutanliklar-etimesgutta-toplanacak |newspaper=[[Haberturk]] |date=4 October 2016 |accessdate=5 October 2016 |language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Turkish Pentagon' to be formed in capital Ankara: Report |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-pentagon-to-be-formed-in-capital-ankara-report.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=104570&amp;NewsCatID=338 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=4 October 2016 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former broadcasting site==
At Etimesgut, there was a longwave broadcasting station with two masts each 256 metres tall, which worked on 198&amp;nbsp;kHz. The station, whose masts stood at {{coord|39|56|24.07|N|32|40|3.2|E|type:landmark|name=Etimesgut transmitter, mast north}} and at {{coord|39|56|14.33|N|32|40|3.03|E|type:landmark|name=Etimesgut transmitter, mast south}} was built in 1938 and shut-down in 2004 and was afterwards demolished.

The '''European Federation of Energy Traders''' ('''EFET''') is an association of European [[Energy market|energy traders]] in markets for wholesale electricity and gas. EFET was founded in 1999 in response to the liberalisation of electricity and gas markets within the [[European Union]]. EFET advocates policies and regulatory measures which allow electricity and gas trading to develop freely while encouraging good risk management practices and responsible corporate governance. In its role as a standard setting body, EFET aims to provide standard solutions to common aspects of wholesale energy transactions, such as contracting and data exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efet.org/AboutUs/EFET-Statement-of-Activities EFET Statement of Activities], on the EFET Website (Retrieved in September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Members ==
As of January 2014, EFET had a total of 126 member companies, of which 37 were associate members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efet.org/AboutUs/Member-Companies EFET Member companies] on the EFET website&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Banking in the United States}}

The '''Federal Reserve System''' (also known as the '''Federal Reserve''' or simply '''the Fed''') is the [[central bank]]ing system of the [[United States of America]]. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the [[Federal Reserve Act]], after a series of [[financial panic]]s (particularly the [[panic of 1907]]) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises.{{refn|group=list|name=need|&lt;ref name="mnglass"/&gt;&lt;ref name="initial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDS-H-04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDS-H-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDS-H-06"/&gt;}} Over the years, events such as the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and the [[Great Recession]] during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref name="initial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=1}} "It was founded by Congress in 1913 to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. Over the years, its role in banking and the economy has expanded."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Reform of the Federal Reserve System in the Early 1930s: The Politics of Money and Banking | first=Sue C. | last=Patrick | publisher=Garland | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-8153-0970-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] established three key objectives for [[monetary policy]] in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|12|225a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12848.htm | title=The Congress established two key objectives for monetary policy-maximum employment and stable prices-in the Federal Reserve Act. These objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=January 25, 2012 | accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its duties have expanded over the years, and currently also include supervising and [[bank regulation|regulating banks]], maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to [[depository institution]]s, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/mission/default.htm | title=FRB: Mission | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 6, 2009 | accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fed conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the [[Beige Book]] and the [[Federal Reserve Economic Data|FRED database]].

The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the [[President of the United States|presidentially]] appointed [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|board of governors]] or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s, located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately owned commercial banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=v}} (See [[#Structure|structure]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserveonline.org | title=Federal Reserve Districts | publisher=Federal Reserve Online | date=n.d. | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413204008/http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm |date=April 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in, and can elect some of the board members of, the Federal Reserve Bank of their region. The [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) sets monetary policy. It consists of all seven members of the board of governors and the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at a time (the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year voting terms). There are also various advisory councils. Thus, the Federal Reserve System has both public and private components.{{refn|group=list|name=pubpriv|&lt;ref name="who_owns_faq"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Federal Reserve website | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm | title=FAQ – Who owns the Federal Reserve? | accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Is the Fed Private or Public? | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2200411/ | date=September 19, 2008 | first=Juliet | last=Lapidos | publisher=Slate | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Reserve System |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/toma.reserve |date=February 1, 2010 |first=Mark |last=Toma |website=EH.

The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors. The federal government receives all the system's annual profits, after a statutory [[dividend]] of 6% on member banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve earned net income of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the [[U.S. Treasury]].&lt;ref name="frs bog net income press lease"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20160111a.htm | title=Press Release – Federal Reserve Board announces Reserve Bank income and expense data and transfers to the Treasury for 2015 | work=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | date=January 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an instrument of the US Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."&lt;ref&gt;From "Who owns the Federal Reserve?", Current FAQs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at [http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Eccles Building]] in Washington, D.C., which serves as the Federal Reserve System's headquarters]]

The primary motivation for creating the Federal Reserve System was to address [[bank run|banking panics]].&lt;ref name="initial"&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2006 | pp=1}} "Just before the founding of the Federal Reserve, the nation was plagued with financial crises. At times, these crises led to 'panics,' in which people raced to their banks to withdraw their deposits. A particularly severe panic in 1907 resulted in bank runs that wreaked havoc on the fragile banking system and ultimately led Congress in 1913 to write the Federal Reserve Act. Initially created to address these banking panics, the Federal Reserve is now charged with a number of broader responsibilities, including fostering a sound banking system and a healthy economy."&lt;/ref&gt; Other purposes are stated in the [[Federal Reserve Act]], such as "to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting [[commercial paper]], to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/GeneralInfo/fract/ | title=Federal Reserve Act | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | date=May 14, 2003 | archivedate=May 17, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517044141/http://www.federalreserve.gov/GeneralInfo/fract/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States underwent several financial crises. A particularly severe crisis in 1907 led Congress to enact the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Today the Federal Reserve System has responsibilities in addition to ensuring the stability of the financial system.&lt;ref name="BoG 2006 pp=1"&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2006 | pp=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addressing the problem of bank panics===
{{Further|Bank run|Fractional-reserve banking}}

Banking institutions in the United States are required to hold reserves{{nsmdns}}amounts of currency and deposits in other banks{{nsmdns}}equal to only a fraction of the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called [[fractional-reserve banking]]. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a [[lender of last resort]] when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel]] laureate [[Milton Friedman]], believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929; Friedman argued that this contributed to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve Board"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boardDocs/Speeches/2003/20031024/default.htm | format=text | title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

Bernanke's speech to M. Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Check clearing system====
Because some banks refused to [[Clearing (finance)|clear]] checks from certain other banks during times of economic uncertainty, a check-clearing system was created in the Federal Reserve System. It is briefly described in ''The Federal Reserve System{{nsmdns}}Purposes and Functions'' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By creating the Federal Reserve System, Congress intended to eliminate the severe financial crises that had periodically swept the nation, especially the sort of financial panic that occurred in 1907. During that episode, payments were disrupted throughout the country because many banks and clearinghouses refused to clear checks drawn on certain other banks, a practice that contributed to the failure of otherwise solvent banks. To address these problems, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System the authority to establish a nationwide check-clearing system. The System, then, was to provide not only an elastic currency{{nsmdns}}that is, a currency that would expand or shrink in amount as economic conditions warranted{{nsmdns}}but also an efficient and equitable check-collection system.}}

====Lender of last resort====
In the United States, the Federal Reserve serves as the [[lender of last resort]] to those institutions that cannot obtain credit elsewhere and the collapse of which would have serious implications for the economy. It took over this role from the private sector "clearing houses" which operated during the Free Banking Era; whether public or private, the availability of liquidity was intended to prevent bank runs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/glossary.cfm?js=0#l lender of last resort], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]], Retrieved May 21, 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Humphrey|first1=Thomas M.|title=Lender of Last Resort: The Concept in History|ssrn=2125371|publisher=Social Science Research Network|date=1 January 1989|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2125371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fluctuations====
Through its [[discount window]] and credit operations, Reserve Banks provide liquidity to banks to meet short-term needs stemming from seasonal fluctuations in deposits or unexpected withdrawals. Longer term liquidity may also be provided in exceptional circumstances. The rate the Fed charges banks for these loans is called the discount rate (officially the primary credit rate).

By making these loans, the Fed serves as a buffer against unexpected day-to-day fluctuations in reserve demand and supply. This contributes to the effective functioning of the banking system, alleviates pressure in the reserves market and reduces the extent of unexpected movements in the interest rates.&lt;ref name="dfeverydayecon"/&gt; For example, on September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board authorized an $85 billion loan to stave off the bankruptcy of international insurance giant [[American International Group]] (AIG).&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve-AIG Press Release-2008-09-16"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080916a.htm | title=Press Release: Federal Reserve Board, with full support of the Treasury Department, authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the American International Group (AIG) | date=September 16, 2008 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Andrews-2008-09-16"&gt;

===Central bank===
{{Further|Central bank}}
[[File:Onedolar2009series.jpg|right|thumb|Obverse of a Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]] issued in 2009]]

In its role as the [[central bank]] of the United States, the Fed serves as a banker's bank and as the government's bank. As the banker's bank, it helps to assure the safety and efficiency of the payments system. As the government's bank or fiscal agent, the Fed processes a variety of financial transactions involving trillions of dollars. Just as an individual might keep an account at a bank, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] keeps a checking account with the Federal Reserve, through which incoming federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments are handled. As part of this service relationship, the Fed sells and redeems [[Treasury security|U.S. government securities]] such as savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds. It also issues the nation's [[Coins of the United States dollar|coin]] and [[Federal Reserve note|paper currency]]. The U.S. Treasury, through its [[United States Mint|Bureau of the Mint]] and [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], actually produces the nation's cash supply and, in effect, sells the paper currency to the Federal Reserve Banks at manufacturing cost, and the coins at face value. The Federal Reserve Banks then distribute it to other financial institutions in various ways.&lt;ref name="Fed_currency"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | url= http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed01.html | title=How Currency Gets into Circulation |date=June 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Fiscal Year]] 2013, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing delivered 6.6 billion notes at an average cost of 5.0 cents per note.&lt;ref name="Bureau_cost"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |url=http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |title=Annual Production Figures |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125657/http://www.bep.treas.gov/uscurrency/annualproductionfigures.html |archivedate=August 27, 2011 |df=mdy }}http://www.bep.treas.gov/resources/productionannual.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bep.gov/images/2013_CFO_Report.pdf |title=Chief Financial Officer Performance and Accountability Report |website=Bureau of Engraving and Printing |page=25 |access-date=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal funds====
{{Main|Federal funds}}

Federal funds are the reserve balances (also called [[Federal Reserve Deposits]]) that private banks keep at their local Federal Reserve Bank.&lt;ref name="fed funds"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed15.html | title=Federal Funds | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York |date=August 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/special_reports/instruments_of_the_money_market/pdf/full_publication.pdf |editor-first=Timothy Q. |editor-last=Cook|editor2-first=Robert K.|editor2-last=Laroche | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | title=Instruments of the Money Market | year=1993 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These balances are the namesake reserves of the Federal Reserve System. The purpose of keeping funds at a Federal Reserve Bank is to have a mechanism for private banks to lend funds to one another. This market for funds plays an important role in the Federal Reserve System as it is what inspired the name of the system and it is what is used as the basis for monetary policy. Monetary policy is put into effect partly by influencing how much interest the private banks charge each other for the lending of these funds.

Federal reserve accounts contain federal reserve credit, which can be converted into [[federal reserve note]]s. Private banks maintain their [[bank reserves]] in federal reserve accounts.

===Bank regulation===
The Federal Reserve regulates private banks. The system was designed out of a compromise between the competing philosophies of privatization and government regulation. In 2006 [[Donald L. Kohn]], vice chairman of the board of governors, summarized the history of this compromise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20061103a.htm | title=Speech – Kohn, The Evolving Role of the Federal Reserve Banks | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Agrarian and progressive interests, led by William Jennings Bryan, favored a central bank under public, rather than banker, control. But the vast majority of the nation's bankers, concerned about government intervention in the banking business, opposed a central bank structure directed by political appointees.

The legislation that Congress ultimately adopted in 1913 reflected a hard-fought battle to balance these two competing views and created the hybrid public-private, centralized-decentralized structure that we have today.}}

The balance between private interests and government can also be seen in the structure of the system. Private banks elect members of the board of directors at their regional Federal Reserve Bank while the members of the board of governors are selected by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

====Government regulation and supervision====
[[File:House Financial Services Committee hearing with Ben Bernanke.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Bernanke (lower-right), former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, at a [[House Financial Services Committee]] hearing on February 10, 2009. Members of the board frequently testify before congressional committees such as this one. The Senate equivalent of the House Financial Services Committee is the [[Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]].]]

The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, enacted in 1978 as Public Law 95-320 and 31 U.S.C. section 714 establish that the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve banks may be audited by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions Federal Reserve System |accessdate=February 19, 2010 |quote=The Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Reserve System as a whole are all subject to several levels of audit and review. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted numerous reviews of Federal Reserve activities |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217220435/http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm |archivedate=February 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAO has authority to audit check-processing, currency storage and shipments, and some regulatory and bank examination functions, however, there are restrictions to what the GAO may audit. Under the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act, 31 U.S.C. section 714(b), audits of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve banks do not include (1) transactions for or with a foreign central bank or government or non-private international financing organization; (2) deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters; (3) transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or (4) a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the board of governors and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to items (1), (2), or (3). See Federal Reserve System Audits: Restrictions on GAO's Access (GAO/T-GGD-94-44), statement of Charles A. Bowsher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96159t.pdf| title=Federal Reserve System Current and Future Challenges Require System-wide Attention: Statement of Charles A. Bowsher | publisher=United States General Accounting Office | date=July 26, 1996 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board of governors in the Federal Reserve System has a number of supervisory and regulatory responsibilities in the U.S. banking system, but not complete responsibility. A general description of the types of regulation and supervision involved in the U.S. banking system is given by the Federal Reserve:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Board also plays a major role in the supervision and regulation of the U.S. banking system. It has supervisory responsibilities for state-chartered banks&lt;ref&gt;See example: {{cite web |url=http://www.state.ar.us/bank/benefits_advantages.html |publisher=Arkansas State Bank Department |title=Advantages of Being/Becoming a State Chartered Bank |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are members of the Federal Reserve System, [[Bank holding company|bank holding companies]] (companies that control banks), the foreign activities of member banks, the U.S. activities of foreign banks, and [[Edge Act]] and "agreement corporations" (limited-purpose institutions that engage in a foreign banking business). The Board and, under delegated authority, the Federal Reserve Banks, supervise approximately 900 state member banks and 5,000 bank holding companies. Other federal agencies also serve as the primary federal supervisors of commercial banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] supervises national banks, and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] supervises [[state bank]]s that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.

Some regulations issued by the Board apply to the entire banking industry, whereas others apply only to member banks, that is, [[state bank]]s that have chosen to join the Federal Reserve System and national banks, which by law must be members of the System. The Board also issues regulations to carry out major federal laws governing [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], such as the [[Truth in Lending Act|Truth in Lending]], [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act|Equal Credit Opportunity]], and [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]s. Many of these consumer protection regulations apply to various lenders outside the banking industry as well as to banks.

Members of the Board of Governors are in continual contact with other policy makers in government. They frequently testify before [[congressional committee]]s on the economy, [[monetary policy]], [[Bank regulation|banking supervision and regulation]], [[Consumer protection|consumer credit protection]], [[financial market]]s, and other matters.

The Board has regular contact with members of the President's [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and other key economic officials. The Chair also meets from time to time with the [[President of the United States]] and has regular meetings with the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. The Chair has formal responsibilities in the international arena as well.}}

=====Regulatory and oversight responsibilities=====
The board of directors of each Federal Reserve Bank District also has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities. If the board of directors of a district bank has judged that a member bank is performing or behaving poorly, it will report this to the board of governors. This policy is described in United States Code:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/301- | title=U.S. Code Title 12, Chapter 3, Subchapter 7, Section 301. Powers and duties of board of directors; suspension of member bank for undue use of bank credit | publisher=Law.cornell.edu | date=June 22, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Each Federal reserve bank shall keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of its member banks with a view to ascertaining whether undue use is being made of bank credit for the speculative carrying of or trading in securities, real estate, or commodities, or for any other purpose inconsistent with the maintenance of sound credit conditions; and, in determining whether to grant or refuse advances, rediscounts, or other credit accommodations, the Federal reserve bank shall give consideration to such information. The chairman of the Federal reserve bank shall report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System any such undue use of bank credit by any member bank, together with his recommendation. Whenever, in the judgment of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, any member bank is making such undue use of bank credit, the Board may, in its discretion, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend such bank from the use of the credit facilities of the Federal Reserve System and may terminate such suspension or may renew it from time to time.}}

===National payments system===
The Federal Reserve plays a role in the U.S. payments system. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks provide banking services to depository institutions and to the federal government. For depository institutions, they maintain accounts and provide various payment services, including collecting checks, electronically transferring funds, and distributing and receiving currency and coin. For the federal government, the Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents, paying Treasury checks; processing electronic payments; and issuing, transferring, and redeeming U.S. government securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980, Congress reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve should promote an efficient nationwide payments system. The act subjects all depository institutions, not just member commercial banks, to reserve requirements and grants them equal access to Reserve Bank payment services.
The Federal Reserve plays a role in the nation's retail and wholesale payments systems by providing financial services to depository institutions. Retail payments are generally for relatively small-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's retail clients{{nsmdns}}individuals and smaller businesses. The Reserve Banks' retail services include distributing currency and coin, collecting checks, and electronically transferring funds through the automated clearinghouse system. By contrast, wholesale payments are generally for large-dollar amounts and often involve a depository institution's large corporate customers or counterparties, including other financial institutions. The Reserve Banks' wholesale services include electronically transferring funds through the [[Fedwire|Fedwire Funds Service]] and transferring securities issued by the U.S. government, its agencies, and certain other entities through the Fedwire Securities Service.

===Board of governors===
{{Main|Federal Reserve Board of Governors}}

The seven-member board of governors is a federal agency. It is charged with the overseeing of the 12 District Reserve Banks and setting national monetary policy. It also supervises and regulates the U.S. banking system in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|12|247}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Governors are appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for staggered 14-year terms.&lt;ref name="dfeverydayecon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasfed.org/educate/everyday/ev4.html | title=The Federal Reserve, Monetary Policy and the Economy – Everyday Economics | publisher=Dallasfed.org | date= | accessdate=August 29, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222121916/http://www.dallasfed.org/educate/everyday/ev4.html | archivedate=December 22, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}https://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/educate/everyday/ev4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One term begins every two years, on February 1 of even-numbered years, and members serving a full term cannot be renominated for a second term.&lt;ref name=FRB01/&gt; "[U]pon the expiration of their terms of office, members of the Board shall continue to serve until their successors are appointed and have qualified."

The chair and vice chair of the board of governors are appointed by the [[President of the United States|president]] from among the sitting governors. They both serve a four-year term and they can be renominated as many times as the president chooses, until their terms on the board of governors expire.&lt;ref name="usc12-241"&gt;See {{usc|12|241}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to US Code 12-241, the chair and vice chair may be chosen either from among the sitting governors or outsiders; the law does not specify a preferred choice.&lt;ref name="usc12-241" /&gt;

===Federal Open Market Committee===
{{Main|Federal Open Market Committee}}

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consists of 12 members, seven from the board of governors and 5 of the regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC oversees and sets policy on [[open market operations]], the principal tool of national monetary policy. These operations affect the amount of Federal Reserve balances available to depository institutions, thereby influencing overall monetary and credit conditions. The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve in foreign exchange markets. The FOMC must reach consensus on all decisions. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC; the presidents of the other banks rotate membership at two- and three-year intervals. All Regional Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the committee's assessment of the economy and of policy options, but only the five presidents who are then members of the FOMC vote on policy decisions. The FOMC determines its own internal organization and, by tradition, elects the chair of the board of governors as its chair and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its vice chair. Formal meetings typically are held eight times each year in Washington, D.C. Nonvoting Reserve Bank presidents also participate in Committee deliberations and discussion. The FOMC generally meets eight times a year in telephone consultations and other meetings are held when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Advisory Council===

[[File:US Federal Reserve Banks collage 1936.jpg|thumb|The twelve Reserve Banks buildings in 1936]]

There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each of which is responsible for member banks located in its district. They are located in [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston|Boston]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|New York]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland|Cleveland]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond|Richmond]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta|Atlanta]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|Chicago]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|St. Louis]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|Minneapolis]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City|Kansas City]], [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Dallas]], and [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|San Francisco]]. The size of each district was set based upon the population distribution of the United States when the Federal Reserve Act was passed.

The charter and organization of each Federal Reserve Bank is established by law and cannot be altered by the member banks. Member banks, do however, elect six of the nine members of the Federal Reserve Banks' boards of directors.&lt;ref name="dfeverydayecon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R000107"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Money and the Federal Reserve System: Myth and Reality – CRS Report for Congress, No. 96-672 E | journal=Congressional Research Service Library of Congress | date=July 31, 1996 | first=G. Thomas | last=Woodward | url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~becraft/FRS-myth.htm | accessdate=November 23, 2008 | ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each regional Bank has a president, who is the chief executive officer of their Bank. Each regional Reserve Bank's president is nominated by their Bank's board of directors, but the nomination is contingent upon approval by the board of governors. Presidents serve five-year terms and may be reappointed.&lt;ref name="FRB_pres"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/banks/default.htm | title= Federal Reserve Bank Presidents | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=July 20, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each regional Bank's board consists of nine members. Members are broken down into three classes: A, B, and C. There are three board members in each class. Class A members are chosen by the regional Bank's shareholders, and are intended to represent member banks' interests. Member banks are divided into three categories: large, medium, and small. Each category elects one of the three class A board members. Class B board members are also nominated by the region's member banks, but class B board members are supposed to represent the interests of the public. Lastly, class C board members are appointed by the board of governors, and are also intended to represent the interests of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode12/usc_sup_01_12_10_3_20_VII.html | title=US Code: Title 12, Subchapter VII – Directors of Federal Reserve Banks; Reserve Agents and Assistants | publisher=Law.cornell.edu | date=June 22, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal status of regional Federal Reserve Banks====
The Federal Reserve Banks have an intermediate legal status, with some features of private corporations and some features of public federal agencies. The United States has an interest in the Federal Reserve Banks as tax-exempt federally created instrumentalities whose profits belong to the federal government, but this interest is not proprietary.&lt;ref name="Scott 8th Cir. 2005"&gt;[http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/05/04/042357P.pdf Kennedy C. Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, et al.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614020633/http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/05/04/042357P.pdf |date=June 14, 2007 }}, [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/406/406.F3d.532.04-2357.html 406 F.3d 532] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517200626/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/406/406.F3d.532.04-2357.html |date=May 17, 2010 }} (8th Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Lewis v. United States'',&lt;ref name="Lewis-vs-U.S."&gt;[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/680/680.F2d.1239.80-5905.html 680 F.2d 1239] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515062925/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/680/680.F2d.1239.80-5905.html |date=May 15, 2010 }} (9th Cir. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] stated that: "The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA [the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]]], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations." The opinion went on to say, however, that: "The Reserve Banks have properly been held to be federal instrumentalities for some purposes." Another relevant decision is ''Scott v. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City'',&lt;ref name="Scott 8th Cir. 2005"/&gt; in which the distinction is made between Federal Reserve Banks, which are federally created instrumentalities, and the board of governors, which is a federal agency.

Regarding the structural relationship between the twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan has written that:&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Reagan, "The Political Structure of the Federal Reserve System," ''American Political Science Review'', Vol. 55 (March 1961), pp. 64–76, as reprinted in ''Money and Banking: Theory, Analysis, and Policy'', p. 153, ed. by S. Mittra (Random House, New York 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|... the "ownership" of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share, beyond the statutory dividend, in Reserve Bank "profits." ... Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates.}}

===Member banks===

A member bank is a private institution and owns stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank. All nationally chartered banks hold stock in one of the Federal Reserve Banks. State chartered banks may choose to be members (and hold stock in their regional Federal Reserve bank) upon meeting certain standards.

The amount of stock a member bank must own is equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Federal Reserve Act | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm | date=December 14, 2010 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | chapter=Section 2.3 Subscription to Stock by National Banks | chapterurl=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2.htm | accessdate=February 6, 2011 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Federal Reserve Act | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fract.htm | date=December 14, 2010 | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | chapter=Section 5.1 Amount of Shares; Increase and Decrease of Capital; Surrender and Cancellation of Stock | chapterurl=http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section5.htm | accessdate=February 6, 2011 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank is not like owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of owning this stock. From the profits of the Regional Bank of which it is a member, a member bank receives a dividend equal to 6% of its purchased stock.&lt;ref name="who_owns_faq" /&gt; The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks' profits is given over to the [[United States Treasury Department]]. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2 billion and distributed $2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.&lt;ref name="frs bog net income press lease" /&gt;

About 38% of U.S. banks are members of their regional Federal Reserve Bank.&lt;ref name="Factcheck"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who owns the Federal Reserve Bank? |url=http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/who_owns_the_federal_reserve_bank.html |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026183106/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/who_owns_the_federal_reserve_bank.html |archivedate=October 26, 2010 |df=mdy }}http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/banking/federal_reserve_membership | title=Federal Reserve Membership | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | date= | accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monetary policy==
{{Further|Monetary policy of the United States}}

The term "[[monetary policy]]" refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national economic goals. What happens to money and credit affects interest rates (the cost of credit) and the performance of an economy. The [[Federal Reserve Act of 1913]] gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States.&lt;ref name="mp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm | title= Federal Open Market Committee | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 22, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mpb"&gt;[http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm Federal Reserve Education – Monetary Policy Basics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105153340/http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/basics_print.htm |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interbank lending===
The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the [[federal funds rate]], which is the rate of interbank lending of [[excess reserves]]. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the [[interbank lending market|interbank market]] and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three "tools" of monetary policy described in the [[Federal Reserve System#Monetary policy|''Tools'' section]] below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve summarized its monetary policy in 2005:

{{quote|The Federal Reserve implements U.S. monetary policy by affecting conditions in the market for balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve Banks...By conducting [[open market operations]], imposing reserve requirements, permitting depository institutions to hold contractual clearing balances, and extending credit through its discount window facility, the Federal Reserve exercises considerable control over the demand for and supply of Federal Reserve balances and the federal funds rate. Through its control of the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve is able to foster financial and monetary conditions consistent with its monetary policy objectives.&lt;ref name="BoG 2005 pp=27"/&gt;}}

Effects on the quantity of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at lower interest rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Federal Reserve System in Action | url=http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond | accessdate=November 24, 2012 | year=2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019011327/http://www.richmondfed.org/publications/education/the_frs_in_action/ | archive-date=October 19, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main tools of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the amount of reserves in private banks:&lt;ref name="mp" /&gt;

|[[Open market operations]]
|Purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities{{nsmdns}}the Federal Reserve's principal tool for implementing monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's objective for open market operations has varied over the years. During the 1980s, the focus gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the [[federal funds rate]] (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed), a process that was largely complete by the end of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm |title= Monetary Policy, Open Market Operations |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413160651/http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm |archivedate=April 13, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal funds rate and open market operations====
{{Further|Open market operations|money creation|federal funds rate}}
[[File:Federal funds rate history and recessions.jpg|frameless|upright=2.75|right]]

The Federal Reserve System implements [[monetary policy]] largely by targeting the [[federal funds rate]]. This is the [[interest rate]] that banks charge each other for overnight loans of [[federal funds]], which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.

Open market operations allow the Federal Reserve to increase or decrease the amount of money in the banking system as necessary to balance the Federal Reserve's dual mandates. Open market operations are done through the sale and purchase of [[United States Treasury security]], sometimes called "Treasury bills" or more informally "T-bills" or "Treasuries". The Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills from its primary dealers. The purchase of these securities affects the federal funds rate, because primary dealers have accounts at depository institutions.&lt;ref name="FRB of NY"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operations | publisher=New York Federal Reserve Bank |date=August 2007 | accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Reserve education website describes open market operations as follows:&lt;ref name="mpb"/&gt;

{{quote|Open market operations involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities (federal agency and mortgage-backed). The term 'open market' means that the Fed doesn't decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an 'open market' in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with{{nsmdns}}the primary dealers{{nsmdns}}compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.

Open market operations are the primary tool used to regulate the supply of bank reserves. This tool consists of Federal Reserve purchases and sales of financial instruments, usually securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, Federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Open market operations are carried out by the Domestic Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under direction from the FOMC. The transactions are undertaken with primary dealers.

The Fed's goal in trading the securities is to affect the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. When the Fed wants to increase reserves, it buys securities and pays for them by making a deposit to the account maintained at the Fed by the primary dealer's bank. When the Fed wants to reduce reserves, it sells securities and collects from those accounts. Most days, the Fed does not want to increase or decrease reserves permanently so it usually engages in transactions reversed within a day or two. That means that a reserve injection today could be withdrawn tomorrow morning, only to be renewed at some level several hours later. These short-term transactions are called repurchase agreements (repos){{nsmdns}}the dealer sells the Fed a security and agrees to buy it back at a later date.}}

=====Repurchase agreements=====
{{Further|Repurchase agreement}}

To smooth temporary or cyclical changes in the money supply, the desk engages in [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On the day of the transaction, the Fed deposits money in a [[Primary dealers|primary dealer's]] reserve account, and receives the promised securities as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the [[primary dealer]]'s reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html | title=Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of New York | website=Ny.frb.org |date=August 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discount rate====
{{Further|Discount window}}

The Federal Reserve System also directly sets the "discount rate", which is the interest rate for "discount window lending", overnight loans that member banks borrow directly from the Fed. This rate is generally set at a rate close to 100 [[basis point]]s above the target federal funds rate. The idea is to encourage banks to seek alternative funding before using the "discount rate" option.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco( 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent operation by the [[European Central Bank]] is referred to as the "[[marginal lending facility]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Patricia S. Pollard| journal = Review| title = A Look Inside Two Central Banks: The European Central Bank And The Federal Reserve| volume = 85| issue = 2|date=February 2003| oclc = 1569030| doi = 10.3886/ICPSR01278| pages = 11–30| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the discount rate and the federal funds rate influence the [[prime rate]], which is usually about 3 percentage points higher than the federal funds rate.

====Reserve requirements====
Another instrument of monetary policy adjustment employed by the Federal Reserve System is the fractional [[reserve requirement]], also known as the required reserve ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required reserve ratio sets the balance that the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks,&lt;ref name="BoG 2005 pp=27"&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The required reserve ratio is set by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2005 | pp=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.&lt;ref name="hist_resreq"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/0693lead.pdf | first=Joshua N. | last=Feinman | title=Reserve Requirements: History, Current Practice, and Potential Reform | format=PDF | journal=[[Federal Reserve Bulletin]] | pages=569–589 |date=June 1993 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve now makes interest payments on depository institutions' required and excess reserve balances. The payment of interest on excess reserves gives the central bank greater opportunity to address credit market conditions while maintaining the federal funds rate close to the target rate set by the FOMC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/20081006a.htm | title=  Board announces that it will begin to pay interest on depository institutions required and excess reserve balances | publisher=Federal Reserve | date=October 6, 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New facilities====
In order to address problems related to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and [[United States housing bubble]], several new tools have been created. The first new tool, called the [[Term Auction Facility]], was added on December 12, 2007. It was first announced as a temporary tool&lt;ref name="taffaq"/&gt; but there have been suggestions that this new tool may remain in place for a prolonged period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20071221b.htm | title= Federal Reserve intends to continue term TAF auctions as necessary | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=December 21, 2007 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation of the second new tool, called the [[Term Securities Lending Facility]], was announced on March 11, 2008.&lt;ref name="tslfannounce"&gt;{{cite web | title= Announcement of the creation of the Term Securities Lending Facility | url=http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080311a.htm | publisher=Federal Reserve | date=March 11, 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities Lending Facility is used to inject [[Treasury security|treasury securities]] into the banking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a6aFI7RKVhEA&amp;refer=news | title=Fed Seeks to Limit Slump by Taking Mortgage Debt | date=March 12, 2008 | publisher=bloomberg.com}} "The step goes beyond past initiatives because the Fed can now inject liquidity without flooding the banking system with cash...Unlike the newest tool, the past steps added cash to the banking system, which affects the Fed's benchmark interest rate...By contrast, the TSLF injects liquidity by lending Treasuries, which doesn't affect the federal funds rate. That leaves the Fed free to address the mortgage crisis directly without concern about adding more cash to the system than it wants"&lt;/ref&gt; Creation of the third tool, called the [[Primary Dealer Credit Facility]] (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/markets/2008/rp080316.html | title=Federal Reserve Announces Establishment of Primary Dealer Credit Facility – Federal Reserve Bank of New York | publisher=Newyorkfed.org | date=March 16, 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now the Fed is able to lend directly to [[primary dealer]]s, which was previously against Fed policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lanman | first=Scott | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&amp;sid=a7VHAq.o6kwU | title=Fed Says Securities Firms Borrow $28.8 Bln With New Financing | publisher=Bloomberg.com | date=March 20, 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between these three new facilities is described by the Federal Reserve:&lt;ref name=pdcffaq&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/pdcf_faq.html | title=Primary Dealer Credit Facility: Frequently Asked Questions – Federal Reserve Bank of New York | publisher=Newyorkfed.org | date=February 3, 2009 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Term Auction Facility program offers term funding to depository institutions via a bi-weekly auction, for fixed amounts of credit.

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility now allows eligible primary dealers to borrow at the existing Discount Rate for up to 120 days.}}

Some measures taken by the Federal Reserve to address this mortgage crisis have not been used since the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/23664032 | title=Fed Announces Emergency Steps to Ease Credit Crisis – Economy | agency=Reuters | publisher=Cnbc.com | date=March 17, 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Reserve gives a brief summary of these new facilities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frbatlanta.org/invoke.cfm?objectid=526AFBC6-5056-9F12-120FEABD6D2ADA91&amp;method=display_body | title= Examining the Federal Reserve's New Liquidity Measures | publisher=Frbatlanta.org | date=April 15, 2008 | accessdate=August 29, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131007005910/https://frbatlanta.org/invoke.cfm?objectid=526AFBC6-5056-9F12-120FEABD6D2ADA91&amp;method=display_body | archivedate=October 7, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As the economy has slowed in the last nine months and credit markets have become unstable, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps to help address the situation. These steps have included the use of traditional monetary policy tools at the macroeconomic level as well as measures at the level of specific markets to provide additional liquidity.

The Federal Reserve's response has continued to evolve since pressure on credit markets began to surface last summer, but all these measures derive from the Fed's traditional open market operations and discount window tools by extending the term of transactions, the type of collateral, or eligible borrowers.}}

A fourth facility, the Term Deposit Facility, was announced December 9, 2009, and approved April 30, 2010, with an effective date of June 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions Policy on Payment System Risk," [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-05-05/pdf/2010-10483.pdf 75 Federal Register 86 (May 5, 2010), pp. 24384–24389.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Term Deposit Facility allows Reserve Banks to offer term deposits to institutions that are eligible to receive earnings on their balances at Reserve Banks. Term deposits are intended to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy by providing a tool by which the Federal Reserve can manage the aggregate quantity of reserve balances held by depository institutions. Funds placed in term deposits are removed from the accounts of participating institutions for the life of the term deposit and thus drain reserve balances from the banking system.

=====Term auction facility=====
{{Further|Term auction facility}}

The Term Auction Facility is a program in which the Federal Reserve auctions term funds to depository institutions.&lt;ref name="taffaq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/taffaq.htm | title=FRB: Temporary Auction Facility FAQ | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=January 12, 2009 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12, 2007, and was done in conjunction with the [[Bank of Canada]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[European Central Bank]], and the [[Swiss National Bank]] to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets.&lt;ref name="taf"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20071212a.htm | title=Announcement of the creation of the Term Auction Facility – FRB: Press Release – Federal Reserve and other central banks announce measures designed to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets | date=December 12, 2007 | publisher=federalreserve.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason it was created is that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the discount window.

The first is that, for all the fanfare, the central banks' plan will make little difference. After all, it does nothing to remove the fundamental reason why investors are worried about lending to banks.

{{quote|the Federal Reserve recently unveiled a term auction facility, or TAF, through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit can be auctioned to eligible borrowers. The goal of the TAF is to reduce the incentive for banks to hoard cash and increase their willingness to provide credit to households and firms...TAF auctions will continue as long as necessary to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets, and we will continue to work closely and cooperatively with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20080117a.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204013747/http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20080117a.htm |date=December 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also described in the ''Term Auction Facility FAQ''&lt;ref name="taffaq"/&gt;

{{quote|The TAF is a credit facility that allows a depository institution to place a bid for an advance from its local Federal Reserve Bank at an interest rate that is determined as the result of an auction. By allowing the Federal Reserve to inject term funds through a broader range of counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than open market operations, this facility could help ensure that liquidity provisions can be disseminated efficiently even when the unsecured interbank markets are under stress.

In short, the TAF will auction term funds of approximately one-month maturity. All depository institutions that are judged to be in sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow at the discount window are also eligible to participate in TAF auctions. All TAF credit must be fully collateralized. Depositories may pledge the broad range of collateral that is accepted for other Federal Reserve lending programs to secure TAF credit. The same collateral values and margins applicable for other Federal Reserve lending programs will also apply for the TAF.}}

=====Term securities lending facility=====
The Term Securities Lending Facility is a 28-day facility that will offer Treasury general collateral to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.&lt;ref name="tslffaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/tslf_faq.html|title=Term Securities Lending Facility: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Newyorkfed.org|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Term Auction Facility, the TSLF was done in conjunction with the [[Bank of Canada]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[European Central Bank]], and the [[Swiss National Bank]]. The resource allows dealers to switch debt that is less liquid for U.S. government securities that are easily tradable. The currency swap lines with the [[European Central Bank]] and [[Swiss National Bank]] were increased.

=====Primary dealer credit facility=====
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) is an overnight loan facility that will provide funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of eligible collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.&lt;ref name=pdcffaq/&gt; This new facility marks a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now [[primary dealer]]s can borrow directly from the Fed when this used to be prohibited.

=====Interest on reserves=====
{{Main|Interest_on_excess_reserves#In_the_United_States_.282008-.29|l1 = Interest on excess reserves in the United States}}

{{As of|2008|10}}, the Federal Reserve banks will pay interest on reserve balances (required and excess) held by depository institutions. The rate is set at the lowest federal funds rate during the reserve maintenance period of an institution, less 75[[basis point|bp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm | title=Interest on Required Reserve Balances and Excess Balances | publisher=Federal Reserve Board | date=October 6, 2008 | accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008|October|23}}, the Fed has lowered the spread to a mere 35 bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081022a.htm | title=Press Release | publisher=Federal Reserve Board | date=October 22, 2008 | accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Term deposit facility=====
The Term Deposit Facility is a program through which the Federal Reserve Banks will offer interest-bearing term deposits to eligible institutions. By removing "excess deposits" from participating banks, the overall level of reserves available for lending is reduced, which should result in increased market interest rates, acting as a brake on economic activity and inflation. The Federal Reserve has stated that:

{{quote| Term deposits will be one of several tools that the Federal Reserve could employ to drain reserves when policymakers judge that it is appropriate to begin moving to a less accommodative stance of monetary policy. The development of the TDF is a matter of prudent planning and has no implication for the near-term conduct of monetary policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100430a.htm | title=Federal Reserve Board approves amendments to Regulation D authorizing Reserve Banks to offer term deposits | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=April 30, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Federal Reserve initially authorized up to five "small-value offerings are designed to ensure the effectiveness of TDF operations and to provide eligible institutions with an opportunity to gain familiarity with term deposit procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100510b.htm | title=Board authorizes small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=May 10, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three of the offering auctions were successfully completed, it was announced that small-value auctions would continue on an ongoing basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100908a.htm | title=Board authorizes ongoing small-value offerings of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=September 8, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Term Deposit Facility is essentially a tool available to reverse the efforts that have been employed to provide liquidity to the financial markets and to reduce the amount of capital available to the economy. As stated in Bloomberg News:

{{quote| Policy makers led by Chairman Ben S. Bernanke are preparing for the day when they will have to start siphoning off more than $1 trillion in excess reserves from the banking system to contain inflation. The Fed is charting an eventual return to normal monetary policy, even as a weakening near-term outlook has raised the possibility it may expand its balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Zumbrun | first = Joshua | title = Fed to Sell Term Deposits to Ensure Exit 'Readiness' | work = Bloomberg | date = September 8, 2010 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-08/fed-to-sell-5-billion-of-term-deposits-to-ensure-readiness-.html | accessdate = September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before House Committee on Financial Services, described the Term Deposit Facility and other facilities to Congress in the following terms:

{{quote| Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....

As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.

When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1087 Testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services regarding "Unwinding Emergency Federal Reserve Liquidity Programs and Implications for Economic Recovery."

=====Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility=====
The Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (ABCPMMMFLF) was also called the AMLF. The Facility began operations on September 22, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/abcpmmmf.htm | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | accessdate=May 27, 2010 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies (parent companies or U.S. broker-dealer affiliates), or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks were eligible to borrow under this facility pursuant to the discretion of the FRBB.

Collateral eligible for pledge under the Facility was required to meet the following criteria:
* was purchased by Borrower on or after September 19, 2008 from a registered investment company that held itself out as a money market mutual fund;
* was purchased by Borrower at the Fund's acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount on the ABCP through the date of its purchase by Borrower;
* was rated at the time pledged to FRBB, not lower than A1, F1, or P1 by at least two major rating agencies or, if rated by only one major rating agency, the ABCP must have been rated within the top rating category by that agency;
* was issued by an entity organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof under a program that was in existence on September 18, 2008; and
* had stated maturity that did not exceed 120 days if the Borrower was a bank or 270 days for non-bank Borrowers.

=====Commercial Paper Funding Facility=====
On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further expanded the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper using the new [[Commercial Paper Funding Facility]] (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy as much of the debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market {{as of|2008|October|1|lc=y}}, according to the most recent data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081007/financial_meltdown.html Fed Action]   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216044105/http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081007/financial_meltdown.html |date=December 16, 2008 }}https://web.archive.org/web/20151015224731/http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081007/financial_meltdown.html&lt;/ref&gt; This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilson | first=Linus |last2=Wu |first2=Yan | title=Does Receiving TARP Funds Make it Easier to Roll Your Commercial Paper Onto the Fed? | date=August 22, 2011 | ssrn=1911454 | publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quantitative policy====
A little-used tool of the Federal Reserve is the ''quantitative policy''. With that the Federal Reserve actually buys back corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities held by banks or other financial institutions. This in effect puts money back into the financial institutions and allows them to make loans and conduct normal business.
The bursting of the [[United States housing bubble]] prompted the Fed to buy mortgage-backed securities for the first time in November 2008. Over six weeks, a total of $1.25 trillion were purchased in order to stabilize the housing market, about one-fifth of all U.S. government-backed mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=129451895 | title=Federal Reserve Mortgage Purchase Program: Planet Money | publisher=NPR | date=August 26, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central banking in the United States, 1791–1913===
{{Main|History of central banking in the United States}}

The first attempt at a national currency was during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1775, the Continental Congress, as well as the states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills "[[Early American currency|Continentals]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uscurrency.gov/history-american-currency|title=Timeline of U.S. Currency History|publisher=U.S. Currency Education Program|accessdate = June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. Overprinting, as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp | title="Mr. Govr. MORRIS moved to strike out "and emit bills on the credit of the U. States" – If the United States had credit such bills would be unnecessary: if they had not, unjust &amp; useless. ...

Geo. ay." | publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu | date= | accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states' ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28.&lt;ref&gt;US Constitution Article 1, Section 10. "no state shall ..emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, the government granted the [[First Bank of the United States]] a charter to operate as the U.S. central bank until 1811.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Our Nation's Paper Money"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.frbsf.org/publications/federalreserve/annual/1995/history.html | title=1995 Annual Report: A Brief History of Our Nation's Paper Money | last=Flamme | first=Karen | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco | accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Bank of the United States came to an end under [[James Madison|President Madison]] because Congress refused to renew its charter. The [[Second Bank of the United States]] was established in 1816, and lost its authority to be the central bank of the U.S. twenty years later under [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]] when its charter expired. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=EkUTaZofJYEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA25,M1 | publisher=Ayer Publishing | year=1978 | title=British Parliamentary reports on international finance: the Cunliffe Committee and the Macmillan Committee reports | isbn=978-0-405-11212-6 | quote=description of the founding of Bank of England: 'Its foundation in 1694 arose out the difficulties of the Government of the day in securing subscriptions to State loans. Its primary purpose was to raise and lend money to the State and in consideration of this service it received under its Charter and various Act of Parliament, certain privileges of issuing bank notes. The corporation commenced, with an assured life of twelve years after which the Government had the right to annul its Charter on giving one year's notice. Subsequent extensions of this period coincided generally with the grant of additional loans to the State'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a third national bank, known as the Federal Reserve, was established in 1913 and still exists to this day.

====First Central Bank, 1791 and Second Central Bank, 1816====
The first U.S. institution with central banking responsibilities was the [[First Bank of the United States]], chartered by Congress and signed into law by President [[George Washington]] on February 25, 1791, at the urging of [[Alexander Hamilton]]. This was done despite strong opposition from [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], among numerous others. The charter was for twenty years and expired in 1811 under President Madison, because Congress refused to renew it.&lt;ref name="boshistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/about/pubs/begin.pdf |title=Historical Beginnings... The Federal Reserve |last=Johnson |first=Roger |date=December 1999 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston |page=8 |accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, however, Madison revived it in the form of the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Years later, early renewal of the bank's charter became the primary issue in the reelection of President [[Andrew Jackson]]. After Jackson, who was opposed to the central bank, was reelected, he pulled the government's funds out of the bank. Jackson was the only President to completely pay off the debt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123491373049303821 pay off the national debt] WSJ&lt;/ref&gt; The bank's charter was not renewed in 1836.
From 1837 to 1862, in the [[Free Banking Era]] there was no formal central bank.
From 1846 to 1921, an [[Independent Treasury System]] ruled.
From 1863 to 1913, a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 [[National Banking Act]] during which series of bank panics, in [[Panic of 1873|1873]], [[Panic of 1893|1893]], and [[Panic of 1907|1907]] occurred&lt;ref name="FDS-H-04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h952.html|title=Panic of 1907: J.P.

The main motivation for the third central banking system came from the [[Panic of 1907]], which caused a renewed desire among legislators, economists, and bankers for an overhaul of the monetary system.&lt;ref name="FDS-H-04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDS-H-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FDS-H-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herrickpanic"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1010701 |title=The Panic of 1907 and Some of Its Lessons |last=Herrick |first=Myron |date=March 1908 |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |volume=31 |pages=8–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of [[financial panics]].&lt;ref name="EFlaherty"/&gt; According to many economists, the previous national banking system had two main weaknesses: an [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] currency and a lack of liquidity.&lt;ref name="EFlaherty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/E/usbank/bank00.htm |title=A Brief History of Central Banking in the United States |last=Flaherty |first=Edward |date=June 16, 1997 |publisher=University of Groningen |location= Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Congress enacted the [[Aldrich–Vreeland Act]], which provided for an emergency currency and established the [[National Monetary Commission]] to study banking and currency reform.&lt;ref name="mnwarburg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/89-05/reg895d.cfm |title=Paul Warburg's Crusade to Establish a Central Bank in the United States |last=Whithouse |first=Michael |date=May 1989 |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516102112/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/89-05/reg895d.cfm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Monetary Commission returned with recommendations which were repeatedly rejected by Congress. A revision crafted during a secret meeting on [[Jekyll Island]] by Senator Aldrich and representatives of the nation's top finance and industrial groups later became the basis of the [[Federal Reserve Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jekyllislandhistory.com/federalreserve.shtml |title=For years members of the Jekyll Island Club would recount the story of the secret meeting and by the 1930s the narrative was considered a club tradition |publisher=Jekyllislandhistory.com |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/chfrs/record.php?id=5653 |title=Papers of Frank A.Vanderlip "I wish I could sit down with you and half a dozen others in the sort of conference that created the Federal Reserve Act" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House voted on December 22, 1913, with 298 voting yes to 60 voting no.

=====Federal Reserve Act, 1913=====
{{Main|Federal Reserve Act}}

[[File:Fed Reserve.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Newspaper clipping, December 24, 1913]]
The head of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leader [[Nelson Aldrich]]. Aldrich set up two commissions – one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central banking systems and report on them.&lt;ref name="mnwarburg"/&gt;

In early November 1910, Aldrich met with five well known members of the New York banking community to devise a central banking bill. [[Paul Warburg]], an attendee of the meeting and longtime advocate of central banking in the U.S., later wrote that Aldrich was "bewildered at all that he had absorbed abroad and he was faced with the difficult task of writing a highly technical bill while being harassed by the daily grind of his parliamentary duties".&lt;ref name="Warburg document"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3815 |title=Paul Warburg's Crusade to Establish a Central Bank in the United States |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ten days of deliberation, the bill, which would later be referred to as the "Aldrich Plan", was agreed upon. It had several key components, including a central bank with a Washington-based headquarters and fifteen branches located throughout the U.S. in geographically strategic locations, and a uniform elastic currency based on gold and commercial paper. Aldrich believed a central banking system with no political involvement was best, but was convinced by Warburg that a plan with no public control was not politically feasible.&lt;ref name="Warburg document"/&gt; The compromise involved representation of the public sector on the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="ecresearch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aier.org/sites/default/files/Files/Documents/Research/3328/EEB198405-REVISED1993.pdf |title=America's Unknown Enemy: Beyond Conspiracy |publisher=American Institute of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich's bill met much opposition from politicians. Critics charged Aldrich of being biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], Aldrich's son-in-law. Most Republicans favored the Aldrich Plan,&lt;ref name="ecresearch" /&gt; but it lacked enough support in Congress to pass because rural and western states viewed it as favoring the "eastern establishment".&lt;ref name="mnglass"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/88-08/reg888a.cfm |title=Born of a panic: Forming the Federal Reserve System |date=August 1988 |publisher=The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516102508/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/88-08/reg888a.cfm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/born-of-a-panic-forming-the-fed-system&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, progressive Democrats favored a reserve system owned and operated by the government; they believed that public ownership of the central bank would end Wall Street's control of the American currency supply.&lt;ref name="ecresearch" /&gt; Conservative Democrats fought for a privately owned, yet decentralized, reserve system, which would still be free of Wall Street's control.&lt;ref name="ecresearch" /&gt;

The original Aldrich Plan was dealt a fatal blow in 1912, when Democrats won the White House and Congress.&lt;ref name="Warburg document" /&gt; Nonetheless, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] believed that the Aldrich plan would suffice with a few modifications. The plan became the basis for the Federal Reserve Act, which was proposed by Senator [[Robert L. Owen|Robert Owen]] in May 1913. The primary difference between the two bills was the transfer of control of the Board of Directors (called the Federal Open Market Committee in the Federal Reserve Act) to the government.&lt;ref name="mnglass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boshistory"/&gt; The bill passed Congress on December 23, 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/17411624/Congressional-Record-Dec-22-1913-pg1465 |title=Congressional Record – House |page=1465 |publisher=Scribd.com |date=December 22, 1913 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/17234309/Congressional-Record-Dec-23-1913 |title=Congressional Record – Senate |page=1468 |publisher=Scribd.com |date=December 23, 1913 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a mostly partisan basis, with most Democrats voting "yea" and most Republicans voting "nay".&lt;ref name="boshistory" /&gt;

==Measurement of economic variables==
The Federal Reserve records and publishes large amounts of data. A few websites where data is published are at the board of governors' Economic Data and Research page,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://federalreserve.gov/econresdata/default.htm | title=FRB: Economic Research &amp; Data | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 24, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the board of governors' statistical releases and historical data page,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases | title= Statistics: Releases and Historical Data | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=May 10, 2010 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the St. Louis Fed's FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2 | title=St. Louis Fed: Economic Data – FRED | publisher=Research.stlouisfed.org | date=August 20, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Open Market Committee|Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)]] examines many economic indicators prior to determining monetary policy.&lt;ref name="eco_ind"&gt;[http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/indicators_print.htm Federal Reserve Education – Economic Indicators]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105064959/http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101_html/policy/indicators_print.htm |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticism involves economic data compiled by the Fed. The Fed sponsors much of the monetary economics research in the U.S., and [[Lawrence H. White]] objects that this makes it less likely for researchers to publish findings challenging the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=White | first=Lawrence H. |date=August 2005 | url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/the-federal-reserve-system-s-influence-on-research-in-monetary-economics | title=The Federal Reserve System's Influence on Research in Monetary Economics | journal=Econ Journal Watch | volume=2 | issue=2 | pages=325–354 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Net worth of households and nonprofit organizations===
[[File:Total Net Worth - Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations 1949-2012.jpg|thumb|Total Net Worth{{nsmdns}}Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations 1949–2012]]

The net worth of households and nonprofit organizations in the United States is published by the Federal Reserve in a report titled ''Flow of Funds''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/z1/ FRB: Z.1 Release – Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States, Release Dates] See the pdf documents from 1945 to 2007. The value for each year is on page 94 of each document (the 99th page in a pdf viewer) and duplicated on page 104 (109th page in pdf viewer). It gives the total assets, total liabilities, and net worth. This chart is of the net worth.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, this value was $64.8 trillion. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, this value was $95.5 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1r-5.pdf Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811102013/http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1r-5.pdf |date=August 11, 2014 }}, June 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Money supply===
{{Further|Money supply}}

The most common measures are named M0 (narrowest), M1, M2, and M3. In the United States they are defined by the Federal Reserve as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Measure
!Definition
|-
| M0
|The total of all physical [[currency]], plus accounts at the central bank that can be exchanged for physical currency.
|-
|M1
|M0 + those portions of M0 held as reserves or vault cash + the amount in [[demand account]]s ("checking" or "current" accounts).
|-
|M2
|M1 + most [[savings account]]s, [[money market account]]s, and small denomination time deposits ([[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]] of under $100,000).
|-
|M3
|M2 + all other CDs, deposits of [[eurodollars]] and [[repurchase agreement]]s.
|}

[[File:Components of the United States money supply2.svg|frameless|right|upright=1.8]]

The Federal Reserve stopped publishing M3 statistics in March 2006, saying that the data cost a lot to collect but did not provide significantly useful information.&lt;ref name = "prxliv"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/h6/discm3.htm | title=Discontinuance of M3 | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=November 10, 2005 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other three money supply measures continue to be provided in detail.

===Personal consumption expenditures price index===
{{Further|Personal consumption expenditures price index}}

The [[Personal consumption expenditures price index]], also referred to as simply the PCE price index, is used as one measure of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption. Using a variety of data including [[United States Consumer Price Index]] and [[U.S. Producer Price Index]] prices, it is derived from the largest component of the [[gross domestic product]] in the BEA's [[National Income and Product Accounts]], personal consumption expenditures.

One of the Fed's main roles is to maintain price stability, which means that the Fed's ability to keep a low inflation rate is a long-term measure of their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|BoG|2006 | pp=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Fed is not required to maintain inflation within a specific range, their long run target for the growth of the PCE price index is between 1.5 and 2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1033.pdf | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis | title=Is the Fed's Definition of Price Stability Evolving? | date=November 9, 2010 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been debate among policy makers as to whether the Federal Reserve should have a specific [[inflation targeting]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/Boarddocs/Speeches/2003/20030325/default.htm | title=Remarks by Governor Ben S.

====Inflation and the economy====
Most [[mainstream economists]] favor a low, steady rate of inflation.&lt;ref name="econjournalwatch.org"&gt;Hummel, Jeffrey Rogers. "Death and Taxes, Including Inflation: the Public versus Economists" (January 2007).[http://econjwatch.org/articles/death-and-taxes-including-inflation-the-public-versus-economists] p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Low (as opposed to zero or [[Deflation|negative]]) inflation may reduce the severity of economic [[recession]]s by enabling the labor market to adjust more quickly in a downturn, and reduce the risk that a [[liquidity trap]] prevents [[monetary policy]] from stabilizing the economy.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20121206000206/http://www.atypon-link.com/AEAP/doi/abs/10.1257/089533003772034934 Escaping from a Liquidity Trap and Deflation: The Foolproof Way and Others]" Lars E.O. Svensson, ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Volume 17, Issue 4
Fall 2003, pp. 145–166&lt;/ref&gt; The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to [[monetary authority|monetary authorities]].

===Unemployment rate===
{{Further|Unemployment rate#United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|List of U.S. states by unemployment rate}}

[[File:US Seasonal Unemployment.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|United States unemployment rates 1975{{ndash}}2010 showing variance between the fifty states]]

One of the stated goals of monetary policy is maximum employment. The unemployment rate statistics are collected by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], and like the PCE price index are used as a barometer of the nation's economic health.

==Budget==
The Federal Reserve is self-funded. The vast majority (90%+) of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically the interest on the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as "capital gains/losses" that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and discount window loans.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Fed – Demonstrating Knowledge of the Fed: {{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/education_resources/files/Demonstrating_Knowledge.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528063259/http://www.chicagofed.org/education_resources/files/Demonstrating_Knowledge.ppt |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The board of governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses as well as the net profit or loss is the large report simply titled, "Annual Report". It also includes data about employment throughout the system. The other report, which explains in more detail the expenses of the different aspects of the whole system, is called "Annual Report: Budget Review". These detailed comprehensive reports can be found at the board of governors' website under the section "Reports to Congress"&lt;ref name=budget&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/default.htm | title= A–Z Listing of Board Publications | publisher=Federalreserve.gov | date=August 10, 2011 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance sheet===
{{Outdated section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Federal Reserve total assets.png|upright=3.65|thumb|center|Federal Reserve total assets, treasuries, and mortages]]

One of the keys to understanding the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve balance sheet (or [[Balance sheet|balance statement]]). In accordance with Section 11 of the [[Federal Reserve Act]], the [[board of governors]] of the Federal Reserve System publishes once each week the "Consolidated Statement of Condition of All Federal Reserve Banks" showing the condition of each Federal Reserve bank and a consolidated statement for all Federal Reserve banks. The board of governors requires that excess earnings of the Reserve Banks be transferred to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual08/pdf/AR08.pdf | title=96th Annual Report 2008 Federal Reserve | publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | format=PDF |date=June 2009 | accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="balance sheet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current | title=Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks | accessdate=March 20, 2008 | publisher=Federal Reserve }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flight permits''' are permits or permission required by an [[aircraft]] to overfly, land or make a [[wiktionary:technical stop|technical stop]] in any country's [[airspace]]. All countries have their own regulations regarding the issuance of flight permits as there is generally a payment involved. The charges normally payable would be the ''Route Navigation Facility Charges or RNFC'' for [[Freedoms of the air#First freedom|overflights]] and also landing and parking charges in case of aircraft making halts. The procedure for issuance of these permits also varies from country to country. More details regarding these can be taken from the respective country's civil aviation websites.

==Categories==&lt;!-- "Overflight permit" redirects to this section; if section title is changed, change the redirect too --&gt;
* An '''overflight permit''' is an authorisation to enter the sovereign airspace (12&amp;nbsp;nm limit) of a given country, overfly, and exit it.  The issuing of an overflight permit confirms that there is no political or security objection to your airline, aircraft, or country of origin/ destination, and that there are no outstanding navigation fees due to the ATC authority. Under the [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation]] all contracting states permit overflight by other states, but for most [[national aviation authority|national aviation authorities]], prior approval is required in the form of an overflight permit.
* A '''landing permit''' is an authorisation to land at a given airport, and in addition to the above, confirms there are no safety or noise objections to your aircraft type, and no commercial objection if you are operating the flight for revenue.
* A '''special permit''' is required where the aircraft is not being operated on a normal certificate of airworthiness and requires approval from the Ministry of Transport.
* A '''diplomatic permit''' is required where the aircraft concerned is government or military. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country for which you are overflying generally issues diplomatic permits.

Most countries accept applications directly from the airlines and/or their agents appointed in the respective countries. The charges for the overflying and landing are normally billed to the operators or their agents by the respective national aviation authority responsible for maintaining and operating all the ground to air communications facilities in its region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAA Foreign Airspace restrictions|url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{trade bloc}}
'''Government procurement''' or '''public procurement''' is the [[procurement]] of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]] and [[construction]] on behalf of a public authority, such as a [[government]] agency. With 10 to 20% of [[GDP]], government procurement accounts for a substantial part of the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/govpro.html Global Trade Negotiations Home Page] at [[Harvard University]], accessed 18 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent [[fraud]], [[waste]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], or local [[protectionism]], the laws of most countries regulate government procurement to some extent. Laws usually require the procuring authority to issue public [[Call for bids|tenders]] if the value of the procurement exceeds a certain threshold.

Government procurement is also the subject of the [[Agreement on Government Procurement]] (GPA), a [[plurilateral]] international treaty under the auspices of the [[WTO]].

==Overview==

=== Need for government procurement ===
Government procurement is necessary because governments cannot produce all the inputs for the goods they provide themselves. Governments usually provide [[public good]]s, e.g. national defense or public infrastructure. Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable, which means that one individual's consumption does not diminish the quantity or quality of the commodity available to others, and individuals cannot be prevented from freely consuming the commodity, or [[Free-rider problem|"free-riding"]]. Consequently, private markets cannot provide public goods. Instead the government provides those goods and finances them by raising taxes from all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/712588185|title=Economics|last=Mankiw|first=Nicholas Gregory|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|others=Taylor, Mark P. 1958-|year=|isbn=9781844808700|edition= 2nd|location=Andover|pages=223–226|oclc=712588185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public goods, governments often also provide [[merit good]]s, such as education or health care. Merit goods are [[private good]]s which are rival and excludable and are therefore provided by private markets. Nevertheless, governments also provide merit goods because of reasons of [[Equity (economics)|equity]] and fairness and because they have [[Externality|positive externalities]] for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39485400|title=Economics of the Public Sector|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|date=2000|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=0393966518|edition= 3rd|location=New York|pages=86–88|oclc=39485400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to provide public and merit goods, the government has to buy input factors from private companies, e.g. police cars, school buildings, uniforms etc. This process is called government or public procurement.

=== Problems ===
Government procurement involves a high risk of [[corruption]] because of the great size of financial turnover and the complexitiy of many procurement processes in which businesses interact very closely with politicians and civil servants. Often the personal interests of the public officials are not the same as the interests of the public. Such a conflict of interest problem, known as the [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent-problem]], increases the risk of corruption. According to [[OECD]], the highest percentage of bribery cases occur in the area of public procurement to influence the awarding of public contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/Corruption-Public-Procurement-Brochure.pdf|title=Preventing Corruption in Public Procurement|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=OECD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption in public procurement causes inefficiencies and high costs to the public. In order to prevent corruption and to ensure transparency and competition among suppliers, public procurement is subject to legal regulation.

===Scope===
Government procurement regulations normally cover all [[public works]], services and supply contracts entered into by a public authority. However, there may be exceptions. These most notably cover [[military acquisition]]s, which account for large parts of government expenditures. The GPA and EU procurement law allow of exceptions where public tendering would violate a country's essential security interests. Additionally, certain politically or economically sensitive sectors, such as public health, energy supply or public transport, may also be treated differently.&lt;ref name="Prieß: Global Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prieß|first=Hans-Joachim|author2=Harvey, Diana|author3=Friton, Pascal|title=Global Overview|journal=Prieß (2012)|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
The procedure of government procurement in Brazil is regulated for a lot of different laws with different procedures depending on the importance and the value of the procurement. The most important law about government procurement which contains basic rules of public procurements and administrative contracts is the Law nº 8.666, 21 june 1993, which contains rules for public tenders and for restricted tenders. There are other different rules to regulate procurement public services, as Law nº 8.987, 13 february 1995 (Concession and Permission of Public Services); Law nº 12.462, 4 august 2011 (Differentiated Procurement - RDC in portuguese) and Law nº 10.520, 17 july 2002, with deal with presential auction. In the internet field (e-procurement) there are executive orders (Decretos) which regulate public procurement as Decree nº 5.450, 31 may 2005 and Decree nº 7.982, 23 january 2013. This latter regulates the procedure of specific situations of sharing acquisitions of goods or under portioned deliverings.&lt;ref&gt;All information can be found in https://www.comprasgovernamentais.gov.br/index.php/legislacao&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Public procurement in Canada is regulated on various governmental levels (federal, provincial, municipal). Most federal procurement is organized by the [[Public Services and Procurement Canada]] (PSPC) agency and is governed by their Code of Conduct of Procurement in combination with principles laid out in the Federal Accountability Act and in the Financial Administration Act. Public procurement is guided by the principles of fairness, transparency, openness, and non-discrimination and complies with all international agreements that Canada is a member of (WTO [[Agreement on Government Procurement|Government Procurement Agreement]] [GPA], [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]], and various bilateral FTAs). Foreign suppliers from member nations to these agreements can bid on Canadian government procurements and are treated the same as domestic suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/cndt-cndct/contexte-context-eng.html|title=Code of Conduct for Procurement.

The principal statutory provisions regulating government procurement are:

*Department of Public Works and Government Services Act (1996)
*Financial Administration Act (1985) and the Government Contracts Regulations &lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html Government Contracts Regulations], accessed 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
*Defence Production Act 1985 (consolidated version published 2011) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=207971 Defence Production Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. D-1) (consolidated version of January 30, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, bids must be solicited by the procuring department unless estimated expenditure does not exceed $25,000, or $100,000 "where the contract is for the acquisition of architectural, engineering and other services required in respect of the planning, design, preparation or supervision of the construction, repair, renovation or restoration of a work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/page-2.html#docCont Government Contracts Regulation 6b], accessed 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; For contracts above $25,000, tenders are published on the transparent Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). A non-competitive procurement process is only used in certain special circumstances. One such area of exception are security-related procurements. In that case the Defence Production Act applies, which allows using a special process and favouring domestic suppliers in acquiring defence supplies and conducting defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://buyandsell.gc.ca/for-businesses/selling-to-the-government-of-canada/the-procurement-process|title=The Procurement Process|last=Engagement|first=Government of Canada, Public Works and Government Services Canada, Acquisitions Branch, Office of Small and Medium Enterprises and Strategic|website=buyandsell.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Timor===
The Ministry of Finance in [[East Timor]] or Timor-Leste is responsible for the oversight of government procurement.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Finance, [https://www.mof.gov.tl/government-procurement/?lang=en Procurement], accessed 13 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Government uses the Timor-Leste eProcurement Portal  for purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eprocurement.gov.tl/public/indexeprtl?&amp;lang=en Timor-Leste eProcurement Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopia===
Government procurement in [[Ethiopia]] is governed by the Ethiopian Federal Government Procurement and Property Administration Proclamation No.649/2009,&lt;ref name=Eth&gt;[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4f0l6J9WQrBYzNmZmJiZjEtYjkyYS00NjhiLWFkMmEtOTA5NjdjMTdkNGEz/view Ethiopian Federal Government Procurement and Property Administration Proclamation], 9 September 2009, accessed 6 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which replaced the proclamation on Procedures of Public Procurement and Establishing its Supervisory Agency, Proclamation No. 430/2005. The Public Procurement
and Property Administration Agency advises the federal government on "on all public procurement and property administration policies, principles and implementation" and provides "technical assistance to the regional governments and city administrations".&lt;ref name=Eth /&gt;

===European Union===
{{Main|Government procurement in the European Union}}
Government procurement in the European Union accounts for more than EUR 2.2 trillion, or 14% of the EU GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement_en|title=Public Procurement - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been regulated and harmonized by [[European Union law|community law]] since the 1970s in order to guarantee transparency and non-discrimination of EU companies in government procurement in all member states. EU laws apply only to tenders that exceed certain thresholds in value. These thresholds vary depending on the area the contract is for and if the procurement is done by a central government or by other public authorities (e.g. municipal government). National laws are applied for tenders below these threshold values.&lt;ref name="Rules &amp; procedures"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/public-tenders/rules-procedures/index_en.htm|title=Rules &amp; procedures|website=Your Europe - Business|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant EU Directives regarding government procurement currently in force are [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1415011920358&amp;uri=CELEX:32009L0081 Directive 2009/81], [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0024 Directive 2014/24], and [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014L0025 Directive 2014/25].

There are five different procedures for public procurement:&lt;ref name="Rules &amp; procedures"/&gt;

*Open procedure: any company is allowed to submit a tender
*Restricted procedure: only companies that have been preselected are allowed to submit a tender
*Negotiated procedure: there are direct negotiations with at least three companies
*Competitive dialogue: if it is not possible to define technical specifications at the beginning, a competitive dialogue with at least three companies is started after which tenders can be submitted. This procedure is applied for complex procurements.
*Electronic auctions: companies that pass a pre-evaluation process can bid in electronic auctions for public contracts

The European Commission is working on further improving efficiency and transparency in government procurement in the EU with its current public procurement strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/strategy_en|title=Public procurement strategy - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
Government procurement in [[Austria]] is regulated by the Federal Procurement Act 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Stalzer, J., [https://www.schoenherr.eu/publications/publication-detail/austria-imminent-implementation-of-public-procurement-directives/ Austria: Imminent implementation of public procurement directives], accessed 14 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium|Belgian]] legislation on public procurement is set out in the Act of 17 June 2016 implementing the 2014 EU procurement directives.&lt;ref&gt;International Comparative Legal Guide, [https://iclg.com/practice-areas/public-procurement-laws-and-regulations/belgium Public Procurement 2018: Belgium], accessed 27 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of 17 June 2016 on public procurement and on concession contracts, and the Law of 16 February 2017 on remedies, failed to meet the EU's transposition deadline (18 April 2016). [[Royal order (Belgium)|Royal Decree]]s issued on 18 April 2017 for general public procurement, 18 June 2017 for procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, 22 June 2017 containing new rules on the performance of public works contracts and concession contracts for public works and 25 June 2017, for the award and performance of concession contracts, have augmented the earlier laws.&lt;ref name=vbb&gt;Van Bael and Bellis, [https://www.vbb.com/media/Insights_Articles/VBB_Memorandum_Public_Procurement_27_07_2017.pd.pdf New Belgian Regulatory Framework Governing Public Procurement – Overview of Main Novelties], accessed 29 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 51 of the Royal Decree of 18 April 2017 includes a "revolving door mechanism", which targets the situation where a person previously working for a contracting authority is now being employed by an economic operator involved in a public procurement procedure established by that contracting authority. In this type of situation the person would be presumed to have a [[conflict of interest]] for a two-year period following the termination of his/her employment with the contracting authority.&lt;ref name=vbb /&gt;

==== Germany ====
In Germany, the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie'', abbreviated BMWi) is responsible for defining laws and principles regarding public procurement. In 2016 Germany transposed the new EU Directives of 2014 into domestic law. Thereby, processes and contracts in public procurement have become easier and more flexible. The Act against Restraints of Competition - Part IV (German: ''[[:de:Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen|Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen]]'', abbreviated GWB) and the Ordinance on the Award of Public Contracts (German: [[:de:Vergabeverordnung|V''erordnung über die Vergabe öffentlicher Aufträge'']], abbreviated VgV) regulate procurement above EU thresholds. Detailed procedures are specified in further regulations, e.g. the Procurement Regulation for Public Works (German abbreviation: [[:de:Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Bauleistungen|VOB]]), the Procurement Regulation for Public Supplies and Services ([[:de:Vergabe- und Vertragsordnung für Leistungen|VOL]]), and the Procurement Regulation for Professional Services ([[:de:Vergabeordnung für freiberufliche Leistungen|VOF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Dossier/public-procurement.html|title=Public Procurement|last=|first=|date=|website=Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many contracts electronic procurement is made possible via an [https://www.evergabe-online.de/start.html?0 online platform].

For public procurement below the EU thresholds there are different regulations. At the federal level national budgetary law applies while the 16 federal German states and some municipalities have their own public procurement laws and regulations. This decentralized system reflects the political decentralization in Germany. However, sub-national level procurement regulations often take national regulations as examples and also ensure competition, non-discrimination, and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/de.pdf|title=Public Procurement - Germany Country Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
Law 4412/2016 on public procurement and Law 4413/2016 on concessions are the main instruments of [[Greece|Greek]] legislation governing public procurement. These two laws of 2016, along with earlier reforms introduced under Law 4281/2014 on public procurement law, have radically simplified the previously complex legal regime, repealing numerous previous laws.&lt;ref&gt;International Comparative Legal Guides, [https://iclg.com/practice-areas/public-procurement-laws-and-regulations/greece Public Procurement 2018: Greece], published 26 January 2018, accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission's profile for [[Greece]] in its study of administrative capacity in the EU had described the public procurement system in the country as "singularly complex, ... being dispersed among as many as 400 laws, regulations, and presidential decrees".&lt;ref name=profile&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/el.pdf Public procurement – Study on administrative capacity in the EU: Greece Country Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Public contract notices are published in the Central Electronic Registry for Public Procurement (KIMDIS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/WorkingGroups/workinggroup4/2016-August-22-24/Contributions_NV/Greece_EN.pdf Hellenic Single Public Procurement Authority], accessed 6 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
Public procurement in [[Italy]] is primarily regulated by the Public Contracts Code, which is administered by the [[Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport (Italy)|Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: Ministero delle infrastrutture e dei trasporti). The code was reformed in 2016 to implement the new EU directives of 2014 into domestic Italian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mit.gov.it/en/comunicazione/news/new-public-procurement-and-concession-contracts-code-has-entered-force|title=The new Public Procurement and Concession Contracts Code has entered into force {{!}} mit|last=|first=|date=2016-04-15|website=www.mit.gov.it|publisher=Italian Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the code, guidelines from the [[National Anti-Corruption Authority (Italy)|National Anti-Corruption Authority]] (Italian: ''Autorità Nazionale AntiCorruzione,'' abbreviated ANAC) and decrees from various ministries also apply to public procurement. Most public procurement on a national level is administered by the state-owned company [[Consip|Consip S.p.A.]] Larger regions have their own agencies for public purchasing.

The five regions with special autonomy ([[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]], [[Aosta Valley|Valle d’Aosta]]) can also establish regional legislation regarding public procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/sources/policy/how/improving-investment/public-procurement/study/country_profile/it.pdf|title=Public procurement - Italy Country Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public procurement is regulated by the Law N°12/2007 of 27/03/2007 on public procurement &lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°8 of 15/04/2007&lt;/ref&gt; which was modified and complemented by the Law N°05/20013 of 13/02/2013.&lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°16 of 22/04/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The law is implemented by a Ministerial Order N°001/14/10/TC of 19/02/2014 establishing Regulations on Public Procurement, Standard Bidding Documents and Standard Contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°10 of 10/03/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Rwanda has a decentralized public procurement system whereby procuring entities (central government organs, local government entities, government projects, commissions, public institutions, parastatals, agencies or any other government entity charged by the Chief Budget Manager to manage public funds) have the power to conduct directly their public procurement process. The main mission of RPPA is (1) to process the establishment and improvement of public procurement legal framework, (2) provide public procurement legal advisory services, (3) conduct audit and monitoring of public procurement activities carried out by procuring entities(tender award and contract management) and (4) build the capacity of public officials involved in public procurement activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rppa.gov.rw Rwanda Public Procurement Authority]&lt;/ref&gt;

In that connection, the legal framework provides for the Independent Review Panels at National Level (National Independent Review Panel) and at District Level (Independent Review Panel at District Level).&lt;ref&gt;Article 14 of the Law N°05/2013 OF 13/02/2013 modifying and complementing the Law N°12/2007 of 27/03/2007 on public procurement&lt;/ref&gt; The Independent Review Panels are composed of members from the Private Sector, Civil Society and the Public Sector, and the members from the Public Sector cannot form the majority of members of the Panel. The Independent Review Panel at National Level is under the supervision of the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning whereas the Independent Review Panel at District Level is under the supervision of the District Council.

In order to make the procurement sector a profession in Rwanda, there is an Association of Procurement Professionals which was established by the Law N°011/2016 of 02/05/2016.&lt;ref&gt;Published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda, N°21 of 23/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6397">'''Legal opportunism''' is a wide area of human activity, which refers generally to a type of abuse of the ''proper intention'' of legal arrangements (the "spirit of the law" as distinguished from the letter of the law). More specifically, it refers to deliberately manipulating legal arrangements for purposes they were not meant for, guided by self-interested motives.

Usually, legal opportunism is understood to occur ''legally'': it is itself not necessarily a "crime" (a violation of the law or an unlawful act), but it could be considered "immoral" ("there ought to be a law against it"). The general effect of legal opportunism, if it really occurs, is that it discredits the [[rule of law]] or destroys the legitimacy of particular legal rules in the eyes of the people affected by them. Inversely, if people perceive a legal framework as arbitrary, obstructive or irrelevant, they are tempted to search for opportunities to find ways "around the law", without formally ''breaking'' the law.

Typical of legal opportunists is that they accept or approve of the application of legal rules when it suits their own interest but reject or disapprove of the application when the rules are against their interest (or if taking self-interested action would mean ''breaking'' the law).&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Brylak, "Legal awareness and access to law". University of Warsaw, c. 2007, p. 5. [http://www.compete.pl/paper/brylak-text.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law should serve them, and not the other way around; or, there is "one rule for them, and another rule for other people."

Often, legal opportunism is enabled because a rule must be ''interpreted'' in order to ''apply'' it (i.e., how exactly it applies in the given situation is not self-evident or obvious), where the chosen interpretation is precisely the one that favours one's self-interest. If a situation is governed by many different and possibly conflicting rules, some choices may be possible in deciding exactly ''which'' rule  applies. The opportunist then picks the option that suits himself. It may be that the original circumstances a rule was intended for have changed, so that the rule in reality gains a different significance from what it originally had—creating an ambiguity that some could exploit opportunistically.

Since there are many dubious ways to manipulate the applicability of legal rules and procedures for selfish purposes, a ''general'' definition of legal opportunism (one which covers all cases) is exceptionally difficult. All the types of opportunism mentioned in this article may appear in a specifically ''legal'' form. Legal opportunism can involve practices such as the following:

*Making or changing laws not for the good of the country as a whole, but to benefit a particular interest group in the country.
*Making or changing laws, primarily to benefit the position of the lawmakers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"It should be no surprise that when rich men take control of the government, they pass laws that are favorable to themselves. The surprise is that those who are not rich vote for such people, even though they should know from bitter experience that the rich will continue to rip off the rest of us. Perhaps the reason is that rich men are very clever at covering up what they do." - [[Andrew Greeley]], "U.S. should try to reduce income disparity". ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', 18 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applying or referring to legal procedures not for the sake of obtaining justice (or so that justice is served), but mainly with the aim of making money out of it, or promote one’s own position, or to place competitors at a disadvantage.
*Exploiting legal loopholes or ambiguities for personal gain or to the advantage of a particular organization.
*In some cases, "tinkering with" bad legislation, formalities or rulings "after the fact": after it is proved that a legal rule previously established is definitely unjust, wrong, inapplicable, mistaken etc. or incriminating someone using a new rule adopted only after the alleged crime was committed.
*Deliberately "embellishing" selective evidence relevant to a legal situation, to benefit one's own position, in ways that are not strictly illegal.
*Trying to sway legal opinion about a case by using arguments or utterances that appeal to the audience, but have substantively nothing to do with the case at hand.
*"Cherry-picking" pieces of evidence, rules or precedents to construct a justification for the policy option that favour's one's own interest.

It should be noted, that in an [[adversarial system]] all kinds of tactics can be legitimately used by lawyers in a self-interested way to help them win their case, without being illegal. Therefore, to ''prove'' "legal opportunism" as a specific form of ''abuse'' of the legal process, for some selfish purpose, can be quite a challenge.

Normally, a modern system of law assumes, that citizens as legal subjects all have the same legal status before the law, and that the law is applied uniformly to all citizens in the same way, under the same circumstances. However,

*There can always be differences about the interpretation of the exact meaning, purpose, intent and application of laws in particular situations.
*Rules can be constructed in ways that are formally the same for everyone but really advantage some and disadvantage others.
*There may be new and novel situations where the law's applicability is unclear.
*The combination of different systems of rules can create unforeseen consequences or uncertainty about how to apply the rules, or about which rule applies in a given case.
*A legal rule, although enacted in a statute, may state or imply a principle that is impossible to enforce systematically for some reason, with the effect that people follow their own interpretation in a self-interested way without penalty.

All of these make possible an opportunist exploitation of legal frameworks by legal subjects, for self-interested motives ''without'' necessarily violating any legal principle, though the ''intention'' of the law (the real purpose or aim that inspired it) is negated.

'''''Lucia v. SEC''''', 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held [[administrative law judges]] of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] are considered inferior Officers of the United States and subject to the [[Appointments Clause]], and thus must be appointed through the President or other delegated officer of the United States, rather than hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ''Lucia v. SEC'', 585 U.S. ___ (2018) |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-130_4f14.pdf|publisher=U.S. Supreme Court |accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "inferior" officers, their appointments are not subject to the Senate's advice and consent role.

== Background ==
Like many other government agencies, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) uses [[administrative law judge]]s (ALJ) to act as a judge in resolving disputes for the agency related to [[administrative law]], those laws that describe how the agency is run. Prior to this case, through November 2017, the SEC had selected ALJ through an in-house hiring process, without seeking consult of the President or officers. Due to this case, as well as the election of President [[Donald Trump]] that put more pressure on the use of ALJs within the government, the SEC formally announced on November 20, 2017 it would have ALJ's appointed by its five Commissioners, as to align with the Constitution's [[Appointments Clause]] to eliminate the constitutionality question raised by this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-sec/u-s-supreme-court-takes-up-challenge-to-sec-in-house-judges-idUSKBN1F12JC | title = U.S. Supreme Court takes up challenge to SEC in-house judges | first = Andrew | last =Chung | date = January 12, 2018 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | publisher = [[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, investment adviser [[Ray Lucia]] promoted a retirement investment strategy called "Buckets of Money" through several seminars. The SEC believed Lucia was offering misleading information in these presentations, and charged Lucia and his investment company under the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/sep/05/sec-investigating-radio-and-tv-personality-ray-luc/ |title = SEC Investigating Radio And TV Personality Ray Lucia | date = September 5, 2012 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | work = [[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; SEC ALJ Cameron Elliot was assigned the case, and after hearings, ruled against Lucia, fining him {{USD|300,000}} and barring him for life for participating in the investment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/radio-adviser-fined/u-s-sec-fines-bars-buckets-of-money-radio-host-for-fraud-idUSL1N0FF1QW20130709 | title = U.S. SEC fines, bars 'Buckets of Money' radio host for fraud | first = Trevor | last = Hunnicutt | date = July 9, 2013 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | publisher = [[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucia appealed the case to the SEC, arguing that Elliot's position was considered an "officer of the United States" due to being able to pass judgement, and as per the Appointments Clause, must be appointed to that position by the President or other officers with delegated authority to do so; Elliot had not gone through such a process. As such, Lucia argued that Judge Elliot was not empowered to issue the ruling. The SEC rejected Lucia's claim that ALJs were officers of the United States; the ALJs used by SEC may issue decisions with significant ramifications for those charged, but these decisions are reviewed by the SEC Commissioners (who are appointed by the President) before they are approved and implemented. To the SEC, they considered that the ALJs, to fulfill their duties, only needed to be employees of the agency, as was the case with Judge Elliot, and did not need to be appointed,  and dismissed Lucia's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2015/sep/07/ticker-sec-kicks-ray-lucias-buckets-money-ploy/ | title = SEC kicks Ray Lucia's "Buckets of Money" ploy | first = Don | last =Bauder | date = September 7, 2015 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | work = [[San Diego Reader]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-court-rules-appointments-process-for-sec-judges-violated-constitution-1529592616 | title = High Court Rules Appointments Process for SEC Judges Violated Constitution | first1 = Dave | last1 = Michaels | first2 =  Brent | last2  = Kendall | date = June 21, 2018 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucia's argument was not the first time the question of ALJ's status had been raised in courts, but in at least two previous cases within the [[United States courts of appeals]] system had ruled that the question was a matter of administrative review, and not a constitutional question. Lucia's case at the SEC led one of the SEC commissioners hearing the case to question whether ALJ must be appointed or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/dealbook/constitutional-challenges-to-secs-use-of-in-house-judges.html | title = Constitutional Challenges to S.E.C.’s Use of In-House Judges | first = Peter | last = Henning | date = October 5, 2015 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucia appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], which also aligned with the SEC in that ALJs did not serve officers of the United States. Upon an ''[[en banc]]'' hearing within the Court of Appeals, the full ten-member panel was split, forcing them to issue a ''[[per curiam]]'' decision that maintained the SEC's stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-sec-judges-idUSKBN19H2EB | title = SEC wins latest round over how its judges are appointed | first = Sarah | last = Lynch | date = June 26, 2017 | accessdate  =June 21, 2018 | publisher = [[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
Lucia petitioned to the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari in July 2017, asking the Court to rule if ALJs are officers of the United States and thus subject to the Appointments Clause. The Court granted to hear the case in January 2018, with oral arguments set for April 23, 2018. 

During the case's review in lower courts, the United States government had backed the SEC's stance. With the election of [[Donald Trump]] as President, the government's stance had changed, favoring the argument that ALJs should be appointed. The SEC had already changed its process of hiring ALJs prior to the Supreme Court decision, by requiring appointments to be approved by a vote of the Commission.&lt;ref name="ap decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/apxsupreme-court-sides-with-buckets-of-money-financier/ | title = Supreme Court sides with ‘Buckets of Money’ financier | date=  June 21, 2018 | accessdate = June 21, 2018 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its brief to the Supreme Court, the government also held the stance that as ALJs should be appointed, they should also be able to be dismissed at the President's or other delegated officer's discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-20/supreme-court-lucia-case-could-remove-agency-judge-protections | title = Trump’s War on ‘Deep State’ Judges | first1 = Margaret | last1 = Newkirk | first2 = Greg | last2= Storh | date = April 20, 2018 | accessdate  =June 21, 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court did not consider this question during oral hearings and internal debates.

The Court ruled on June 21, 2018, in a 7–2 decision affirming Lucia's statement that ALJs are officers of the United States, since they are being effectively being given judicial power, and thus must be appointed by the President or a delegated officer.&lt;ref name="wsj decision"/&gt; The Court ruled that Lucia must now be due a new hearing before a different, properly appointed officer from the SEC, but otherwise did not comment on any other aspect of Lucia's case.&lt;ref name="ap decision"/&gt; The majority opinion was written by Justice [[Elena Kagan]] and joined by Justices [[John Roberts]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], and [[Neil Gorsuch]]. Justice Thomas also wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Gorsuch. While this decision is expected to allow any entity with a pending case before an SEC ALJ to request a new ruling, the ruling was crafted as to prevent completed cases from being reopened, or if this would apply to cases open at other agencies besides the SEC.&lt;ref name="nytimes decision"/&gt;

Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in part with the judgment and dissented in part, with Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]] joining in his dissent.  Breyer agreed that the appointment of ALJ's by SEC staff rather than by the Commissioner themselves was not lawful.  However, this unlawfulness arose from a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia, 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this violation was statutory in nature, it was unnecessary to address the constitutional question.&lt;ref&gt;''Lucia'', 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 3).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Breyer argued that it was problematic to determine the "inferior Officer" status of ALJ's without first deciding the "pre-existing ''Free Enterprise Fund''&lt;ref&gt;''Free Enterprise Fund'' v. ''Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.'', 561 U. S. 477 (2010). &lt;/ref&gt; question— namely, what effect that holding would have on the statutory 'for cause' removal protections that Congress provided for administrative law judges."&lt;ref&gt;''Lucia'', 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 12).&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Breyer disagreed with the need for a hearing before a different ALJ, as there is not clear that the Constitution requires a hearing before a different "Officer" after an Appointments Clause violation.&lt;ref&gt;''Lucia'', 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 14).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Ginsburg, stating that ALJs should not be treated as officers as their judgments are not treated as final and binding.&lt;ref name="nytimes decision"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/politics/sec-judges-supreme-court.html | title = S.E.C.

The mall is five stories tall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowucity.com/indexen.php/Guide_index.html|title=Luohu Commercial City floor maps}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sells a wide range of items, including watches, handbags, clothes, shoes, audio-visual products, souvenirs, curtains, [[DVD]]s, etc. The mall also includes a number of restaurants and shops that offer services, such as massages and dental work, at very low prices.

==Transportation==
===Inter-city===
The Luohu Inter-city Bus Terminal is located directly under Luohu Commercial Center, and buses to locations in [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]] provinces are available here. A shuttle to [[Shenzhen Airport]] is also available in the Bus Terminal. [[Shenzhen Railway Station]] is next to the mall and provides long-distance travel across China. Visitors with permission to enter [[Hong Kong]] may cross the border at the Immigration Control Point and take the [[East Rail Line|East Rail&amp;nbsp;Line]] from [[Lo Wu Station]] as far as Hung Hom.

===Within Shenzhen===
Located on the north side of Luohu Commercial Center is a bus station for intra-city buses and mini-buses. Immediately to the west is [[Luohu Station]] on [[Line 1, Shenzhen Metro|Line 1]] of the [[Shenzhen Metro]]. Taxis are also available at a special taxi stand location below the intra-city bus station.

'''Miracle Mineral Supplement''', often referred to as '''Miracle Mineral Solution''', '''Master Mineral Solution''', '''MMS''' or the '''CD protocol''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/parents-are-giving-their-children-bleach-enemas-to-cure-them-of-autism-311|title=The Parents Who Give Their Children Bleach Enemas to 'Cure' Them of Autism|work=VICE|author=Stefan Sirucek|date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[chlorine dioxide]], an industrial bleach. It is made by mixing 28 percent sodium chlorite solution with an acid such as citrus juice. This mixture produces chlorine dioxide, a potent industrial bleach and industrial water cleaner. High oral doses of this bleach, such as those recommended in the labeling, can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, symptoms of severe dehydration and other life threatening conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm220747.htm|title=FDA Warns Consumers of Serious Harm from Drinking Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS)|date=3 February 2011|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203232945/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm220747.htm|archivedate=3 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was coined by former [[Scientology|Scientologist]]&lt;ref name=ne&amp;ya/&gt; {{ill|Jim Humble|de}} in his 2006 [[self-publishing|self-published]] book, ''The Miracle Mineral Solution of the 21st Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Miracle Mineral Solution of the 21st Century|publisher=Jim Humble|year=2006|author=Jim Humble}} (self published)&lt;/ref&gt; A more dilute version is marketed as '''Chlorine Dioxide Solution (CDS)'''.&lt;ref name="FSAcds"&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=UK [[Food Standards Agency]] |date= July 3, 2012 |title= Agency warning on chlorine solutions |url= http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2012/jul/cdswarning#.UJ8EzIawUzQ |accessdate= November 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MMS is falsely promoted as a cure for [[HIV]], [[malaria]], [[viral hepatitis|hepatitis viruses]], the [[H1N1]] [[flu virus]], [[common cold]]s, [[autism]], [[acne]], [[cancer]], and much more.

==Safety and legal issues==
''[[The Guardian]]'' has described MMS as "extremely nasty stuff, and the medical advice given is that anyone who has this product should stop using it immediately and throw it away. In Canada it was banned after causing a life-threatening reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Martin | last = Robbins | title = The man who encourages the sick and dying to drink industrial bleach | date = 2010-09-15 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/15/miracle-mineral-solutions-mms-bleach | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, a Mexican woman travelling with her American husband on their yacht in [[Vanuatu]] took MMS as a preventative for malaria. Within 15 minutes she was ill, and within twelve hours she was dead. The island nation's public prosecutor, Kayleen Tavoa, did not press any charges as there were no specific laws banning the importation of MMS, but advised, "While every case is assessed on its own merits, I advise that any person who misuses MMS in Vanuatu in the future would be likely to face prosecution for potentially serious criminal offences. No person should ever give MMS to another person to drink without advising them of what it is they are drinking and of the serious risks to health that may arise if they decide to drink the mixture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Gibson |first= Joel |publication-date= January 9, 2010 |title= Death in paradise |newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issn= 0312-6315 |url= http://www.smh.com.au/national/death-in-paradise-20100108-lyxv.html |accessdate= February 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214180619/http://www.smh.com.au/national/death-in-paradise-20100108-lyxv.html |archivedate=December 14, 2013 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In 2008, a 60-year-old Canadian man was hospitalized after a life-threatening response to MMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sketchy supplements on Calgary website prompt Health Canada warning |first= Renato |last= Gandia |url= http://www.calgarysun.com/2012/02/15/sketchy-supplements-on-calgary-website-prompt-health-canada-warning |newspaper= [[Calgary Sun]] |date= February 15, 2012 |accessdate = February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a May 2010 advisory which indicated that MMS exceeds tolerable levels of sodium chlorite by a factor of 200,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher= [[Health Canada]] |date= May 12, 2010 |title= Health risks associated with use of Miracle Mineral Solution |url= http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2010/2010_74-eng.php |accessdate= February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a Calgary-based supplier briefly stopped distribution. A February 2012 warning, which resulted in one website shutting down, advised: "There are no therapeutic products containing sodium chlorite authorized for oral consumption by humans in Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher= [[Health Canada]] |date= February 15, 2012 |title= Sodium chlorite solution not authorized for oral consumption by humans |url= http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2012/2012_21-eng.php |accessdate= February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Tobin |first= Anne-Marie |publication-date= February 15, 2012 |title= Website shut down after selling product called MMS |work= [[CICT-DT|Global Calgary]] |publisher = Shaw Media |url= http://www.globaltvcalgary.com/website+shut+down+after+selling+product+called+mms/6442581915/story.html |accessdate= February 21, 2012 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the [[Food Standards Agency]] has also released a warning, following the initial warning from Health Canada and a similar warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in which they stated that "MMS is a 28% sodium chlorite solution which is equivalent to industrial-strength bleach. When taken as directed it could cause severe [[nausea]], vomiting and [[diarrhea]], potentially leading to [[dehydration]] and [[hypotension|reduced blood pressure]]. If the solution is diluted less than instructed, it could cause damage to the gut and red blood cells, potentially resulting in [[respiratory failure]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Food Standards Agency has since reiterated their warning on MMS and extended it to include CDS.&lt;ref name="FSAcds" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/04/government-warning-internet-remedies|title=Bleach-based cure-all online remedies could kill, warns government|first=Rebecca|last=Smithers|date=4 July 2012|publisher=|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sellers attribute the vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea to the product working, but it is simply the product's toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://moh.gov.ms/?p=803 |title= Product Warning: Miracle Mineral Solution |publisher= Ministry of Health |location= Montserrat |accessdate= December 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, an alert was issued by the Belgian Poison Control Centre to the [[European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists]]. In response, an evaluation was performed by the French "Comité de coordination de toxicovigilance" in March 2010, warning about a dose dependent irritation and possible toxic effects. They also warned that patients affected by serious diseases could be tempted to stop their treatments in favour of this alternative treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar notice was released in July 2010 by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] warning that the instructions for preparing the solution by mixing it with an acidic solution, or even orange juice, would produce [[chlorine dioxide]], "a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment." Because of reports including nausea, vomiting, and dangerously [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] as a result of dehydration following instructed use, the FDA has advised consumers to dispose of the product immediately.&lt;ref name="fda.gov" /&gt;

MMS is not approved for the treatment of any disease and according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], chronic exposure to small doses of chlorine dioxide could cause reproductive and neurodevelopmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Investigations==
In 2015, BBC London conducted an undercover investigation into MMS, with a reporter posing as a family member of a person with [[autism]].  The BBC reporter was sold two bottles containing [[sodium chlorite]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] by a self-styled "reverend" named Leon Edwards linked to the Genesis II Church in the United States.  Edwards told the reporter that the solutions would cure nearly all illnesses and conditions, including cancer, HIV, malaria, autism and Alzheimer's.  He recommended 27 drops per day for a baby.  Laboratory analysis later showed that the concentration of both bottled solutions was stronger than advertised.  Edwards told the reporter:

: "I put it in my eyes, my nose, my ears, bathe in it, drunk it, breathed it in my lungs. I got injected in my butt with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33079776|title='Miracle autism cure' seller exposed by BBC investigation|date=11 June 2015|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eyewitness News and ABC News investigated the MMS phenomenon in 2016, and uncovered an "underground network" centred around southern California which was promoting the substance as a cure for conditions including cancer, [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and childhood autism.&lt;ref name=ne&amp;ya&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/parents-making-children-drink-bleach-160057178.html|title=Parents Are Making Their Children Drink Bleach to 'Cure' Them of Autism|date=28 January 2018|publisher=Newsweek/Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in January 2018 that at least six police forces have investigated the use of MMS in the UK, where it continues to be available.  Spokespersons for the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the [[Food Standards Agency]] have repeatedly warned of the dangers of using such a product.&lt;ref name=ne&amp;ya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brit-kids-forced-drink-bleach-11924623|title=Desperate parents forcing kids to drink bleach as autistic children become victims of sick US cult|date=27 January 2018|publisher=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments==
Former Chicagoan Kerri Rivera, who now resides in Mexico, was required by the [[Illinois Attorney General]] to sign a document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assurance of Voluntary Compliance - Kerri Rivera|url=http://media.nbcchicago.com/documents/Rivera+Fully+Executed+AVC.pdf|website=[[NBC Chicago]]|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that she would no longer promote the use of toxic chlorine dioxide, or "CD," in the state of Illinois. The agreement, which Rivera signed, says, "Respondent [Rivera] makes unsubstantiated health and medical claims regarding the use of chlorine dioxide in the treatment of autism. In truth and fact, Respondent lacks competent and reliable scientific evidence to support her claims that chlorine dioxide can treat autism. Respondent's act of promoting unsubstantiated health and medical claims regarding the use of chlorine dioxide in the treatment of autism constitutes a violation of Section 2 of the Consumer Fraud Act." The agreement continued to bar Rivera from speaking at seminars and selling chlorine dioxide or similar substances for the treatment of autism. However, Rivera operates a Facebook page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerri Rivera's CD Autism Group on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/AutismCD|website=Facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CD Autism dot org|url=http://cdautism.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; that promote injecting autistic children with a toxic chlorine dioxide formula via enema, and claims that the intestinal lining and membranes children expel as a result are parasites, which is patently false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning Against Chlorine Dioxide Use|url=https://www.autism.com/statement_mms|website=[[Autism Research Institute]]|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-Attorney General [[Lisa Madigan]] described the case by saying, "You have a situation where there are people, complete quacks, that are out there promoting a very dangerous chemical being given to young children...

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
In [[law]], a '''motion to set aside judgment''' is an application to overturn or set aside a [[court]]'s [[Judgment (law)|judgment]], [[verdict]] or other final ruling in a case. Such a [[motion (legal)|motion]] is proposed by a party who is dissatisfied with the end result of a [[Legal case|case]]. Motions may be made at any time after entry of judgment, and in some circumstances years after the case has been closed by the courts. Generally the  motion cannot be based on grounds which were previously considered when deciding a motion for new trial or on an appeal of the judgment, thus the motion can only be granted in unusual circumstances, such as when the judgment was procured by [[fraud]] which could not have been discovered at the time of the trial, or if the court entering the judgment lacked the [[jurisdiction]] to do so.

Motions to set aside judgments entered in civil cases in the [[United States district court]]s are governed by Rule 60 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].  The rule is quite straightforward; its court room application is mostly exactly as stated.

Motions to set aside judgment in criminal cases are rare: in U.S. jurisprudence the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is the usual method of attacking a criminal conviction after the right of [[appeal]] has been exhausted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10739">'''Music ownership databases''' are lists of the owners of [[Musical composition|compositions]] and the people who represents them. Often, a piece of music will have more than one owner. This is caused by [[Publishing contract|Publishing contracts]], co-writing, band contracts, label deals, and similar music contracts.  Music ownership databases are created from the idea that with more transparency about the owners of musical compositions, the lower the costs become to create and use music. For example, a [[Derivative work|derivative license]] is needed when a portion of a piece of music is used in a different piece, which is a common practice in [[hip hop music]], among other genres. In American copyright laws, a derivative work must have permission from every owner of the original work. If it is not known who the original owner of the work was and artists use it anyway, then they can be sued for [[copyright infringement]]. A music ownership database, major industry players speculate, would eliminate this problem. This is apparent through the amount of time and money spent in attempting to create this database.

== Earlier attempts ==
===International Music Joint Venture===
The International Music Joint Venture (IMJV) started in 1998. It was the first joint partnership to create a database between multiple different [[Collective rights management|collective management organizations]] (CMOs). [[BUMA/STEMRA]] (Netherland), [[PRS for Music|PRS]] (UK) and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] (USA) were the founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kefalas|first1=Andreas|title=The Relevance of Traditional Collective Management Organisations in the Digital Age|journal=University of Agder Master Thesis|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The database was supposed to be created using the [[metadata]] store on [[Utrecht]] and [[London]] computers. IMJV invited many CMOs like [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores|SGAE]] (Spain)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Llewellyn|first1=Howell|title=SGAE Pledges to Work with IMJV|agency=Billboard|date=April 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] (USA) and [[Harry Fox Agency]], but for one reason or another many organizations did not join. Problems started to rise because IMJV was a way for STEMRA to move around employees they could not fire because of the laws in Holland at the time. When IMJV invited [[GEMA (German organization)|GEMA]] (Germany), they refused because they would have to fire their staff because the deal required STEMRA staff to take their place. Smaller CMOs started to believe that they would become redundant if IMJV launched. The larger CMOs who had already joined became reluctant to reduce their status and profitability by releasing the information for their repertoire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Phil|title=Nickels and Dimes: Music Publishing and How It Works|date=2013|publisher=A Division of Music Sales Limited|location=14-15 Berners Street, London|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In late 2001, the initiative dissolved without a single operating office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=IMJV Dissolved - SOCAN Remains Committed to State-of-the-Art Technology Development|journal=Words and Music|date=2002|volume=Vol. 9|issue=No. 2|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At its peak, IMJV represented 21% of the world’s music.

===International Music Registry===
In 2011, the International Music Registry (IMR) launched. This was a database headed by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rethink Music|title=Transparency and Payment Flows in the Music Industry|pages=21-25|url=https://www.berklee.edu/sites/default/files/Fair%20Music%20-%20Transparency%20and%20Payment%20Flows%20in%20the%20Music%20Industry.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. IMR was a database not only for composition but also for recordings. [[Google]] agreed to fund WIPO early on, but WIPO broke their partnership after they thought the alliance would give Google too much power. Instead, WIPO tried to fund the project themselves. In-fighting among the different powerhouses like [[Record label| record labels]] and [[music publisher (popular music)|publishing houses]] caused the IMR to collapse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Phil|title=Nickels and Dimes: Music Publishing and How It Works|date=2013|publisher=A Division of Music Sales Limited|location=14-15 Berners Street, London|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Global Repertoire Database===
The Global Repertoire Database was started by the PRS on September 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milosic|first1=Klementina|title=GRD’s Failure|journal=Music Business Journal|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This database had representatives from publishing houses, record labels, Google, [[iTunes]], Monifone, and had a total of 13 CMO’s: [[Australasian Performing Right Association|APRA]] (Australasia), ASCAP, BMI, BUMA, GEMA, PRS, [[STIM]] (Sweden), [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]] (France), [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada|SOCAN]] (Canada), [[SABAM]] (Belgium), SGAE, [[SIAE]] (Italy) and [[Escritório Central de Arrecadação e Distribuição|UBC]] (Brazil). More than 80 organizations participated in the initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smirke|first1=Richard|title=Global Repertoire Database HQ to be Based in London and Berlin|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/global/1561367/global-repertoire-database-hq-to-be-based-in-london-and-berlin|accessdate=7 December 2017|date=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This database was never meant to be for public use, but as a Global Database for music industry major players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rethink Music|title=Transparency and Payment Flows in the Music Industry|pages=21-25|url=https://www.berklee.edu/sites/default/files/Fair%20Music%20-%20Transparency%20and%20Payment%20Flows%20in%20the%20Music%20Industry.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to some CMOs pulling their support from the initiative, GRD went from having guaranteed financial support to having 8 million euros of [[Investment|investment]] scrapped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooke|first1=Chris|title=PRS confirms Global Repertoire Database “Cannot” Move Forward, Pledges to Find “Alternative Ways”|url=http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/prs-confirms-global-repertoire-database-cannot-move-forward-pledges-to-find-alternative-ways/|website=Complete Music Updata|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Current American Attempts ==
===Transparency of Music License Ownership Act===
The Transparency of Music License Ownership Act [[Bill (law)|bill]] was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]] on July 20, 2017 by Jim Sensenbrenner and Suzan DelBene. It creates a database with the ability to enforce participation by law. Like most [[Legislation|legislation]] today, there are people who support this bill and people who oppose against this bill. The people who are in support after the Transparency of Music License Ownership Act say that it will help the music industry grow by cutting costs caused by misinformation and intermediaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Vibrant Music Licensing Marketplace|url=http://mic-coalition.org/news-posts/transparency-music-licensing-ownership-act-promotes-vibrant-music-licensing-marketplace/|website=Music InnovationConsumers|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The opposition against this bill believes that the legislation would limit the ability for copyright owners to sue for infringement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flanagan|first1=Andrew|title=New Bill Calling For Transparency In Music Is Surprisingly Opaque|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/08/01/540655528/new-bill-calling-for-transparency-in-music-is-surprisingly-opaque|website=NPR|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
===ASCAP and BMI Database===
On July 26, 2017, ASCAP and BMI announced a joint database between both organizations, a project that has been in the works for the past year. The first phase, a searchable database, will roll out the first quarter of 2018. 90% of music in the USA is represented by these two organizations. Groups of people in that industry are excited for this much information to be on one database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aswad|first1=Jem|title=ASCAP and BMI Join Forces on Comprehensive Song Database|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/ascap-and-bmi-join-forces-on-comprehensive-song-database-1202507071/|website=Variety|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time, many have mentioned that the database is incomplete because it does not include music from the CMOs [[SESAC]] (USA) or Global Music Rights (USA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christman|first1=Ed|title=Inside the Music Publishing World's Epic Struggle to Build a Single Song Database|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/7889691/inside-the-music-publishing-worlds-epic-struggle-to-build-a-single-song|website=Billboard|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. House Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, among others in the industry, have suggested ASCAP and BMI cannot be trusted because of their past withdrawing from the GRD causing it to collapse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanchez|first1=Daniel|title=War Erupts Over Whose Global Music Rights Database Is Better|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/08/04/riaa-ascap-bmi-congress-shared-music-database/|website=Digital Music News|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christman|first1=Ed|title=ASCAP-BMI Song Database Plan Rollout Questioned|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7881962/ascap-bmi-database-rollout-plan-controversy|website=Billboard|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===RIAA and NMPA Database===
Soon after ASCAP and BMI announced their database, RIAA and NMPA came forward with the information that they have also been working on the database between their two organizations. RIAA and NMPA said they purposely excluded ASCAP and BMI because they believed inviting them would cause a hindrance to the overall goal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanchez|first1=Daniel|title=A US Congressman Just Called ASCAP+BMI’s Shared Database a Scam|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/07/27/mic-coalition-ascap-bmi/|website=Digital Music News|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the same time, publishers in the music industry have expressed doubt about the ability of RIAA and NMPA to create a database without any CMOs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dredge|first1=Stuart|title=RIAA And NMPA Working On Their Own Song-Database Project|url=http://musically.com/2017/08/03/riaa-nmpa-working-song-database-project/|website=Musically|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;s.

'''Natural rubber''', also called '''India rubber''' or '''''caoutchouc''''', as initially produced, consists of [[polymer]]s of the [[organic compound]] [[isoprene]], with minor impurities of other organic compounds, plus water. [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] are two of the leading rubber producers. Forms of [[polyisoprene]] that are used as natural rubbers are classified as [[elastomer]]s.

Currently, rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the [[latex]] from the [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]] or others. The latex is a sticky, milky [[colloid]] drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called "tapping". The latex then is refined into rubber ready for commercial processing.  In major areas, latex is allowed to coagulate in the collection cup. The coagulated lumps are collected and processed into dry forms for marketing.

Natural rubber is used extensively in many applications and products, either alone or in combination with other materials. In most of its useful forms, it has a large [[stretch ratio]] and high [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]], and is extremely waterproof.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Heinz-Hermann Greve "Rubber, 2. Natural" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{toclimit|3}}

== Varieties ==

=== ''Hevea brasiliensis'' ===
The major commercial source of natural rubber latex is the Pará rubber tree (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]''), a member of the [[spurge]] [[Family (biology)|family]], ''[[Euphorbiaceae]]''. This species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years.

=== Congo rubber ===
[[Congo rubber]], formerly a major source of rubber, came from vines in the genus ''[[Landolphia]]'' (''[[Landolphia kirkii|L. kirkii]]'', ''L. heudelotis'', and ''L. owariensis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/botany/rubber.htm|title=Rubber and Other Latex Products|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dandelion ===
[[Dandelion]] milk contains latex. The latex exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from [[rubber trees]]. In the wild types of dandelion, latex content is low and varies greatly. In [[Nazi Germany]], research projects tried to use dandelions as a base for rubber production, but failed.&lt;ref name="Heim2002"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1DqS5a5A8JkC}}|title=Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus|last=Heim|first=Susanne|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|year=2002|isbn=978-3892444961|authorlink=Susanne Heim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, by inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology]] (IME) in [[Germany]] developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|date=28 October 2013|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[Continental Tire]]s, IME began a pilot facility.

=== Other ===
Many other plants produce forms of latex rich in isoprene polymers, though not all produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most are more difficult to tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example [[gutta-percha]] (''[[Palaquium gutta]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/GuttaPercha/ |title=The Gutta Percha Company |first=Bill |last=Burns |work=History of the Atlantic Cable &amp; Undersea Communications |accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chicle]] from ''[[Manilkara]]'' species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (''[[Ficus elastica]]''), Panama rubber tree (''[[Castilla elastica]]''), various spurges (''[[Euphorbia]]'' spp.), [[lettuce]] (''[[Lactuca]]'' species), the related ''[[Scorzonera tau-saghyz]]'', various ''[[Taraxacum]]'' species, including common dandelion (''[[Taraxacum officinale]]'') and Russian dandelion (''[[Taraxacum kok-saghyz]]''), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, [[guayule]] (''Parthenium argentatum''). The term '''gum rubber''' is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

== History ==
The first use of rubber was by the indigenous cultures of [[Mesoamerica]]. The earliest archeological evidence of the use of natural latex from the [[Hevea tree|''Hevea'' tree]] comes from the [[Olmec]] culture, in which rubber was first used for making balls for the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]. Rubber was later used by the  [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]] cultures – in addition to making balls Aztecs used rubber for other purposes such as making containers and to make textiles waterproof by impregnating them with the latex sap.&lt;ref&gt;Emory Dean Keoke, Kay Marie Porterfield. 2009.

The Pará rubber tree is [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to [[South America]]. [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the ''[[Académie Royale des Sciences]]'' of France in 1736.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web |title= Charles Marie de la Condamine |website= bouncing-balls.com |url= http://www.bouncing-balls.com/timeline/people/nr_condamine.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751, he presented a paper by [[François Fresneau]] to the Académie (published in 1755) that described many of rubber's properties. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt; In England, [[Joseph Priestley]], in 1770, observed that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing off [[pencil]] marks on paper, hence the name "rubber". It slowly made its way around England. In 1764 François Fresnau discovered that [[turpentine]] was a rubber solvent. [[Giovanni Fabbroni]] is credited with the discovery of [[naphtha]] as a rubber solvent in 1779.

South America remained the main source of the limited amounts of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The trade was heavily protected and exporting seeds from Brazil was a [[Capital punishment|capital offense]], although no law prohibited it. Nevertheless, in 1876, [[Henry Wickham (explorer)|Henry Wickham]] smuggled 70,000 Pará rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to [[Kew Gardens]], England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to [[India]], [[British Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), [[Dutch East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]]), [[Singapore]], and [[British Malaya]]. Malaya (now [[Peninsular Malaysia]]) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber.

In the early 1900s, the [[Congo Free State]] in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by [[forced labor]]. King Leopold II's colonial state brutally enforced production quotas. Tactics to enforce the rubber quotas included removing the hands of victims to prove they had been killed. Soldiers often came back from raids with baskets full of chopped-off hands. Villages that resisted were razed to encourage better compliance locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-25|title=Atrocities in the Congo Free State|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State&amp;oldid=842894462|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] for more information on the rubber trade in the Congo Free State in the late 1800s and early 1900s. [[Liberia]] and [[Nigeria]] started production.

In [[India]], commercial cultivation was introduced by British planters, although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale were initiated as early as 1873 at the [[Calcutta]] Botanical Gardens. The first commercial ''Hevea'' plantations were established at Thattekadu in [[Kerala]] in 1902. In later years the plantation expanded to [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] of India. India today is the world's 3rd largest producer and 4th largest consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/Rubber.htm|title=Natural rubber in India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001100758/http://www.dsir.gov.in/reports/ExpTechTNKL/Abs%20new/Rubber.htm|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore and Malaya, commercial production was heavily promoted by [[Henry Nicholas Ridley|Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley]], who served as the first Scientific Director of the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]] from 1888 to 1911. He distributed rubber seeds to many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex without causing serious harm to the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_518_2004-12-28.html |title=Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley |last=Cornelius-Takahama |first=Vernon |date=2001 |work=Singapore Infopedia |accessdate=9 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504095356/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_518_2004-12-28.html |archivedate=4 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his fervent promotion of this crop, he is popularly remembered by the nickname "Mad Ridley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysiahistory.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:mad-ridley-and-the-rubber-boom&amp;catid=47:economic-history |title=Mad Ridley and the rubber boom |first1=Dr Loh Wei |last1=Leng |first2=Khor Jin |last2=Keong |date=19 September 2011 |work=Malaysia History |accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-World War II ===
[[Charles Goodyear]] developed [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] in 1839, although [[Mesoamerican]]s used stabilized rubber for balls and other objects as early as 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hosler | first1 = D. | last2 = Burkett | first2 = S.L. | last3 = Tarkanian | first3 = M.J. | year = 1999 | title = Prehistoric polymers: Rubber processing in ancient Mesoamerica | url = | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5422| pages = 1988–1991 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5422.1988 | pmid=10373117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slack2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Slack|title=Noble obsession: Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock, and the race to unlock the greatest industrial secret of the nineteenth century|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=CWzeAAAAMAAJ}}|date=7 August 2002|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=978-0786867899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before World War II significant uses included door and window profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, [[Rubber mat|matting]], flooring and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the [[automotive]] industry. The use of rubber in car [[tire]]s (initially solid rather than pneumatic) in particular consumed a significant amount of rubber.  [[Gloves]] (medical, household and industrial) and toy [[balloon]]s were large consumers of rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant tonnage of rubber was used as [[adhesive]]s in many manufacturing industries and products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet industries. Rubber was commonly used to make [[rubber band]]s and pencil [[eraser]]s.

Rubber produced as a fiber, sometimes called 'elastic', had significant value to the textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film. Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into the fabric. Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments. While rubber is still used in textile manufacturing, its low tenacity limits its use in lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to [[neoprene]] (polymer of [[chloroprene]]), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, [[spandex]] (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.

==Properties==
[[File:Latex being collected from a tapped rubber tree.jpg|thumb|Rubber latex]]
Rubber exhibits unique physical and chemical properties. Rubber's stress–strain behavior exhibits the [[Mullins effect]] and the [[Payne effect]] and is often modeled as [[Hyperelastic material|hyperelastic]]. Rubber [[Strain crystallization|strain crystallizes]].

Due to the presence of weakened [[allyl]]ic C-H bonds in each [[repeat unit]], natural rubber is susceptible to [[vulcanisation]] as well as being sensitive to [[ozone cracking]].

The two main [[solvents]] for rubber are [[turpentine]] and [[naphtha]] (petroleum). Because rubber does not dissolve easily, the material is finely divided by shredding prior to its immersion.

An [[ammonia]] solution can be used to prevent the [[flocculation|coagulation]] of raw latex.

Rubber begins to melt at approximately {{Convert|180|C}}.

===Elasticity===
{{main|Rubber elasticity}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
On a microscopic scale, relaxed rubber is a disorganized cluster of erratically changing wrinkled chains. In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear. The restoring force is due to the preponderance of wrinkled conformations over more linear ones. For the quantitative treatment see [[ideal chain]], for more examples see [[entropic force]].

Cooling below the [[glass transition temperature]] permits local conformational changes but a reordering is practically impossible because of the larger energy barrier for the concerted movement of longer chains. "Frozen" rubber's elasticity is low and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] results from small changes of [[Chemical bond|bond]] lengths and angles: this caused the [[Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]], when the American [[Space Shuttle]]'s flattened [[o-ring]]s failed to relax to fill a widening gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title = Casing Joint Design | work =  Report - Investigation of the Challenger Accident| publisher = US Government Printing Office| date =| url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRPT-99hrpt1016/pdf/CHRG-101shrg1087-2.pdf| format = PDF| doi = | accessdate = 29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glass transition is fast and reversible: the force resumes on heating.

The parallel chains of stretched rubber are susceptible to crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have to move out of the way of the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.

[[Vulcanization]] of rubber creates di- and [[polysulfide bonds]] between chains, which limits the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and results in chains that tighten more quickly for a given strain, thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making the rubber harder and less extensible.

===Malodour===
Raw rubber storage depots and rubber processing can produce malodour that is serious enough to become a source of complaints and protest to those living in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b74a/c9bfbe91a9cc5625c7dd980bc1de3ec8a0de.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215053437/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b74a/c9bfbe91a9cc5625c7dd980bc1de3ec8a0de.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbial impurities originate during the processing of block rubber. These impurities break down during storage or thermal degradation and produce volatile organic compounds. Examination of these compounds using [[gas chromatography]]/[[mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) and gas chromatography (GC) indicates that they contain sulphur, ammonia, [[alkene]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[ester]]s, hydrogen sulphite, nitrogen, and low molecular weight fatty acids (C2-C5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Determination of Chemical Components that Cause Mal-Odor from Natural Rubber|first1=Vipavee P.|last1=Hoven|first2=Kesinee|last2=Rattanakaran|first3=Yasuyuki|last3=Tanaka|date=1 November 2003|journal=Rubber Chemistry and Technology|volume=76|issue=5|pages=1128–1144|doi=10.5254/1.3547792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aidic.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/12/30/021.pdf |title=Info |website=www.aidic.it |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When latex concentrate is produced from rubber, sulphuric acid is used for coagulation. This produces malodourous hydrogen sulphide.&lt;ref name="aidic.it"/&gt;

The industry can mitigate these bad odours with [[scrubber|scrubber systems]].&lt;ref name="aidic.it"/&gt;

== Chemical makeup ==
[[File:NatVsSynPolyisoprene.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Chemical structure of cis-polyisoprene, the main constituent of natural rubber. Synthetic cis-polyisoprene and natural cis-polyisoprene are derived from different precursors, [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] and [[isoprene]].]]

Latex is the polymer cis-1,4-polyisoprene – with a [[molecular weight]] of 100,000 to 1,000,000 [[Dalton (unit)|daltons]]. Typically, a small percentage (up to 5% of dry mass) of other materials, such as [[proteins]], [[fatty acids]], [[resins]], and inorganic materials (salts) are found in natural rubber. Polyisoprene can also be created synthetically, producing what is sometimes referred to as "synthetic natural rubber", but the synthetic and natural routes are different.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Some natural rubber sources, such as [[gutta-percha]], are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene, a [[structural isomer]] that has similar properties.

Natural rubber is an elastomer and a [[thermoplastic]]. Once the rubber is vulcanized, it is a [[thermoset]]. Most rubber in everyday use is vulcanized to a point where it shares properties of both; i.e., if it is heated and cooled, it is degraded but not destroyed.

The final properties of a rubber item depend not just on the polymer, but also on modifiers and fillers, such as [[carbon black]], [[factice]], whiting and others.

===Biosynthesis===
Rubber particles are formed in the [[cytoplasm]] of specialized latex-producing cells called [[laticifer]]s within rubber plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Koyama |editor-first= Tanetoshi |editor2-last= Steinbüchel |editor2-first= Alexander |chapter= Biosynthesis of Natural Rubber and Other Natural Polyisoprenoids |title= Polyisoprenoids |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1a_wAAAAMAAJ|page=73}}|series= Biopolymers |volume= 2 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |date= June 2011 |pages= 73–81 |isbn= 978-3527302215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubber particles are surrounded by a single [[phospholipid]] membrane with [[hydrophobic]] tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at the surface of the growing rubber particle, which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the rubber particle, a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Paterson-Jones |first1= J.C. |last2= Gilliland |first2= M.G. |last3= Van Staden |first3= J. |title= The Biosynthesis of Natural Rubber |journal= Journal of Plant Physiology |volume= 136 |issue= 3 |pages= 257–263 |date= June 1990 |doi= 10.1016/S0176-1617(11)80047-7 |issn= 0176-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (an [[Allyl group|allylic]] compound), which elongates by Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Christian |last1=Schulze Gronover |first2=Daniela |last2=Wahler |first3=Dirk |last3=Prufer |editor-last= Magdy |editor-first= Elnashar |date=5 Jul 2011 |title=Biotechnology of Biopolymers |chapter=4.

The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by [[prenyltransferase]], which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Xie |first1= W. |display-authors= 3 |last2= McMahan |first2= C.M. |last3= Distefano |first3= A.J.

The required isopentenyl pyrophosphate is obtained from the [[mevalonate]] pathway, which derives from [[acetyl-CoA]] in the [[cytosol]].

==Production==
[[File:Rubber trees in Kerala, India.jpg|thumb|Rubber is generally cultivated in large plantations. The image shows a coconut shell used in collecting latex, in plantations in [[Kerala]], India.]]
Close to 28 million tons of rubber were produced in 2013, of which approximately 44% was natural. Since the bulk is synthetic, which is derived from petroleum, the price of natural rubber is determined, to a large extent, by the prevailing global price of crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wlxrubber.com/news_detail/newsId=daa867c8-3134-477a-a1aa-4db921ff538f&amp;comp_stats=comp-FrontNews_ranking01-1264986203356.html |title=Overview of the Causes of Natural Rubber Price Volatility |language= |publisher=En.wlxrubber.com |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526213107/http://en.wlxrubber.com/news_detail/newsId%3Ddaa867c8-3134-477a-a1aa-4db921ff538f%26comp_stats%3Dcomp-FrontNews_ranking01-1264986203356.html |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubberstudy.com/documents/WebSiteData_3.0c.pdf |title=STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF WORLD RUBBER SITUATION |publisher=International Rubber Study Group |date=Nov 2014 |accessdate=2015-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412003724/http://www.rubberstudy.com/documents/WebSiteData_3.0c.pdf |archivedate=12 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2880010|title=The Impact of the Changes of the World Crude Oil Prices on the Natural Rubber Industry in Malaysia|journal=World Applied Sciences Journal|author=Dr. Aye Aye Khin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia was the main source of natural rubber, accounting for about 94% of output in 2005. The three largest producers, [[Thailand]], Indonesia (2.4 million tons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Listiyorini |first=Eko |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-16/rubber-exports-from-indonesia-may-grow-6-8-next-year-update1-.html |title=Rubber Exports From Indonesia May Grow 6%–8% Next Year |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104074312/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-16/rubber-exports-from-indonesia-may-grow-6-8-next-year-update1-.html |archivedate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malaysia, together account for around 72% of all natural rubber production. Natural rubber is not cultivated widely in its native continent of South America due to the existence of South American leaf [[blight]], and other natural predators.

=== Cultivation ===
Rubber latex is extracted from rubber trees. The economic life period of rubber trees in plantations is around 32 years&amp;nbsp;— up to 7 years of immature phase and about 25 years of productive phase.

The soil requirement is well-drained, weathered soil consisting of [[laterite]], lateritic types, sedimentary types, nonlateritic red or [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soils.

The climatic conditions for optimum growth of rubber trees are:
* Rainfall of around {{Convert|250|cm}} evenly distributed without any marked dry season and with at least 100 rainy days per year
* Temperature range of about 20 to 34&amp;nbsp;°C, with a monthly mean of 25 to 28&amp;nbsp;°C
* Atmospheric humidity of around 80%
* About 2000 hours sunshine per year at the rate of six hours per day throughout the year
* Absence of strong winds

Many high-yielding clones have been developed for commercial planting. These clones yield more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg of dry rubber per hectare per year, under ideal conditions.

=== Collection ===
[[File:Ceylon rubber.jpg|thumb|A woman in [[Sri Lanka]] harvesting rubber, circa 1920]]
In places such as Kerala and Sri Lanka where coconuts are in abundance, the half shell of coconut was used as the latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became  more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised "spout" knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily "task" size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Indian contributions to the world 15,000 years of inventions and innovations|last=Keoke|first=Emory|publisher=Checkmark Books|year=2003|isbn=|location=|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usual to tap a pannel at least twice, sometimes three times, during the tree's life. The economic life of the tree depends on how well the tapping is carried out, as the critical factor is bark consumption. A standard in Malaysia for alternate daily tapping is 25&amp;nbsp;cm (vertical) bark consumption per year. The latex-containing tubes in the bark ascend in a spiral to the right. For this reason, tapping cuts usually ascend to the left to cut more tubes.

The trees drip latex for about four hours, stopping as latex coagulates naturally on the tapping cut, thus blocking the latex tubes in the bark. Tappers usually rest and have a meal after finishing their tapping work, then start collecting the liquid "field latex" at about midday.

====Field coagula====
[[File:MixedFieldCoagula.jpg|thumb|Mixed field coagula.]]
[[File:SmallholdersLumpAtRemillingFactory.jpg|thumb|Smallholder's lump at a remilling factory]]
The four types of field coagula are "cuplump", "treelace", "smallholders' lump" and "earth scrap". Each has significantly different properties.&lt;ref&gt;This section has been copied almost verbatim from the [[public domain]] UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), ecoport.com article: {{cite web |url= http://ecoport.org/ep?SearchType=earticleView&amp;earticleId=644&amp;page=4363 |title=Processing of Natural Rubber, Manufacture of Latex-Grade Crepe Rubber |first1=John |last1=Cecil |first2=Peter |last2=Mitchell |first3=Per |last3=Diemer |first4=Peter |last4=Griffee |publisher=FAO, Agricultural and Food Engineering Technologies Service |work=ecoport.org |date=2013 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trees continue to drip after the collection leading to a small amount of "cup lump" that is collected at the next tapping. The latex that coagulates on the cut is also collected as "tree lace". Tree lace and cup lump together account for 10–20% of the dry rubber produced. Latex that drips onto the ground, "earth scrap", is also collected periodically for processing of low-grade product.

===== Cup lump =====
Cup lump is the coagulated material found in the collection cup when the tapper next visits the tree to tap it again. It arises from latex clinging to the walls of the cup after the latex was last poured into the bucket, and from late-dripping latex exuded before the latex-carrying vessels of the tree become blocked. It is of higher purity and of greater value than the other three types.

===== Tree lace =====
Tree lace is the coagulum strip that the tapper peels off the previous cut before making a new cut. It usually has higher copper and manganese contents than cup lump. Both copper and manganese are pro-oxidants and can damage the physical properties of the dry rubber.

===== Smallholders' lump =====
Smallholders' lump is produced by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees on their way to work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex&amp;nbsp;— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.

===== Earth scrap =====
Earth scrap is material that gathers around the base of the tree. It arises from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark, from rain flooding a collection cup containing latex, and from spillage from tappers' buckets during collection. It contains soil and other contaminants, and has variable rubber content, depending on the amount of contaminants. Earth scrap is collected by field workers two or three times a year and may be cleaned in a scrap-washer to recover the rubber, or sold to a contractor who cleans it and recovers the rubber. It is of low quality.

=== Processing ===
[[File:RemovingCoagulumFromCoagulatingTroughs.jpg|thumb|Removing coagulum from coagulating troughs.]]
Latex coagulates in the cups if kept for long and must be collected before this happens. The collected latex, "field latex", is transferred into coagulation tanks for the preparation of dry rubber or transferred into air-tight containers with sieving for ammoniation. Ammoniation preserves the latex in a colloidal state for longer periods of time.

Latex is generally processed into either latex concentrate for manufacture of dipped goods or coagulated under controlled, clean conditions using formic acid. The coagulated latex can then be processed into the higher-grade, technically specified block rubbers such as SVR 3L or SVR CV or used to produce Ribbed Smoke Sheet grades.

Naturally coagulated rubber (cup lump) is used in the manufacture of TSR10 and TSR20 grade rubbers. Processing for these grades is a size reduction and cleaning process to remove contamination and prepare the material for the final stage of drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Rubber Testing|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VQVAHZyHyPAC|page=6}}|publisher=ASTM International|pages=6–|id=GGKEY:8BT2U3TQN7G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dried material is then baled and palletized for storage and shipment.

=== Vulcanized rubber ===

[[File:Torn latex rubber dry suit wrist seal P8180011.jpg|thumb|Torn latex rubber dry suit wrist seal]]
Natural rubber is often vulcanized, a process by which the rubber is heated and [[sulfur]], [[peroxide]] or [[bisphenol]] are added to improve resistance and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and to prevent it from perishing. Before World War II, carbon black was often used as an additive to rubber to improve its strength, especially in vehicle tires.

=== Transportation ===
Natural rubber latex is shipped from factories in south-west Asia, South America, and West and Center Africa to destinations around the world. As the cost of natural rubber has risen significantly and rubber products are dense, the shipping methods offering the lowest cost per unit weight are preferred. Depending on destination, warehouse availability, and transportation conditions, some methods are preferred by certain buyers. In international trade, latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers. Inside the container, smaller containers are used to store the latex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090404081944/http://www.aalatex.com/content/comments.asp?id=193 Transportation of Natural Rubber] - Industry Source&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Rubber boots.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Compression molded (cured) [[rubber boot]]s before the [[Flash (manufacturing)|flashes]] are removed]]
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
{{original research|section|date=November 2016}}
Uncured rubber is used for cements;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lgduDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Uncured+rubber+is+used+for+cements#v=onepage&amp;q=Uncured%20rubber%20is%20used%20for%20cements&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of Materials Science for Technologists: Properties, Testing, and Laboratory Exercises, Second Edition|last=Horath|first=Larry|year=2017|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=978-1478635185|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for adhesive, insulating, and friction tapes; and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear. [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized rubber]] has many more applications. Resistance to abrasion makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts, and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge.

The flexibility of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for various kinds of shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful in the manufacture of articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or [[lacrosse]] balls are made of rubber.

Around 25 million tonnes of rubber are produced each year, of which 30 percent is natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rma.org/about-rma/rubber-faqs|title=Rubber Faqs|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913145725/https://rma.org/about-rma/rubber-faqs|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder is synthetic rubber derived from petrochemical sources. The top end of latex production results in latex products such as surgeons' gloves, condoms, balloons and other relatively high-value products. The mid-range which comes from the technically specified natural rubber materials ends up largely in tires but also in conveyor belts, marine products, windshield wipers and miscellaneous goods. Natural rubber offers good elasticity, while synthetic materials tend to offer better resistance to environmental factors such as oils, temperature, chemicals and ultraviolet light. "Cured rubber" is rubber that has been compounded and subjected to the vulcanisation process to create cross-links within the rubber matrix.

==Allergic reactions==
{{Main|Latex allergy}}

Some people have a serious [[latex allergy]], and exposure to natural latex rubber products such as [[latex glove]]s can cause [[anaphylactic shock]]. The [[antibody generator|antigenic proteins]] found in ''Hevea'' latex may be deliberately reduced (though not eliminated)&lt;ref name=510k&gt;{{cite web|title=Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Testing for Skin Sensitization To Chemicals In Natural Rubber Products|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm073793.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through processing.

Latex from non-''[[Hevea]]'' sources, such as [[Guayule]], can be used without allergic reaction by persons with an allergy to ''Hevea'' latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm048052.htm|title=New Type of Latex Glove Cleared|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some allergic reactions are not to the latex itself, but from residues of chemicals used to accelerate the cross-linking process. Although this may be confused with an allergy to latex, it is distinct from it, typically taking the form of [[Type IV hypersensitivity]] in the presence of traces of specific processing chemicals.&lt;ref name=510k /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Latex Allergy Association|title=Allergy Fact Sheet|url=http://www.latexallergyresources.org/allergy-fact-sheet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ForensicScience|digital|image=NetworkTopologies.svg}}

'''Network forensics''' is a sub-branch of [[digital forensics]] relating to the monitoring and analysis of [[computer network]] traffic for the purposes of information gathering, legal evidence, or [[intrusion detection]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Palmer, A Road Map for Digital Forensic Research, Report from DFRWS 2001, First Digital Forensic Research Workshop, Utica, New York, August 7 – 8, 2001,  Page(s) 27–30&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other areas of digital forensics, network investigations deal with volatile and dynamic information. Network traffic is transmitted and then lost, so network forensics is often a pro-active investigation.&lt;ref name="casey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Eoghan|title=Digital Evidence and Computer Crime, Second Edition|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-12-163104-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xo8GMt_AbQsC&amp;hl=en&amp;dq=Digital%20Evidence%20and%20Computer%20Crime,%20Second%20Edition&amp;ei=it1XTMncCMm44gbC_qyFBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Network forensics generally has two uses. The first, relating to security, involves monitoring a network for anomalous traffic and identifying intrusions. An attacker might be able to erase all log files on a compromised host; network-based evidence might therefore be the only evidence available for forensic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Hjelmvik, Passive Network Security Analysis with NetworkMiner http://www.forensicfocus.com/passive-network-security-analysis-networkminer&lt;/ref&gt; The second form relates to law enforcement. In this case analysis of captured network traffic can include tasks such as reassembling transferred files, searching for keywords and parsing human communication such as emails or chat sessions.

Two systems are commonly used to collect network data; a brute force "catch it as you can" and a more intelligent "stop look listen" method.

==Overview==

Network forensics is a comparatively new field of forensic science. The growing popularity of the Internet in homes means that computing has become network-centric and data is now available outside of disk-based [[digital evidence]]. Network forensics can be performed as a standalone investigation or alongside a [[computer forensics]] analysis (where it is often used to reveal links between digital devices or reconstruct how a crime was committed).&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

Marcus Ranum is credited with defining Network forensics as "the capture, recording, and analysis of network events in order to discover the source of security attacks or other problem incidents".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Ranum, Network Flight Recorder, http://www.ranum.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to computer forensics, where evidence is usually preserved on disk, network data is more volatile and unpredictable. Investigators often only have material to examine if packet filters, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems were set up to anticipate breaches of security.&lt;ref name="casey" /&gt;

Systems used to collect network data for forensics use usually come in two forms:&lt;ref&gt;Simson Garfinkel, Network Forensics: Tapping the Internet http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/04/26/nettap.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Catch-it-as-you-can" – This is where all packets passing through a certain traffic point are captured and written to storage with analysis being done subsequently in batch mode. This approach requires large amounts of storage.
*"Stop, look and listen" – This is where each packet is analyzed in a rudimentary way in memory and only certain information saved for future analysis. This approach requires a faster [[Central processing unit|processor]] to keep up with incoming traffic.

==Types==

===Ethernet===
[[File:Wireshark screenshot.png|thumb|[[Wireshark]], a common tool used to monitor and record network traffic]]

Applying forensic methods on the [[Ethernet]] layer is done by eavesdropping bit streams with tools called monitoring tools or sniffers. The most common tool on this layer is [[Wireshark]] (formerly known as Ethereal) and [[tcpdump]] where [[tcpdump]] works mostly on [[unix-like]] operating systems. These tools collect all data on this layer and allows the user to filter for different events. With these tools, website pages, email attachments, and other network traffic can be reconstructed only if they are transmitted or received unencrypted. An advantage of collecting this data is that it is directly connected to a host. If, for example the IP address or the MAC address of a host at a certain time is known, all data sent to or from this IP or MAC address can be filtered.

To establish the connection between IP and MAC address, it is useful to take a closer look at auxiliary network protocols. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables list the MAC addresses with the corresponding IP addresses.

To collect data on this layer, the [[network interface card]] (NIC) of a host can be put into "[[promiscuous mode]]". In so doing, all traffic will be passed to the CPU, not only the traffic meant for the host.

However, if an intruder or attacker is aware that his connection might be eavesdropped, he might use encryption to secure his connection. It is almost impossible nowadays to break encryption but the fact that a suspect's connection to another host is encrypted all the time might indicate that the other host is an accomplice of the suspect.

===TCP/IP===

On the network layer the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) is responsible for directing the packets generated by [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] through the network (e.g., the Internet) by adding source and destination information which can be interpreted by routers all over the network. Cellular digital packet networks, like [[GPRS]], use similar protocols like IP, so the methods described for IP work with them as well.

For the correct routing, every intermediate [[Router (computing)|router]] must have a routing table to know where to send the packet next.
These routing tables are one of the best sources of information if investigating a digital crime and trying to track down an attacker. To do this, it is necessary to follow the packets of the attacker, reverse the sending route and find the computer the packet came from (i.e., the attacker).

===The Internet===
The internet can be a rich source of digital evidence including web browsing, email, [[newsgroup]], synchronous chat and [[peer-to-peer]] traffic. For example, web server logs can be used to show when (or if) a suspect accessed information related to criminal activity. Email accounts can often contain useful evidence; but email headers are easily faked and, so, network forensics may be used to prove the exact origin of incriminating material. Network forensics can also be used in order to find out who is using a particular computer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&amp;month=2011-01&amp;post=Facebook-SSL-and-Network-Forensics "Facebook, SSL and Network Forensics", NETRESEC Network Security Blog, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; by extracting user account information from the network traffic.

=={{visible anchor|Wireless forensics}}==
'''Wireless forensics''' is a sub-discipline of network forensics. The main goal of wireless forensics is to provide the methodology and tools required to collect and analyze (wireless) [[network traffic measurement|network traffic]] that can be presented as valid digital evidence in a court of law. The evidence collected can correspond to plain data or, with the broad usage of [[Voice-over-IP]] (VoIP) technologies, especially over wireless, can include voice conversations.

Analysis of wireless network traffic is similar to that on wired networks, however there may be the added consideration of wireless [[Wireless security|security measures]].

The '''''Official Languages Act''''' ([[Nehiyawin | Cree language]] : ''Wetsuweten |Dené]]) ''([[French language|French]] ''([[Inuvik]]: ''Loi sur les langues officielles'') (the ''Act'') is a [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]] that came into force on September 9, 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?m=/index&amp;nid=480459|title=40 Years of the Official Languages Act|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] equal status in the government of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html|title=Official Languages Act - 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.) |work=Act current to July 11th, 2010|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes them "official" languages, having preferred status in law over all other languages. Although the ''Official Languages Act'' is not the only piece of federal language law, it is the legislative keystone of [[official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's official bilingualism]]. It was substantially amended in 1988. Both languages are equal in Canada's government and in all the services it controls, such as the courts.

==Summary of main features==
The ''Act''&lt;ref&gt;Canada. [http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html ''Official Languages Act (1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.))]. Ottawa. Page consulted July 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  provides, among other things,
*that Canadians have the right to receive services from [[Structure of the Canadian federal government|federal departments]] and from [[Crown corporations]] in both official languages;
*that Canadians will be able to be heard before [[Court system of Canada|federal courts]] in the official language of their choice;
*that Parliament will adopt laws and to publish regulations in both official languages, and that both versions will be of equal legal weight;
*that English and French will have equal status of languages of work within the federal public service within geographically defined parts of the country that are designated bilingual (most notably in [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]], [[Montreal]] and [[New Brunswick]]), as well as in certain overseas government offices and in parts of the country where there is sufficient demand for services in both official languages. In remaining geographical areas, the language of work for federal public servants is French (in Quebec) and English (elsewhere);

The Federal government has set in place regulations establishing linguistic categories (anglophone, francophone, bilingual) for some job functions within the public service. Departments and agencies of the federal government are required to fill these positions with individuals who are capable of serving the public in English, in French, or in both languages.  Unilingual public servants are given incentives to learn the other official language, and the government provides language training and offers a "bilingualism bonus".

Part VI of the ''Act'' mandates that English-speaking Canadians and French-speaking Canadians not be discriminated against based on ethnic origin or first language learned when it comes to employment opportunities and advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-04|title=Official Languages Act - Part VI - Participation of English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010021011/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/op_ap/act_loi/ola_llo_annot/ola_llo_annot_e.htm|archivedate=2006-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law also created the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Commissioner of Official Languages]], an officer of Parliament charged with receiving complaints from the public, undertaking inquiries, and making recommendations regarding the status of the two official languages.

Section 32 of the ''Official Languages Act'' authorizes the Governor in Council (''i.e.'', the federal cabinet) to issue regulations defining the geographic regions in which services will be offered by the federal government in the relevant minority language (English in Quebec and French elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-17|title= Definition of English or French Linguistic Minority |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/SOR-92-48/bo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3//en#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a legal definition for the otherwise vague requirement that services be provided in the minority official languages wherever there is "significant demand." The definition used in the regulations is complex, but basically an area of the country is served in both languages if at least 5,000 persons in that area, or 5% of the local population (whichever is smaller), belongs to that province's English or French linguistic minority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=2007-04-17|title= Calculation of Population Numbers|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cr/SOR-92-48/bo-ga:l_I-gb:s_4//en#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations were first promulgated in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|date=2003-09-01|title=Official Languages Regulations|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/reg.asp?Lang=English|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110052520/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/legislation/reg.asp?Lang=English|archivedate=2006-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political context==
The ''Official Languages Act'' was one of the cornerstones of the government of [[Pierre Trudeau]]. The law was an attempt to implement some of the policy objectives outlined by the federally commissioned [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which had been established in 1963 and since that time had been issuing periodic reports on the inequitable manner in which Canada’s English-speaking and French-speaking populations were treated by the federal administration. At that time, only 9% of jobs within the federal public service were occupied by Francophones,&lt;ref&gt;Canada. Rapport de la Commission royale d’enquête sur le bilinguisme et le biculturalisme. Livre III : le monde du travail. Ottawa, Imprimeur de la Reine, 1969, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; even though French-speakers formed a quarter of the Canadian population. The proportion of jobs designated bilingual grew to 14% in 1978, and to 25% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Commissioner of Official Languages. ''[http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/ar_ra/2004_05/2004_05_f.htm#chap1.7 Annual Report, Special Edition 1969-2004. Volume I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523001350/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/ar_ra/2004_05/2004_05_f.htm |date=2006-05-23 }}''. Ottawa, 2006. {{ISBN|0-662-74073-4}}. Page 43263 consulted July 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important features of the 1969 act was to ensure that federal government services would be provided in both official languages, wherever population size warranted it.

Its principles were later incorporated into the ''[[Constitution of Canada]]'', in [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.

A new ''Official Languages Act'' was enacted in 1988 in order to achieve two objectives.

First, it was necessary to update the 1969 law to take into account the new language-related obligations that the federal government had undertaken under Sections 16-23 of the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', which had been enacted in 1982. For example,  [[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 20]] of the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' guarantees the right of the Canadian public to communicate in English and French with any central government office or with regional offices where there is "a significant demand for communication with and services from that office." Significant demand is not defined in the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms''. One of the purposes of the ''Official Languages Act'' of 1988 was to remedy this omission.

Second, the new law included provisions for the promotion by the government of Canada of Quebec’s [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking minority]] and of the [[French Canadian|French-speaking minorities]] in the rest of the country. The programs that fall under the "promotion" umbrella are often designed to encourage each provincial government to offer services to its official-language minority community, and contain a mechanism for transferring funds to the provincial governments in order to finance a part of these programs. Under Canada’s federal constitution, many important services, such as education and health, fall under provincial jurisdiction and are therefore off-limits to any direct federal spending. The transfer of federal funds, conditional upon the fulfilment by each provincial government of detailed conditions laid out in a funding agreement, is a constitutionally permitted method of dodging this jurisdictional constraint.

This would suggest that the ''Official Languages Act'' and Quebec's ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' (also known as "Bill 101") are fundamentally at cross-purposes with each other. However, that perspective is not universally accepted. For example, former Liberal leader [[Michael Ignatieff]] has stated that "Bill 101 and the ''Official Languages Act'' are not in opposition, they are complementary."&lt;ref&gt;Ignatieff made the comment at the Liberal Party of Canada's Quebec convention in early October, 2009. He is quoted in [[Don Macpherson (journalist)|Don Macpherson]], "NDP would add rights for French Quebecers", in the ''Montreal Gazette'', October 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Provincial legislatures===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2015}}
In 1969, the law was adopted with all-party support in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. Despite this, there was not universal support for the law. The premiers of the three Prairie provinces requested, early in 1969, that the Official Languages Bill be referred to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to determine its constitutionality. They maintained, along with JT Thorson, the former president of the [[Exchequer Court of Canada]], that the bill was outside the powers of the Parliament of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson's  arguments are discussed, and rejected, by [[Eugene Forsey]] in "The Constitutionality of the Official Languages Act", ''Globe and Mail'', February 8, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to the court was never made, but the legal question was resolved in 1974, when the Supreme Court ruled, in [[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick]], that the subject matter of the bill was within federal jurisdiction.

In subsequent decades the response from provincial governments to the example set by the federal government has been mixed:
*[[New Brunswick]], which is home to Canada’s second largest French-speaking minority population, adopted the federal government policy and adopted its own ''Official Languages Act'' shortly thereafter. The bilingual status of New Brunswick was strengthened in 1993 by [[section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|the addition of section 16.1 to the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'']].
*[[Ontario]], which is the home to Canada’s largest French-speaking minority, opted instead to enact a law (the ''[[French Language Services Act]]'') which provides for services of the provincial government to be made available in certain geographically designated regions, but which does not give the French language either a symbolic or an authoritative status as an equal "official" language of Ontario.
*[[Manitoba]], which is home to Canada’s third-largest French-speaking minority, refused to overturn its ban on the use of French in both the provincial legislature and its courts (which had been in effect since 1890), until it was forced to do so in 1985 by a ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] (''[[Reference re Manitoba Language Rights]]'') that the province was under a constitutional obligation to enact laws in French as well as in English.
*[[Quebec]], which is home to an English-speaking minority of over half a million, had traditionally been the only province which was generous in its treatment of its minority-language population, and for this reason had been cited by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism as the model to be emulated by other provinces. But in the 1970s the provincial legislature adopted two laws, the [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|''Official Language Act'']] (also known as "Bill 22") and the [[Charter of the French Language]] (also known as "Bill 101"), reducing the access of Quebecers to English-language services, preventing immigrants and Francophones from enrolling their children in English schools, requiring that French be made the language of the workplace, and restricting the use of English on commercial signs.

===Public reactions===
Public support for bilingual services had dramatically increased between the mid-1960s and the end of the 1970s. There was no direct polling on the popularity of the ''Official Languages Act'' itself at the time, but poll data on related questions gives an indication of a significant shift in the attitudes of English-speaking Canadians. A 1965 poll showed that 17% of Canadians living outside Quebec favoured the use of public funds to finance French-language schools. This proportion had risen to 77% by 1977 (albeit in response to a slightly different question about support for provincial governments offering services in French "where possible").&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Parkin and André Turcotte. ''[http://www.cubiq.ribg.gouv.qc.ca/in/faces/details.xhtml?id=p%3A%3Ausmarcdef_0001010009 Le bilinguisme : Appartient-il au passé ou à l’avenir ?]'', Centre de recherche et d'information sur le Canada, mars 2004, p. 9. Page consulted July 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Quebec, changes to the treatment of French-speakers within the federal public service were met with approval mixed with a scepticism that this actually helped the unilingual French-speaking majority of Quebecers, who continued to be excluded from all federal jobs designated "bilingual", since by definition a "bilingual" job requires the use of English, and is therefore closed to a unilingual Francophone.

However, the changes found some opposition in English Canada. ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' columnist Braithwaither sums up the position of the opponents of the bill like this: "We are not afraid of any aspect of the language bill, we simply regard it as unnecessary, politically-motivated, costly to implement, divisive, and, as it affects the non-English, non-french third of the population, wholly discriminatory."&lt;ref&gt;Graham Fraser, ''Sorry, I don't Speak French'', McLelland &amp; Steward, LDT, Toronto, ON, 2006: p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the bill, some positions in the public sector were designated as bilingual. At the implementation of the bill, if a bilingual position was held by an unilingual anglophone, this person was allowed to keep its position at the condition that they attempted to learn French, and all subsequent holders of this positions must be bilingual. Under these circumstances, there were fears that, because of the higher rate of bilingualism among Francophones, people whose first official language is French would become overrepresented in the public sector. However, this has not become the case. The ratio of French first official language speakers to English first official language speakers in the public sector is almost the same as in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey/2014-public-service-employee-survey-respondent-distribution-demographic-characteristics.html|title=2014 Public Service Employee Survey Respondent Distribution by Demographic Characteristics|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;A=R&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=4&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=01&amp;GL=-1&amp;GID=1159582&amp;GK=1&amp;GRP=1&amp;O=D&amp;PID=110461&amp;PRID=10&amp;PTYPE=109445&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2016&amp;THEME=118&amp;VID=24705&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0|title=Data tables, 2016 Canadian Census   First Official Language Spoken (5), Language Spoken Most Often at Home (10), Other Language(s) Spoken Regularly at Home (11), Knowledge of Official Languages (5) and Age (7) for the Population Excluding Institutional Residents of Canada, Provinces and Territories, Census Divisions and Census Subdivisions, 2016 Census|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At any rate, the adoption of official bilingualism at the federal level did almost nothing to slow the rise of the sovereignist movement. The nationalist '''[[Parti Québécois]]''' made its first significant electoral breakthrough less than a year after the ''Official Languages Act'' was adopted, winning 23% of the vote in Quebec’s [[Quebec general election, 1970|1970 provincial election]] and replacing the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] as the main electoral vehicle for [[Quebec nationalism]]. Six years later, the Parti Québécois came to power in the [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976 provincial election]].

== Failure to implement all provisions of the ''Official Languages Act'' ==
From time to time, the Official Languages Commissioner draws attention to the fact that federal agencies subject to the law are failing to live up to their legal obligations regarding official languages. In a report published in 2004 on the 35th anniversary of the ''Official Languages Act'', Commissioner [[Dyane Adam]] noted that only 86% of posts designated "bilingual" in the federal public service were occupied by persons who had effectively mastered the two official languages. This nevertheless was an increase over the comparable figure of 1978, when only 70% of the incumbents in posts that had been designated "bilingual" were capable of speaking both languages at accepted levels.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Commissariat aux langues officielles. ''[http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/archives/ar_ra/2004_05/2004_05_f.htm#chap1.7 Rapport annuel édition spéciale 1969-2004.

Page consulted July 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages]] had received 14 complaints related to Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]]'s use of English and French during public [[town hall meeting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/01/19/language-complaints-filed-over-trudeau-s-french-answers-to-english-questions_n_14268222.html|title=Trudeau's French Answers To English Questions Yield Language Complaints|date=2017-01-19|work=HuffPost Canada|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven of the reports came following a session in [[Sherbrooke]], Quebec, where Trudeau, whose father had enacted the ''Official Languages Act'' fifty years prior, answered in French when he was asked in English to address a lack of government-provided [[mental health]] services for English-speaking persons.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtube.com/8cpc6JtENOE&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining three were attributed to Trudeau answering in English to a question asked in French while in [[Peterborough, Ontario]].

== Opinion polls ==

According to a poll conducted in 2002, 98% of Quebecers consider official bilingualism to be "very important" or "somewhat important". This proportion drops to 76% in the Atlantic provinces, 72% in Ontario, 67% in the Prairie provinces, and 63% in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Parkin and André Turcotte. ''[http://www.cubiq.ribg.gouv.qc.ca/in/faces/details.xhtml?id=p%3A%3Ausmarcdef_0001010009 Le bilinguisme : Appartient-il au passé ou à l’avenir ?]'', Centre de recherche et d'information sur le Canada, mars 2004, p. 6. Page consulted July 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll, conducted in 2000, shows that more than half of Canadians outside Quebec believe that too much effort has gone into promoting bilingualism. By contrast, only 26% of Quebecers shared this view.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Parkin and André Turcotte. ''[http://www.cubiq.ribg.gouv.qc.ca/in/faces/details.xhtml?id=p%3A%3Ausmarcdef_0001010009 Le bilinguisme : Appartient-il au passé ou à l’avenir ?]'', Centre de recherche et d'information sur le Canada, mars 2004, p. 11. Page consulted July 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted in 2012 found that 63% of Canadians were in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada, a 9% increase since that same poll was last conducted in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officiallanguages.gc.ca/en/publications/other/2016/official-languages-and-bilingualism-survey-research|title=Official languages and bilingualism survey research presentation|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, another poll was conducted, showing increasing support for Official bilingualism in every province. Among telephone respondents, 88% of Canadians said they "strongly support" or "somewhat support" the aims of the ''Official Languages Act'': 91% in the Atlantic, 94% in [[Quebec]], 87% in [[Ontario]], 83% in the Prairies, 90% in [[Alberta]] and 84% in British Columbia. 84% of telephone respondents also said they personally "strongly support" or "somewhat support" official bilingualism.  The results were more mixed in the online portion of the poll, where 78% of respondents said they "strongly support" or "somewhat support" the aims of the ''Official Languages Act'', and 73% said they personally "strongly support" or "somewhat support" official bilingualism. In another poll conducted on this topic in the same year, 67% of respondents across Canada answered "yes" to the question "Are you personally in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?" while 31% said "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officiallanguages.gc.ca/en/publications/other/2016/official-languages-and-bilingualism-survey-research|title=Official languages and bilingualism survey research presentation|publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1162">The '''Parliamentary Elections Act 1770''' (also known as the '''Grenville Act''') is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] (10 Geo III c. 16). The Act transferred the power of trying [[election petition]]s from the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] to the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Judiciary]]. All contested elections were to be considered by a committee of thirteen members selected by ballot. The Act was initially limited to one year, but was extended several times. A bill was passed in 1774 to make it perpetual — by that time five cases had already been tried.

This Act was repealed by section 1 of the Controverted Elections Act 1828 (9 Geo. IV c. 22).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9207">A '''peremptory norm''' (also called '''''jus cogens''''' or '''''ius cogens''''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|dʒ|ʌ|s|_|ˈ|k|oʊ|dʒ|ɛ|n|z|,_|ˌ|j|ʌ|s}};&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jus+cogens&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] for "compelling law") is a fundamental principle of [[international law]] that is accepted by the international community of [[sovereign state|states]] as a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] from which no [[derogation]] is permitted.

There is no universal agreement regarding precisely which norms are ''jus cogens'' nor how a norm reaches that status, but it is generally accepted that ''jus cogens'' includes the prohibition of [[genocide]], maritime [[piracy]], enslaving in general (to include [[slavery]] as well as the [[slave trade]]), [[torture]], [[refoulement]] and [[war of aggression|wars of aggression and territorial aggrandizement]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Status of peremptory norms under international law==
Unlike ordinary [[Customary international law|customary law]], which has traditionally required consent and allows the alteration of its obligations between states through [[treaty|treaties]], peremptory norms cannot be violated by any state "through international treaties or local or special customs or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force".&lt;ref&gt;Prosecutor v.

Discussions of the necessity of such norms could be traced as far as 1758 (Emmerich de Vattel, Droit des gens) and 1764 (Christian Wolff, Jus Gentium), clearly rooting from principles of [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Czapliński. Jus Cogens and the Law of Treaties. In C. Tomuschat and J. M. Thouvenin (eds). 2006. The Fundamental Rules of the International Legal Order. Netherlands: Koninklijke Brill NV, pp. 83–98&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was the judgments of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] that indicate the existence of such a peremptory norm.  In the [http://www.icj-cij.org/pcij/serie_A/A_01/03_Wimbledon_Arret_08_1923.pdf Wimbledon Case] in 1923, not mentioning peremptory norms explicitly but stating how state sovereignty is not inalienable.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni. 2011. Crimes Against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 266, see also Wimbledon Case, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 53 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], any treaty that conflicts with a peremptory norm is void.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 53, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331, 8 ''International Legal Materials''  679 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty allows for the emergence of new peremptory norms,&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 64, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S 331, 8 ''International Legal Materials''  679 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; but does not specify any peremptory norms. It does mention the prohibition on the threat of use of force and on the use of coercion to conclude an agreement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character."&lt;ref&gt;U.N. Doc. A/CONF.39/27 (1969), repinted in 63 Am. J. Int'l L. 875 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of peremptory norms is considered limited but not exclusively catalogued. They are not listed or defined by any authoritative body, but arise out of case law and changing social and political attitudes. Generally included are prohibitions on waging [[War of aggression|aggressive war]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], maritime [[piracy]], [[genocide]], [[Crime of apartheid|apartheid]], [[slavery]], [[torture]]. As an example, international tribunals have held that it is impermissible for a state to acquire territory through war.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Bossuyt en Jan Wouters (2005): ''Grondlijnen van internationaal recht'', Intersentia, Antwerpen enz., p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"&gt;Prosecutor v. Furundžija, International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, 2002, 121 ''International Law Reports'' 213 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the seemingly clear weight of condemnation of such practices, some critics disagree with the division of international legal norms into a hierarchy. There is also disagreement over how such norms are recognized or established. The relatively new concept of peremptory norms seems to be at odds with the traditionally consensual nature of international law considered necessary to state [[sovereignty]].

Some peremptory norms define criminal offences considered to be enforceable against not only states but also individuals. That has been increasingly accepted since the [[Nuremberg Trials]] (the first enforcement in world history of international norms upon individuals) and now might be considered uncontroversial. However, the language of peremptory norms was not used in connection with these trials, rather the basis of criminalisation and punishment of Nazi atrocities, was that civilisation could not tolerate their being ignored because it could not survive their being repeated.

There are often disagreements over whether a particular case violates a peremptory norm. As in other areas of law, states generally reserve the right to interpret the concept for themselves.

Many large states have accepted this concept. Some of them have ratified the Vienna Convention, while others have stated in their official statements that they accept the Vienna Convention as "codificatory". Some have applied the concept in their dealings with international organizations and other states.

==Examples==

===Execution of juvenile offenders===
The case of ''[[Michael Domingues v. United States]]'' provides an example of an international body's opinion that a particular norm is of a ''jus cogens'' nature. Michael Domingues had been convicted and sentenced to death in [[Nevada]], United States for two murders committed when he was 16 years old. Domingues brought the case in front of the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]] which delivered a non-legally binding report.&lt;ref name="The Michael Domingues Case 2001"&gt;The Michael Domingues Case: Argument of the United States, Office of the Legal Adviser, United States Department of State, ''Digest of United States Practice in International Law 2001'', pp. 303, 310–13&lt;/ref&gt; The United States argued that there was no ''jus cogens'' norm that "establishes eighteen years as the minimum age at which an offender can receive a sentence of death".&lt;ref name="The Michael Domingues Case 2001"/&gt; The Commission concluded that there was a "''jus cogens'' norm not to impose capital punishment on individuals who committed their crimes when they had not yet reached 18 years of age."&lt;ref&gt;The Michael Domingues Case: Report on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Report No. 62/02, Merits, Case 12.285 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has subsequently banned the execution of juvenile offenders. Although not necessarily in response to the above non-binding report, the Supreme Court cited evolving international norms as one of the reasons for the ban (''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'').

===Torture===
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] stated in ''Prosecutor v. Furundžija'' that there is a ''jus cogens'' for the prohibition against torture.&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"/&gt; It also stated that every state is entitled "to investigate, prosecute and punish or extradite individuals accused of torture, who are present in a territory under its jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Prosecutor v. Furundžija 2002"/&gt;  Therefore, there is universal jurisdiction over torture. The rationale for this is that "the torturer has become, like the pirate and the slave trader before him, ''[[hostis humani generis]]'', an enemy of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Janis, M. and Noyes, J. International Law": Cases and Commentary (3rd ed.), Prosecutor v. Furundžija, Page 148 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persons and family relations''' is one of the subjects covered in [[civil law (area)|civil law]] in the [[Philippine Bar Examinations]].

==Scope==
Persons and family relations mainly deals with the issues of family matters such as marriage, annulment and voiding of marriages, adoption, property settlements between spouses, parental authority, support for spouses and children, emancipation, legitimes (inheritance) of children from their parents and between relatives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabuya|first=Elmer T|title=The Law on Persons and Family Relations|year=2006|publisher=Rex Bookstore|location=Manila|isbn=971-23-4551-3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the most important coverage of this subjects is the [[Family Code of the Philippines]], or Executive Order 209, which was enacted by former president [[Corazon Aquino]] on July 6, 1987 (taking effectivity one year later after the completion of its official publication). The main reason for enacting this code was to replace the first book of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]] which covers relations between persons, and family.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sempio-Dy|first=Alicia|title=Handbook on the Family Code of the Philippines|year=1988|publisher=Quezon City|location=Central Law Book Publishing Co., Inc|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Based on the Family Code, a valid marriage requires certain essential and formal requisites. Essential requisites to marriage include legal capacity to marry and consent. Formal requisites include a valid marriage license, authority of solemnizing officer and a marriage ceremony where the contracting parties personally appear before the solemnizing officer and declare that they take each other as husband and wife in the presence of two witnesses of legal age.

Absence of any of the essential and formal requisites renders a marriage void ''ab initio'' (from the beginning), except in cases such as contracting parties in good faith believed that the solemnizing officer (who had no authority to solemnize the marriage) had the authority to solemnize marriage. Thus a marriage between minors or to a minor is void. Similarly, a marriage without a valid marriage license (except in certain circumstances) is void.

A defect in the essential requisites renders the marriage voidable and thus can be subject to annulment. Irregularities in the formal requisites does not affect the validity of the marriage but renders the parties responsible for such irregularities to be civilly, criminally or administratively liable.

However, there are cases where some of the formal requisites are not required, which usually happens in exceptional circumstances. An example is when the parties contracting marriage are living in a remote area inaccessible to any viable means of transport, such that it renders impossible the acquisition of a marriage license. In such cases, a valid marriage license may not be required. The same is also true for ethnic marriages which can forgo the need for a valid marriage license, provided they conform to the customs for such ethnic marriages.

==Annulment==
A marriage can be annulled if there is a defect in the essential requisites. Consent obtained through fraud, deceit or violence, for example, can annul the marriage. Similarly, an individual below 21 years old who contracts to marry but does not obtain parental consent can also have their marriage annulled within the prescribed period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1642">The '''Royal Court Table''' ({{lang-hr|Kraljevski sudbeni stol}}) of [[Zagreb]] was the main court of [[first instance]] in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] between 1850 and 1918.

The [[Habsburg Monarchy]] reorganized its judiciary in 1850 when the [[Tabula Banalis]] ([[Ban of Croatia|Ban]]'s Table) became the [[appellate court]] for all courts in Croatia and Slavonia, including the Land Court (''{{lang|hr|Zemaljski sud}}''), renamed to the Royal County Court Table (''{{lang|hr|Kraljevski županijski sudbeni stol}}'') in 1862, and finally the Royal Court Table according to the Organization of Courts of the First Instance Act dated November 21, 1874. It was the court of [[first instance]] with [[criminal law|criminal]] and major [[Civil law (Civil law)|civil]] [[jurisdiction]], while the subordinate courts from the area of [[central Croatia]] used it as an [[appellate court]] until 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.daz.hr/vodic/b-pravosudje/b2-pravosudje-od-1848-do-1918/208-hr-dazg-84-sudbeni-stol-u-zagrebu | language = Croatian | title = HR-DAZG-84 Sudbeni stol u Zagrebu | publisher = [[Croatian State Archives]] | date = 2008-10-28 | accessdate = 2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1862 the [[supreme court]] of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] 
was the '''Table of Seven''' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Stol sedmorice'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4467">The '''Russia–Korea Treaty of 1884''' was negotiated between representatives of Russia and Korea.

==Background==
In 1876, Korea established a trade treaty with Japan after Japanese ships approached [[Ganghwado]] and threatened to fire on the Korean capital city. Treaty negotiations with several Western countries were made possible by the completion of this initial Japanese overture.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chun-gil. (2005). {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|''The History of Korea,'' pp. 107-108.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the Americans concluded a treaty and established diplomatic relations,&lt;ref&gt;Yŏng-ho Ch'oe ''et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|A9LoA9L1ABcC|''Sources of Korean Tradition,'' p. 235|page=235}}; excerpt, "''Korea signed a similar accord with the United States (the ''Treaty of Chelump'o'', 1882) that was followed by similar agreements with other Western nations'';" Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921-1922. (1922). {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|''Korea's Appeal to the Conference on Limitation of Armament,'' p. 29.|page=29}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Korea. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation dated May 22, 1882."&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a template for subsequent negotiations with other Western powers.

==Treaty provisions==
The Russians and Koreans negotiated and approved a multi-article treaty with provisions similar to other Western nations.&lt;ref name="mission32"&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 32.|page=32}}; excerpt, "Treaty and Diplomatic Relations Between Korea and Russia. Treaty of Amity and Commerce dated June 24, 1884"; Kim, {{Google books|hauDIGtLbnsC|p. 107.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministers from Russia to Korea were appointed in accordance with this treaty; and they were: [[Karl Ivanovich Weber]], appointed October 14, 1885; [[Alexey Shpeyer]], appointed March 28, 1898;&lt;ref name="mission32"/&gt; [[Paul Pavlov]],&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Denis Ashton. (2002). {{Google books|-AE-xG7Z3gYC|''The Tide at Sunrise,'' p. 214.|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; appointed December 13, 1898.&lt;ref name="mission32"/&gt;

The treaty remained in effect even after [[Korea under Japanese rule|a Japanese protectorate was established]] over Korea in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|p. 36.|page=36}}; excerpt, "''Official rescript issued by Japan, November 22, 1905, declares: 'In bringing this agreement to the notice of the powers having treaties with Korea, the Imperial Government declares that * * * they will see that these treaties are maintained and respected, and they also engage not to prejudice In any way the legitimate commercial and industrial interests of those powers in Korea'.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''SCO Group v. DaimlerChrysler''''' was a lawsuit filed in the [[United States]], in the state of [[Michigan]]. In December 2003, [[SCO Group|SCO]] sent a number of letters to [[Unix]] licensees. In these letters, SCO demanded that the licensees certify certain things regarding their usage of [[Linux]]. [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]], a former Unix user and current Linux user, did not respond to this letter. On March 3, 2004, SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their Unix license agreement, by failing to respond to the certification request made by SCO.  The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal order on December 21, 2004. The case was dismissed without prejudice, but if SCO wishes to pursue the timeliness claim again, it must pay DaimlerChrysler's legal fees since August 9. On December 29, 2004, SCO filed a claim of appeal notice. On January 31, 2005, the claim of appeal was dismissed.

==History==
For use on their [[Cray supercomputer]], [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]] bought a Unix source license from [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] on September 2, 1988. A source license allows the licensee to view, modify and use the Unix [[source code]] on a number of specific machines (designated [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s).

Through a number of acquisitions, The SCO Group became the licensing agent that handled Unix source licenses. Chrysler Motors Corporations merged with [[Daimler-Benz]] in 1998 forming [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]].

==Background information==
The licenses sold by AT&amp;T allow the licensor to ask for certification regarding the use of the licensed product.

:''On [SCO's] request, but not more frequently than annually, LICENSEE shall furnish to [SCO] a statement, certified by an authorized representative of LICENSEE, listing the location, type and serial number of all DESIGNATED CPUs hereunder and stating that the use by LICENSEE of SOFTWARE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement has been reviewed and that each such SOFTWARE PRODUCT is being used solely on DESIGNATED CPUs (or temporarily on back-up CPUs) for such SOFTWARE PRODUCTS in full compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.''

The SCO Group invoked their right to ask for certification on December 18, 2003. In addition to the certification specified in the license, SCO also instructed the Unix licensees to certify their use of Linux, a competing operating system. 

DaimlerChrysler did not respond to this letter.  In fact, it is possible that DaimlerChrysler never received it;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040317183640185#c100728|title=SCO used wrong address!

&lt;/ref&gt; into a massive, {{convert|4400000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center|headquarters complex]] (1000 Chrysler Drive) in nearby [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] between 1993-1996.  The company closed down its Highland Park facilities in 1997.  

The name of the company, too had changed: "Chrysler Motors Corporation" had become part of [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] when it merged with [[Daimler-Benz]] AG in 1998.  The former Chrysler operations were now referred to informally as "the Chrysler Group", but were legally known as [[Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC]].

==The lawsuit==
On March 3, 2004, The SCO Group filed a ''[[breach of contract]]'' lawsuit against DaimlerChrysler. In its complaint, SCO claimed that DaimlerChrysler refused to comply with the terms of the license. SCO also speculated that DaimlerChrysler broke the licensing agreement when they moved to the Linux [[operating system]] and that this is the reason why they refused to certify.

DaimlerChrysler responded with a motion for [[summary judgment]] on April 15, 2004. DaimlerChrysler claimed that the letter sent by SCO asked for certifications that were not agreed upon in the original licensing agreement, such as certifications about the use of Linux. Additionally DaimlerChrysler claimed that the original licensing agreement does not mention a specific time in which a licensee should respond to a certification request. DaimlerChrysler also told the court that it had not been contacted by SCO after receiving the letter, instead SCO filed suit without further attempts to receive any certifications.

At the same time, DaimlerChrysler also responded by certifying their use of Unix, according to the provisions specified in the original licensing agreement. In this certification DaimlerChrysler revealed that they have not used Unix for over 7 years.

On August 9, 2004, Judge Chabot granted the summary disposition almost completely. The only remaining issue on the case was whether DaimlerChrysler's response was submitted in a timely manner. On November 17, 2004, SCO moved to stay its suit pending SCO v. IBM case, but was denied.

The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal order on December 21, 2004. The case was dismissed without [[prejudice (law)|prejudice]], but if SCO wishes to pursue the timeliness claim again, it must pay DaimlerChrysler's legal fees since August 9. On December 29, 2004, SCO filed a claim of [[appeal]] notice. On January 31, 2005, the claim of appeal was dismissed.

'''Starrett City Associates''' is a group of investors, led by [[Disque Deane]], that owned the [[Starrett City, Brooklyn|Starrett City]] housing complex in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] until 2008. The firm is best known for unsuccessfully defending a landmark civil rights lawsuit that concerned "[[reverse discrimination]]" and [[racial quota]]s in the housing complex, and for controversy during the sale of the development in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="JacksonKeller2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth T. Jackson|author2=Lisa Keller|author3=Nancy Flood|title=The Encyclopedia of New York City: Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI5ERUmHf3YC&amp;pg=PT5716|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-18257-6|page=1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Starrett City, Brooklyn|Starrett City]] was constructed from 1972 to 1975, as part of the Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Act to develop the area now known as [[Spring Creek, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=JacksonKeller2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GatewayIIFEIS-2009&gt;{{cite web|author1=AKRF, Inc., Eng-Wong Taub &amp; Associates, Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, Inc.|title=FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT for GATEWAY ESTATES II|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/developers/environmental-review.page|website=[[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]|publisher=[[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development]]|accessdate=November 16, 2015|date=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was built, Starrett City was the largest housing development in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4lawschool.com/property/us.shtml U.S. v. Starrett City Associates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and remains the largest federally subsidized apartment complex.&lt;ref name=JacksonKeller2010 /&gt;

===Discrimination charges===
In 1980, the [[NAACP]] initiated a class-action suit against Starrett City Associates and charged that the owner of the housing complex attempted to maintain racial quotas by selective approval of tenants based on racial and ethnic profiles.  The quotas caused minority applicants to wait longer than white applicants for spaces in the complex.  Starrett City Associates argued that the quotas were necessary to maintain racial balance.  In other words, if the quotas had not been in place, the population would have been disproportionately non-white. The [[New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal]] was also named as a defendant in the suit because it had oversight of the public money spent to build the project and allowed the quotas to exist. The case was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the fall of 1988, and the court ruled against Starrett.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/1988/sg880385.txt United States Department of Justice, Supreme Court Brief No. 88-82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Starrett proposed to make apartments available to Soviet Jews who came to the United States in order to maintain racial diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Finder | first=Alan | title=Brooklyn Landlord, To Keep Racial Mix, Looks to Soviet Jews | website=The New York Times | date=1990-07-24 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/24/nyregion/brooklyn-landlord-to-keep-racial-mix-looks-to-soviet-jews.html | access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of Starrett City===

In early 2007, Starrett City Associates attempted to sell Starrett City for $1.3 billion to [[Clipper Equity LLC]], a partnership of [[David Bistricer]] and Sam Levinson.  The sale was ultimately unsuccessful due to public opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NY State Housing Chief Rejects New Starrett City Bid

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">The '''Treaty of Epe''' was a treaty between Great Britain (represented by [[Benjamin Campbell (consular agent)|Benjamin Campbell]], Consul in Lagos and Thomas Miller Commander of ''HMS Crane'') and [[Kosoko]] on September 28, 1854.

==Background==
On December 26, 1851, in what is now known as the [[Bombardment of Lagos]] or [[Reduction of Lagos]] Britain intervened in Lagos politics by executing naval action against [[Kosoko]], then [[Oba of Lagos]], ousting him, and installing Oba [[Akitoye]] who had promised to embrace abolition.  On January 1, 1852 Akitoye signed the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] abolishing the slave trade.

Kosoko fled to Epe and built up an independent base with about 400 warriors and mounted multiple attacks on Lagos; one on August 5, 1853 and another on August 11, 1853 which came dangerously close to the Oba's palace but was rebuffed just in time by a burst of fire from the British naval force under Commander Phillips of ''HMS Polyphemus''.

After much negotiation, Kosoko eventually signed the Treaty of Epe on September 28, 1854 with Consul [[Benjamin Campbell (consular agent)|Benjamin Campbell]], agreeing not to make any claims to Lagos or to endanger commerce in Lagos. The treaty was a tactical success for Kosoko who got the British to recognize his state in Epe. In the big picture, however, the Lagos throne remained out of reach with Akitoye and Dosunmu's descendants firmly rooted.

==Treaty text==
The text of the treaty is transcribed below:&lt;ref name=Smith-Appendix&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate 1851-1861|publisher=University of California Press, 1979|isbn=9780520037465|pages=138-139 Appendix B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Agreement entered into this 28th day of September 1854 between Kosoko his Caboceers and Chiefs and Chiefs, and Benjamin Campbell Esquire Her Brittanic Majesty’s Consul for the Bight of Benin, and Thomas Miller Esquire Commander H.M.S. Sloop “Crane” Senior Officer of the Bights of Benin and Biafra.''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''1st. Kosoko his Caboceers and Chiefs solemnly pledge themselves to make no attempt to regain possession of Lagos either by threats, hostilities or strategem''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''2nd. Kosoko his Caboceers and Chiefs claim Palma, as their port of trade, and Benjamin Campbell Esquire Her Brittanic Majesty’s Consul, and Thomas Miller Esquire Commander and Senior Naval Officer in the Bights, engage to recognize Palma, as the port of Kosoko and his Caboceers and Chiefs, for all purposes of legitimate trade. ''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''3rd. Kosoko his Caboceers and Chiefs do most solemnly pledge themselves to abandon the slave trade, that is the export of slaves from Africa, also not to allow any slave trader to reside at their port or any other place within their jurisdiction and influence''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''4th. Kosoko his Caboceers and Chiefs solemnly bind themselves to give every protection and assistance to such merchants and traders as may wish to reside among them for the purpose of carrying on legitimate trade - also to assist her Brittanic Majesty’s Consul to reopen markets on the Jaboo shore viz Agienu, Ecorodu, and Aboyee, and in maintaining order and security at those markets.''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''5th. There shall be levied at the Port of Palma, an export duty of one head of cowries for every Puncheon of Palm Oil of the average size of one hundred and twenty gallons and two strings of cowries per lb. on all Ivory exported from the above Port for the benefit of Kosoko.''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''6th. Benjamin Campbell Esquire Her Brittanic Majesty’s Consul engages on behalf of her Majesty’s Government that for the due and faithful performance of this engagement on the part of Kosoko his Caboceers and Chiefs there shall be paid to Kosoko by her Majesty’s Government an annual allowance for his life of Two thousand heads of cowries or one thousand dollars at his option.''
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
''7th. This engagement to have full force and effect from this day and until annulled by Her Brittanic Majesty’s Government.''

The '''Universal National Service Act''' is the name of at least four bills proposed in the [[United States Congress]] (in 2003, 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2013), sponsored by Congressman [[Charles Rangel]] of New York, proposing mandatory national service for young adults, male or female. Other advocates for mandatory national service include Senator [[Chris Dodd]], along with author [[Larry J. Sabato]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government. [http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/748/text "H.R. 748 - Universal National Service Act"], ''[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]'', Washington DC, 6 March 2013. Retrieved on 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universal National Service Act of 2003 ==
The Universal National Service Act of 2003 ({{USBill|108|H.R.|163}}, {{USBill|108|S.|89}}) was a bill to resume the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]] in the [[United States]], introduced in the 2003 session of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The bill would have provided that, as early as June 2005, young men and women ages 18–26 could be called to service. Section 6 of the bill does not include college enrollment in the list of valid deferments and postponements of being drafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|108|H.R.|163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure was introduced by representative [[Charles B. Rangel|Charles Rangel]], a leader in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and co-sponsored by five other Democrats. On October 5, 2004, Republicans called for a vote on the bill. The bill was considered under a [[Suspension of the rules in the United States Congress|motion to suspend the rules]], which required a two-thirds vote for passage for the roll call vote to take place. The roll call vote on the bill was 2 in favor, 402 against. The only Members voting "aye" were [[Jack Murtha]] and [[Pete Stark]].

Observers largely believe that Rangel, knowing beforehand that the bill would never be passed by the House, introduced it only to make a point. Rangel himself argued that the point of his bill was to express his opposition to the war in Iraq. In an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Rangel said "if those calling for war knew that their children were likely to be required to serve&amp;mdash;and to be placed in harm's way&amp;mdash;there would be more caution and a greater willingness to work with the international community in dealing with Iraq." (See [http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2004/10/05/University/Bush-Kerry.Appear.To.Dismiss.Draft.Bill-742042.shtml dailytexanonline.com]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002058054_pitts10.html seattletimes.nwsource.com])

Some commentators opined that the bill figured in a "[[scare campaign]]" to convince US voters that Republicans (or specifically the [[White House]]) had secret plans to re-institute conscription after the November 2 elections. For example, [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]], a columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'', claimed on May 31, 2004, that the bill is "currently approved and sitting in the Committee for Armed Services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1228331,00.html "Draft Dilemma"] ''The Guardian'', 31 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He further predicted that the draft itself would be implemented as early as June 15, 2005. [[William R. Hawkins|William Hawkins]], a columnist for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', denies that the bill was ever approved and claims that when Republicans brought it to the floor on October 5, it was for the express purpose of killing it.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20041020-092925-8406r.htm "Draft Duplicity"] ''The Washington Times'', 21 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal National Service Act of 2006==
[[National Service Act of 2006|The Universal National Service Act of 2006]] ({{USBill|109|H.R.|4752}}) introduced February 14, 2006. [[New York (state)|New York]] Democratic Representative Charles Rangel again called for the draft to be reinstated. It required men and women 18–42 to perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for "other purposes". Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]] had rejected this proposal. It had no sponsors.

== Universal National Service Act of 2007==
The Universal National Service Act of 2007 ({{USBill|110|H.R.|393}}) is a bill introduced by [[Charles B. Rangel]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on January 10, 2007. It proposes the requirement that all residents in the United States aged between 18 and 42 carry out [[national service]], and be available for [[conscription]] during wartime. It allows no deferments after age 20.

When the bill was introduced, it was referred to House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means. On February 26, it was then referred to the [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel]].

As of December 12, 2007, the bill had two co-sponsors. They are Rep. [[Yvette Clarke]] (D-NY) and Rep. [[Jim McDermott|James McDermott]] (D-WA).

[[Larry J. Sabato]] put forth a similar proposal in his 2007 book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'', with the primary difference being that Sabato's requirement would have been written into the Constitution instead of existing solely as a legislative mandate.

=== 2008 Presidential Campaign ===
This bill has become the subject of blogosphere speculation in the 2008 Presidential Race after Democratic candidates [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] both appeared to give some support for such legislation. During an MTV/MySpace forum on February 19, 2008, Hillary Clinton, when asked about education expenses, stated, "I'm in favor of two years of national service, where you could earn up to $10,000 a year doing national service and go right into helping you pay for college." In a follow-up comment, Barack Obama then stated, "one of the things that I've proposed, for example, is that I will give a $4000 tuition credit--every student, every year--so that they are not being loaded up with enormous debts, but there will be a community service--a national service component. The military could be one way for you to get this $4000 tuition credit. Another way would be to work in an under-served school that needs help. Another way would be to work in an under-served hospital or a homeless shelter, or a veterans home. The point is, I think it is important for young people to serve."

On July 2, 2008, in a [https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/07/02/obamas-remarks-on-service/ speech] at Colorado Springs, Barack Obama (as presumptive Democratic Party nominee) made another reference to such legislation when he called for the creation of a nationwide civilian service program, by explaining his vision of a national service program similar to the one he outlined in the MTV/MySpace forum, saying he would make federal assistance to schools contingent to school districts establishing service programs, with a goal of 50 h of service per year for middle school and high school students and 100 h of service per year for college students. He also expanded on his proposed program, calling for all ages to participate in an expansion of existing voluntary national service programs, and creation of new ones, in many areas, such as infrastructure rebuilding, service to the elderly, and environmental cleanup. Obama's entire service program proposal quickly became controversial, largely for being mistaken as a call for a national paramilitary force, though the proposal's only reference to military service was to volunteer participation in regular [[U.S. Armed Forces]], as one activity that would qualify for inclusion under the program's umbrella.

On September 11, 2008, at Columbia University, Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama addressed this further, saying, "But it's also important that a president speaks to military service as an obligation not just of some, but of many. You know, I traveled, obviously, a lot over the last 19 months. And if you go to small towns, throughout the Midwest or the Southwest or the South, every town has tons of young people who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. That's not always the case in other parts of the country, in more urban centers. And I think it's important for the president to say, this is an important obligation. If we are going into war, then all of us go, not just some."[https://web.archive.org/web/20081025105120/http://www.clipsandcomment.com/2008/09/11/transcript-servicenation-presidential-forum-at-columbia-university/]

Obama never actually said he supported a draft or the specific bill that is currently stalled in Congress.

== Universal National Service Act of 2010==
The Universal National Service Act of 2010 ({{USBill|111|H.R.|5741}}) is a bill introduced by [[Charles B. Rangel]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on July 15, 2010. It again proposes the requirement that all residents - male and female - in the United States aged between 18 and 42 carry out [[national service]] for a period of two years, in the event of a war or national emergency, as declared by the president. It allows no deferments after age 20.&lt;ref&gt;HR 5742 §107(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill, however, was dismissed at the end of the 111th Congress session.

==Universal National Service Act of 2013==
The Universal National Service Act of 2013 was introduced to the House Committee on Armed Services by [[Charles B. Rangel]] on February 15, 2013, demanding a 2-year mandatory national service period, civilian or military, for citizens between the ages of 18 and 25. The bill then moved to the House Subcommittee on Military Personnel on March 6, 2013, but later died in committee.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government.

Retrieved on 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, 2015, Rangel introduced legislation to activate Selective Service to draft men and women ages 18–25 via lottery during any authorization on the use of military force.

A '''war resister''' is a person who resists war. The term can mean several things: resisting participation in all war, or a specific war, either before or after enlisting in, being inducted into, or being [[conscription|conscripted]] into a military force.

==History, evolution and etymology of the term==

Early usage of the term "war resister" is found in the name of the [[War Resisters League]] which was formed in 1923 by men and women who had opposed [[World War I]].  The [[War Resisters League]] is a section of the London-based [[War Resisters' International]] which was founded in [[Bilthoven]], Netherlands in 1921 under the name "Paco".

In 1975, the [[Committee on South African War Resistance]], an organisation of exiled [[conscientious objectors]], pacifists, anti-militarists and deserters from the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF), was formed in the aftermath of [[Operation Savannah (Angola)|Operation Savannah]] and the [[Soweto uprising]] the following year.  Its aim was to raise international awareness about the role of the SADF and to provide support to objectors in exile.

In 2008 and 2009, the [[Parliament of Canada]] officially adopted the term "war resister" to include those who are not necessarily opposed to all war, but who selectively refused to participate in the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;On November 22, 2007, a [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliamentary]] Committee "commenced its study of Iraq war resisters" This Committee work resulted in a motion which passed twice in the [[House of Commons of Canada]]: [[Canada and Iraq War resisters#House of Commons support war resisters motion|on June 3, 2008]] and [[Canada and Iraq War resisters#House of Commons support War resisters motion again|on March 30, 2009.]] See [http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=221127&amp;Lang=1&amp;PARLSES=392&amp;JNT=0&amp;COM=13182 CIMM – Minutes of Meeting / Procès-verbal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cmte.parl.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=222011|title=Report – Iraq War Resisters / Rapport –Opposants a la guerre en Irak|publisher=House of Commons / Chambre des Communes, Ottawa, Canada|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was also adopted by various media in Canada at various times.&lt;ref name="Kyonka"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.thestar.com/article/484115|title = Iraq war resister sentenced to 15 months| date = August 23, 2008| first = Nick | last = Kyonka|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news |title= Liberals back U.S. war resister's bid to stay in Canada |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/09/18/iraq-objector.html |publisher= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date= September 18, 2008|accessdate=February 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalrymple"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=6f16e1b6-ce9c-4045-a5ec-95469eb16c2f|title = War resister expects to be deported this week| date = September 21, 2008| first = Tobin | last = Dalrymple| publisher = [[Canwest News Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenney's comments prejudice hearings for war resister, critics say |date= January 9, 2009|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=January 25, 2009|quote= |url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/01/09/refugee-war.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite news |first= Alex|last= Cooper|title= Federal court to hear American war resister's appeal|url= https://www.thestar.com/article/622278|work=Toronto Star |date= April 21, 2009|accessdate=April 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2010, the term "War Resisters" was the name of a nine-minute documentary on [[Global Television Network]] television program [[16:9 (TV series)]]. [[Carolyn Jarvis]] interviewed war resisters [[Robin Long]] and Rodney Watson, and [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Member of Parliament]] [[Gerard Kennedy]] on his [[Canada and Iraq War resisters#Bill C-440 introduced in Parliament|Bill C-440 regarding Iraq war resisters in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalnational.com/programs/16x9/Resisters/2468254/story.html|title= War Resisters|author= [[Global Television Network]]|date= January 24, 2010|work=[[16:9 (TV series)]] |publisher=[[Global Television Network]] |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2010, Canadian writer Peter Smollett referred to people opposing [[World War I]] as "war resisters." Among the people he mentioned were [[Albert Goodwin]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/887751--war-resisters-also-deserve-a-memorial|title=War resisters also deserve a memorial |author=Peter Smollett |date=November 9, 2010 |work= Opinion|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and semantics of the term==

War resisters have been referred to using various related terms: "[[deserter]]", "[[conscientious objector]]", or "[[refugee]]".  However, it is important to recognize that each of those terms has a very specific meaning in [[legal English]], whereas each of those terms carries a broader [[semantics|semantic meaning]] in [[Standard English]].

===Legal English===

====International law====

In [[international law]], specifically the ''Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status'' of the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), there is discussion of "refugee status after desertion" as being legitimate under international law. The Handbook states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

“171. Not every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming [[refugee]] status after [[desertion]] or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the [[international community]] as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d58e13b4.pdf Source: Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Canadian law====

The federal law-making body of Canada is the [[Parliament of Canada]]. The term "war resister" is used in the official documents of the Parliament of Canada: On November 22, 2007, a [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliamentary]] Committee "commenced its study of Iraq war resisters"&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=221127&amp;Lang=1&amp;PARLSES=392&amp;JNT=0&amp;COM=13182 CIMM – Minutes of Meeting / Procès-verbal]&lt;/ref&gt; This Committee work resulted in a motion which also used the term "war resisters"&lt;ref name="cmte.parl.gc.ca"/&gt; and which was passed twice by the [[House of Commons of Canada]]: [[Canada and Iraq War resisters#House of Commons support war resisters motion|on June 3, 2008]] and [[Canada and Iraq War resisters#House of Commons support War resisters motion again|on March 30, 2009.]] After the motion passed the first time, the media began to use the term "war resister," also.&lt;ref name="Kyonka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalrymple"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/832891--war-resister-wins-another-shot-at-permanent-residence |title= War resister wins another shot at permanent residence|author= Wendy Gillis|date= July 6, 2010|work=Toronto Star |accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. war resisters praise WikiLeaks |author= Ashante Infantry|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date= October 24, 2010|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/880383--u-s-war-resisters-praise-wikileaks |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some controversy when the Canadian Supreme Court refused to hear the appeals of two American army deserters, Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey, whose requests for refugee status were denied.  Both had deserted to Canada in 2004 after learning they were to be deployed to Iraq. The high court, as usual, gave no reasons for its refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2007/11/15/hinzman-decision.html |title=Top court refuses to hear cases of U.S. deserters |  work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) findings that the two did not qualify as Convention refugees.&lt;ref name="Lawyers Weekly, May 19, 2006"&gt;
{{cite journal
|url= http://www.lawyersweekly.ca/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=284

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both faced court martial and up to five years in jail as deserters if returned.  Lawyer Faisal Kutty argued that the IRB and the court appear to have danced around the politically sensitive issues and existing case law. Their arguments that they did not want to participate in an illegal war and that they would be punished for acting on their conscience was rejected by the IRB. The adjudicators held that they were not conscientious objectors (because they were not opposed to wars in general); the U.S. was willing and able to protect them; and that their treatment would not amount to persecution.

Paragraph 171 of UN Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Convention Refugee Status provides that where the type of military action with which an individual does not wish to be associated is condemned by the international legal community as contrary to rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion could be regarded as persecution.&lt;ref name="Lawyers Weekly, May 19, 2006"/&gt;

In denying both claims, the adjudicators opined that the legal status of the war in Iraq had no bearing on the analysis of paragraph 171. This determination was one of the issues on which the matters were appealed to the Federal Court, but Justice Anne Mactavish, noted in separate decisions (Hughey v. Canada [2006] F.C. 421 and Hinzman v. Canada [2006] F.C. 420) that this question was not an issue before her and did not have to be decided.&lt;ref name="Lawyers Weekly, May 19, 2006"/&gt;

The duo’s lawyer, Jeffrey House, says the decisions at both levels were also based on the erroneous view that American jurisprudence gives war resisters the right to seek a remedy if they question the legality of a war.  In fact, he argues that this is not true. The leading case on the “political questions doctrine” which revolves around whether people can challenge the legality of war based on their conscience and international law was turned down by the United States Supreme Court in Callan v. Bush. Given this situation, the U.S. is not in a position to provide protection to resisters, notes House.  House himself was a war resister.&lt;ref name="Lawyers Weekly, May 19, 2006"/&gt;

The existing case law from the Federal Court of Appeal, Al-Maisri v. Canada [1995] F.C. J. No. 642, appears on point and yet was rejected by Justice Mactavish as being of “limited assistance.” The case involved a Yemeni who was denied status by the IRB. Al-Maisri acknowledged he was prepared to fight for Yemen to protect it from aggression, but was not prepared to fight for Iraq against Kuwait. Yemen was an Iraqi supporter. The Court of Appeal held that “non-defensive incursion into foreign territory” was within the ambit of paragraph 171 and overturned the IRB decision.  “What is wrong for Saddam Hussein should be wrong for the Americans as well,” says House, a Vietnam-era draft dodger.&lt;ref name="Lawyers Weekly, May 19, 2006"/&gt;

Justice Mactavish held that the legality of the conflict is irrelevant when analyzing paragraph 171 when “one is considering the claim of a low-level ‘foot soldier’.” Yet, Al-Maisri was also a ‘foot soldier.’ Justice Mactavish admitted that “given the decision of the Court of Appeal in Al-Maisri, it is fair to say that the issue is not entirely free from doubt,” and proceeded to certify this question, which gave the two an automatic right of appeal to the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref name="Lawyers Weekly, May 19, 2006"/&gt;

Authorities in Canada and the U.S closely monitored the politically sensitive case. Indeed, the case became the proverbial public relations “hot potato” for the U.S. At the initial hearing, a former U.S. Marine testifying in Hinzman’s support stated that American soldiers in Iraq routinely violated international law by killing unarmed civilians, including women and children. Affidavits from two international law professors confirming the illegality of the war and reports from Human Rights Watch and the International Committee of the Red Cross documenting the abuses and violations were also filed.&lt;ref name="Lawyers Weekly, May 19, 2006"/&gt;

The '''Convention for the Unification of certain rules relating to international carriage by air''', commonly known as the '''Warsaw Convention''', is an international [[Treaty|convention]] which regulates liability for international carriage of persons, luggage, or goods performed by [[aircraft]] for reward.

Originally signed in 1929 in [[Warsaw]] (hence the name), it was amended in 1955 at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], and in 1971 in [[Guatemala City]], [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=GNP&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Navigation for Pilots|year=1998|publisher=Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, Inc.|isbn=978-1560273127|pages=370|author1=De Remer, Dale |author2=Mc Lean, Donald W. |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States courts have held that, at least for some purposes, the Warsaw Convention is a different instrument from the Warsaw Convention as amended by the [[Hague Protocol]].

==History==
On 17 August 1923, the French government proposed the convening of a [[diplomatic conference]] in November 1923 for the purpose of concluding a convention relating to [[Legal liability|liability]] in international carriage by air. The conference was formally deferred on two occasions due to reluctant behavior of the governments of various nations to act on such a short notice without the knowledge of the proposed convention. Finally, between 27 October and 6 November, the first conference met in [[Paris]] to study the draft convention. Since most of the participants were diplomats accredited to the French government and not professionals, it was agreed unanimously that a body of technical, legal experts be set up to study the draft convention prior to its submission to the diplomatic conference for approval. Accordingly, the International Technical Committee of Legal Experts on Air Questions (''Comité International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aériens'', CITEJA) was formed in 1925. In 1927–28 CITEJA studied and developed the proposed draft convention and developed it into the present package of unification of law and presented it at the Warsaw Conference, where it was approved between 4 and 12 October 1929. It unified an important sector of private air law.

The Convention was written originally in French and the original documents were deposited in the archives of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Poland]]. After coming into force on 13 February 1933, it resolved some conflicts of law and jurisdiction.

Between 1948–51 it was further studied by a legal committee set up by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and in 1952 a new draft was prepared to replace the convention. However it was rejected and it was decided that the convention be amended rather than replaced in 1953. The work done by the legal committee at the Ninth Session was presented to the International Conference on Air Law which was convened by the Council of the ICAO and met at [[The Hague]] from 6 to 28 September 1955. The Hague Conference adopted a Protocol (the [[Hague Protocol]]) for the amendment of the Warsaw Convention. Between the parties of the Protocol, it was agreed that the 1929 Warsaw Convention and the 1955 Hague Protocol were to be read and interpreted together as one single instrument to be known as the Warsaw Convention as amended at the Hague in 1955. This was not an amendment to the convention but rather a creation of a new and separate legal instrument that is only binding between the parties. If one nation is a party to the Warsaw Convention and another to the Hague Protocol, neither state has an instrument in common and therefore there is no mutual international ground for litigation.

The [[Montreal Convention]], signed in 1999, replaced the Warsaw Convention system.

==Content==
There are five chapters:
*Chapter I – Definitions
*Chapter II – Documents of Carriage; Luggage and Passenger Ticket
*Chapter III – Liability of the Carrier
*Chapter IV – Provisions Relating to Combined Carriage
*Chapter V – General and Final Provisions

In the convention there is a provision of successive carriage and a combined carriage partly by air and partly by other modes of transport as well.

In particular, the Warsaw Convention:
*Defines "international carriage" and the convention's scope of applicability
*Sets rules for documents of carriage
*Sets rules for the air carrier's liability and limitations thereof
*Sets rules for legal jurisdiction
*Mandates carriers to issue [[airline ticket|passenger tickets]];
*Requires carriers to issue [[bag tag|baggage checks]] for [[checked luggage]];
*Creates a limitation period of two years within which a claim must be brought (Article 29); and
*Limits a carrier's liability to at most:
** 250,000 [[Francs]] or 16,600 [[special drawing rights]] (SDR) for personal injury;
** 250 [[Francs]] or 17 SDR per [[kilogram]] for checked luggage and cargo, or [[US$]]20 per kilogram{{fact|date=February 2018}} for non-signatories of the amended [[Montreal Convention]]; 
** 5,000 Francs or 332 SDR for the [[hand luggage]] of a traveller.

The sums limiting liability were originally given in [[gold franc]]s (defined in terms of a particular quantity of gold by article 22 paragraph 5 of the convention). These sums were amended by the Montreal Additional Protocol No. 2 to substitute an expression given in terms of SDRs. These sums are valid in the absence of a differing agreement (on a higher sum) with the carrier. Agreements on ''lower'' sums are null and void.

A court may also award a claiming party's costs, unless the carrier made an offer within 6 months of the loss (or at least 6 months before the beginning of any legal proceedings) which the claiming party has failed to beat.

The Warsaw Convention provides that a [[plaintiff]] can file a [[lawsuit]] at his or her discretion in one of the following forums:
# The carrier's principal place of business
# The domicile of the carrier
# The carrier's place of business through which the contract was made
# The place of the destination

According to Clauses 17 and 18 of the Warsaw Convention, airline companies are liable for any damage that occurs to passengers or their belongings during in-flight. However, airline companies will not be held responsible if the damage results from the passenger's own fault or one of their temporary servants such as doctors assisting ill passengers on their own initiative (Clause 20). To be covered by air carriers, doctors should respond to the captain's call when it comes to assisting ill passengers. In such cases, doctors are considered an airline's temporary servants who acted on the airline's instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Laur Liabilities of Doctors on Aircraft Med Leg J March 2013 81:31—35&lt;/ref&gt; Major airlines are all covered by insurance to meet such contingencies and to cover doctors who act as their temporary agents.

==Ratifications==
As of 2015, the Warsaw Convention had been ratified by 152 [[Sovereign state|states]].&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt; The Protocol to the Convention had been ratified by 137 states.
