{{Rabbinical Literature}}
The '''''Alphabet of ben Sirach''''' (''Alphabetum Siracidis'', ''Othijoth ben Sira'') is an anonymous [[medieval]] text inspired by the [[Wisdom of Sirach]]. It is dated to anywhere between 700 and 1000 CE. It is a compilation of two lists of [[proverb]]s, 22 in [[Aramaic]] and 22 in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], both arranged as alphabetic [[acrostic]]s. Each proverb is followed by an [[Haggadic]] commentary. The work has been characterized as [[satire|satirical]], and it contains references to [[masturbation]], [[incest]] and [[flatulence]]. The text has been translated into [[Latin]], [[Yiddish]], [[Judeo-Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. A partial English translation appeared in Stern and Mirsky (1998).

==Aramaic proverbs==
The Aramaic proverbs are the far older part of the book. Five of them can be traced to Talmudic-Midrashic literature. The Hebrew commentary, illustrating the proverbs with fables, is much younger.

in the reading of Ginzberg:
#"Honor the Ethiop before thou hast need of him", ([[Sirach|Ecclus.]] 38:1)
#"If a son do not conduct himself like a son, let him float on the water."
#"Gnaw the bone that falls to thy lot whether it be good or bad."
#"Gold must be hammered, and the child must be beaten."
#"Be good and refuse not thy portion of good."
#"Woe to the wicked man and woe to his companions."
#"Cast thy bread upon the waters and upon the land, for thou shalt find it after many days" (Eccles. 11:1)
#"Hast thou seen a black ass? [Then] it was neither black nor white."
#"Bestow no good upon that which is evil, and no evil will befall thee."
#"Restrain not thy hand from doing good."
#"The bride enters the bridal chamber and, nevertheless, knows not what will befall her."
#"A nod to the wise is sufficient; the fool requires a blow." (Proverbs 22:15)
#"He who honors them that despise him is like an ass."
#"A fire, when it is kindled, burns many sheaves" (James 3:5)
#"An old woman in the house is a good omen in the house"
#"Even a good surety has to be applied to for a hundred morrows; a bad one for a hundred thousand."
#"Rise quickly from the table and thou wilt avoid disputes."
#"In thy business deal only with the upright."
#"If the goods are near at hand, the owner consumes them; but if they are at a distance, they consume him."
#"Do not disavow an old friend."
#"Thou mayest have sixty counselors, but do not give up thy own opinion"
#"He that was first satisfied and then hungry will offer thee his hand; but not he that was first hungry and then satisfied."

==The second Alphabet==
The 22 Hebrew proverbs are quite different in character from the Aramaic ones, and much more recent. Half of the proverbs are borrowed from the Talmud, and are only a pretext for the presentation of a number of legends surrounding Ben Sira. Ben Sira is presented as the son of [[Jeremiah]]. Ben Sira's fame reached [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]], who called him to his court. Nebuchadnezzar sets forth various ordeals for Ben Sira, who responds with 22 stories. Some of the fables of the collection are indebted to Christian legend, and to the Indian [[Panchatantra]].

===Lilith===
{{main|Lilith}}
The text is best known because of its reference to [[Lilith]], and it is the fifth of Ben Sira's responses to King Nebuchadnezzar. It is reproduced here in its entirety: &lt;!--source? translator?--&gt;

:Soon afterward the young son of the king took ill. Said Nebuchadnezzar, "Heal my son. If you don't, I will kill you." Ben Sira immediately sat down and wrote an amulet with the Holy Name, and he inscribed on it the angels in charge of medicine by their names, forms, and images, and by their wings, hands, and feet. Nebuchadnezzar looked at the amulet. "Who are these?"
:"The [[angel]]s who are in charge of medicine: Snvi, Snsnvi, and Smnglof [סנוי סנסנוי וסמנגלוף] (in English: Senoy, Sansenoy and Semangelof). While God created [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], who was alone, He said, 'It is not good for man to be alone' ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:18). He also created a woman, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air. Adam stood in prayer before his Creator: 'Sovereign of the universe!' he said, 'the woman you gave me has run away.' At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels to bring her back.

:"Said the Holy One to Adam, 'If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.' The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the [[Egypt]]ians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, 'We shall drown you in the sea.'

:"'Leave me!' she said. 'I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.'

:"When the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers."

Some Jewish [[feminism|feminists]] have written arguments urging for Lilith's depiction in ''The Alphabet of Ben Sira'' to be reevaluated, based on the fact that this text was originally written primarily as a work of [[satire]]. Although the negativity surrounding Lilith's character as a demoness (i.e. terrorising pregnant women, fornicating with demons, murdering infants, etc.) was taken with a varying degree of superstition within Judaism, it should not go unrecognized that much of the work was probably intended satirically.&lt;ref&gt;Academia.edu:WOMAN HAS TWO FACES: RE-EXAMINING EVE AND LILITH IN JEWISH FEMINIST THOUGHT. Carvalho, Diana. June 2009. Retrieved April 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other scholars argue that the satirical tone of the composition makes it even more difficult to assess the value of Lilith. The ruthlessly parodic tone of the ''Alphabet'' suggests that the blade of criticism is actually directed against Adam, who turns out to be weak and ineffective in his relations with his wife. Apparently, the first man is not the only male figure who is mocked: Even the Holy One cannot subjugate Lilith and needs to ask his messengers, who only manage to go as far as negotiating the conditions of the agreement. Lilith is approached in her own dwelling by the divine emissaries, themselves a miserable reflection of the four majestic [[Angel|angels]] of the [[Book of Enoch|Enochian tradition]]. Thus, even if the ''Alphabet'' should not be treated as a manifesto of female empowerment, Lilith is presented therein as the strongest and most influential character from among her literary companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosior|first=Wojciech|date=2018|title=A Tale of Two Sisters: The Image of Eve in Early Rabbinic Literature and Its Influence on the Portrayal of Lilith in the Alphabet of Ben Sira|url=http://www.academia.edu/36771379/A_Tale_of_Two_Sisters_The_Image_of_Eve_in_Early_Rabbinic_Literature_and_Its_Influence_on_the_Portrayal_of_Lilith_in_the_Alphabet_of_Ben_Sira|journal=Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies &amp; Gender Issues|volume=|issue=32|pages=112–130|doi=10.2979/nashim.32.1.10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Amamikyu'''|阿摩美久&lt;ref&gt;Shō Shōken. ''Chūzan Seikan'' (in Japanese). 1650.&lt;/ref&gt; or 阿摩彌姑&lt;ref&gt;Tei Heitetsu. ''Kyūyō'' (in Chinese). 1745.&lt;/ref&gt;||[[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: Amanchuu}}, or {{Nihongo|'''Amekushin-otome-ōankami'''|天久神乙女王御神}}, is the creation goddess of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in the [[Ryukyuan religion]].

==Name==
Amamikyu's name comes from the reading of the [[Chinese characters]] 阿摩美久 or 阿摩彌姑, which were most likely written [[ad-hoc]] for the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan pronunciation]]. Readings can vary widely from Amamikyu, Amamikyo, Amamikiyo, Amamiko, Amamiku, Amamigu, Amamichuu, and Amanchuu. "Amamikyu" was used by [[George H. Kerr]] in his ''Ryukyu: Kingdom and Province Before 1945'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, George. ''Okinawa:History of an Island People''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Publishing, 1958. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation myth==
The beginning of ''[[Chūzan Seikan]]'' details the creation of the Ryukyu Islands. The Heavenly Emperor (天帝), who lived in the Heavenly [[Gusuku]] (天城), looked down on the world and saw that there were no islands, so he ordered Amamikyu (阿摩美久) to create the Ryukyu Islands. She asked for materials to build the islands, so the Heavenly Emperor sent Shinerikyu to bring her grasses, trees, and stones. She descended to Earth on [[Kudaka Island]], and then made landfall on [[Okinawa Island]] on the spot of [[Sefa-utaki]], and later built [[Tamagusuku Castle]] and [[Chinen Castle]] and a number of communities. She asked the Heavenly Emperor for materials to make people, but the other gods would not go down to Earth. Without sexual intercourse, she became pregnant by Shinerikyu (志仁禮久) and populated the islands. Some generations later, a "heavenly grandchild" named Tentei was born, who split Ryukyuan society into five classes with his three sons and two daughters: the first son was [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Tenson Dynasty|Tenson]], who became the first King of Ryukyu; the second son became the first feudal lord ([[Anji (Ryukyu)|Aji]]); the third son became the first farmer; the first daughter became the first royal [[noro (priestess)|noro priestess]]; and the second daughter became the first village noro priestess.&lt;ref&gt;Glacken, Clarence. ''The Great Loochoo''. University of California Press, 1955. Pp 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Her final home was located at [[Minton Castle]] in [[Tamagusuku, Okinawa]].

==Historical legacy==
Amamikyu's tomb is located on [[Hamahiga Island]] in [[Uruma, Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nifee.net/piman/ha-rekisi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sefa-utaki is the holiest [[utaki]] site in the Ryukyuan religion. During the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] era, the king and [[kikoe-ōgimi]] made an annual [[pilgrimage]] to the site from [[Shuri Castle]] to worship Amamikyu, facing [[Kudaka Island]].

'''Antonio Bacci''' (4 September 1885 – 20 January 1971) was an Italian [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church]]. He served as [[Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters|Secretary of Briefs to Princes]] from 1931 to 1960, when he was elevated to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] by [[Pope John XXIII]]. He is perhaps best known for his role in the [[Ottaviani Intervention]].

==Biography==
Bacci was born in [[Giugnola]], near [[Florence]], and [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood on 9 August 1909. From 1910 to 1922, he served as professor and [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] of the [[seminary]] in Florence. Bacci then entered the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Vatican Secretariat of State]] in 1922 as an expert in [[Latin]]. He was raised to the rank of [[Monsignor|Honorary Chamberlain of His Holiness]] on 15 March 1923, and appointed [[Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters|Secretary of Briefs to Princes]] in 1931. During his 31-year-long tenure as Secretary, he prepared the Latin text of important [[Holy See|Vatican]] documents during the reigns of [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]], [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]], and [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]].&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite news|date=14 March 1960|work=[[TIME Magazine]]|title=Seven New Hats|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871562-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Papal conclave, 1958|1958 papal conclave]], he called for "a saintly Pope" who could "be a bridge between heaven and the earth...between the social classes...[and] a bridge among nations, even those who reject and persecute Christian religion."&lt;ref name=pastor&gt;{{cite news|date=3 November 1958|work=[[TIME Magazine]]|title=Pastor of Souls|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810585,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John XXIII created him [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Deacon]] of ''[[Sant'Eugenio]]'' in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 28 March 1960. Cardinal Bacci was later named [[Titular bishop|titular archbishop]] of ''Colonia in Cappadocia'' on 5 April 1962, and received his [[Bishop (Catholicism)|episcopal consecration]] on the following 19 April from John XXIII, with Cardinals [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]] and [[Benedetto Aloisi Masella]] serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]]. He attended the [[Second Vatican Council]] from 1962 to 1965, and [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|participated]] in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963 papal conclave]] that elected [[Pope Paul VI]].

One of the Vatican's leading Latin experts, Bacci strongly opposed the introduction of the [[vernacular]] into the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news|date=1 February 1971|work=[[TIME Magazine]]|title=Milestones|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909776,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what was known as the [[The Ottaviani Intervention|Ottaviani Intervention]], the then 84-year-old Bacci, together with 79-year-old [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], sent to Pope Paul VI, with a short covering letter from themselves, a study by a group of [[Theology|theologians]] under the direction of [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]] criticizing the draft [[Order of Mass]] of the [[Mass of Paul VI|revision of the Roman Missal]].&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Lefebvre gathered together a group of 12 theologians who wrote under his direction, A Short Critical Study of the Novus Ordo Missae often called the Ottaviani Intervention." [http://www.holycrossseminary.com/Most_Asked_Questions_Appendix_III_page2.htm A Short History of the SSPX]&lt;/ref&gt; In their letter the two cardinals said that the study showed that the new Order of Mass "represents, both as a whole and in its details, a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session 22 of the [[Council of Trent]]...to which, nonetheless, the Catholic conscience is bound forever. With the promulgation of the Novus Ordo, the loyal Catholic is thus faced with a most tragic alternative."
Among Bacci's publications was ''Lexicon Eorum Vocabulorum Quae Difficilius Latine Redduntur'', a dictionary of modern terms in Latin; he invented such words as ''gummis salivaria'' ("chewing gum"), ''barbara saltatio'' ("the twist"), and ''diurnarius scriptor'' ("newspaper reporter").&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref name=cultores&gt;{{cite news|date=16 February 1953|work=[[TIME Magazine]]|title=Ad Cultores Optimos|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817958,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a standard reference for writers of Modern Latin, especially at the Vatican, until it was superseded by the [[Lexicon Recentis Latinitatis]].

Bacci died at [[Vatican City]], at age 85. He is buried in his native Giugnola, near Florence.

The '''Archbishop of Petra'''  was established during the Crusader era and served the diocese of Palaestrina III, the [[Oultrejordain]] area, and traditionally included [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]], although Crusader protection rarely extended that far.  

The [[Islam]]ic conquest in the 7th century had eliminated [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] control of the area and with it the protection of the Christian communities.  However, Palestinian and Syrian Christian communities had remained in the region well into the Islamic occupation period and with the arrival of the Crusader Principalities, they were placed under the supervision of the diocese with the expectation of restoring the area's Christian roots.  Frankish communities soon added to their number and before [[Saladin]]'s reconquest, the area had an increasing number of Catholic communities.  Following the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by Saladin, what little protection for Christians had existed was eliminated and the nascent Christian communities were soon destroyed.  

Nonetheless, several isolated monasteries at various levels of precarious existence continued, thereby creating the necessity of appointing Archbishops well into the modern period. However, by the late 19th and early 20th centuries what vestiges of monastic life and their few extant congregants which remained were effectively eliminated by [[Bedouin]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] raids and with it the diocese lapsed.

== Beginnings ==

The first mention of events related to the history of the religion was a report in a Wellington newspaper in July 1846.&lt;ref name="Spectator1846"/&gt; These were reprints of an 1845 article in the London ''Times'' which relied on Muslim reactions to the new religion.&lt;ref name="States1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States|title=World Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUYlAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=1977|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 there was an event with caused great suffering on Babís ( who Bahá'ís hold as a direct [[Precursor (religion)|precursor]] akin to the relationship between [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Following this initial mention of incidents related to the religion there were several contacts between New Zealanders and Bahá'ís at the beginning of the 20th century. New Zealander [[Wilhelmina Sherriff Bain]] may have met [[Sarah Jane Farmer]], a notable Bahá'í in the United States, (see [[Green Acre]]) in 1904.

Though Felkin is more known for being involved with other interests, another early Bahá'í, Maurice Chambers, counts Felkin as the Bahá'í through whom he learned of the religion and converted in 1914.&lt;ref name="BahaiArohanui" /&gt;

Whoever converted first, there was at least one Bahá'í in New Zealand in 1912 and more shortly thereafter.

`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention spreading the Bahá'í Faith in [[New Zealand]] and was written on 11 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 because of disruptions from [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]] which strongly affected New Zealand and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Winder | first = Virginia | title = Spanish Influenza NZ's Worst Disaster | work = Taranaki Stories | publisher = Puke Ariki | date = 21 July 2004 | url =http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/disasters/flu.htm  | accessdate = Sep 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers is known to have exchanged letters with `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1919.&lt;ref name="Dec30" /&gt; Stevenson received a visit by Australian community founders John and Clara Hyde-Dunn in 1922 and again in 1923 and the New Zealand community quickly grew, including Stevenson's sisters Amy and Lilias.

After receiving a compilation on forming Assemblies they then returned to New Zealand in December 1925. They also returned with some dust from the Tomb of Bahá'u'lláh which was placed in New Zealand soil at Stevenson's home in a ceremony held on 14 February 1926. Later in 1926 the Bahá'ís in Auckland were able to properly elect their first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]]. In 1928 there were seven assemblies between New Zealand and Australia - by 1939 the number of assemblies had reduced to 4 but the locations with Bahá'ís increased to 17 and by 1940 the count of assemblies reached 19 while there were still 17 other locations with smaller groups of Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name=JORH2012-Smith&gt;{{cite journal

In 1948 the first person of [[Māori people|Māori]] descent to accept the Bahá’í Faith was Albert White, who was one quarter Māori.

In 1958 Hand of the Cause of God, [[Enoch Olinga]] visited the [[Ngaruawahia]] [[Marae]] and talked with elders and four years later, when Hand of the Cause of God, Dr Muhajir visited, Ephraim Te Paa, a [[Kaumatua]] (Māori elder) from Ahipara converted to the religion. In 1963 with the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] the Hands of the Cause updated and published a kind of census of the religion. At that time there were four assemblies -[[Auckland]], [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Wellington]] - and 18 localities with smaller groups of Bahá'ís - see maps.&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; The story of one convert in 1964 includes her concern for her bi-racial children and despair at the bigotry of interracial marriage among the very minorities her children were members (she being [[Celt]] and married a Māori) when she found this kind of marriage highly accepted among Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 730–1 | year = 1986 | url =http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/720-748.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the National Assembly, who participated in the convention for the first election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], were: Hugh Blundell, John Carr, Margaret Harnish, Linda Hight, Percy Leadley, Phyllis Milne, Jean Simmons, Douglas Weeks, and Terry Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor = Rabbani, R. |year = 1992 |title = The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher = Bahá'í World Centre |isbn = 0-85398-350-X |url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians&amp;chapter=7 | page = 411}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Bahá'í community came to the assistance of refugees in 1979 from the [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran who were allowed to settle in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Fond memories of NZ welcome | journal = Immigration Matters | publisher = New Zealand Immigration Service | volume = | issue = | date = July 2004 | url = http://www.dol.govt.nz/PDFs/IMIssue2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1987 and 1989, a further 142 Iranian Bahá'ís settled in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Beaglehole | first = Ann | title = Refugees - 1970s–2003: refugee groups | encyclopedia = Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand | volume = Online | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/refugees/4 | publisher = Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga | date = 4 March 2009 | isbn = 978-0-478-18451-8 | accessdate = 2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern Bahá'í community of New Zealand the Bahá'ís have multiplied their interests internally and externally.

==Early days==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
`Abdu'l-Bahá, head of the religion from 1892 to 1921, mentioned the Marshall Islands among the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to. He wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The seventh of the tablets mentioned taking the Bahá'í Faith to the Marshall Islands and was written on 11 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on 4 April 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Tablet 7) "A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great island groups of the Pacific Ocean — [[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]], and the islands attached to these groups, such as New Guinea, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Philippine Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji Islands, New Hebrides, Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, Bismarck Archipelago, Ceram, Celebes, Friendly Islands, Samoa Islands, Society Islands, Caroline Islands, Low Archipelago, Marquesas, Hawaiian Islands, Gilbert Islands, Moluccas, [[Marshall Islands]], Timor and the other islands. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with tongues commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of God, they must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts to all the people. Know ye of a certainty that whatever gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy Spirit are surging over it, and the heavenly grace of the Blessed Beauty encompasseth that gathering."&lt;ref name="tab1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Beginnings===
Marcia Steward (later de Matamores Atwater), was a [[pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneer]] and named a [[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh|Knight of Bahá’u’lláh]] for being the first to move to the Marshall Islands. Steward was born in Pasadena, California in 1904, and embraced the religion in 1938 and was eager to pioneer before the conclusion of the first Seven Year Plan (1937–1944) of [[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor. First she moved to Santiago de Chile. She continued to serve across Latin America for a number of years as plans proceeded for the religion.&lt;ref name="Atwater"/&gt; See [[Bahá'í Faith in Chile]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus |title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = West Linn, OR | url =http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear = |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374|url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal |page=6 |isbn = 0-87743-145-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1947 Atwater was appointed secretary of the Central American Teaching Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American Administration Develops |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1947 | issue = 197 | page =3 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one of its goals to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | issue = 493 | page =2 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. While she was deciding where to serve next a cable from Shoghi Effendi arrived asking Atwater to try to get to the Marshall Islands sometime between 1 April and 2 May 1954. His cable reached Atwater on 16 April and by 20 April she was in Washington DC. Immediately after World War II the islands were administered for about 6 years by the United States Navy. When the Trusteeships under the United Nations were formed, the Marshall Islands became part of the Trusteeship of the Pacific (which included the Caroline, and Mariana Islands as well as the Marshall Islands). The United States was given the authority to administer this Trusteeship by the United Nations. The Marshall Islands were the site of [[:Category:U.S. nuclear test sites|nuclear bomb tests]], the Marshall Islands were tightly closed to any guests unconnected with government work. At the time she had a contract with a publisher and hoped to be self-sufficient after finishing her book. By 9 May she informed [[Horace Holley (Bahá'í)|Horace Holley]] that she had permission to enter the islands and was awaiting her Navy security clearance. Atwater was able to secure a visa to travel there because of excellent connections in Washington D.C., and got her original three-month pass renewed because of the same contacts. Maintaining the appearance of wealth and ease which accompanied her family's position in the U.S., she was actually, by the time she went to the Marshalls, completely without independent income, and was deputized by the United States National Spiritual Assembly with some help from the National Spiritual Assembly of Central America. In July 1954 she left Hawaii, finally, for Japan, and then sailed from Kobe to the Marshall Islands, arriving in [[Majuro]], capital and largest city of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, on August 7.

While there she was invited to a reception in honor of a visiting U.S. congressman from Colorado where she recited, upon request, some of her "poetry of Majuro," after which the congressman asked for copies. Marcia wrote to Virginia Breaks in the [[Caroline Islands]] that most of her good friends in the Marshalls were Catholic or Jesuit priests, remarking, "this is probably natural, since I lived in a Latin-American Catholic environment for so many years." Breaks said that Atwater seemed to "greatly enjoy" her time on the islands, and "she was apparently given government housing." Marcia hoped to stay on in the islands although she was very ill during her last two months there, but she was not given another permit. She was able to stay until March 1955. During that time she taught the religion, traveled to various atolls, fulfilled some press commitments which were subject to the District Commissioner's censor but which had, in the end, been helpful in securing her visa; and she tried to get some Bahá’í information translated into Marshallese. The nature of her illness is unknown, as is the story of all her activities there, since the report she wrote was lost and she evidently never had the strength to re-write it. After leaving the islands she suffered from a debilitating skin ailment, of which she wrote, "A terrible affliction has me almost ready to be locked up: I am quite horrible to behold...." She felt her skin problem was caused by radiation burns from atomic testing on the Marshalls, but this could never be proved, and she tried unsuccessfully to collect compensation from the U.S. government.

The Marshall Islands, vacated for several months when it became necessary for Atwater to leave, was replaced by another Bahá'í pioneer, Betty Klaas, from Honolulu by August 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Intercontinental Committees; Asia ENROLL MANY BELIEVERS IN PACIFIC ISLANDS |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1956 | issue = 306 | page =7 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960 there were no pioneer Bahá'ís&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = South Pacific|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1960 |issue = 353 | page =6 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1964 there is mention of a group of Bahá'ís there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Progress of the Nine Year Plan News from the World Center|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1964 | issue = 405 | page =1 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of Majuro was elected 21 April 1967. This is also the first Local Spiritual Assembly to be formed in the Trust Territory of Micronesia. Its members were Jack Peter, Elsie Heran, Ninam Reran, Brad Hollinger (pioneer), Kim Lang (pioneer), Tataka Arawatau, Betra Heran, Harlan Lang (pioneer) and Pencil Heran.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; In 1972 a regional spiritual assembly of the North West Pacific Ocean was based in [[Pohnpei]] covering the Caroline, Marshall and Mariana Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/hassall_asia-pacific_spiritual_axisBahá'í Communities in the Asia-Pacific Performing Common Theology and Cultural Diversity on a 'Spiritual Axis'] by Graham Hassall and William Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second local assembly was elected in "Laura" in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Northwest Pacific Ocean 20th, 21st Local Assemblies formed|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1975 | issue = 537 | page =17 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the first spiritual assembly on Santo Island, in the [[Kwajalein Atoll]], was announced January 1. All the teachers involved in the formation of this assembly were Micronesians. The activity evolved under the direction of the national teaching committee of the Marshall Islands, with the help of the Spiritual Assembly of [[Ebeye Island]] of the same atoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; North West Pacific Ocean Santo Island forms first Assembly|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1976 | issue = 542 | page =12 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth across the nation==
Following international conferences on the promulgation of the religion in Hong Kong, 26–30 November 1975 and Auckland, New Zealand, 19–22 January 1976 a Marshallese conference was held later in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; North West Pacific Ocean Santo Island forms first Assembly|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1976 | issue = 545 | page =5 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1977 four Bahá'í communities gathered and had a picnic to discuss the upcoming first National Convention and the importance of [[Bahá'í administration#Elected institutions|Local Spiritual Assembly elections]]. Thirty-five Bahá'ís and their children were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Marshall Islands - First National Convention picnic topic|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1977 | issue = 553 | page =16 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1979 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Marshall Islands reports "The major islands that are uninhabited: Toka, Ailinginae, Rongdrik, Jemo, Bikini, Erkub, Bokak, Bikar." In the same report, Rongelap Atoll is listed as having a Bahá'í group, [[Ujelang Atoll]] is shown as an isolated Bahá'í and [[Enewetak Atoll]] as well is shown to have a group.&lt;ref name="islands"/&gt; In March the Department of Secretariat at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] writes to the national assembly saying, "It is noted that there are only two major inhabited islands not yet open to the Faith -- Mejit and Ailuk, and it is hoped these will soon be opened."&lt;ref name="islands"/&gt; By the summer of 1979 there were 15 more local assemblies, 42 localities, a temple site, endowment land, three local centers, and two revised translations of a prayer book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title =VictoryMessages - The Baha'I world resounds with the glorious news of Five Year Plan victories; Australasia; Marshall Islands|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1979 | issue = 581 | page =9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm |issn=0043-8804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1983 the national assembly report states "Atolls which have no population and therefore are not to be considered under any teaching plan are as follows: Ailingae, Bikar, Bikini, Bokaak (Taongi), Erikub, Jemo, Knox, Rongerik, and Taja." A note is appended by the national assembly to this same report reads: "Note: Though one of the larger islands of the M.I. atolls, Rongelap is largely radioactive, with no population."&lt;ref&gt;For more information on movements of populations and drifts of radiation see {{Cite journal | last = Jamir | first = Vinson |title = the South Pacific Islands: Economic, Political and Legal Interactions | journal = LLM theses |page=172 | publisher = University of Georgia School of Law | location = | year = 1983 | url = http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/stu_llm/107/ | accessdate =25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second note, in reference to Ujelang Atoll, reads: "Note: For a time uninhabited, there is a report some people may have returned."&lt;ref name="islands"/&gt; A [[former Peace Corps]] member who had worked on [[Lae Atoll]] in 1969-71 as an elementary school teacher returned in 1984 as a Bahá'í and managed to introduce the religion on a few atolls where no natives had yet joined the religion.

===Multiplying interests accelerate===
Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web |last=Momen |first = Moojan |title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" | publisher = Bahai-library.com |url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | format = | doi = |accessdate =16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon | first = Geeta Gandhi | title= Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 |issue = 1 | year = 1997 |url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"/&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8|postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In the Marshall Islands a management team composed of Bahá'ís as requested by the national government, operated 7 public elementary schools under contract with the government.&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Bahá'í Faith in the Asia Pacific Issues and Prospects | periodical = Bahá'í Studies Review | volume=06 | pages = 1–10 |year = 1996 | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_bahai_asia-pacific_issues |postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the growth of the institutions the organizational impact of the Bahá'ís became more well known starting in the mid-1980s in the Marshall Islands.

===Relations with Marshallese government===
The Bahá'ís have had a long positive relationship with the government. [[Amata Kabua]], then President of the Marshall Islands, was a government leader who has a close relationship with Bahá'í institutions nationally and internationally. In his address at the opening of the UN General Assembly in October 1991 President Kabua called for "a new and comprehensive vision of a global society, supported by a new system of values. This recognition does not imply the abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, nor the abolition of national autonomy. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a far higher aspiration than has thus far animated human affairs."&lt;ref name="hassal-pacific"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For similarity of language, consider:

===Focus to the society===
By 1992 the Bahá'ís operate state schools under contract with the government.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt;
In 2003 a Bahá'í with the main goal of helping the rural population established a project which he sees as an extension of his commitment to the promotion of social and economic development — a commitment that stems from his practice of the Bahá’í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bahá'í International Community | title = Vanuatu Mechanic Going to Town on tank of Coconut oil | journal =Pacific Islands Report | publisher = Pacific Islands Development Program/East-West Center | location = Port Vila, Vanuatu | date =August 2003 | url = http://166.122.164.43/archive/2003/August/08-21-feature.htm| accessdate =16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Estimates of the number of Bahá'ís in the Marshal Islands vary considerably. From 1983 to 1987 the percentage of Bahá'ís reported for the Marshall Islands, went from 2% to 11.5% according to Bahá'í sources. Similar growth rates are reported in some other Pacific nations.&lt;ref name="hassal1"/&gt; But as early as 2001 the US State Dept estimated the Bahá'ís at 0.6 percent or about 400.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5620.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2001: Marshall Islands]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (14 September 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; However almost at the same time the 2000 [[World Christian Encyclopedia]] estimation of a Bahá'í population was just over 1,000, or 1.50%.&lt;ref name="adhere2000"/&gt;

The '''Bhangi Misl''' ({{lang-pnb|ਭੰਗੀ ਮਿਸਲ ([[Gurmukhi]]), بھنگی مثل ([[Shahmukhi]])}}) was a large [[Sikh]] [[Misl]]&lt;ref name="BhangiMisl"/&gt; headquartered in a village near [[Amritsar]]. It was founded in the early 18th century by [[Chhajja Singh |Sardar Chhajja Singh]],&lt;ref name="BhangiMisl"&gt;Sikh History (2004). [http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/events/bhangi.html "The Bhangi Misal"], ''History of the Sikhs'', 2004. Retrieved on 7 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Rishi (2015).

==Expanse of Bhangi Misl== 
It grew in strength and territory to cover an area from [[Attock]] to [[Multan]] and emerged as the strongest power in the western [[Punjab region]].&lt;ref name="McLeod2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=W. H.|title=Historical dictionary of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ma3G-hjh6SwC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=10 July 2010|date=2005-07-28|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-5088-0|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, deaths among the leadership during the late 1760s reduced the Misl's power.&lt;ref name="McLeod2005"/&gt;

==Decline of Power==
The Bhangi misl engaged in numerous power struggles with the [[Sukerchakia Misl]] until they were severely weakened at the [[Battle of Basin]] and the loss of Lahore to [[Ranjit Singh]].

Bhangi Misl held the possession of [[Zamzama]], the famous cannon, which was at the time named Bhangi Toap, Bhangianwala Toap and Bhangian di Top, names it retains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Khushwant ''A History of the Sikhs, Volume 1: 1469-1839''.

'''[[Buddhism]] in [[Argentina]]''' has been practiced since the early 1980s.

Although Argentina is largely [[Catholic Church in Argentina|Catholic Christianity]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants established the first Chinese temple in 1986, and [[Korean people|Korean]] immigrants founded their own temple. Since then many groups have been giving teachings, some of them rooted in the best known [[Sōtō]] tradition from [[Japan]], but also in many [[Tibet]]an institutes for the practice of [[meditation]] ([[Mahamudra]], [[Dzog Chen]], [[Lam Rim]]).

[[Tenzin Gyatso|The XIV]] [[Dalai Lama]] visited [[Buenos Aires]] twice. The first time was in 1991 or 1992.

Nowadays many branches have flourished and [[Wheel of Dharma|teach]].

Many organizations have cooperated to bring the relics of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] to Argentina. This event was supported by the Royal Embassy of Thailand in Buenos Aires.

Among [[scholar]]s who contributed to the spreading of Buddhism in Argentina are Samuel Wolpin, whose books have opened a door to many [[students]] and the general public, and Carmen Dragonetti and Fernando Tola, who have been researching and studying Buddhism for many years, with their books translated to many languages.

Teachers who have visited the country include Pu Hsien, founder of the [[Tzon Kuan Temple]], Mok Sunim, responsible for spreading of Korean Buddhism in the early twentyfirst century, [[Chogyal Namkhai Norbu]], founder of the international Dzog Chen Community who transmitted Dzog Chen teachings here, and Lama Ngawang Sherab Dorje, who visited Argentina many times.

Local teachers include Augusto Alcalde (Diamond Sangha) the first Roshi in this country. Jorge Bustamante, Soto lineage. Alberto Pulisi (Upasaka). Gonzalo Barreiros (Dharma Teacher), and two Argentine lamas, Horacio and Consuelo.

'''Buddhism in Brazil''' consists of practitioners from various [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions and schools. A number of Buddhist organisations and groups are also active in Brazil, with nearly 150 temples spread across the states.

==Japanese Heritage==

Buddhism was introduced to Brazil due to the immigration of Japanese in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mandalamagazine.org/archives/mandala-issues-for-2006/august/buddhism-in-latin-america/ Buddhism in Latin America - Mandala Publications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Japanese schools and sects of Buddhism, such as [[Soto Zen]], [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]] [[Hommon Butsuryu|Honmon Butsuryu Shu]], [[Jodo Shinshu]] (also known as [[True Pure Land]] Buddhism) and [[Soka Gakkai]] have a strong presence in Brazil. Despite being the most expressive in Brazil, these schools face a number of challenges which limit their influence and outreach. One of those challenges is the mismatch of goals and expectations between the more traditional, Japanese-born people and the native Brazilians alongside those of Japanese descent.

Although the Japanese contributed to the introduction of Buddhism to Brazil, adherence to Buddhism is not particularly widespread among descendants of Japanese immigrants, who were largely converted to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. Those who practice and identify with Buddhism tend to display a wide variety of stances regarding their relationships to the ethnicity and the religious tradition.  To various degrees most of them attempt to simultaneously meld with local Brazilian culture according to their personal preferences. Most such schools are attempting to reach out to Brazilians not of Japanese descent, however often facing considerable internal resistance in the process.

Other Japanese traditions present in Brazil include [[Shingon]], [[Tendai]], [[Nichiren-shū]] and [[Nichiren Shōshū]] schools, albeit in somewhat modest numbers. Recent years also saw a growth of interest in the practice Zen variants from [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] in Brazil.

==Theravada Buddhism==

The [[Theravada]] tradition's presence in Brazil was started by those who created the Brazil Buddhist Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbb.riobudavihara.com Sociedade Budista do Brasil]&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially presented with a generalist non-sectarian approach to Buddhism, it evolved into a more Theravada-aligned society drawing teachings from the [[Pāli Canon]] of the [[Tripitaka]] and to other teachings and practices of the Theravada tradition.
Since the 1970s it has maintained simple installations built with voluntary work which have hosted visiting monks from Sri Lanka and other Theravada countries. In 1989, the [http://nalanda.org.br Nalanda Buddhist Centre]  was established. It maintains affiliated groups in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Curitiba]], and has invited a large number of international teachers through the years.

==Vajrayana Buddhism==
[[File:Tibetan_Buddhist_Temple_RS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temple in [[Três Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]].]]
All four major schools of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], [[Nyingma]], [[Gelug]], [[Sakya]] and [[Kagyu]] schools, maintain active centers in Brazil. [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] relocated the headquarters of his international organization to [[Três Coroas]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] State where he spent the last few years of his life. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] visited Brazil in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/45-sao-paulo-city-welcomes-hh-the-dalai-lama News | The Office of His Holiness The Dalai Lama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahayana Buddhism==

The Chinese [[Zen|Chan]] school and Mahayana Buddhism is centered on the city of [[Cotia]]'s [[Zu Lai Temple]] and its companion Buddhist University in [[São Paulo State]], both of which were opened in 2003. The temple, near the city of [[São Paulo]], is the largest temple in Latin America, and was built using funds raised from American Buddhist organisations and donors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braziltravelblog.com/2007/03/17/brazil-in-pictures-zu-lai-temple/ Brazil in pictures: Zu Lai temple&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fo Guang Shan Temple in the city of [[Olinda]], in the northeastern state of [[Pernambuco]], also belongs to the Mahayana tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://templofgsolinda.blogspot.com/ Fo Guang Shan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese Zen school of [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] maintains temples and sangha in the cities of [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iamhome.org/international.htm#Brazil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531045226/http://iamhome.org/international.htm#Brazil |archivedate=2009-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism Today==

Although Brazil remains a largely Christian country, Buddhism has a growing presence in Brazil. There is considerable online activity and dialogue amongst Brazilian Buddhists, with a number of websites and online groups; there are, for example, Facebook groups dedicated for discussion and clarifying doubts about Buddhism and Buddhist teachings.

The activities of Buddhist groups are however a bit restricted due to the linguistic geography of Brazil - since it is a non-Spanish speaking country in Latin America. This limits the cross-boundary activities typical of the Buddhist organisations active in other countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The State government of [[Espírito Santo]] has implemented a special training programme for military police to attend zen courses at the [http://www.mosteirozen.com.br Mosteiro Zen Morro da Vargem].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psfk.com/2010/06/military-police-meets-zen-buddhism.html Military Police Meets Zen Buddhism - PSFK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] is a small minority [[Religion in the Netherlands|religion]] in the [[Netherlands]], but it has shown rapid growth in recent years.{{when?|date=July 2015}} As of the 2006 estimate, 170,000 Dutch people identified their religion as Buddhist (about 1% of the total population).&lt;ref&gt;Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau. ''[http://www.scp.nl/dsresource?objectid=19831&amp;type=org Maatschappelijke organisaties in beeld]''. Den Haag, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The first awareness of '''Buddhism in the Netherlands''' can be traced back to early books,&lt;ref&gt;Philip Utenbroeke (c.13) [[Barlaam and Josaphat (book)|Barlaam en Joasaph]] – a translation of the Greek manuscript by c.7 patriarch [[John of Damascus]]&lt;/ref&gt; with references to Buddhism reappearing in 1651,&lt;ref&gt;Rogerius (1651) notes of missionary work on the Coromandel Coast of India mentioning the Buddha as the ninth Avatar of Visnu&lt;/ref&gt; 1843&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Halbertsma (1789-1869) Het Buddhisme en zijn Stichter (Buddhism and its Founder) based on Brian Houghton Hodgson's illustrations of the literature and religion of the Buddhists, published in 1841&lt;/ref&gt; and 1878,&lt;ref&gt;C.P.Tiele (1878) review on W. T. Rhys Davids' book Buddhism: Being a sketch of the Life and Teaching of Gautama, the Buddha&lt;/ref&gt; with the first book on Buddhism being written in the [[Dutch language]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;J.P. van der Vegte (1879) Het Buddhisme en zijn Stichter (Buddhism and its founder) 330pp (translation of Rhys Davids' book)&lt;/ref&gt; The turn of the century saw more popular books on Buddhism published in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Ortt (1905) [[The Gospel of Buddha]] translation of the work by Paul Carus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.U. Meyboom (1902) ''Het Licht van Azie'' translation of Paul Arnold's ''The Light of Asia''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Wijnaendts Francken (1897) ''Het boeddhisme en zijn wereldbeschouwing'' (Buddhism and its world-view)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Bouwman (1906) ''Boeddhisme en Christendom'' (Buddhism and Christianity)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. van Houten (1889) ''De leer van de Boeddha naar de heilige boeken van het zuidelijke Boeddhisnie voor Europeanen bewerk'' (The Teaching of the Buddha according to the holy books of Southern Buddhism, adapted for Europeans)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study of Buddhism in the Netherlands==
The scientific study of Buddhism began in the Netherlands with the appointment of [[Hendrik Kern]] as the first professor for the chair for Sanskrit at [[Leiden University]]. He published two histories&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kern (1882) ‘Geschiedenis van het Buddhisme in Indie’(History of Buddhism in India) Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kern (1884) ‘Geschiedenis van het Buddhisme in Indie’ Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and a manual of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kern (1896) Manual of [[India]]n Buddhism&lt;/ref&gt; Kern, like [[Émile Senart]], portrayed the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as a legendary being or a hero representing the sun. Kern was succeeded by [[Jacob Speyer]] (1849–1913), who translated several [[Mahayana]] texts and the [[Jatakamala]] for the series ‘The Sacred Books of the Buddhists’. The subsequent chair, [[Jean Philippe Vogel]] (1871–1958), became famous as an archaeologist by proving that Kasia in India must have been [[Kusinara]], the place of the [[Parinirvana]] of the Buddha. He also conducted investigations on the [[Borobudur]], the great Buddhist monument on the Isle of [[Java]].

==Postwar Buddhism==
After the [[World War II|Second World War]], a strong ally for Buddhism came in the form of the [[Theosophists]]. The Dutch secretary of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]], Mrs. Spruitenburg, returned from India and started ‘gatherings’ in her home in [[Huizen]] that attracted dozens of people from all over the country. Among them was Ernst Verwaal, who founded the ‘Buddhistische Vriendenkring Den Haag’ (Circle of Friends of Buddhism The Hague), later renamed as ‘Nederlandse Buddhistische Vriendenkring’ (Dutch Circle of Friends of Buddhism). He issued a simple journal.&lt;ref&gt;‘De Samenspraak’ (The Dialogue)&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of the ‘Circle’ was in [[The Hague]], where in 1966 the wife of the [[Thailand|Thai]] Ambassador, Mrs. Bhakdi, started receiving on Saturdays its members in the Thai Embassy. Later the group was presided by Ronald Poelmeijer, also being influenced by Peter van der Beek, who in 1953 became a member of The Western Buddhist Order, represented in [[Europe]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] Buddhist Jack Austin.

==National Buddhist Organisation==
In 1966 the Dutch Circle of Friends of Buddhism Circle changed its name to the ‘Buddhist Society in the Netherlands’. The new Society held activities that were calculated liberal to all the schools of Buddhism. This ecumenical policy led to some dissension, and later the organization was revamped as the ‘Stichting Nederlands Buddhistisch Centrum’ (Dutch Buddhist Centre Foundation) on 8 November 1967, with the aim ‘to study of the principles of Buddhism in all its diversity and to encourage the practical application of these principles. From 1968 to the present, the Centre has issued a journal. Originally it was called ‘Saddharma’&lt;ref&gt;Saddharma&lt;/ref&gt; and early in the 21st century it was rechristened as ‘Vorm en Leegte’&lt;ref&gt;Vorm en Leegte&lt;/ref&gt; and published together with a commercial Buddhist publisher. The centre changed its name in 1978 to ‘Stichting Vrienden van het Boeddhisme’ (Friends of Buddhism Foundation). In the same year the ‘Boeddhistische Unie van Nederland’ (Buddhist Union of the Netherlands) was founded, consisting only of representatives of Buddhist groups, with Tony Kurpershoek-Scherft as its first President. It was this second organization which became the Dutch member of the [[European Buddhist Union]]. Early 21st century however it dropped its membership of the EBU for a number of reasons; a main one being that the EBU had, and currently still has, both national umbrella organisations amongst its members as well as 'traditions on European level' like FPMT, Triratna Buddhist Community etc. making it in the BUN's eyes a too confused platform.

From 1978 onwards, the history of Buddhism in the Netherlands is mostly the story of individual Buddhist traditions. With however the BUN still acting on their behalf towards government and NGOs, leading to e.g. the BOS 'Boeddhistische Omroep Stichting' (Buddhist Broadcasting Channel) and the formal Buddhist Prisoner Chaplainship which gets equal recognition as other religions. And the SVB still being relevant as an ecumenical entry-level organisation, and as publisher of the only generic Buddhist (quarterly) magazine available in Dutch kiosks.

==Zen/Chán Buddhism==
{{primary sources|section|date=February 2013}}
In 1968 Leo Boer and [[Janwillem van de Wetering]] founded a [[Zen]] group, and through two books &lt;ref&gt;Janwillem van de Wetering (1973) ''Het dagende niets'' (The Dawning of Nothingness)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janwillem van de Wetering (1973) ''The Empty Mirror'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul)&lt;/ref&gt; made Zen popular in the Netherlands. The guidance of the group was taken over by Erik Bruijn who is still in charge of a flourishing community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erikbruijn.nl Erik Bruijn]&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are several Zen organisations in the Netherlands:
* The Kanzeon Sangha of [[Dennis Merzel|Genpo Roshi]] – having its roots in the [[White Plum Asanga]] of [[Taizan Maezumi]] Roshi – consists of several organisations:
** Niko Tydeman Sensei leads the ''Zen Centrum Amsterdam'', which has a relatively large [[zendo]] in the centre of [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenamsterdam.nl/ Zen Centrum Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Tenkei Coppens Roshi leads the ''Zen River'' Buddhist monastery in [[Uithuizen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenrivertemple.org/index.html Zen River]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ton Lathouwers is the informal "leader" of ''Maha Karuna Ch’an'', an ''… informal and fundamentally open sangha of laypersons …''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahakarunachan.be/welkom/introduction-in-english/ Maha Karuna Ch’an] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425150903/http://www.mahakarunachan.be/welkom/introduction-in-english/ |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ton studied under several teachers, beginning with [[Masao Abe]]. He received dharma transmission from the Indonesian [[Chán]] teacher [[Ashin Jinarakkhita|Teh Cheng]]. Ton's teachings are characterised by an emphasises on [[Karuṇā|karuna]].
* Another group consists of the ''Zen.nl'' organisation from Rients Ritskes, a student of Hirata Roshi of [[Tenryū-ji]] in Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zen.nl/nl/index.php Zen.nl] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509202816/http://www.zen.nl/nl/index.php |date=May 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in Kyoto in 1986/87, and claimed to be "officially authorised" by Sokun Tsushimoto Roshi in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130222191903/http://www.zen.nl/zenmanagement/trainers.php Zen.nl Zenmanagement: trainers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ Boeddhistisch Dagblad, 17 april 2013, ''Rients Ritskes op beschuldiging: ‘Raksu formeel uitgereikt als bewijs van competent zenleiderschap’''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420011852/http://boeddhistischdagblad.nl/rients-ritskes-op-beschuldiging-raksu-formeel-uitgereikt-als-bewijs-van-een-competent-zenleader/ |date=April 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090802x1.html The Japan Times online: Caring for body and soul. Interview with Sokun Tsushimoto]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many other groups are also represented in the Netherlands, like the ''Order of Buddhist Contemplatives'' in Apeldoorn, the [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] ''Order of Interbeing'' and the ''International Zen Institute Noorderpoort''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeninstitute.org/en/home.html International Zen Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; monastery/retreat centre in Drenthe, led by Jiun Hogen Roshi.
* Chinese Buddhists developed an own centre: it is a famous landmark in the Chinatown district of Amsterdam, called the He Hua temple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021208151922/http://www.ibps.nl/en/hehuahome.htm He Hua Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; It's manned primarily by monks and nuns linked to the [[BLIA]] of Ven. [[Hsing Yun]] from Taiwan.

==Theravada Buddhism==
In 1971 the Dutch merchant Monshouwer gathered some people in order to discuss the possibility of founding a [[Theravada]] temple with the support of Thai ambassador Sompong Sucharitkul. In 1973 the temple was officially founded in [[Waalwijk]]. Originally the temple was named Wat Dhammasucaritanucharee, but two years later renamed as Buddharama Temple with its own supporting foundation called ‘Young Buddhists Netherlands’. This foundation had its own journal.&lt;ref&gt;‘Vipassana-Sara’&lt;/ref&gt; Later the founding abbot Ven. Mettavihari moved to Amsterdam and started a separate community of vipassana practitioners there. The foundation supporting the Thai temple in Waalwijk was renamed the ‘Nederlandse Buddha Dhamma Stichting’ (Dutch Buddha Dhamma Foundation) and now aims mainly for Thai immigrants. 

In 2015 it became known that Mettavihari had sexually abused various of his followers in Waalwijk and elsewhere. At least 21 victims had accused him of abuse by June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Excuses voor slachtoffers misbruik boeddhistische tempel Waalwijk|url = http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4060527/excuses-slachtoffers-misbruik-boeddhistische-tempel-waalwijk.html|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passing away of Ven. Mettavihari, there still is the Sangha Metta Buddhist temple [http://www.sanghametta.nl] in Amsterdam centre; next to this two countrywide organisations being the general Vipassana-oriented SIM [http://www.simsara.nl] and the Burmese-oriented Sagya U Bha Khin [https://web.archive.org/web/20100816074745/http://www.ubakhin.net/]. Also more regional organisations exist e.g. around Groningen and Drenthe in the north of the country.

==Tibetan Buddhism==
In 1977 Han de Wit, an authorized pupil of the Kagyu lama [[Chogyam Trungpa]], founded a centre in Amsterdam [http://www.shambhala.nl] which is engaged in teaching the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and meditation according to [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibet]]an tradition. There is a smaller centre in [[Oegstgeest]], also founded by de Wit, and groups in two other towns (Utrecht and Nijmegen). Other [[Karma Kagyu]] centres from different lineages have also sprung up, e.g. Naropa Institute in Cadzand, the locally famous Stupa temple in Hantum [http://www.karmakagyu.nl/] and Diamond Way Buddhism (Ole Nydahl).
The Tibetan Nyingma tradition is represented by several groups. They have a centre (Nyingma Centrum, Nederland) and a bookshop in Amsterdam. These groups belong to the organization of [[Tarthang Tulku]] who resides in [[California]]. The Gelugpa tradition (FPMT) is organized in the Maitreya Institute and owns a retreat centre in [[Loenen, Apeldoorn]] and a city centre in [[Amsterdam]]. The Maitreya Institute centres here are based on the initiative of Paula Koolkin in 1976. In August 1979 lama Thubten Yeshe and lama Zopa Rinpoche came to teach. By 2013 lama Geshe Sonam Gyaltsen and lama Sonam Ngodrup are the teachers in permanent residence. The Sakya tradition of Tibetan Buddhism took a foothold in 1976 as Geshe Lama Sherab Gyaltsen Amipa established the ‘Sakya Thegchen Ling’ in The Hague. 
Next to these four main schools there are also representations of more ecumenic and split-off Tibetan Groups. E.g. Rigpa from [[Sogyal Rinpoche]], [[Dzogchen]] community from [[Chogyal Namkhai Norbu]], the [[New Kadampa Tradition]] and the Jewel Heart affiliated with [[Gelek Rinpoche]].

==Other groups==
Finally two more ecumenic groups should be mentioned. In the first place the [[Triratna Buddhist Community]] (TBC, formerly FWBO) [http://www.triratna.nl] connected with the large movement of Ven. [[Sangharakshita]] in the [[UK]]. It is growing at a regular speed, with centres in Amsterdam and Arnhem and a retreat centre in [[Hengstdijk]], in the southern Zeeuws-Vlaanderen region. The centre in Den Haag, 'Boeddhistisch Centrum Haaglanden', follows roughly the same teaching but separated from the movement. Secondly there is the [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]], a group of pupils of [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]]. This group had separated itself from the larger group in [[Germany]] after the death of Lama Govinda.

==Present situation==
{{update|section|date=July 2015}}
In 1971 there were 900 Buddhists in the Netherlands. Since 1971 the number of Buddhists has increased considerably, probably in connection with the rise of ‘alternative’ views in society and the decline of [[Religion in the Netherlands#Major denominations|Christianity]]. The increased interest in Buddhism is evident from the growth in number of Buddhist centres. In 1990 total there were forty-two groups.,&lt;ref&gt;quantitative estimations are based on a 1990 survey by V. van Gemert&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 between eighty and one hundred including groups associated with a larger national centre. A Buddhist broadcasting channel (Boeddhistische Omroep Stichting)[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216161851/http://www.buddhistmedia.com/news.aspx?lStrLang=eng] offers programming on the national network. In 2004 there were 170,000 Buddhists in the Netherlands - about 1% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;2004 data drawn from [http://www.scp.nl/dsresource?objectid=19831&amp;type=org 2008 SCP report]&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Buddhist Prison Chaplainship [https://web.archive.org/web/20090831165643/http://www.gevangenisboeddhist.nl/], 'Boeddhistische Zendende Instantie', is formally recognised by the government, gets equal subsidy as the other main religions and is busy setting up a professional training in cooperation with the Free University of Amsterdam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">'''Cipus''' was a legendary Roman [[praetor]] famous for his ''[[pietas]]''. After receiving a prophecy that he would become king of Rome, he chose voluntary exile instead of the throne. He is mentioned by [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', [[Pliny the Elder]] in ''[[Natural History]]'', and [[Valerius Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Karl Galinsky, The Cipus Episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association Vol. 98 (1967), pp. 181-191&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature== 
Ovid's treatment of Cipus in Book 15 of '''Metamorphoses''' is the most thorough.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' XV.552-621&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ovid, Cipus notices that he has grown horns on his head after seeing his reflection in a stream. He declares that if the omen is good it should benefit his lands and the inhabitants of [[Quirinus]] (i.e., [[Rome]]), but if the omen is ill it should fall solely on his shoulders. Cipus then builds new altars and makes sacrifices to the gods. A seer who examined the entrails spilled during the sacrifice prophesies that Cipus would enter Rome and be chosen its king.

Cipus decides that living in exile is preferable to being made king and devises a plan. He hides his horns with a garland of laurel and calls a meeting of the citizens and the [[Roman Senate]]. At this gathering, he warns that it has been prophesied that someone with horns on his head will enter Rome, be made its king, and give the citizens laws as if they were slaves. Cipus does not reveal that he is the prophesied king, but, instead, tells the people that he has hindered this king.

At the end of his speech, Cipus removes the garland of laurel and reveals his horns. The people are awe struck by this revelation, but soon place a festive headdress on Cipus' head since they cannot allow him to remain in Rome un-honored. The Senate then grants Cipus lands equal to the amount that oxen could encircle in one day and he leaves the city in exile.

Finally, the image of Cipus' horns is carved on the gates of the city gate and his name is remembered for ages to come.

'''''Citizen Khan''''' is a [[British sitcom]] produced by the [[BBC]] and created by [[Adil Ray]]. Five series have been shown so far. It was set in Sparkhill, East Birmingham, described by its lead character, a British Pakistani Muslim Mr Khan (Ray), as "the capital of [[British Pakistani|British Pakistan]]". ''Citizen Khan'' follows the trials and tribulations of Mr Khan, a loud-mouthed, patriarchal, cricket-loving, self-appointed community leader, and his long suffering wife (played by [[Shobu Kapoor]]) and daughters Shazia ([[Maya Sondhi]] 2012–2014, Krupa Pattani 2015–16) and Alia ([[Bhavna Limbachia]]).&lt;ref name="mediacentre"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/citizenkhan/ | title=A new sitcom for BBC One created by and starring Adil Ray | publisher= [[BBC]] | date=17 August 2012 | accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Series One, [[Kris Marshall]] starred as Dave, the manager of Mr Khan's local [[mosque]].&lt;ref name="mediacentre"/&gt;  The first name of Mrs Khan is Razia, however Mr Khan's first name is never revealed.

The title of the show is a play on the title of the [[Orson Welles]] film ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=khuramshaz|url=http://muskandmoccasin.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/bbc-citizen-khan/|title=BBC: Citizen Khan|publisher=Musk &amp; Moccasin|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character Mr Khan had already featured in the [[BBC Two]] comedy series ''[[Bellamy's People]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000281/adil_ray_mr_khan_tv_transfer/ | title=TV series for Bellamy's People character Mr Khan?| publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]] | date=8 April 2010 | accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Down the Line (radio series)|Down the Line]]''&lt;ref name="mediacentre"/&gt; and on his own online series on the BBC Comedy website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/show/p007b7j6/mr_khan/ | title=BBC – Comedy – Clips from 'Mr Khan' | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 2012, the BBC announced that ''Citizen Khan'' had been commissioned for a second series.&lt;ref name="metroseries2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/913476-citizen-khan-gets-second-series-from-bbc-despite-anti-islam-controversy|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|title=Citizen Khan gets second series from BBC despite 'anti-Islam' controversy|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2013, BBC controller [[Charlotte Moore (TV executive)|Charlotte Moore]] announced that ''Citizen Khan'' had been renewed for a third series which began airing on 31 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a535187/citizen-khan-to-return-for-third-series-on-bbc-one.html|title=Citizen Khan to return for third series on BBC One|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 2014, BBC comedy controller Shane Allen announced that a fourth series had been commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Ben|title=Citizen Khan to return for a fourth series|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a615923/citizen-khan-to-return-for-a-fourth-series.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2015, the official Facebook page of ''Citizen Khan'' confirmed through a video of Mr Khan that the fourth series would begin on 30 October 2015. On 20 January 2016, it was confirmed the show would return for a fifth series which started airing on 4 November 2016.

Although Adil Ray is a Muslim, the show has divided opinion on whether its humour is a mockery of followers of that religion. Ray maintains that Mr Khan is a comic character who is intended for families of any ethnic background to relate to, as with other British family sitcoms.&lt;ref name=dont/&gt;

==Broadcast and reception==
The first episode of ''Citizen Khan'' was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 27 August 2012, in a late timeslot of 10:20pm. It received what [[Digital Spy]] referred to as an "impressive" 3.41 million viewers and 20.9% of the audience.&lt;ref name="ep1viewers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a402141/new-tricks-series-nine-launches-with-78-million.html|title='New Tricks' series nine launches with 7.8 million|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s Saira Khan stated "at last, a home grown sitcom that allows British Muslims to laugh at themselves. Good on the BBC for finally realising the comic potential in one of the biggest communities that make up modern Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Saira|title=Offensive? Racist? No, just funny – and oh so true!|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2195459/Citizen-Khan-Offensive-Racist-No-just-funny--oh-true.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Hasnet Lais stated "Credit must be given to Adil Ray for not sparing any sacred cows and shining light on the conundrum of some British Muslim women under the patriarchal cosh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizen Khan’s Alia: How the hijab got sexy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/citizen-khan-s-alia-how-the-hijab-got-sexy-8194410.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC received over 700 complaints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sitcom Citizen Khan prompts 185 complaints to the BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19395994|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the airing of the first episode with a further 20 complaints to [[Ofcom]]. Some British Muslims claimed that the show "ridicules" and "insults" Islam. The BBC claimed it had evidence the complaints were part of a [[Lobbying|lobbying campaign]] and countered it saying a number of people, including those of Muslim communities, praised the show and referred to its audience figures as a "very positive start."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19395994|title=Sitcom Citizen Khan prompts 185 complaints to the BBC|publisher=BBC News|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Independent''{{'}}s Arifa Akbar commented negatively on its many clichéd jokes and character traits and drawing many comparisons with 1970s-style sitcoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-viewing--citizen-khan-bbc1-hunderby-sky-atlantic-8082402.html|title=Last night's viewing – Citizen Khan ( Tawqir Asghar)|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012|location=London|first=Arifa|last=Akbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Jones of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was more optimistic, describing it as "an affable enough debut, deserving a wider audience than this post-watershed slot is likely to attract."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/26/how-big-is-the-universe?newsfeed=true|title=TV highlights 27/08/2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012|location=London|first1=Andrew|last1=Mueller|first2=Rebecca|last2=Nicholson|first3=Ali|last3=Catterall|first4=Mark|last4=Jones|first5=Gwilym|last5=Mumford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islam Channel]] made a special show titled ''Politics and Media: Citizen Khan – Racist stereotypes or harmless fun?'' Presenter [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]] discussed whether the BBC comedy is stereotyping Muslims, or whether it is fun and can be laughed about by Muslims.

By the second episode, broadcast on 3 September, ''Citizen Khan'' clips had become [[viral video|viral]]. Opinion outside the United Kingdom has also been mixed, resulting in many heated debates. Outside of the UK, Pakistani newspaper ''[[The News International]]'' criticised the BBC's use of Pakistani flags in the Khan's home and Mr Khan's younger daughter quickly putting on a [[hijab]] and pretending to read the [[Qur'an]]. The Pakistan News Watch website countered "shows like ''Citizen Khan'' are essential in multicultural societies and help put all communities on an equal footing – if everyone can have a laugh at everyone else's expense, then no one can claim superiority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Brown|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19511191|title=Citizen Khan – view from abroad|publisher=BBC|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate continued into a third week with the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' publishing an article by Pakistani journalist Sabbiyah Pervez appealing to her own community to "stop being so defensive and learn to laugh at itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sabbiyah|last=Pervez|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/letters-and-columnists/sabbiyah-pervez-my-community-should-stop-being-so-defensive-and-learn-to-laugh-at-itself-1-4915866|title=Sabbiyah Pervez: My community should stop being so defensive and learn to laugh at itself|publisher=[[Yorkshire Post]]|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC ordered a seven-episode second series on 27 September 2012 due to good ratings.&lt;ref name="metroseries2"/&gt; On 18 September 2013, the BBC announced that the second series would air on Friday nights in the prime time 9.30pm slot from 4 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2013/40/bbcone-citizenkhan.html|title=BBC – Citizen Khan – Media Centre|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''The Guardian'', Adil Ray stated "What I’ve intended to do with ''Citizen Khan'' is a good thing – to make Mr Khan a good character, to make him universal and a communication between different communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizen Khan creator Adil Ray: 'Don't allow yourself to be offended'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/29/citizen-khan-adil-ray-sitcom|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television industry newspaper [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]] run an article entitled ‘Rise of a sitcom hero’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adil Ray, Citizen Khan|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/features/adil-ray-citizen-khan/5060802.article|publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show, along with coverage of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' and ''[[The Voice UK]]'', made up the list of the most watched shows on the [[BBC iPlayer]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267712/How-tablet-taking-TV-BBC-reveals-record-iPlayer-figures-mobile-devices.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Mark | last=Prigg | title=How the tablet is taking over from the TV: BBC reveals record iPlayer figures for mobile devices | date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series 3 of ''Citizen Khan'' gained an audience of around 5 million per episode, including iPlayer views. Ahead the Series 4 debut in October 2015, Vicky Power of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' stated "It’s harmless, friendly fun for the whole family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV tonight: Nigella's back|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10908196/Whats-on-TV-tonight.html?ref=driverlayer.com/web|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series 4 of ''Citizen Khan'' made its debut on 30 October 2015. The series attracted a record 3.3 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK TV ratings: Gogglebox tops Friday night with 3.5 million for Channel 4|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a676655/uk-tv-ratings-gogglebox-tops-friday-night-with-35-million-for-channel-4.html#~psTkK65YAzaIZ4|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Citizen Khan'' has been exported to Australia, India, Russia, Bulgaria and New Zealand, spawned Christmas specials and prompted a UK-wide “live” tour of regional theaters. Speaking to ''The Daily Telegraph'' in 2015 ahead of the launch of series 4, Adil Ray stated that fans of the show realise it is a "big laugh out loud comedy, not a reflection of every Muslim or Pakistani family in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The only time you see Muslims on TV is as terrorists'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11958400/The-only-time-you-see-Muslims-on-TV-is-as-terrorists.html|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Series 4, the role of Shazia Khan was taken over by Krupa Pattani replacing Maya Sondhi.

Adil Ray has reported that he received death threats for the show, including one threatening a riot.&lt;ref name=dont&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conlan|first1=Tara|title=Citizen Khan creator Adil Ray: 'Don't allow yourself to be offended'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/29/citizen-khan-adil-ray-sitcom|accessdate=15 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that his influences came from comedies such as ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' and ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' that were aimed at family audiences, and he desires for families of all backgrounds to be able to see elements of Khan's character in their father figure.&lt;ref name=dont/&gt; Ray has claimed that for every complaint he had over a scene in which Khan's daughter Alia hurriedly covers her head in the presence of her father, he received ten from Muslims, Catholics and Jews relating to the experience of a child behaving similarly.&lt;ref name=dont/&gt;

In April 2016, the show was condemned in parliament by [[Rupa Huq]], Labour MP for [[Ealing Central and Acton]], who called its portrayal of a Birmingham Muslim family "quite backward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC sitcom Citizen Khan 'Islamophobic', says MP|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36048059?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_daily_politics_and_sunday_politics&amp;ns_source=facebook&amp;ns_linkname=news_central|accessdate=15 April 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Condemned: Criminal Origins''''' (known in Europe as '''''Condemned''''') is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[survival horror]] [[video game]] developed by [[Monolith Productions]] and published by [[Sega]]. It was launched worldwide in 2005 on the [[Xbox 360]], with a [[Microsoft Windows]] version released later in 2006.

''Condemned: Criminal Origins'' places an emphasis on melee combat and puzzle solving, including searching for fingerprints and gathering evidence.

Upon release, ''Condemned'' was met with moderate to good reviews by many aggregates and critics. Many reviewers cited its storyline and lack of progression as the game's biggest fault. As a reprieve, the game's solid controls and fresh approach to the horror genre were praised. A sequel, entitled ''[[Condemned 2: Bloodshot]]'', was released in 2008 for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. Other media forms include an internet prequel and a planned film adaptation to expand the ''Condemned'' franchise. The developers have cited films such as ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' and ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' as inspiration for the game.

==Gameplay==

===Combat===
Although the game is played entirely from a first-person perspective (only broken for [[cut scene]]s), it is not a traditional [[first-person shooter]]. Firearms are present, but are somewhat uncommon. Unlike many other games from a first-person perspective, though, firearms are especially deadly, often killing enemies with a single shot. The guns that can be found, or taken from enemies, are only good for as long as the current ammo in the magazine lasts; once this is depleted, the butt of the gun can be used as a weapon. To complicate matters further, enemies operate firearms from the same ammo reserve, meaning once the enemy has been dispatched, the player only gets what ammo was left over from the fight. This encourages players to attack enemies carrying firearms quickly.

The focus of the experience is on improvised [[melee]], allowing players and enemies to collect, or even pull, weapons from their surrounding environments, such as pipes, locker doors, shovels, and [[Dimensional lumber#Softwoods|2x4]]s. The word often employed by the developers of the game to describe the combat is '[[visceral]]'. A quick-kick is available for attacking without, or alongside, a hand-held weapon, and attacks can be unleashed in different directions and configurations, such as left to right or overhead, but combat is notable for ''not'' utilizing a [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]] system, unlike similar titles such as ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay]]''. In many cases, blocking is necessary both before and after landing a successful hit. The player can also perform "finishing moves" when the opponent is on his knees, such as [[headbutt]]ing or breaking their neck.

The artificial intelligence displayed by enemies requires the player to think on their feet a great deal more than similar games. Enemies are able to flee and hide effectively, often surprising the player by quickly appearing from a concealed spot. Enemies can also effectively [[feint]], in order to trick the player into blocking at an inopportune time, leaving themselves open for the real attack.

Although there are sharp weapons in the game, one cannot stab or dismember enemies. In fact, the player can almost never wield an actual knife or sword, with the exception being in the School level, where the player has brief access to a meat cleaver. Some melee weapons fall under the class of ''entry tool'', (like a fire axe for a rotten door, or a crowbar for a locked safe) and act as keys in the gameworld, allowing the player to access new areas or locked boxes.

The player also has a taser gun which when used stuns the target, does some damage and allows the player to seize the stunned enemy's weapon. Later in the game, Lieutenant Rosa gives the player a new upgraded taser, which is much more powerful, causing the enemy's legs to give out. One hit or shot after that will kill any enemy. Common uses for it are safely attacking enemies with guns (since it allows players to stun them from a distance and then seize the gun while the enemy is incapacitated), countering an immediate attack (since using the taser does not require the precise timing that blocking does) and obtaining the chance to make a free hit (a hit where the player does not risk being hit first). However, it has to recharge between shots so it cannot be used to bypass the game's system of carefully fighting enemies.

The entire game takes place in derelict urban environments, with minimum lighting. The player must use a flashlight to navigate through the game's constantly darkened environments, while dealing with frequent enemy ambushes.

Near the end of the game the player loses both the flashlight and the taser. This means all strategies which required the taser become impossible and the only personal light source becomes burning planks which means carrying a gun reduces visibility. This effectively forces the player to rely exclusively on blocking, hiding and evasion for defense and close range attacks for offense.

===Crime scenes===
''Condemned'' directly involves the player in [[Forensics|crime scene investigations]], offering the ability to, at the press of a [[Context-sensitive user interface|context-sensitive]] button, call upon a suite of forensic tools to find and record evidence. The player character is linked to an FBI lab via his mobile phone throughout the investigation, allowing (almost immediate) remote examination and analysis by his support worker, Rosa. Crime scene evidence can be used to solve puzzles, allowing the player to pass previously impassable barriers, and provide clues to the overall mysteries of the story.

Examples of evidence include fingerprints, footprints, fibers, fluids (such as blood or chemicals), particles, residues, markings/etchings, material, imprints, wounds, small objects, documents, and body parts.

The player character is gifted with the instinctual ability to detect when forensic evidence is nearby, allowing players to bring up the detection and collection tools when appropriate. However, the "instincts" of the character only vaguely highlight the area in which the evidence resides; it is up to the player to methodically sweep the scene and catalog any findings.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Condemned: Criminal Origins'' is set in the fictional American city of Metro. The player takes on the role of Ethan Thomas, a crime scene investigation agent with the [[FBI]]'s  Serial Crime Unit, as he traverses the seedier sides of the city. His journey takes him through a number of condemned buildings as he searches for the one who framed him for murder, the evasive Serial Killer X. Along the way, Ethan must use his investigative intuition and technology to examine evidence left behind by SKX, all the while fighting off the violently psychotic denizens of Metro City, who seem to be driven to such madness by a mysterious, yet seemingly extraneous force.

===Characters===
The game's protagonist is Ethan Thomas (voiced by [[Greg Grunberg]]), an SCU investigator with unusually acute investigative instincts. He also is stated to have superhuman durability, as demonstrated by his ability to recover quickly from electrocution, long falls, and blunt trauma to the head, among others. He is aided in his investigations by Rosa, a forensics investigator at headquarters.

The primary antagonist of the game is Serial Killer X, who is hunting the serial killers that Ethan is searching for, killing them by the methods that they themselves use. Near the end of the game, he is revealed to be Leland Vanhorn, nephew of Ethan’s friend Malcolm. Malcolm believes that Leland is being influenced by mysterious mutilated humanoid creatures that are causing an increase in insanity throughout the city.

===Plot===
The game begins with the protagonist, SCU agent Ethan Thomas, arriving at the scene of a murder. He and his fellow officers go into an abandoned building that is surrounded by psychopaths and criminals. The crime scene they investigate is one of a young woman. She is on the floor with strangulation wounds, sitting across a table from a male mannequin. Ethan, along with his colleagues, agree that the murder was most likely committed by the Match Maker, a serial killer that Ethan has been investigating. After they collect evidence from the scene, one of the officers smells cigarette smoke. Believing that the smoke must be coming from their suspect, they decide to split up and go after him. While searching for the suspect, Ethan tries to restore power from an electrical box. Due to an electrical surge, Ethan is shocked, and drops to the floor, causing his weapon to be thrown from his hand. A man hiding in the shadows takes it and flees. Ethan manages to chase the man into a small, dead-end room, where the man holds Ethan at gunpoint and tells him they have similar goals. Ethan's colleagues enter the room and tell the man to drop his weapon, and are promptly shot by the man with Ethan's gun, who then shoves Ethan out a window onto the street.

Ethan wakes in his apartment with Malcolm Vanhorn, a friend of Ethan’s father, at his side. Malcolm warns Ethan that he is wanted for the deaths of the two officers who were shot with Ethan's gun. Ethan is determined to prove his innocence, although his own sanity appears to be slipping, as throughout the game he suffers numerous horrific visions, and all the while is forced to fight to the death in self-defence against homeless men and women who have inexplicably been driven insane.

He soon learns that the killer is interested in Ethan’s SCU career. Later, he finds the body of the Match Maker, killed by his own [[modus operandi]] in an old department store. He presumes that the man at the original crime scene, referred to in the game as "Serial Killer X", is the culprit and that he is trying to kill the serial killers that Ethan is looking for. Ethan searches for the one that he thinks is next, a serial killer dubbed 'The Torturer'.

Ethan tracks the Torturer and Serial Killer X to an abandoned apple orchard in the rural town of Brier. Shortly before finding the Torturer in the farmhouse, Ethan is attacked by a strange man-like creature. Ethan kills the creature, and continues in his search. He searches through the farm where he eventually finds the Torturer dead, also killed by his own modus operandi. Soon, Ethan finds the mysterious killer, who is revealed to be Leland Vanhorn, nephew of Malcolm Vanhorn. Malcolm arrives and knocks Ethan out with a shovel to prevent him from hurting Leland. Leland then knocks Malcolm out.

When Ethan revives, he is tied up and at the mercy of Leland. He explains to Ethan that he has been killing the serial killers that Ethan had been hunting, and that he intends to kill Ethan as well. As Leland thinks of all the ways that he can kill Ethan, cutting Ethan's finger off in the process, Ethan notices another man-like creature hiding in the [[rafter]]s. This creature is known as 'The Hate'{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and is identified as the source of the madness gripping Metro City. Malcolm jumps Leland from behind and succeeds in wrestling him to the ground. Ethan manages to free himself, and Malcolm tells him to kill The Hate, saying that it is the cause of Leland’s madness. Ethan pursues The Hate as it tries to escape, fighting waves of hideously burned homeless men along the way, and eventually corners it in a barn and kills it.

As Malcolm drives Ethan home, Ethan discovers that Leland is alive, and in the trunk of the car. When Ethan opens the trunk, he is given the option to shoot the tied-up Leland. If he does not shoot Leland, Leland pulls out his own gun and waves it at Ethan before committing suicide. Later, Ethan and Rosa are having a conversation in a diner when Rosa tips him off that she is wired, revealing that she still trusts him. Rosa then leaves the diner, and Ethan goes to the bathroom. While in the restroom, the player witnesses as Ethan's mouth becomes that of one of The Hate before the game comes to an abrupt halt.

==Unlockable content==
The version of ''Condemned: Criminal Origins'' for the [[Xbox 360]] console employs the achievements system mandated by [[Microsoft]]. As the criteria for the achievement awards are met, bonus content is unlocked, which can then be accessed from a special menu. Content includes concept and production sketches and paintings, work-in-progress animation, video from motion capture sessions, and a rather lengthy video showcasing a complete level from an early version of the game. These features were later carried over to the PC version of the game.

==Development==
{{Expand section|date=February 2008}}

''Condemned: Criminal Origins'' was originally known as ''The Dark'', quite far into production. Under this name, the game was largely similar but differed in several key areas. The player character was known as Agent Cross, and the game appeared to follow him on a government-sanctioned investigation, or investigations, rather than acting as a rogue on the run from the law. Although Cross possessed the supernatural leanings of Thomas from the final game, he could actually use various magical spells. For example, a spell could be uttered to pull a gun from an enemy's hands and another spell saw doors and other obstacles break in front of the player, seemingly negating the need for a fire axe. The forensic tools used by Cross also differed, as the detection and collection tools were typically one individual item - the UV light, for instance, could illuminate clues and then be used to physically swipe across them, to take samples.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Controversy===
In February 2008 all copies of ''Condemned'' were confiscated in [[Germany]] because of [[Strafgesetzbuch#.C2.A7 131: Representation of violence|§131 StGB]], which outlaws the dissemination or public display of media "which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity." Distribution in Germany is now prohibited by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcwelt.de/ratgeber/Report-Ego-Shooter-unter-Generalverdacht-67637.html |title=Ego-Shooter unter Generalverdacht? |trans-title=First-person shooter under general suspicion? |date=May 14, 2008 |website=[[PC Welt]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG Tech Media GmbH]] |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==

===Prequel===
A six-part episodic online game was released on the ''Condemned: Criminal Origins'' website.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The protagonist is Agent Mallory, who is searching for a serial killer. In the last episode, Mallory is killed by Serial Killer X. The game ends where ''Condemned: Criminal Origins'' begins.

===Sequel===
{{Main|Condemned 2: Bloodshot}}

A direct sequel to the game was released in 2008. It was titled ''Condemned 2: Bloodshot'' to show the character evolution in protagonist Ethan Thomas. The game was developed by [[Monolith Productions|Monolith]] and published by [[Sega]], the same companies as the original. It expanded on the gameplay elements from ''Condemned'' and added several new features such as online multiplayer and environmental kills.

===Film adaptation===
On October 4, 2005, [[Warner Brothers Studios]] announced plans to release a film adaptation which is set in the same "universe" as the then upcoming ''Condemned: Criminal Origins''.&lt;ref name="igntie"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steel |first=Wade |date=October 6, 2005 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/06/film-tie-in-for-condemned-criminal-origins |title=Film Tie-In for Condemned: Criminal Origins |website=IGN |publisher=Ziff Davis |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. Studios had acquired Monolith Productions during 2004 and was expecting 2008 to be announced, but never was.
 
A report from ''The Variety'' stated that Kurt Sutter, co-executive producer of the television series ''[[The Shield]]'', would be writing the screenplay for the film under the working title ''Unforgettable''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

According to earlier drafts of the script, a police officer hunts down a serial killer in an attempt to clear his name from murder. However, during the process he discovers that he may be tied to other ongoing murder cases in an unusual way. The cop soon begins to question throughout his investigation upon discovering his supernatural abilities, "who he is as a man, until he realizes he's not a man. A tug-of-war emerges among a faction of good and evil aliens."&lt;ref name="igntie"/&gt;

Also connected with the project is Jason Hall, a former Monolith CEO who joined Warner Bros. to become Vice president of Operations over their gaming division. Hall, along with Nathan Henderickson, was responsible for the film's concept and state that he seeks to "come up with something specifically designed to use multiple mediums to tell stories that had some continuity and connective thread... We wanted to create a universe that, like a ''[[Star Wars]]'', was big enough where different stories could exist."&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Michael |date=October 4, 2005 |url=https://variety.com/2005/digital/markets-festivals/wb-hatches-dual-species-1117930205/ |title=WB hatches dual species |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' indicated that the plan was to introduce audiences to the "universe" of ''Condemned'' with ''Criminal Origins'', followed by a film adaptation which will tie-in with a sequel video game gradually expanding the story's universe.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

The '''Dominican Priory, Viborg''', or '''Blackfriars''' (''Sortebrødrekloster'') was an important [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], [[Denmark]], during the Middle Ages.

== History ==
The Dominicans were a mendicant order which relied on the gifts of local people for their day to day sustinance. Their work was teaching and a rigorous daily schedule of prayers, meditation, and study. The order was introduced into Denmark by Brother Solomon from Aarhus in the 1220s. 

Viborg Priory was established perhaps as early as 1227 by Bishop [[Gunnar of Viborg]]. It is first mentioned in the church annals in 1246 when donations to the priory are listed. 

The priory church was completed towards the end of the 13th century in [[Brick Gothic|red brick in the Gothic style]] and consisted of a choir, sacristy, and central nave. It was located on the north of the priory so as to be near the town. Women were excluded from the church except during church holidays. It was unusual in that preaching was in the [[Danish language]] from 1254.

The priory complex consisted of four ranges built in a rectangle around a central courtyard. One of the wings was a dormitory which had individual cells for the friars and places for novices and lay brothers.  The Dominican custom was to sleep fully clothed, including footgear, so that they would be ready to travel at a moment's notice.

The chapter room was used for meetings and for receiving important guests. The refectory was used as a communal dining hall connected to the bakery, brewery, and storage areas. The friars had a modest library and study hall. Another wing was for guests and a hospital. Over time, through the gifts of local residents, the priory acquired land, farms and a brickworks, worked by servants, lay brothers or compulsory work owed by local farms.

A wall encircled the entire priory, and the entrances were so narrow that they prevented anyone from riding or driving into the open courtyard.  

Few of the priors' names are known as written records are scarce. Prior Adam is mentioned in 1353. Prior Niels Jepsen is named in the transfer of a farm to Bishop Erik Kaas in 1516. The last prior was Niels Vinoldsen, named in the dissolution of the priory in 1529.

==Dissolution==
The [[Reformation in Denmark|Reformation]] brought an end to the priory in Viborg and to the Dominicans in Denmark. Both [[Franciscans]] and Dominicans felt the effects of the religious reforms which swept through Denmark in the early 16th century. Many Danes felt that the tithes, fees, and work due to religious houses were a burden on a generally poor country. Dominicans and Franciscans, as [[mendicant orders]], added to that burden by requiring constant donations of food, fuel, drink, and services from the local population. [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]] and [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]], both of whom were reform-minded kings, received letters of complaint about the mendicant orders and in 1527 began granting local requests to close monasteries. Force was used to shut down religious houses in 27 town in Denmark, including Viborg. In a letter dated 23 February 1529 the king ordered that the priory should be dissolved, that the church was to become a parish church, and that citizen Jens Hvas was to take possession of the priory buildings as personal property.  

A fire damaged the priory buildings in 1552 and it appears they were pulled down and the materials used in other houses and businesses in Viborg. The church continued to serve as the parish church for the southern part of Viborg (whence it was known as the ''Søndre Sognkirke'', or "southern parish church"). A narrow tower was added to the front of the priory church in 1696-1701 with funds raised by [[Christen Erichsøn]], the local parish priest.

The town fire of 1726 weakened the remaining structure so badly that church officials decided to demolish the church and to combine the "priory parish" with the "cathedral parish" until it could be rebuilt. Construction began immediately using the groundplan of the original medieval church in the same style of red brick. Work was substantially completed in 1728. The tower had a high narrow spire on top.

King [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] donated an altarpiece, constructed in [[Antwerp]] in 1520 by [[Mogens Christian Thrane]], with dozens of pictures depicting scenes from the [[New Testament]],  from [[Christianborg Palace]] chapel in [[Copenhagen]]. It is the pride of the modern church.

==Current use==
The church was restored in 1876, and the tower spire replaced with a stepped brick top which reflects the usual Danish parish tower architecture. In 1912-1917 the church underwent an even more extensive restoration which is the church that may be still seen today.

In the tower hang three bells: the two oldest from 1729 cast by Caspar Kønig, and the most recent cast by De Smithske and added to the tower in 1929.

The church features a large [[pipe organ]] by Danish builder Christensen, built in 1985, in a mixed baroque-romantic style. Its full disposition is as follows:

==Tamil Inscriptions==
{{main|Tamil Inscriptions of Bangalore}}
The Chokkanathaswamy Temple is a 10th-century [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] temple, located in Domlur. There are a number of [[Tamil Language|Tamil]] inscriptions in the temple. Domlur is called as Tombalur or Desimanikkapattanam in these inscriptions. Chakravarthi Posalaviraramanatha Deva has left inscriptions with directions to temple authorities of his kingdom. Further some inscriptions record the tributes, taxes and tolls made to the temple by [[Deva Raya II|Devaraya II]] of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]], which state the houses, wells, land around Tombalur were offered to the deity Sokkapperumal.

==Career==
A [[periodontist]], Singh served in the [[U.S. Army]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], one of a small number of [[Sikh]]s allowed to retain articles of faith, grandfathered in after a change in policy in 1984 forbidding soldiers from exhibiting their religion with "conspicuous" clothing or style of hair or beard. He was one of few Sikhs with a turban in the U.S. Army.

Although Singh has retired from the U.S. Army, he is still actively involved in supporting rights for future Sikhs to keep their article of faiths in the military.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Gwalipa''' was an Indian hermit-saint who lived during the 8th century AD.  According to legend, Gwalipa cured the [[Rajput]] chieftain [[Suraj Sen (Gwalior)|Suraj Sen]] of leprosy, and in gratitude, [[Suraj Sen (Gwalior)|Suraj Sen]] founded the city of [[Gwalior]] in his name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ifgtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=gwalipa&amp;dq=gwalipa&amp;pgis=1 William Curtis, Fodor, Eugene, 1905 ''Fodor's India'' D.

Practitioners are called "vodouists" ([[French language|French]]: ''vodouisants'' {{IPA-fr|voduizɑ̃|}}) or "servants of the spirits" ([[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]]: ''sèvitè'').{{sfn|Cosentino|1995b|p=25}}

Vodouists believe in a distant and unknowable [[Creator deity|Supreme Creator]], ''Bondye'' (derived from the French term ''Bon Dieu'', meaning "good [[God]]"). According to Vodouists, Bondye does not intercede in human affairs, and thus they direct their worship toward spirits subservient to Bondye, called [[loa]].{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=48}} Every loa is responsible for a particular aspect of life, with the dynamic and changing personalities of each loa reflecting the many possibilities inherent to the aspects of life over which they preside.{{sfn|Brown|1991|p=6}} To navigate daily life, vodouists cultivate personal relationships with the loa through the presentation of offerings, the creation of personal altars and devotional objects, and participation in elaborate ceremonies of music, dance, and [[spirit possession]].{{sfn|Brown|1991|p=4–7}}

Vodou originated in what is now [[Benin Republic]] and developed in the [[French colonial empire]] in the 18th century among West African peoples who were enslaved, when African religious practice was actively suppressed, and enslaved Africans were [[Forced conversion|forced to convert]] to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Religious practices of contemporary Vodou are descended from, and closely related to, [[West African Vodun]] as practiced by the [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]]. Vodou also incorporates elements and symbolism from other African peoples including the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Kongo people|Kongo]]; as well as [[Taíno people|Taíno]] religious beliefs, [[Roman Catholicism]], and European spirituality including [[mysticism]] and other influences.{{sfn|Cosentino|1995b|p=25-55}}

In Haiti, some Roman Catholics combine their faith with aspects of Vodou. This practice is denounced as diabolical by virtually all [[Protestantism in Haiti|Haitian Protestants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=40SIdXeUEhUC|title = Crossing the Water and Keeping the Faith: Haitian Religion in Miami|last = Rey|first = Terry|last2 = Stepick|first2 = Alex|date = 2013-08-19|publisher = NYU Press|isbn = 9781479820771|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names and etymology==
''Vodou'' is a [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]] word that formerly referred to only a small subset of Haitian rituals.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} The word derives from an [[Ayizo language|Ayizo]] word referring to mysterious forces or powers that govern the world and the lives of those who reside within it, but also a range of artistic forms that function in conjunction with these ''vodun'' energies.{{sfn|Blier|1995|p=61}} Two of the major speaking populations of Ayizo are the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] and the [[Fon people|Fon]]—European slavers called both the Arada. These two peoples composed a sizable number of the early enslaved population in [[St. Dominique]]. In Haiti, practitioners occasionally use "Vodou" to refer to Haitian religion generically, but it is more common for practitioners to refer to themselves as those who "serve the spirits" (''sèvitè'') by participating in ritual ceremonies, usually called a "service to the loa" (''sèvis lwa'') or an "African service" (''sèvis gine'').{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} These terms also refer to the religion as a whole.

Outside of Haiti, the term ''Vodou'' refers to the entirety of traditional Haitian religious practice.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} 
Originally written as ''vodun'', it is first recorded in ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', a 1658 document written by the King of [[Allada]]'s ambassador to the court of [[Philip IV of Spain]].{{sfn|Blier|1995|p=61}} In the following centuries, ''Vodou'' was eventually taken up by non-Haitians as a generic descriptive term for traditional Haitian religion.{{sfn|Brown|1995|p=205}} There are many used orthographies for this word. Today, the spelling ''Vodou'' is the most commonly accepted orthography in English.{{sfn|Cosentino|1995a|p=xiv}} Other potential spellings include ''Vodoun'', ''vaudou'', and ''voodoo'', with ''vau-'' or ''vou-'' prefix variants reflecting French orthography, and a final ''-n'' reflecting the nasal vowel in West African or older, non-urbanized, Haitian Creole pronunciations.

The spelling ''voodoo'', once very common, is now generally avoided by Haitian practitioners and scholars when referring to the Haitian religion.{{sfn|Courlander|1988|p=88}}{{sfn|Lane|1949|p=1162}}{{sfn|Thompson|1983|p=163}}{{sfn|Cosentino|1988|p=77}} This is both to avoid confusion with [[Louisiana Voodoo]],{{sfn|Fandrich|2007|p=780}} a related but distinct set of religious practices, as well as to separate Haitian Vodou from the negative connotations and misconceptions the term "voodoo" has acquired in popular culture.{{sfn|Fandrich|2007|p=775}}{{sfn|Hurbon|1995|p=181-197}} Over the years, practitioners and their supporters have called on various institutions including the [[Associated Press]] to redress this misrepresentation by adopting "Vodou" in reference to the Haitian religion. In October 2012, the [[Library of Congress]] decided to change their [[subject heading]] from "Voodooism" to Vodou in response to a petition by a group of scholars and practitioners in collaboration with [[KOSANBA]], the scholarly association for the study of Haitian Vodou based at University of California Santa Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;For a fuller description of transitions in spelling, see: [http://www.bulldozia.com/projects/index.php?id=583 From Voodoo to Vodou]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:PortAuPrinceMarche.jpg|right|thumb|Vodou paraphernalia, [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti.]]
Vodou is popularly described as not simply a religion, but rather an experience that ties body and soul together. The concept of tying that exists in Haitian religious culture is derived from the Congolese tradition of ''kanga'', the practice of tying one's soul to something tangible. This "tying of soul" is evident in many Haitian Vodou practices that are still exercised today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rey|first=Terry|author2=Karen Richman|title=The Somatics of Syncretism: Tying Body and Soul in Haitian Religion|journal=Studies in Religion-Sciences Religieuses|year=2010|volume=3|pages=279–403|doi=10.1177/0008429810373321|url=http://sir.sagepub.com/content/41/2/231.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirits===
Vodouisants believe in a Supreme God called Bondye, from the [[French language|French]] ''.&lt;ref&gt;Haitian Vodouisants believe in Damballah. In her book "Tell My Horse", [[Zora Neale Hurston]] writes that "Damballah is the highest and most powerful of all the gods, but never is he referred to as the father of the gods as was Jupiter, Odin, and great Zeus...whenever any of the gods meet him they bow themselves and sing, "Ohe', Ohe'! Ce Papa nous qui pe' passe'!" (It is our papa who passes.)" (Hurston, pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt; When it came in contact with Roman Catholicism, the Supreme Creator was associated with the [[Christianity|Christian]] God, and the ''loa'' associated with the [[saints]].

====Lwa====
[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|right|thumbnail|A large sequined Vodou "drapo" or flag by the artist George Valris, depicting the [[veve]], or symbol, of the lwa [[Loko Atison]].]]
Since Bondye (God) is considered unreachable, Vodouisants aim their prayers to lesser entities, the spirits known as [[loa]], or ''mistè''. The most notable lwa include [[Papa Legba]] (guardian of the crossroads), [[Erzulie#Maîtresse Mambo Erzulie Fréda Dahomey|Erzulie Freda]] (the spirit of love), [[Simbi]] (the spirit of rain and magicians), [[Azaka Medeh|Kouzin Zaka]] (the spirit of agriculture), and [[Marassa Jumeaux|The Marasa]], divine twins considered to be the first children of Bondye.{{sfn|Gordon|2000|p=54}}

These lwa can be divided into 21 nations, which include the Petro, Rada, Congo, and Nago.{{sfn|Alvarado|2011}}

Each of the lwa is associated with a particular Roman Catholic saint. For example, Legba is associated with [[Anthony the Hermit|St. Anthony the Hermit]], and [[Damballa]] is associated with [[Saint Patrick|St. Patrick]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George (1978). Black Religions in the New World. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lwa also fall into family groups who share a surname, such as [[Ogou]], [[Erzulie|Ezili]], [[Azaka (disambiguation)|Azaka]]&lt;!-- NOTE: This DAB link is intentional, as the page just disambiguates two loa with the same surname: Azaka Medeh (loa of harvest) and Azaka-Tonnerre (loa of thunder). --&gt; 
or [[Ghede]]. For instance, "Ezili" is a family, [[Erzulie#Erzulie Dantor|Ezili Danto]] and [[Erzulie#Maîtresse Mambo Erzulie Fréda Dahomey|Ezili Freda]] are two individual spirits in that family. Each family is associated with a specific aspect, for instance the Ogou family are soldiers, the Ezili govern the feminine spheres of life, the Azaka govern agriculture, the Ghede govern the sphere of death and fertility.

===Morality===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}
{{See also|Haitian Vodou and sexual orientation}}
Vodou's moral code focuses on the vices of dishonor and greed. There is also a notion of relative propriety—and what is appropriate to someone with [[Damballah|Dambala Wedo]]  as their head may be different from someone with [[Ogoun|Ogou Feray]] as their head. For example, one spirit is very cool and the other is very hot. Coolness overall is valued, and so is the ability and inclination to protect oneself and one's own if necessary. Love and support within the family of the Vodou society seem to be the most important considerations. Generosity in giving to the community and to the poor is also an important value. One's blessings come through the community, and one should be willing to give back. There are no "solitaries" in Vodou—only people separated geographically from their elders and house. A person without a relationship of some kind with elders does not practice Vodou as it is understood in Haiti and among Haitians; additionally, Haitian Vodou emphasizes the 'wholeness of being' not just with elders and the material world, but also unity with the interconnected forces of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michel|first1=Claudine|title=Women's Moral and Spiritual Leadership in Haitian Vodou: The Voice of Mama Lola and Karen McCarthy Brown|journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|date=September 1, 2001|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a diversity of practice in Vodou across the country of Haiti and the Haitian diaspora. For instance, in the north of Haiti, the ''lave tèt'' ("head washing")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daniels|first1=Kyrah Malika|title=The Coolness of Cleansing: Sacred Waters, Medicinal Plants and Ritual Baths of Haiti and Peru|journal=Revista: Harvard Review of Latin America|date=Fall 2016|volume=16|issue=1|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''kanzwe'' may be the only initiation, as it is in the Dominican Republic and Cuba, whereas in Port-au-Prince and the south they practice the ''kanzo'' rites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richman|first1=Karen E.|title=Peasants, Migrants and the Discovery of African Traditions: Ritual and Social Change in Lowland Haiti|journal=Journal of Religion in Africa|date=August 1, 2007|volume=37|issue=3|pages=383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three grades of initiation{{spaced ndash}}kanzo senp, si pwen, and asogwe{{spaced ndash}}and the latter is the most familiar mode of practice outside Haiti. Some lineages combine both, as [[Mambo (Vodou)|Mambo]] [[Katherine Dunham]] reports from her personal experience in her book ''Island Possessed''.

While the overall tendency in Vodou is conservative in accord with its African roots, there is no singular, definitive form, only what is right in a particular house or lineage. Small details of service and the spirits served vary from house to house, and information in books or on the internet therefore may seem contradictory. There is no central authority or  "[[pope]]" in Haitian Vodou, since "every mambo and houngan is the head of their own house", as a popular Haitian saying goes. Another consideration in terms of Haitian diversity are the many sects besides the Sèvi Gine in Haiti such as the Makaya, Rara, and other secret societies, each of which has its own distinct pantheon of spirits.

===Soul===
According to Vodou, the soul consists of two aspects, in a type of [[soul dualism]]: the ''gros bon ange'' (big good angel) and the ''ti bon ange'' (little good angel). The ''gros bon ange'' is the part of the soul that is essentially responsible for the basic biological functions, such as the flow of blood through the body and breathing. On the other hand, the ''ti bon ange'' is the source of personality, character and willpower. "As the ''gros bon ange'' provides each person with the power to act, it is the ''ti bon ange'' that molds the individual sentiment within each act".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Kette. "Haitian Zombie, Myth, and Modern Identity." CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture 12.2 (2010): n. pag. Web. 29 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While the latter is an essential element for the survival of one's individual identity, it is not necessary to keep the body functioning properly in biological terms, and therefore a person can continue to exist without it.

==Practices==

===Liturgy and practice===
[[File:JacmelVodou.jpg|right|thumb|Vodou ceremony, [[Jacmel]], [[Haiti]].]]
A Haitian Vodou temple is called a [[Peristil]].{{sfn|Kilson|Rotberg|1976|p=345}} After a day or two of preparation setting up altars at an Hounfour, ritually preparing and cooking fowl and other foods, etc., a Haitian Vodou service begins with a series of prayers and songs in French, then a litany in [[Haitian Creole]] and [[Haitian Vodoun Culture Language|Langaj]] that goes through all the European and African saints and loa honored by the house, and then a series of verses for all the main spirits of the house. This is called the "Priyè Gine" or the African Prayer. After more introductory songs, beginning with saluting Hounto, the spirit of the drums, the songs for all the individual spirits are sung, starting with the [[Legba]] family through all the Rada spirits, then there is a break and the Petro part of the service begins, which ends with the songs for the [[Guédé|Gede]] family.

As the songs are sung, participants believe that spirits come to visit the ceremony, by taking [[Spirit possession#In Haitian Vodou and African traditions|possession]] of individuals and speaking and acting through them. When a ceremony is made, only the family of those possessed is benefited.  At this time it is believed that devious mambo or houngan can take away the luck of the worshippers through particular actions. For instance, if a priest asks for a drink of champagne, a wise participant refuses. Sometimes these ceremonies may include dispute among the singers as to how a hymn is to be sung. In Haiti, these Vodou ceremonies, depending on the Priest or Priestess, may be more organized.  But in the United States, many vodouists and clergy take it as a sort of non-serious party or "folly". In a serious rite, each spirit is saluted and greeted by the initiates present and gives readings, advice, and cures to those who ask for help. Many hours later, as morning dawns, the last song is sung, the guests leave, and the exhausted hounsis, houngans, and mambos can go to sleep.[[File:VOODOO PERISTILE Croix des Mission, Haiti 1980.jpg|thumb|VOODOO PERISTILE Croix des Mission, Haiti 1980]]

Vodou practitioners believe that if one follows all taboos imposed by their particular loa and is punctilious about all offerings and ceremonies, the loa will aid them. Vodou practitioners also believe that if someone ignores their loa it can result in sickness, the failure of crops, the death of relatives, and other misfortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George (1978). ''Black Religions in the New World''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
Animals are sometimes sacrificed in Haitian Vodou. A variety of animals are sacrificed, such as pigs, goats, chickens, and bulls.
"The intent and emphasis of sacrifice is not upon the death of the animal, it is upon the transfusion of its life to the loa; for the understanding is that flesh and blood are of the essence of life and vigor, and these will restore the divine energy of the god."&lt;ref&gt;[[Deren, Maya]] (1953). ''[[Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti]]''. New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the individual's household level, a Vodouisant or "sèvitè"/"serviteur" may have one or more tables set out for their ancestors and the spirit or spirits that they serve with pictures or statues of the spirits, perfumes, foods, and other things favored by their spirits. The most basic set up is just a white candle and a clear glass of water and perhaps flowers. On a particular spirit's day, one lights a candle and says an [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] and [[Hail Mary]], salutes Papa Legba and asks him to open the gate, and then one salutes and speaks to the particular spirit as an elder family member. Ancestors are approached directly, without the mediating of Papa Legba, since they are said to be "in the blood".

In a Vodou home, often, the only recognizable religious items are images of saints and candles with a rosary. In other homes, where people may more openly show their devotion to the spirits, noticeable items may include an altar with Catholic saints and iconographies, rosaries, bottles, jars, rattles, perfumes, oils, and dolls. Some Vodou devotees have less paraphernalia in their homes because until recently Vodou practitioners had no option but to hide their beliefs. Haiti is a rural society and the cult of ancestors guard the traditional values of the peasant class.  The ancestors are linked to family life and the land. Haitian peasants serve the spirits daily and sometime gather with their extended family on special occasions for ceremonies, which may celebrate the birthday of a spirit or a particular event. In very remote areas, people may walk for days to partake in ceremonies that take place as often as several times a month. Vodou is closely tied to the division and administration of land as well as to the residential economy. The cemeteries and many crossroads are meaningful places for worship: the cemetery acts as a repository of spirits and the crossroads acts as points of access to the world of the invisible.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Claudine (Aug 1996). "Of Worlds Seen and Unseen: The Educational Character of Haitian Vodou". Comparative Education Review (The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Comparative and International Education) 40. Retrieved Dec 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priests===
[[File:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou Voudun rites.jpg|thumb|Ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou rites, [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]], Germany.]]
[[Houngan]]s (Male Vodou Priest) or [[Mambo (Vodou)|Mambos]] (Female Vodou Priest) are usually people who were chosen by the dead ancestors and received the divination from the deities while he or she was possessed. His or her tendency is to do good by helping and protecting others from spells, however they sometimes use their supernatural power to hurt or kill people. They also conduct ceremonies that usually take place "Amba Peristil" (under a Vodou Temple). However, non-Houngan or non-Mambo as Vodouisants are not [[Initiation|initiated]], and are referred to as being "bossale"; it is not a requirement to be an initiate to serve one's spirits. There are clergy in Haitian Vodou whose responsibility it is to preserve the rituals and songs and maintain the relationship between the spirits and the community as a whole (though some of this is the responsibility of the whole community as well). They are entrusted with leading the service of all of the spirits of their lineage. Sometimes they are "called" to serve in a process called ''being reclaimed'', which they may resist at first.{{sfn|McAlister|1993|pp=10–27}} Below the houngans and mambos are the hounsis, who are initiates who act as assistants during ceremonies and who are dedicated to their own personal mysteries.

The ''asson'' (calabash rattle) is the symbol for one who has acquired the status of houngan or mambo (priest or priestess) in Haitian Vodou. The calabash is taken from the calabasse courante or calabasse ordinaire tree, which is associated with Danbhalah-Wédo. A houngan or mambo traditionally holds the asson in their hand, along with a clochette (bell). The asson contains stones and snake vertebrae that give it its sound. The asson is covered with a web of porcelain beads.&lt;ref&gt;Rigaud, Milo (2001). Secrets of Voodoo. New York: City Lights Publishers. pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''bokor'' is a sorcerer or magician who casts spells on request. They are not necessarily priests, and may be practitioners of "darker" things, and are often not accepted by the mambo or the houngan. 
''Bokor'' can also be a Haitian term for a Vodou priest or other practitioner who works with both the light and dark arts of magic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bokor]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} The bokor, in that sense, deals in ''baka' (malevolent spirits contained in the form of various animals).&lt;ref&gt;Deren, Maya (1953). Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti. New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and the afterlife===
Practitioners of Vodou revere death, and believe it is a great transition from one life to another, or to the afterlife. Some Vodou families believe that a person’s spirit leaves the body, but is trapped in water, over mountains, in grottoes—or anywhere else a voice may call out and echo—for one year and one day. After then, a ceremonial celebration commemorates the deceased for being released into the world to live again. In the words of Edwidge Danticat, author of "A Year and a Day"—an article about death in Haitian society published in the New Yorker—and a Vodou practitioner, "The year-and-a-day commemoration is seen, in families that believe in it and practice it, as a tremendous obligation, an honorable duty, in part because it assures a transcendental continuity of the kind that has kept us Haitians, no matter where we live, linked to our ancestors for generations." After the soul of the deceased leaves its resting place, it can occupy trees, and even become a hushed voice on the wind. Though other Haitian and West African families believe there is an afterlife in paradise in the realm of God. &lt;ref&gt;Danticat, Edwidge. "A Year And A Day." The New Yorker 17 Jan. 2011: 19.

==History==

===Before 1685: From Africa to the Caribbean===
[[File:Gbe languages.png|thumb|Area of [[West African Vodun]] practice, the religion with the greatest influence on Haitian Vodou.]]

The cultural area of the [[Fon people|Fon]], [[Ewe people|Ewe]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] peoples share a common [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] conception of a dual [[Cosmology|cosmological]] divine principle consisting of [[Nana Buluku]], the [[God]]-Creator, and the voduns(s) or God-Actor(s), daughters and sons of the Creator's twin children [[Mawu]] (goddess of the moon) and [[Lisa (mythology)|Lisa]] (god of the sun). The God-Creator is the [[cosmogonical]] principle and does not trifle with the mundane; the voduns(s) are the God-Actor(s) who actually govern earthly issues. The [[Dahomey mythology|pantheon of vodoun]] is quite large and complex.

West African Vodun has its primary emphasis on ancestors, with each family of spirits having its own specialized priest and priestess, which are often hereditary. In many African clans, deities might include [[Mami Wata]], who are gods and goddesses of the waters; [[Legba]], who in some clans is virile and young in contrast to the old man form he takes in Haiti and in many parts of Togo; [[Ogoun|Gu]] (or Ogoun), ruling iron and smithcraft; [[Sakpata]], who rules diseases; and many other spirits distinct in their own way to West Africa.

A significant portion of Haitian Vodou often overlooked by scholars until recently is the input from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]]. The entire northern area of Haiti is heavily influenced by [[Kongo people|Kongo practices]]. In northern Haiti, it is often called the [[Kongo Rite]] or Lemba, from the Lemba rituals of the [[Kingdom of Loango|Loango]] area and [[Mayombe]]. In the south, Kongo influence is called [[Petwo]] (Petro). Many loa (a Kikongo term) are of Kongo origin such as Basimba belonging to the [[Basimba people]] and the Lemba.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= The Book of Life, Knowledge and Confidence| publisher= Pacific Press|year=2012| url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1471734633|pp=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Vodun religion (distinct from Haitian Vodou) already existed in the United States previously to Haitian immigration, having been brought by enslaved West Africans, specifically from the Ewe, Fon, Mina, Kabaye, and Nago groups. Some of the more enduring forms survive in the [[Gullah|Gullah Islands]].

European [[colonialism]], followed by totalitarian regimes in West Africa, suppressed Vodun as well as other forms of the religion. However, because the Vodun deities are born to each African clan-group, and its clergy is central to maintaining the moral, social, and political order and ancestral foundation of its villagers, it proved to be impossible to eradicate the religion.

===1685-1791: Vodou in colonial Saint-Domingue===
The majority of the Africans who were brought as slaves to Haiti were from Western and Central Africa. The survival of the belief systems in the [[New World]] is remarkable, although the traditions have changed with time and have even taken on some Catholic forms of worship.{{sfn|Stevens-Arroyo|2002|}} Two important factors, however, characterize the uniqueness of Haitian Vodou as compared to African Vodun; the transplanted Africans of Haiti, similar to those of [[Cuba]] and Brazil, were obliged to disguise their loa or spirits as [[Roman Catholic]] [[saint]]s, an element of a process called [[syncretism]].

Two keys provisions of the [[Code Noir]] by King [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1685 severely limited the ability of enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue to practice African religions. First, the Code Noir explicitly forbade the open practice of all African religions.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Second, it forced all slaveholders to convert their slaves to Catholicism within eight days of their arrival in Saint-Domingue.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} Despite French efforts, enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue were able to cultivate their own religious practices.  Enslaved Africans spent their Sunday and holiday nights expressing themselves. While bodily autonomy was strictly controlled during the day at night, the enslaved Africans wielded a degree of agency. They began to continue their religious practices but also used the time to cultivate community and reconnect the fragmented pieces of their various heritages. These late night reprieves were a form of resistance against white domination and also created community cohesion between people from vastly different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Slavery and Slave Society," in the Making of Haiti|last=Fick|first=Carolyn|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Catholicism was used as a tool for suppression, enslaved Haitians, partly out of necessity, would go on to incorporate aspects of Christianity into their Vodou.{{sfn|Desmangles|1990|p=475}} [[Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry]], a French observer writing in 1797, noted this religious [[syncretism]], commenting that the Catholic-style altars and votive candles used by Africans in Haiti were meant to conceal the Africanness of the religion{{sfn|Moreau de Saint-Méry|1797}}but the connection goes much further than that. Vodounists superimposed Catholic saints and figures onto the Iwa/Ioa, major spirits that work as agents of the Grand Met.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caribbean Religious History: An Introduction|last=Edmonds|first=Ennis Barrington|publisher=New York Univ. Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of major Catholic idols re-imagined as Iwa are the Virgin Mary being seen as Ezili. Saint Jacques as Ogou, and Saint Patrick as Dambala.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Vodou ceremonies and rituals also incorporated some Catholic elements such as the adoption of the Catholic calendar, the use of holy water in purification rituals, singing hymns, and the introduction of Latin loanwords into Vodou lexicon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===1791–1804: The Haitian Revolution===
The most historically iconic Vodou ceremony in Haitian history was the [[Bois Caïman]] ceremony of August 1791  that took place on the eve of a slave rebellion that predated the Haitian Revolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Haitian Revolutionary Studies|last=Geggus|first=David|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ceremony the spirit [[Ezili Dantor]] possessed a priestess and received a [[Creole Pig|black pig]] as an offering, and all those present pledged themselves to the fight for freedom.{{sfn|Markel|2009|}} While there is debate on whether or not Bois Caiman was truly a Vodou ritual, the ceremony also served as a covert meeting to iron out details regarding the revolt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vodou ceremonies often held a political secondary function that strengthened bonds between enslaved people while providing space for organizing within the community. Political leaders such as [[Boukman Dutty]], a slave who helped plan the 1791 revolt, also served as religious leader, connecting Vodou spirituality with political action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|last=Dubois|first=Laurent|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bois Caiman has often been cited as the start of the [[Haitian Revolution]] but the slave uprising had already been planned weeks in advance,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; proving that the thirst for freedom had always been present. The revolution would free the Haitian people from French [[French colonial empires|colonial]] rule in 1804 and establish the first black people's [[republic]] in the history of the world and the second independent nation in the Americas. Haitian nationalists have frequently drawn inspiration by imagining their ancestors' gathering of unity and courage. Since the 1990s, some neo-evangelicals have interpreted the politico-religious ceremony at Bois Caïman to have been a pact with demons. This extremist view is not considered credible by mainstream Protestants, however conservatives such as Pat Robertson repeat the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAlister|first=Elizabeth|title=From Slave Revolt to a Blood Pact with Satan: The Evangelical Rewriting of Haitian History|journal=Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses|date=June 2012|volume=41|issue=2|pages=187–215|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=elizabeth_mcalister|doi=10.1177/0008429812441310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vodou in 19th-century Haiti===

====1804: Liberty, Isolation, Boycott====
On 1 January 1804 the former slave Jean-Jaqcues Dessalines (as [[Jacques I]]) declared the independence of St. Domingue as the First Black Empire; two years later, after his assassination, it became the Republic of Haiti. This was the second nation to gain independence from European rule (after the United States), and the only state to have arisen from the liberation of slaves. No nation recognized the new state, which was instead met with isolation and boycotts. This exclusion from the global market led to major economic difficulties for the new state.

Many of the leaders of the revolt disassociated themselves from Vodou. They strived to be accepted as Frenchmen and good Catholics rather than as free Haitians. Yet most practitioners of Vodou saw, and still see, no contradiction between Vodou and Catholicism, and also take part in Catholic masses.

====1835: Vodou made punishable, secret societies====
The new Haitian state did not recognize Vodou as an official religion. In 1835, the government made practising Vodou punishable. Secret Voodoo societies therefore continued to be important. These societies also provided the poor with protection and solidarity against the exercising of power by the elite. They had their own symbols and codes.

===20th century to the present===
Today, Vodou is practiced not only by Haitians but by Americans and people of many other nations who have been exposed to Haitian culture. [[Haiti]]an [[Creole peoples|creole]] forms of Vodou exist in Haiti, the [[Dominican Republic]], Cuba,{{sfn|Stevens-Arroyo|2002|pp=37–58}} some of the outer islands of the [[Bahamas]], the United States, and other places to which Haitians have immigrated. There has been a re-emergence of the Vodun traditions in the United States, maintaining the same ritual and cosmological elements as in West Africa. These and other African-diasporic religions, such as Lukumi or Regla de Ocha (also known as [[Santería]]) in Cuba, and [[Candomblé]] and [[Umbanda]] in Brazil, have evolved among descendants of transplanted Africans in the Americas.

Former president of Haiti [[François Duvalier]] (also known as Papa Doc) played a role in elevating the status of Vodou into a national doctrine. Duvalier was involved in the noirisme movement and hoped to re-value cultural practices that had their origins in Africa. Duvalier manipulated Vodou to suit his purposes throughout his Reign of Terror. He organized the Vodou priests in the countryside and had them advance his agenda, instilling fear through promoting the belief that he had supernatural powers playing into the religion's mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine (Jan 17, 2011). "The Death and Legacy of Papa Doc Duvalier" Retrieved May 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apter, Andrew (May 2002). "On African Origins: Creolization and Connaissance in Haitian Vodou". American Ethnologist (Wiley on behalf of the American Anthropological Association) 29. Retrieved Dec 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Haitians involved in the practice of Vodou have been initiated as Houngans or Mambos. In January 2010, after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]] traditional ceremonies were organized to appease the spirits and seek the blessing of ancestors for the Haitians. Also a ''"purification ceremony"'' was planned for Haiti.

=== Controversy after the 2010 earthquake ===
Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], there were verbal and physical attacks against vodou practitioners in Haiti perpetrated by those who felt that vodouists were partially responsible for the natural disaster. Furthermore, during a [[Cholera|Cholera outbreak in 2010]] several Vodou priests were lynched by mobs who believed them to be spreading the disease.{{sfn|Valme|2010|}}

==Demographics and geographic distribution==
Because of the religious syncretism between Catholicism and Vodou, it is difficult to estimate the number of Vodouists in Haiti. The CIA currently estimates that approximately 50% of Haiti's population practices Vodou, with nearly all Vodouists participating in one of Haiti's Christian denominations.{{sfn|CIA World Factbook}}

==Myths and misconceptions==
[[File:Affaire de Bizoton 1864.png|thumb|The ''Affaire de Bizoton'' of 1864. The murder and alleged canibalization of a woman's body by eight voodoo devotees caused a scandal worldwide and was taken as proof of the evil nature of voodoo.]]

Vodou has often been associated in popular culture with [[Satanism]], [[witchcraft]], [[zombie]]s and "voodoo dolls". Zombie creation has been referenced within rural Haitian culture,{{sfn|Davis|1988|}} but is not a part of Vodou. Such manifestations fall under the auspices of the ''[[bokor]]'' or sorcerer, rather than the priest of the loa. The practice of sticking pins in voodoo dolls has history in folk magic. "Voodoo dolls" are often associated with [[Louisiana Voodoo|New Orleans Voodoo]] and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] as well the magical devices of the [[poppet]] and the ''[[nkisi]]'' or ''bocio'' of West and Central Africa.

The general fear of Vodou in the US can be traced back to the end of the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791-1804). There is a legend that Haitians were able to beat the French during the Haitian Revolution because their Vodou deities made them invincible. The US, seeing the tremendous potential Vodou had for rallying its followers and inciting them to action, feared the events at [[Bois Caïman]] could spill over onto American soil. After the Haitian Revolution many Haitians fled as refugees to New Orleans. Free and enslaved Haitians who moved to New Orleans brought their religious beliefs with them and reinvigorated the Voodoo practices that were already present in the city. Eventually, Voodoo in New Orleans became hidden and the magical components were left present in the public sphere. This created what is called hoodoo in the southern part of the United States. Because hoodoo is folk magic, Voodoo and Afro-diasporic religions in the U.S. became synonymous with fraud. This is one origin of the stereotype that Haitian Vodou, New Orleans Voodoo, and hoodoo are all tricks used to make money off of the gullible.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Carolyn Morrow (Oct 2002). "Perceptions of New Orleans Voodoo: Sin, Fraud, Entertainment and Religion". Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions (University of California Pres) 6. Retrieved Dec 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elites preferred to view it as folklore in an attempt to render it relatively harmless as a curiosity that might continue to inspire music and dance.&lt;ref&gt;Bellegarde-Smith, P. (2006). ''Haitian Vodou: Spirit, Myth and Reality''. (p. 25).  Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing an uprising in opposition to the [[US occupation of Haiti]] (1915-1934), political and religious elites, along with Hollywood and the film industry, sought to trivialize the practice of Vodou. Hollywood often depicts Vodou as evil and having ties to Satanic practices in movies such as ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'', ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'', ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', and in children’s movies like ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', though this last example countered this trope with a kindly voodoo priestess who helps the main characters.

In 2010, a [[2010 Haiti earthquake|7.0 earthquake]] that devastated Haiti brought negative attention to Vodou. [[Televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]] stated that the country had cursed itself after the events at Bois Caïman, because he claimed they had engaged in Satanic practices in the ceremony preceding the Haitian Revolution. "They were under the heel of the French, you know, Napoleon the third and whatever. And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the prince.' True story. And so the devil said, 'Ok it's a deal.' And they kicked the French out. The Haitians revolted and got something themselves free. But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-12017-504083.html|title=Pat Robertson: Haiti "Cursed" After "Pact to the Devil" - Crimesider - CBS News|date=6 November 2012|website=Web.archive.org=|accessdate=2 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106024225/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-12017-504083.html|archivedate=6 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also (or, instead) this [[CBS News]] ("© 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.") web page: {{cite web

==KOSANBA==
Scholarly research on Vodou and other African spiritual retentions in Haiti started in the early 20th century with chronicles such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]]'s "Tell My Horse", amongst others. Other notable early scholars of Haitian Vodou one could cite are Milo Rigaud Alfred Metraux and Maya Deren, for example. In April 1997, thirteen scholars gathered at the University of California Santa Barbara for a colloquium on Haitian Vodou.  From that meeting the ''Congress of Santa Barbara'' was created, also known as [[KOSANBA]].{{sfn|KOSANBA|}}  These scholars felt there was a need for access to scholarly resources and course offerings studying Haitian Vodou, and pledged, "...to create a space where scholarship on Vodou can be augmented."&lt;ref name="ucsb.edu"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100613040659/http://research.ucsb.edu/cbs/projects/haiti/kosanba/declaration.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As further described in the Congress’ declaration:

"The presence, role, and importance of Vodou in Haitian history, society, and culture are unarguable, and recognizably a part of the national ethos. The impact of the religion qua spiritual and intellectual disciplines on popular national institutions, human and gender relations, the family, that plastic arts, philosophy and ethics, oral and written literature, language, popular and sacred music, science and technology and the healing arts, is indisputable. It is the belief of the Congress that Vodou plays, and shall continue to play, a major role in the grand scheme of Haitian development and in the socio-economic, political, and cultural arenas.  Development, when real and successful, always comes from the modernization of ancestral traditions, anchored in the rich cultural expressions of a people."&lt;ref name="ucsb.edu"/&gt;

In the fall of 2012, KOSANBA successfully petitioned the Library of Congress to change the terms "voodoo" and "voodooism" to the correct spelling "Vodou".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100611173100/http://research.ucsb.edu/cbs/projects/haiti/kosanba/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
In the aftermath of the [[François Duvalier]] dictatorship, a number of individuals, including many houngan, sought to organize means of defense for Haitian Vodou from defamation by Christian missionaries and congregations. One of the first leading houngan to formally organize other houngan in solidarity was [[Wesner Morency]] (1959–2007), who established the Vodou Church of Haiti in 1998 (registered in 2001 by the Ministry of Justice) and the Commission Nationale pour la Structuration de Vodou (CONAVO). Another individual who has pursued the organization of houngan is [[Max Beauvoir]], who established and heads the [[National Confederation of Haitian Vodou]].

'''Healing the centurion's servant''' is one of the [[miracles of Jesus in the Gospels|miracles]] said to have been performed by [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as related in the [[Gospel]]s of Matthew&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%208:5-13;&amp;version=TNIV |title=Biblegateway Matthew 8:5–13 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Luke. The story is not recounted by either John or Mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%207:1-10;&amp;version=TNIV |title=Biblegateway Luke 7:1–10 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these accounts, a Roman centurion asked Jesus for his help because his boy servant was ill. Jesus offered to go to the centurion's house to perform a healing, but the [[centurion]] demurred and suggested that Jesus' word of authority from where he was at that moment would be sufficient. Impressed, Jesus commented approvingly of the strong religious faith displayed by the soldier and granted the request, which resulted in the servant being healed the same day.

==Scriptures==
[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew 8:5–13]] (TNIV)
{{quote|When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. "Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly." Jesus said to him, "Shall I come and heal him?" The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour.}}

[[Gospel of Luke|Luke 7:1–10]] (TNIV)
{{quote|When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this, because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue." So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel." Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.}}

==Sources==
The story of the Centurion does not exist in the Gospel of Mark. The accepted theory is that material not in Mark but found in both Matthew and Luke came from a now lost source known as [[Q (source)|Q]]. This passage is an anomaly as Q is believed to have been a sayings gospel, a list of sermons and quotations from Jesus with no other material, but this story includes background details. It would also be the only miracle story that originated in Q. One possibility is that only the dialogue was in Q, and both Matthew and Luke added the background details from a shared oral history.&lt;ref name="Keener1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig S. Keener|title=A Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew|year=1999|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-3821-6|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gospel of John]] narrates a similar account of Jesus [[Healing the royal official's son|healing the son of a royal official]] at Capernaum at a distance in {{bibleref|John|4:46–54|NIV}}. Some, such as in [[Fred Craddock]] in his commentary on Luke,&lt;ref&gt;Fred Craddock: ''Luke'', 2009 {{ISBN|0-664-23435-6}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; treat them as the same miracle. However, in his analysis of Matthew, [[R. T. France]] presents linguistic arguments against the equivalence of ''pais'' and son and considers these two separate miracles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary'' by R. T. France 1987 {{ISBN|0-8028-0063-7}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merrill C.

Luke 7:2 and 7:10 refer to the person to be healed as ''doulos'', unambiguously meaning "servant" but has the centurion himself call him "pais" &lt;Stephens 1550&gt; - which has a number of more ambiguous meanings including "child" (e.g., {{bibleref2|Matt|2:16}}; {{bibleref2|Luke|2:43,8:51-54}} where it refers to a girl), "son" ({{bibleref2|John|4:51}}), "servant" ({{bibleref2|Luke|15:26}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|4:25}}), or be unclear whether son or servant is meant.&lt;ref name="marston"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marston |first=Paul |year=2003 |url=http://www.fmcuk.org.uk/social%20issues/homosexuality.htm |title=Christians, Gays and Gay Christians |publisher=Free Methodists |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427000331/http://www.fmcuk.org.uk/social%20issues/homosexuality.htm |archivedate=2006-04-27 &lt;!-- 000331 --&gt;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Center of Parapsychology and Scientific Research of the New Age''', generally known under the name of '''Horus''' (in reference to falcon-god [[Horus]] which was the emblem of the group), was a [[New Age]]-oriented [[new religious movement]] founded in France in 1989 by Marie-Thérèse Castano, and ended in April 1997. This group had about 300 members, including teachers, doctors and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jean Vernette, Claire Moncelon |title=Horus |url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sos.derivesectaire/FICHES/horus.htm |work=Dictionnaire des groupes religieux aujourd'hui (religions - églises - sectes - nouveaux mouvements religieux - mouvements spiritualistes) |publisher=SOS Dérives sectaires |language=French |date=1995 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community of the group was located in [[La Coucourde]], in the [[Drôme]] department. In the 1990s, the group was often the subject of strong criticisms in the media, as former members and a 1995 report established by the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]]&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes — ''Les sectes en France'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher=''Assemblée Nationale'' |language=French |date=1995 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented it as a [[cult]]. In 1997, the founder and several followers were sentenced to prison on grounds of [[duty to rescue]], complicity in forgery and unauthorized practice of medicine. However, the group considered to be a victim of [[defamation]] and expressed its complaints particularly through its lawyer.

==History and doctrines==
The movement was founded in 1989 by Marie-Thérèse Castano (born 1945), who was widely called Maïté. She is a former trader and real estate broker who achieved some notability in the 1980s hosting a radio program about [[esotericism]] and [[occultism]]. Later, she organized conferences in which she talked about pacifism, ecology, alternative medicine, [[personal development]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref name="LePoint"&gt;{{cite web |title=Le meilleur des mondes de Maïté |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/1996-01-13/le-meilleur-des-mondes-de-maite/920/0/101798 |work=Le Point |publisher= |language=French |date=13 January 1996 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With people who shared her opinions, she decided to found a community in La Coucourde, Drôme, which gathered approximately 100 people and some children. Created in 1992, this 40-hectare ecological farm lived in autarky. Members produced their own fruits, vegetables, cheeses, milk and raised livestock, then sold them on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Valérie Colin |title=Ces dames du bio géant |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9904.htm#23b |work=Le Vif-L'Express |publisher=Prevensectes |language=French |date=20 April 1999 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affirming to be in relation with higher entities, Castano said to be the reincarnation of [[Nefertiti]].&lt;ref name="Nefertiti"&gt;{{cite web |title=Néfertiti condamnée |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/region/laquo-chauffeurs-raquo-la-nuit-mm-tout-le-monde-le-jour_477464.html |work=L'Express |language=French |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine of the group, mainly related to ecology and New Age, focused on meditation, study of Egyptian civilization, cosmic energies, astrology and [[telepathy]]. The group claimed to be able to get giant fruits and vegetables without [[fertilizer]]s. Some members refused [[vaccination]]s for their children. The community's purpose was the scientific research in [[parapsychology]] and the knowledge of the laws of the nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gilbert Klein |title=Les sectes et l'ordre public |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6NsQSV0fEkC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=%22horus%22+secte#v=onepage&amp;q=%22horus%22%20secte&amp;f=false |language=French |page=66 |date=2005 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Castano publicly announced the break-up of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horus annonce sa dissolution |url=https://www.humanite.fr/1997-04-14_Articles_-Horus-annonce-sa-dissolution |work=L'Humanité |language=French |date=14 April 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313105339/http://www.humanite.fr/1997-04-14_Articles_-Horus-annonce-sa-dissolution |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The media criticized the group mainly on allegations of despoilment, [[paranoia]], loss of critical thought, family breakdown, abandonment of medical treatments, refusal of vaccinations and school attendance for children. The group was also criticized for its challenge of the basic concepts of scientific medicine and false certificates of vaccination.&lt;ref name="LePoint"/&gt; The doctrine was sometimes considered as a potential source of nervous breakdown and attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicolas Guillet |title=Les difficultés de la lutte contre les dérives sectaires |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DL1-ntI8FQC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22horus%22+secte#v=onepage&amp;q=%22horus%22%20secte&amp;f=false |language=French |page=36 |date=2007 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the group was eventually classified as a cult in the [[List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents|1995 parliamentary report]].&lt;ref name="Report"/&gt; In 1997, the Belgian parliamentary commission established a list of 189 movements containing the Horus community.

After the death of two women of 82 and 54 years old respectively in July 1994 and in January 1995,&lt;ref name="Nefertiti"/&gt; Castano was indicted and jailed on 20 June 1997 for duty to rescue and illegal practice of medicine (the two dead bodies were transported  to their villages where deaths were reported, then the bodies cremated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Émilie Rive |title=Louis Cornillon, Avocat de l'Association de défense des familles et des individus, partie civile dans le procès contre la secte Horus |url=https://www.humanite.fr/popup_imprimer.html?id_article=441787 |work=L'Humanité |language=French |date=20 January 1999 |accessdate=1 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a couple was indicted after refusing medical care for their young child, and a doctor was expelled from the [[General Medical Council]] for having issued a false certificate of vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Un médecin radié de l'ordre pour un faux certificat de vaccination |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9706.htm#1 |work=Libération |publisher=Prevensectes |language=French |date=14 June 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 1999, the Tribunal correctionnel de Valence, as well as on 7 July 1999, the Court d'Appel de Grenoble, sentenced Castano and several followers to fines and prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Prison ferme requise contre les adeptes d'Horus |url=https://www.humanite.fr/popup_imprimer.html?id_article=441798 |work=L'Humanité |language=French |date=20 January 1999 |accessdate=1 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Serge Thomas |title=La gourelle d'Horus ira en prison |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9907.htm#8a |work=France-Soir |publisher=Prevensectes |language=French |date=8 July 1999 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Un an de prison pour le gourou d'Horus |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9907.htm#8 |work=Le Parisien |publisher=Prevensectes |language=French |date=8 July 1999 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to criticisms==
These accusations were rejected by the group. After a highly critical documentary broadcast on [[France 2]] on 4 January 1996 in ''[[Envoyé spécial]]'', members stated that the journalist had belonged to the community for two years, then accepted to produce a such documentary for 600,000 francs because of financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="Sectophobie"&gt;Joël Labruyère, ''La sectophobie'', 2001, Les 3 Monts editions, pp. 32-36 ({{ISBN|2-909735-46-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joël Labruyère, ''L'État inquisiteur — La spiritualité en danger!'', 2000, Les 3 Monts editions, pp. 219-21 ({{ISBN|2-909735-22-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; Members considered they were victims of conspiracy to disclose their discoveries in agriculture, which would justify their alleged persecution, including arsons and animals killed.&lt;ref&gt;Joël Labruyère, ''L'État inquisiteur — La spiritualité en danger!'', 2000, Les 3 Monts editions, pp. 69 ({{ISBN|2-909735-22-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1996, a teacher follower was revoked by the Ministère de l'Éducation Nationale for fear of [[proselytism]], but in 1998 the Tribunal Administratif de Grenoble nullified this decision. After complaints by the Éducation Nationale on the grounds of inadequate education, children were subject of a special watch by the judge of Valencia, which was perceived as offensive by community's members.&lt;ref name="Sectophobie"/&gt; For her part, Castano said she did not practice medicine and did not create a school within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Des malades sans soins, des tomates géantes sans engrais |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9901.htm#20 |work=Libération, Le Monde, Charlie Hebdo |publisher=Prevensectes |language=French |date=January 1999 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book entitled ''Les radis de la colère - Le complot démasqué, pourquoi la France a-t-elle peur d'Horus?'', Horus' lawyer Jean-Pierre Joseph, rejected these accusations. Although he was just the lawyer of several members of the group, Christian Paturel also denied these criticisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Maître Paturel |title=L'affaire Horus et les objecteurs de conscience |url=http://www.sectes-infos.net/Paturel_5.htm |work= |publisher=''Sectes-infos'' |language=French |accessdate=1 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127092200/http://www.sectes-infos.net/Paturel_5.htm |archivedate=27 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented the group as an "agrarian community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Christian Paturel |title=La pensée unique face aux spiritualités: Le choc des mondes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6B7eTAo9fKIC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22horus%22+secte#v=onepage&amp;q=%22horus%22%20secte&amp;f=false |language=French |pages=196, 197 |date=2007 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. IRAC aims to defend [[social equality|equality]], [[social justice]], and [[religious pluralism]] within Israel, through the Israeli legal system, lobbying and publications. Author [[Elana Maryles Sztokman]] calls IRAC "the preeminent civil and human rights organization in Israel," advocating for a broadly inclusive democracy and promoting social justice.&lt;ref&gt;Sztokman, Elana Maryles. The War on Women in Israel: A Story of Religious Radicalism and the Women Fighting for Freedom. Sourcebooks, 2014 p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Recent campaigns include an effort to ban gender segregation on Israeli public buses, a successful public campaign for the abolition of income guarantees to [[kollel]] students, and a lobbying campaign in defense of human rights organizations operating in Israel. [[Anat Hoffman]], currently the executive director of IRAC, is also the director and a founding member of '''Neshot HaKotel''', also known as "[[Women of the Wall]]" or WoW, an organization of women who pray at the [[Western Wall]] in an egalitarian manner. Rabbi Noa Sattath is director of IRAC. She has completed five years in that role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.643903 Meet the lesbian rabbi about to lead a crusade against racism in Israel, ''Haaretz'', 24 February 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of focus==
*Promote acceptance of religious pluralism in Israel, working to secure equal funding and status for Reform and Conservative movements.
*Promote freedom of marriage and equal rights in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irac.org/Mission.aspx|title=IRAC - Israel Religious Action Center - Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Oppose discrimination against women and gender segregation (see [[sex segregation]]).
*Oppose [[racism in Israel]], particularly when incited by religious or government representatives.
*Secure the rights of converts to Judaism.

==Developments==

* In 2006 IRAC filed a complaint about racist incitement by Jerusalem rabbis. As a result of the complaint, Shai Nitzan, head of the Special Tasks Division in the State Attorney's Office, ordered a police investigation into possible criminal activity by Rabbi David Batzri and his son, Rabbi Yitzhak Batzri, who in protesting the opening of a mixed Hebrew-Arab school announced that the school was inappropriate because Arabs are "impure" and "donkeys." Attorney Reut Michaeli said IRAC welcomed the investigation in hopes of ending "the improper use that rabbis and others make of the Jewish religion to advance unacceptable, discriminatory and racist views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisenberg|first= Dan |title=Police investigate Jerusalem rabbis for racist incitement|date=March 21, 2006|publisher= [[The Jerusalem Post]]|url= http://www.jpost.com/landedpages/printarticle.aspx?id=16736}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012 IRAC celebrated what Haaretz called "one of its most significant triumphs," when it prevailed in an eight year court battle to have the Israeli government pay the salaries of four non-Orthododox rabbis, "creating a hairline crack in the Orthodox monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.667105 |title=Is there a future for Reform Judaism in Israel?|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]|date= 21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014, IRAC won its first class-action suit. The Jerusalem District Court agreed that IRAC's client, [[Kolech]] could receive damages from [[Kol baRama]], an ultra-Orthodox radio station that prohibits women from participating in its broadcasts or working as employees. Kolech is an Orthodox women's organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org/blog/2014/09/10/victory-over-gender-exclusion-israel|title=A Victory Over Gender Exclusion in Israel|author=Anat Hoffman|work=Reform Judaism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4274885,00.html|title=NIS 104M class action suit against haredi radio|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2014 the Jerusalem District Court ruled that [[Chevra Kadisha]] burial society will no longer be allowed to place signs enforcing gender segregation of men and women at funerals, unless the family of the deceased requests it. The Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC) and the Human Rights Clinic at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Law filed a claim against Chevra Kadisha in Rehovot and Jerusalem, claiming it violated the Religious Services Ministry's prohibition on gender segregation in cemeteries. Attorney Erez-Lachovsky, head of IRAC's legal department, announced, "This is excellent news. The two Chevra Kadisha companies involved in this affair firmly refused to obey the [[Ministry of Religious Services]] director-general's memo which ordered them to remove the signs. This marks the end of discriminating segregation signs in cemeteries." Chevra Kadisha representatives said they were only acting in accordance with rabbinic orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nachshoni|first= Kobi |title=Court rules against gender segregation at funerals|date=December 9, 2014|website= [[YNET]]|url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4601450,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2014 ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' interviewed [[Anat Hoffman]] regarding arson at school that was apparently incited by [[Lehava]] and committed by members of the anti-assimilation group. Hoffman said IRAC had filed over 40 complaints "with the attorney general against Lehava and its leaders since 2010, and we only got one serious answer to any of them.” Because of lack of attention to the complaints, IRAC joined other organizations in October 2014 in petitioning the High Court of Justice against the attorney general. The petition asks the attorney general to investigate Lehava, and accuses the group of numerous examples of illegal activity such as promoting housing discrimination against non-Jews and harassing organizations that employ Arabs. The court has allowed the state an extension until January 2015 to file its response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=RENEE GHERT-ZAND |title=Will arrest of Lehava leader extinguish anti-assimilation activists’ fervor?

* In January 2014 the head of IRAC's legal team was quoted in [[Haaretz]] about the unsuccessful attempt by the city of [[Bnei Brak]] to take down campaign posters that included photos of female candidates. In the city's ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, women are usually absent from advertisements and billboards because pictures of women are viewed as "sexually provocative". The city's representatives claimed they had been ordered to remove signs picturing Likud contenders such as [[Miri Regev]] and [[Gila Gamliel]]. The police were summoned and initially supported the city, but then informed city officials the signs could not be removed.  City officials protested that they were only trying to protect the sensitivities of religious residents. But [[Orly Erez-Likhovski]], head of the legal department at the Israel Religious Action Center, said this was a victory for gender equality: "“I am very happy that the officials from the Likud didn’t give up, fought the municipality and the police who first arrived on the scene. It shows that the message is starting to penetrate on every level that exclusion of women is illegal and unacceptable. It doesn't always translate to the people on the ground but we see that great progress is being made - even in Bnei Brak, even in the ultra-Orthodox sector. This is an important message.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Allison Kaplan Sommer |title=An unlikely feminist victory in ultra-Orthodox Bnei Brak|date= 1 January 2015|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]'' |url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/routine-emergencies/1.634898}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Rights on Flights": IRAC is acting in response to complaints by airline passengers who have been subjected to Orthodox male passengers attempting to impose gender segregation on flights. IRAC will be drawing on its experience fighting for the rights of women to sit anywhere they choose on public buses as it collaborates with airlines to develop policies to protect the rights of female passengers in the skies. In January 2015, IRAC contacted almost twenty airlines with flights to and from Israel and asked them to meet with IRAC staff so solutions can be developed that protect the rights of female passengers and comply with legal prohibition of gender segregation and gender discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/50494/t/0/blastContent.jsp?email_blast_KEY=1306981 |title=IRAC Newsletter - Rights on Flights |date=5 January 2015|website=salsa3.salsalabs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times interviewed Anat Hoffman on the phenomenon on Orthodox males asking female passengers on airlines to move, noting that IRAC had started a campaign urging women not to give up their seats. “I have a hundred stories,” said Hoffman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/aboard-flights-conflicts-over-seat-assignments-and-religion.html |title=When a Plane Seat Next to a Woman Is Against Orthodox Faith|publisher=''The New York Times''|date= 9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, 81 year old Israeli-American attorney [[Renee Rabinowitz]] agreed to sue El Al as a plaintiff protesting gender discrimination in response to the airline pressuring her to move from her assigned seat to appease a religious male refusing to sit next to a woman. The Israel Religious Action Center was seeking $13,000 in compensation from the airline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/israeli-american-woman-sues-el-al-after-she-was-asked-to-change-seats/2016/02/29/8512e74e-defd-11e5-8c00-8aa03741dced_story.html Israeli-American woman sues El Al after she was asked to change seats] The Washington Post, February 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 2017,  Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court Judge Dana Cohen-Lekah awarded Rabinowitz 6500 shekels in compensation, and ruled that the airline must declare that it is forbidden for a crew member to ask a passenger to change seats at the request of another passenger based on gender.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/231430&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, IRAC believes that passengers may still be subject to such requests and planned an advertising program for airports, reminding women of their rights. Israeli authorities refused to let the ads be posted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/04/israeli-airport-blocks-ads-urging-women-to-refuse-to-give-up-seats] &lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2018 the Jerusalem District Court ruled that haredi radio station Kol Barama must pay 1 million NIS in damages, not including legal fees, as a result of a class action suit filed by IRAC and Asaf Pink for not allowing women's voices on the radio station. This is the first class action lawsuit on civil rights and gender segregation in Israel. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Haredi-radio-station-charged-with-1-million-NIS-for-gender-discrimination-567731] &lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish author and historian [[Cesar Vidal Manzanares]] wrote that "José de Segovia Barrón write theological opinions and culture reviews in the highest professional level, lighting the topics because of its own particular deep perception of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15764">[[File:Ättestupan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View over [[Gothenburg]] from the heights of [[Ramberget|Keillers Park]].]] 
The '''Keillers Park murder''' is a famous [[Sweden|Swedish]] criminal case. It started on 23 July 1997, when the body of an unknown man was discovered in a park in the city of [[Gothenburg]], in western Sweden. The man, who had been shot twice with a pistol, was identified two days later as Josef&lt;ref group=nt&gt;Josef is the Swedish spelling of the name Yusef.&lt;/ref&gt; ben Meddour (aged 36), a homosexual and [[Algeria]]n national, who had been living in Sweden for many years.

After many months of investigation, the police were able to apprehend the two murderers. They were named as [[Jon Nödtveidt]] (aged 22), the leader of [[black metal]] band [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], and his friend Vlad (aged 20), an [[Iran]]ian national settled in Sweden. The two men, who confessed to their crime, were eventually sentenced by a court of appeal to ten years of incarceration. 

Nödtveidt and Vlad, who were members of [[Temple of the Black Light]], had on several occasions discussed performing human sacrifices before they murdered Meddour. That the motive was occult-related could not however be clearly established, and the murder was described as a [[homophobia|homophobic]] hate crime by the Swedish police.

== Discovery of the body ==
On 23 July 1997, at around 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy discovered the body of a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in [[Ramberget|Keillers Park]], in downtown [[Gothenburg]]. Called on site, the police determined that the man had been shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 04:46 - 05:05 : ''Plötsligt ser han en man som ligger på mage...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

No identification was found on the corpse, but a female police officer recognized the man as someone who was often seen in the area of ''Svingeln square'' and who, with his curled hair and sunglasses, looked like Swedish singer [[Magnus Uggla]]. In the neighbourhood, a shop attendant told the police that the actual name of the victim was Josef and that he was often in the company of a [[Finland|Finnish]]-looking man.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 07:07 - 08:10 : ''De vet ännu ingenting om den mördade mannen...''&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to this testimony, the police were able to identify Josef ben Meddour, aged 36, an Algerian national.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Settled in Sweden for about ten years,&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 11:17 - 11:29 : ''Polisen har nu identifierat den man...''&lt;/ref&gt; Meddour was gay, and the Finnish-looking man was his boyfriend.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 08:42 - 08:52 : ''Mannen som butiksbiträdet säger har...''&lt;/ref&gt;

== First leads ==
The police first suspected the victim's boyfriend. The head cap recovered near the body was his, he had no alibi, and the couple was known for their frequent arguments. After twelve days in custody, the boyfriend was nevertheless released, and he was later cleared of all suspicion.&lt;ref name=p4 group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigators then learned that on the evening of 22 July, Meddour had received the visit of militants of the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|GIA]], an Algerian Islamic organisation.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 22:12 - 22:22 : ''Det visar sig att samma kväll som Josef...''&lt;/ref&gt; As Meddour himself was known for his opposition to the GIA, the police considered the possibility of a political assassination. Other people were interrogated, but leading to no breakthrough, and the investigators soon realised they were headed in the wrong direction.&lt;ref name=p5 group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrests ==
[[File:Jon Nödtveidt.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Jon Nödtveidt]] in 2005.]] 
On 15 December 1997, a 23-year-old woman entered a police station in [[Stockholm]], the Swedish capital. She wanted to file a complaint against her boyfriend Vlad, whom she accused of beating her, and threatening to kill her. She also told the police officers present that Vlad had once confessed to her that he was, along with his friend Jon, the perpetrator of the Keillers Park murder.&lt;ref name=p5 group=lo/&gt;

The story that Vlad had told the young woman was as follows: he and Nödtveidt met Meddour in a street of Gothenburg, and invited him to follow them to Keillers Park. There, they first tried to immobilise him with an [[electroshock weapon]] (Taser), which somehow did not succeed. Meddour tried to run away, but Vlad shot him in the back with a pistol. While Meddour was lying on the ground, Vlad handed the gun to Nödtveidt, who shot a second bullet to the head.&lt;ref name=p5 group=lo/&gt;

The 23-year-old woman also told the police that she knew the whereabouts of the murder weapon.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Alerted, police investigators in Gothenburg could only acknowledge that observations made on the crime scene matched the woman's account of the events. Vlad was arrested the same day at his home in Stockholm. He was found carrying a loaded 9 mm pistol. Nödtveidt was apprehended in Gothenburg on the morning of 18 December.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Confessions ==
The two suspects at first denied any involvement in Meddour's death, but after he was remanded on probable cause, Nödtveidt eventually made a confession. His account started the night of 21 to 22 July 1997, which he spent drinking at various pubs and clubs in Gothenburg, along with Vlad and two other friends. In the early morning, the two other friends headed back home, while Nödtveidt and Vlad started roaming in the city centre. Next to a park locally known as a meeting place for gay men, they were accosted by a stranger, who at the sight of their clothes asked them if they were Satanist, and told them he wanted to learn about this cult. At first, Nödtveidt and Vlad tried to push back the unknown man, but he insisted. This was how they came to know Meddour.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two friends eventually invited Meddour to follow them to Nödtveidt's home. While on the way, Meddour's behaviour and speech made clear he was a homosexual, which made Nödtveidt and Vlad feel angry and offended. Once they reached Nödtveidt's home, Meddour appeared scared and refused to step in. Nödtveidt and Vlad then suggested continuing their discussion about Satanism at Keillers Park. The three men hit the streets again, but before they left, Nödtveidt entered his flat to pick up the pistol and the Taser. Once at Keillers Park, Vlad took the Taser from Nödtveidt, and tried unsuccessfully to immobilise Meddour. Meddour attempted to run away, but his escape was cut short when Vlad shot a first bullet in his back, followed by a second bullet in his head.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

When faced with his contradictions, Vlad also confessed to the murder. His version of the events was very similar to Nödtveidt's, apart from one significant difference: according to him, Nödtveidt was the one who had held the gun, and who had pulled the trigger twice.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The investigation led the Gothenburg police into the world of [[black metal]] and [[Satanism]].

=== Black metal ===
{{main|Early Norwegian black metal scene}}
Nödtveidt was the leader of a musical band, [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], that had earned some fame in the small world of early black metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Niclas |last=Lindstrand |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/metalsangare-tog-sitt-liv/ |title=Metalsångare tog sitt liv |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=19 August 2006 |access-date= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] characterised by the occultism and raw violence of its lyrics,&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 27:52 - 28:16 : ''Och samtidigt som den här metalen slog igenom...''&lt;/ref&gt; and by the extreme behaviour and lifestyle of its followers.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 01:12 - 01:29 : ''Black metal är inte bara en musikgenre...''&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the nineties, the brief history of black metal was already related with violent deaths.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 31:00 - 31:20 : ''Det är nu det tar sin början...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[Per Yngve Ohlin|Per Ohlin]], the Swedish singer of a Norwegian band called [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], committed suicide&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 32:00 - 32:24 : ''Och i slutet på 80-talet så flyttade...''&lt;/ref&gt; by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun.&lt;ref name=p12 group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His body was found by the band's leader, [[Øystein Aarseth]], who instead of calling the police immediately, left to buy a disposable camera, and came back to take photographs of the corpse, eventually using the images for the band's live album ''Dawn of the Black Hearts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn of the Black Hearts by Mayhem|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Mayhem/The_Dawn_of_the_Black_Hearts_-_Live_in_Sarpsborg%2C_Norway_28-2%2C_1990/8075#|website=Encyclopedia Metallum: The Metal Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 32:25 - 32:44 : ''Men när han upptäcktes av Øystein...''&lt;/ref&gt; Aarseth also picked up fragments of his friend's skull, which ended up on a display shelf at the ''Helvete'' record shop in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 34:19 - 34:30 : ''I ett hörn i Helvete står ett vitrinskåp...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, [[Faust (musician)|Bård 'Faust' Eithun]], a co-worker of Aarseth stabbed a homosexual man in a street of [[Lillehammer]]. The murderer later stated homophobia as the motive for his act.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 36:03 - 36:31 : ''En av medlemmarna var en kille som...''&lt;/ref&gt; Aarseth himself was stabbed to death in 1993 by a Norwegian musician, [[Varg Vikernes]], who was known for his solo project [[Burzum]]. Vikernes claims that the murder was in fact an act of self-defense, as Aarseth had allegedly planned to murder him. Vikernes – who was also accused of [[Church arson|burning three churches]] - was sentenced in 1994 to 21 years behind bars.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 43:27 - 44:52 : ''Situationen i Norge blev ohållbar ganska...''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satanism ===
{{Main article|Temple of the Black Light}}
[[File:Inverted pentacle bold.svg|thumb|The inverted [[pentagram]] is a symbol of alchemy.]]
When the arrests were made on 15 and 18 December 1997, the police discovered satanic altars in the homes of the two suspects.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; A human skull was also found at Vlad's place, for which he was charged with possession of human parts.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Nödtveidt and Vlad were members of a satanic organization called ''Misanthropic Luciferian Order'' (MLO), of which Vlad was one of the founders, and that, according to the police, never had more than a handful of followers.&lt;ref name=p13 group=lo/&gt;

During their investigations, the police interrogated former members of the MLO, who described the organisation and narrated the occult ceremonies they had attended. Rituals included meditation, invocations of demons and animal sacrifices – cats, which were bought through classified ads. During the weeks that preceded the murder of Josef ben Meddour, Vlad had been more and more extremist in his speech, and the idea of performing human sacrifices, followed by a mass suicide, was discussed at length. During a meeting at Nödtveidt's place, a list of possible victims was made. It included a former follower who had defected, band members from Dissection, and even Nödtveidt's girlfriend.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

These plans led to the defection of some members of the MLO, who did not want to take part in any assassination, or who feared for their own lives. As a result, when the arrests were made, the number of active members was down to three: Nödtveidt, Vlad and his girlfriend.&lt;ref group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trials ==
The motives of the murder were not made clear during the trial. Was it a satanic crime, one of the human sacrifices that the MLO members had talked about? Or was it rather a hate crime, motivated by the anger Nödtveidt and Vlad had felt when confronted with Meddour's personality? According to criminal inspector Lars Ohlin, who led the police investigation, there is no denying that Nödtveidt and Vlad's acts were made on a background of Satanism, but homophobia was also a clear factor, and the Keillers Park murder was registered as a [[hate crime]] by the Swedish police.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 71:20 - 71:32 : ''Rätten lägger stor vikt på att det finns...''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July 1998, Nödtveidt was sentenced by the Gothenburg district court to eight years of prison for assistance to murder and illegal possession of a firearm. Vlad was sentenced to ten years for murder, violence against his girlfriend, illegal possession of a firearm and possession of body parts. All three parties appealed to the verdict.&lt;ref name=p13 group=lo&gt;{{sv}} Ohlin (2012), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeal for Western Sweden gave its verdict on 25 September 1998. Nödtveidt was this time sentenced to ten years in prison, just as Vlad, whose sentence was confirmed.&lt;ref name=p13 group=lo/&gt;

== Epilogue ==
Nödtveidt and Vlad were released in 2004, after spending seven years behind bars.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 72:06 - 72:09 : ''De släpps både två...''&lt;/ref&gt; Considering he had lived long enough, and in conformity with his satanic beliefs, Nödtveidt committed suicide in 2006. His body was found at his home, surrounded by a ring of candles, a ritual book by his side. His name was thus added to the list of violent deaths that have contributed to the legend of black metal.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 73:58 - 74:28 : ''Johan hittades i en ring av tända ljus...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Josef ben Meddour's body was repatriated to Algeria. He was buried in the national capital, [[Algiers]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv}} 76:17 - 76:33 : ''Eftersom Per Anders och Josef inte hade...''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fiqh |criminal}}

In [[Islam]], [[gambling]] ({{lang-ar|ميسر|translit=maisir, maysir, maisira, qimar}})&lt;ref name=IFQA&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Finance. Q&amp;A. What is the Difference Between Qimar and Maisir?|url=http://investment-and-finance.net/islamic-finance/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-qimar-and-maisir.html|website=investment-and-finance|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=Nov 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is forbidden ({{lang-ar|[[harām]]|script=Latn}}). 
''Maisir'' is prohibited by Islamic law (''[[shari'a]]'') on the grounds that "the agreement between participants is based on immoral inducement provided by entirely wishful hopes in the participants' minds that they will gain by mere chance, with no consideration for the possibility of loss".&lt;ref name=IFQA/&gt;

;Definitions
Both ''qimar'' and ''maisir'' refer to games of chance, but ''qimar'' is a kind (or [[subset]]) of ''maisir''.&lt;ref name=UIF/&gt; 
Author Muhammad Ayub defines ''maisir'' as "wishing something valuable with ease and without paying an equivalent compensation for it or without working for it, or without undertaking any liability against it by way of a game of chance",&lt;ref name=UIF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ayub|first1=Muhammad|title=Understanding Islamic Finance|date=2007|publisher=Wiley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3eZcL_kAkMC&amp;pg=PT118&amp;lpg=PT118&amp;dq=difference+between+Maisir+and+Qimar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2eU3-WNxbv&amp;sig=TeKpoyBZ-j6uUboduvBHcBBU0l4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nLXDVKSYBciRyAT37IH4Cg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=difference%20between%20Maisir%20and%20Qimar&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source, Faleel Jamaldeen, defines it as "the acquisition of wealth by chance (not by effort)".&lt;ref name=Jamaldeen-17&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7ImTjBd1gQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=islamic+finance+for+dummies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHhbyB8M7SAhVl8IMKHe0ICF4Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20finance%20for%20dummies&amp;f=false |title=Islamic Finance For Dummies |last=Jamaldeen|first=Faleel |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118233900|language=en|ref=FJIFD2012|page=17 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayub defines ''qimar'' as "also mean[ing] receipt of money, benefit or usufruct at the cost of others, having entitlement to that money or benefit by resorting to chance";&lt;ref name=UIF/&gt; Jamaldeen as "any game of chance".&lt;ref name=Jamaldeen-17/&gt;

;In scripture
It is stated in the [[Quran]] that games of chance, including ''maisir'', are a "grave sin" and "abominations of Satan's handiwork". It is also mentioned in [[ahadith]].

{{Quote|They ask you about wine and gambling. Say: 'In them both lies grave sin, though some benefit, to mankind. But their sin is more grave than their benefit.'|[[Qur'an]], 2:219 ([[al-Baqara]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|219|s=ns}} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-2/verse-219/ Quran Surah Al-Baqara ( Verse 219 )]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|source=|O believers, wine and gambling, idols and divining arrows are an abhorrence, the work of Satan. So keep away from it, that you may prevail. Satan only desires to arouse discord and hatred among you with wine and gambling, and to deter you from the mention of God and from prayer. Will you desist?| Qur'an, Sura 5:90-91 ([[Al-Ma'ida]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|90|e=91|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, "Whoever swears saying in his oath. 'By [[Al-lāt]] and [[al-‘Uzzá]],' should say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but God; and whoever says to his friend, 'Come, let me gamble with you,' should give something in charity."|Sahih Bukhari, Book 78 (Oaths and Vows), [[hadith]] 645}}

'''Marie-Julie Jahenny''' {{IPA-br|maˈʁiː ʒyˈliː ʒaɛˈniː}} ([[Blain, Loire-Atlantique|Coyault, Blain]], February 12, 1850 – [[Blain, Loire-Atlantique|La Fraudais]], March 4, 1941) was a [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Christian mysticism|mystic]] and [[stigmatist]].

==Life==
Marie-Julie Jahenny was born in a large peasant family,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chire.fr/A-129704-marie-julie-jahenny-la-stigmatisee-de-blain-1850-1941.aspx www.chire.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; and later joined the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]].

During her life, she reported several [[Marian apparition|apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] and [[Jesus Christ]] through which she received prophecies about the end of the world, the [[Great Catholic Monarch]], punishment for the sins of the people, the destruction of Paris through civil war, the [[Three Days of Darkness]], and the coming of [[Antichrist]].

From the age of twenty-three until her death, she bore the [[stigmata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marie Julie the Stigmatist|url=http://www.catholictradition.org/Passion/jahenny.htm#STIGMATIST}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the testimony of witnesses, she experienced miraculous Holy Communions, miraculous fasting periods to where she lived no other food but the Eucharist for several years, suffered supernatural attacks from the devil, and had the gift of prophecy and miracles.

Marie-Julie predicted numerous chastisements for sin that would fall first on France then spread to the rest of the world.  These include: earthquakes, unprecedented destruction through storms, failed harvests, unknown plagues that would spread rapidly plus the cures for them, a "Blood Rain" that would fall for seven weeks, civil war in France that apparently would be started by conspirators in the government, the persecution of the Catholic Church with the total closure of all churches and religious houses, persecution and slaughter of Christians, the destruction of Paris, a Two Day period of Darkness that would come circa a month before the Three Days of Darkness. The coming of the [[Last Roman Emperor|Great Monarch]] would also be announced by signs in the sky. She also had visions of the Angelic Pontiff who would reign at the same time of the Great Monarch, and that both these great leaders were destined to restore the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;"We Are Warned: The Prophecies of Marie-Julie Jahenny"  (December 1, 2011).

An association called ''"Le sanctuaire de Marie-Julie Jahenny"'' was created and presided over by Andre, the Marquis of La Franquerie, the French monarchist propagandist (1901-1992).

'''Mary Frances of the Five Wounds, [[Third Order of St. Francis|T.O.S.F.]]''' ({{lang-it|Maria Francesca delle Cinque Piaghe}}, 25 March 1715 &amp;ndash; 7 October 1791), was an [[Italian people|Italian]] member of the [[Third Order of St. Francis]], who is honored as a saint in the Catholic Church.

==Life==
She was born '''Anna Maria Gallo''', the daughter of Francesco Gallo and Barbara Basinsin, in the [[Quartieri Spagnoli]] (Spanish Quarter) of [[Naples]], a [[red-light district]] of the city, still known for its high crime. According to tradition, another saint, the [[Jesuit]], [[Francis de Geronimo]], predicted her future sanctity while she was still an infant. Her family was of the middle class, but her father, a weaver of gold lace, was a very violent man, who regularly abused his family physically, often severely.&lt;ref name=heckmann&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09755a.htm Heckmann, Ferdinand. "St. Mary Frances of the Five Wounds of Jesus." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 6 Aug. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Gallo was sixteen, her father attempted to force her into a marriage with a young man of means who was seeking her hand. She refused and asked to join the Franciscan Third Order, through which she could live out a religious life in the family home. The [[friars]] of Naples were part of the reform of St. [[Peter of Alcantara]], and they and the [[Third Order|tertiaries]] under their rule were known for the strictness of their lives. Through the intervention of a friar, Father Theophilus, permission to enter the Order was eventually granted by her father.&lt;ref name=heckmann/&gt;

Gallo was received into the Order on 8 September 1731 and began wearing the [[religious habit]] of the Order, which was an uncommon practice by that era. She also adopted the use of the [[religious name]] she took upon being received into the Order, out of her devotion to the [[Blessed Mother]], St. [[Francis of Assisi]] and the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]].&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90242|work=Santi e Beati|title=Santa Maria Francesca delle Cinque Piaghe|accessdate=2 March 2013|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to live in the family home to serve God as a consecrated virgin, as was customary in those days.&lt;ref name=habig&gt;[http://www.franciscan-sfo.org/sts/S10065wou.htm ''The Franciscan Book of Saints'', ed. by Marion Habig, ofm., Franciscan Herald Press, 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

She took as her [[spiritual director]], the Franciscan friar, [[John Joseph of the Cross]], while her [[confessor]] was the [[Barnabite]] priest, [[Francis Xavier Bianchi]], and she began to be known among her neighbors for her work of charity, helping the poor of the sector. She was a person of deep prayer, often spending long hours in meditation.

In 1753 she joined with another Franciscan tertiary, known only as Maria Felice, and they moved into a small palace owned by a priest, Giovanni Pessiri, who became their spiritual director. The two women occupied the second floor, sleeping on the floor, and the priest the floor above.&lt;ref name=SB /&gt; She is said to have received the wounds of the [[stigmata]] while living there and suffered patiently many physical afflictions and spiritual trials.&lt;ref name=SB /&gt; She would wear gloves to cover the marks on her hands, while she did her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firponet.com/Francesco/Servants/MFrancesca/casa_MF_guanti.htm|work=St. Mary Frances' Home|title=The Gloves she wore to cover the Stigmata|accessdate=2 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808054855/http://www.firponet.com/Francesco/Servants/MFrancesca/casa_MF_guanti.htm|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also said to have had visions of [[Raphael (archangel)|Saint Raphael the Archangel]], who healed her of several afflictions.&lt;ref name=queen&gt;[http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-raphael/ "Archangel Raphael", Queen of Angels Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Mary Frances was buried in the Franciscan [[:it:Complesso di Santa Lucia Vergine al Monte|Church of Santa Lucia al Monte]] in Naples, which she attended during her life.  This church also contains the tomb of John Joseph, now also declared a saint.

Mary Frances was declared [[Venerable]] by [[Pope Pius VII]], on 18 May 1803.  She was [[beatified]] by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on 12 November 1843. She was soon [[canonized]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] on 29 June 1867. Her [[feast day]] is celebrated on 6 October. She was the first woman from Naples to have been declared a saint by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=SB /&gt;

Devotion to Mary Frances has long continued to be strong in the neighborhood where she lived, and of which she is the [[patron saint]]. The residents credit her intercession with the little damage the sector endured during [[World War II]], when over 100 bombs were dropped on it.&lt;ref name=SB /&gt; Her home has been preserved as a chapel and museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firponet.com/Francesco/Servants/MFrancesca/casa_di_MF.htm|work=St. Mary Frances' Home|title=Main|accessdate=2 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815144505/http://www.firponet.com/Francesco/Servants/MFrancesca/casa_di_MF.htm|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Pius IX, who canonized Mary Frances, declared her to be a patroness of expectant mothers and of women having difficulty conceiving.&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nelcuoredeigiorni.tv2000.it/napoli-il-santuario-di-santa-maria-francesca-delle-cinque-piaghe/2012/08/08|work=TV2000 Italia|title=Nel santuario di Santa Maria Francesca delle Cinque Piaghe|date=8 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702183950/http://www.nelcuoredeigiorni.tv2000.it/napoli-il-santuario-di-santa-maria-francesca-delle-cinque-piaghe/2012/08/08|archivedate=2 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the patroness of the Gallo World Family Foundation, which was founded to promote the development of Judeo-Christian values in the betterment of the world by members of the Gallo family scattered worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galloworldfamily.org/|work=Gallo World Family Foundation|title=Mission Statement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2001, her remains were transferred from the Church of Santa Lucia to the house where she had spent the last half of her life. It is now the [[:it:Chiesa di Santa Maria Francesca delle Cinque Piaghe|Shrine of St. Mary Frances of the Five Wounds]]. It is still a common practice for expectant mothers to go there to be blessed with her [[relic]]. Many [[votive offering]]s from mothers who credit her with their successful deliveries are displayed in the sanctuary.&lt;ref name= IT /&gt;

In Scotland, the Venerable [[Margaret Sinclair (nun)|Margaret Sinclair]] took the religious name Sister Mary Francis of the Five Wounds during her short-lived vocation in [[London]]. Her major shrine in [[St Patrick's Church, Edinburgh]] has been given status by both [[Pope Paul VI]] declaration, and [[Pope John Paul II]] description of The Blessed Margaret as being "one of God’s little ones who, through her very simplicity, was touched by God with the strength of real holiness of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1982/june/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19820601_ospedale-st-joseph.html|title=ADDRESS OF JOHN PAUL II DURING THE VISIT TO SAINT JOSEPH’S HOSPITAL|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman law|law]], the '''''auspicia maxima''''' (also ''maxima auspicia'') were the "greatest auspices," conferred on [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|senior magistrates]] who held ''[[imperium]]'': "''[[auspicium]]'' and ''imperium'' were the twin pillars of the magistrate's power" ''([[potestas]]'').

Consuls and censors were not [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|colleagues]], and the censors lacked military auspices ''(auspicia militiae)''. [[Praetor]]s, however, held a form of ''auspicia maxima'' and could also lead an army, though their ''imperium'' was lesser than that of the consuls.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.

==History==
{{Further|Dal Khalsa (Sikh Empire)}}
In order to withstand the persecution of [[Shah Jahan]] and other [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers, several of the later [[Sikh Gurus]] established military forces and fought the [[Mughal Empire]] and [[Hindu]] hill chiefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Surjit Singh|authorlink=|title=History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1606-1708 C.E|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/History-Sikh-Gurus-Retold--1708/dp/8126908580/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1296039499&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=26 January 2010|date=1 February 2008|publisher=Atlantic Publishing|isbn=81-269-0858-0 |page=814|chapter=13 Khalsa Battles Against Islamic Imperialism and Hindu Conservatism}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Battles involving the Sikh Empire#Early Afghan-Sikh Battles|early]] and [[Sikh Empire|middle]] Mughal-Sikh Wars. [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] continued Sikh resistance to the [[Mughal Empire]] until his defeat at the [[Battle of Gurdas Nangal]].

For several years Sikhs found refuge in the jungles and the [[Sivalik Hills|Himalayan foothills]] until they organized themselves into military bands known as ''[[jatha]]s''.

Each Misl was made up of members of soldiers, whose loyalty was given to the Misl's leader. A Misl could be composed of a few hundred to tens of thousands soldiers. Any soldier was free to join whichever Misl he wished, and was free to cancel his membership of the Misl to whom he belonged. He could, if he wanted, cancel his membership of his old Misl and join another. The Barons would allow their armies to combine or coordinate their defences together against a hostile force if ordered by the Misldar Supreme Commander. These orders were only issued in military matters affecting the whole [[Sikh]] community. These orders would normally be related to defense against external threats, such as Afghan military attacks. The profits of a fighting action were divided by the misls to individuals based on the service rendered after the conflict using the [[#Administration|sardari system]].

The '''Sikh Confederacy''' is a description of the [[political]] structure, of how all the Barons' Kingdoms interacted with each other [[politically]] together in [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Although misls varied in strength, the use of primarily [[light cavalry]] with a smaller amount [[heavy cavalry]] was uniform throughout all of the Sikh misls. Cavalrymen in a misl were required to supply their own horses and equipment.&lt;ref name="Singh 1963 page=23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1963|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard cavalryman was armed with a [[spear]], [[matchlock]], and [[scimitar]].&lt;ref name="Francklin1805"&gt;{{cite book|last=Francklin|first=William|title=Military memoirs of Mr. George Thomas; who, by extraordinary talents and enterprise, rose from an obscure situation to the rank of a general, in the service of the native powers in the North-West of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhsFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=30 June 2010|year=1805|publisher=Reprinted for John Stockdale|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; How the armies of the Sikh misls received payment varied with the leadership of each misl. The most prevalent system of payment was the 'Fasalandari' system; soldiers would receive payment every six months at the end of a [[harvest]].&lt;ref name="Singh1964"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Fauja|title=Military system of the Sikhs: during the period 1799-1849|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLk9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2010|year=1964|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cavalry tactics===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Misl Cavalryman - The Sikh Army 1799-1849 - pg 6.jpg|thumb|300px|The Misls primarily employed cavalry in warfare.]]
Fauja Singh considers the Sikh misls to be [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla armies]], although he notes that the Sikh misls generally had greater numbers and a larger number of [[artillery]] pieces than a guerrilla army would.&lt;ref name="Singh 1963 page=23"/&gt; The misls were primarily cavalry based armies and employed less artillery than [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] or [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] armies. The misls adapted their tactics to their strength in cavalry and weakness in artillery and avoided pitched battles. Misls organized their armies around bodies of horsemen and their units fought battles in a series of skirmishes, a tactic which gave them an advantage over fighting pitched battles. Bodies of cavalry would attack a position, retreat, reload their muskets, and return to attack it again. The tactics used by misl field armies include [[Flanking maneuver#Maneuvering|flanking]] an enemy, obstructing river passages, cutting off a unit from its supplies, intercepting messengers, attacking isolated units like foraging parties, employing [[hit-and-run tactics]], overrunning camps, and attacking [[baggage train]]s. To fight large armies the misl would completely evacuate the areas in front of the enemy's marching route but follow in the rear of the opposition and reconquer areas the enemy had just captured, threaten agents of the enemy with retribution, and sweep over the countryside in the wake of the enemy's withdrawal.

The ''Running Skirmish'' was a tactic unique to the Sikh cavalrymen which was notable for its effectiveness and the high degree of skill required to execute it. [[George Thomas (soldier)|George Thomas]] and George Forster, contemporary writers who witnessed it described its use separately in their accounts of the military of the Sikhs. George Forster noted:

"A party from forty to fifty, advance in a quick pace to a distance of carbine shot from the enemy and then, that the fire may be given with the greatest certainty, the horses are drawn up and their pieces discharged, when speedily, retiring about a 100 paces, they load and repeat the same mode of annoying the enemy. Their horses have been so expertly trained to a performance of this operation that on receiving a stroke of hand, they stop from a full canter."

The Sikh Misls had four different classes of administrative divisions. The patadari, misaldari, tabadari, and jagirdari were the different systems of [[land tenure]] used by the misls, and land granted by the misl left the responsibility of establishing law and order to the owner of the land. The land under the direct administration of the chief of the misl was known as the ''sardari'' and the tabadari and jagirdari systems used land directly given by the chief from the sardari. The patadari and misaldari systems formed the basis of a misl, while tabadari and jagirdari lands would only be created after large acquisitions of land. The type of system that was used in an area depended on the importance of the chief [[sardar]] of the area to the rest of the misl.

The ''Patadari system'' affected newly annexed territories and was the original method used by the misls in administrating land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patadari system relied on the cooperation of surkundas, the rank of a leader of a small party of [[cavalrymen]]. The chief of the misl would take his/her portion and divide the other parcels among his [[Sardar]]s proportional to the number of [[cavalrymen]] they had contributed to the misl.&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=34"&gt;{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sardars would then divide their parcels among their Surkundas, and then the Surkundas subdivided the land they received among their individual cavalrymen. The Surkundas receiving parcels of land with settlements were required to fortify them{{#tag:ref|The owners of larger villages were required to erect [[stockade]]s and [[Ditch (fortification)|ditches]] while the owners of towns erected either [[keep]]s or [[fort]]s&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=34"/&gt;|group=note}} and establish fines and laws for their [[zamindar]]s and [[ryot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parcels of land in the patadari system could not be sold, but could be given to relatives in an [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=35"&gt;{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers who received parcels from the Patadari system held their land in complete freedom.&lt;ref name="Kakshi 2007 page=73"/&gt;

The ''Misaldari system'' applied to sardars with a small number of cavalrymen as well as independent bodies of cavalrymen who voluntarily attached themselves to a misl.&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=35"/&gt; They kept the lands they held before joining the misl as an allotment for their cooperation with the misl. The leaders of these groups, called misaldars, could transfer their allegiance and land to another misl without punishment.&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=35"/&gt;

The ''Tabadari system'' referred to land under the control of a misl's tabadars. Tabadars served a similar function to retainers in Europe. They were required to serve as cavalrymen to the misl and were subservient to the misl's leader. Although tabadars received their land as a reward, their ownership was subject entirely on the misl's leader.&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=36"&gt;{{harvnb|Prinsep|1834|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tabadari grants were only hereditary on the choice of the chief of the misl.

The ''Jagirdari system'' used the grant of [[jagir]]s by the chief of the misl. [[Jagir]]s were given by the chief of the misl to relations, dependents, and people who "deserved well".&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=36"/&gt; The owners of jagirs were subservient to the chief of the misl as their ownership was subject his/her needs. Like the Tabadars, jagirdars were subject to personal service when the chief of the misl requested.&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=36"/&gt; However, because jagirs entailed more land and profit, they were required to use the money generated by their jagirs to equip and mount a quota of [[cavalrymen]] depending on the size of their jagir.&lt;ref name="Prinsep 1834 page=36"/&gt; Jagirdari grants were hereditary in practice but a misl's chief could revoke the rights of the heir. Upon the death of the owner of a tabadari or jagadari grant, the land would revert to direct control of the chief (sardari).

==Territory==
[[File:Punjabdoabs1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A map of the [[Punjab region]] showing the different doabs]]
The two main divisions in territory between the misls were between those who were in the [[Malwa]] region and those who were in the [[Majha]] region. While eleven of the misls were north of the [[Sutlej]] river, one, the [[Phulkian Misl]] was south of the Sutlej.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oberoi|1994|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs north of the Sutlej river were known as the [[Majha]] Sikhs while the Sikhs that lived south of the [[Sutlej]] river were known as the [[Malwa]] Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Kakshi 2007 page=164"/&gt; In the smaller territories were the Dhanigeb Singhs in the [[Sind Sagar Doab]], the Gujrat Singhs in the [[Jech Doab]], the Dharpi Singhs in the [[Rechna Doab]], and the Doaba Singhs in the [[Jalandhar Doab]].&lt;ref name="Kakshi 2007 page=164"/&gt;

After living in Macedonia for eighteen years she moved to Ireland and then to [[India]], where she lived for most of her life.

In 1950 Teresa founded the [[Missionaries of Charity]], a Roman Catholic [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] which had over 4,500 sisters and was active in 133 countries in 2012. The congregation manages homes for people dying of [[HIV/AIDS]], [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis]]; [[soup kitchen]]s; dispensaries and mobile clinics; children's- and family-counselling programmes; [[orphanage]]s, and schools. Members, who take vows of [[chastity, poverty, and obedience]], also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor".&lt;ref&gt;Muggeridge (1971), chapter 3, "Mother Teresa Speaks", pp. 105, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresa received a number of honours, including the 1962 [[List of Ramon Magsaysay Award winners|Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize]] and 1979 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. She was [[Canonization|canonised]] (recognised by the church as a [[saint]]) on 4 September 2016, and the anniversary of her death (5 September) is her [[feast day]].

A controversial figure [[Criticism of Mother Teresa|during her life and after her death]], Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work. She was praised and criticised for her [[opposition to abortion]], and criticised for poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography was written by [[Navin Chawla]] and published in 1992, and she has been the subject of [[#Film and literature|films and other books]]. On September 6, 2017, Teresa was named co-patron of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta, alongside [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]].

According to a biography by [[Joan Graff Clucas]], during her early years Teresa was fascinated by stories of the lives of [[missionaries]] and their service in [[Bengal]]; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff.

Teresa left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the [[Sisters of Loreto]] at [[Loreto Abbey]] in [[Rathfarnham]], Ireland, to learn English with the view of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff.

On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she travelled by train to the [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto convent]] in Darjeeling from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] for her annual retreat. "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith."&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York.

She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,&lt;ref name="IANS2016"/&gt; replacing her traditional Loreto [[Religious habit|habit]] with a simple, white cotton [[sari]] with a blue border. Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in [[Patna]] to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988).

Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2002). ''Mother Teresa''. Indianapolis. Alpha Books, p. 57. {{ISBN|0-02-864278-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, she begged for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of convent life during these early months:

{{quote|Our Lord wants me to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today, I learned a good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I walked and walked till my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul, looking for a home, food and health. Then, the comfort of Loreto [her former congregation] came to tempt me. "You have only to say the word and all that will be yours again", the Tempter kept on saying&amp;nbsp;... Of free choice, my God, and out of love for you, I desire to remain and do whatever be your Holy will in my regard. I did not let a single tear come.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997).

On 7 October 1950, Teresa received [[Holy See|Vatican]] permission for the diocesan congregation which would become the Missionaries of Charity.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2002). ''Mother Teresa''. Indianapolis. Alpha Books, p. 62. {{ISBN|0-02-864278-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=washingtonpost.com: Highlights of Mother Teresa's Life|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/teresa/stories/words.htm|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997 the 13-member Calcutta congregation had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centres worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged, alcoholics, the poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997).

In 1952, Teresa opened her first [[hospice]] with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple into the [[Kalighat Home for the Dying]], free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, Anne (1997).''Mother Teresa: Beyond the Image''.

The congregation began to attract recruits and donations, and by the 1960s it had opened hospices, orphanages and [[Leper colony|leper houses]] throughout India.

The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a [[Enclosed religious orders|contemplative branch]] of the Sisters followed in 1976. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity.

When Eastern Europe experienced increased openness in the late 1980s, Teresa expanded her efforts to Communist countries which had rejected the Missionaries of Charity. She began dozens of projects, undeterred by criticism of her stands against abortion and divorce: "No matter who says what, you should accept it with a smile and do your own work."

==Declining health and death==
Teresa had a heart attack in Rome in 1983 while she was visiting [[Pope John Paul II]]. Following a second attack in 1989, she received an [[artificial pacemaker]]. In 1991, after a bout of [[pneumonia]] in Mexico, she had additional heart problems. Although Teresa offered to resign as head of the Missionaries of Charity, in a [[secret ballot]] the sisters of the congregation voted for her to stay and she agreed to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blessed Mother Teresa|url=http://www.britannica.com/nobelprize/article-9071751|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1996 she fell, breaking her [[collarbone]], and four months later she had [[malaria]] and [[Heart failure#Left-sided failure|heart failure]]. Although Teresa had [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]], her health was clearly declining.

Teresa was first recognised by the Indian government more than a third of a century earlier, receiving the [[Padma Shri]] in 1962 and the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iccr.gov.in/content/nehru-award-recipients|title=Nehru Award Recipients {{!}} Indian Council for Cultural Relations {{!}} Government of India|website=www.iccr.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later received other Indian awards, including the [[Bharat Ratna]] (India's highest civilian award) in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bharatratna.co.in/bharat-ratna-awardees.htm|title=List Of Bharat Ratna Awardees|website=www.bharatratna.co.in|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teresa's official biography, by [[Navin Chawla]], was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mother_Teresa.html?id=7AmVAAAACAAJ|title=Mother Teresa: The Authorized Biography|last=Chawla|first=Navin|date=1992-03-01|publisher=Diane Publishing Company|isbn=9780756755485|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kolkata]], she is worshipped as a goddess by some [[Hinduism|Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-india-teresa-draws-devotees-of-all-faiths-1472857787|title=In India, Teresa Draws Devotees of All Faiths|last=Stacey|first=Daniel|date=2016-09-03|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-05-18|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special {{INR}}5 coin (the amount of money Teresa had when she arrived in India) on 28 August 2010. President [[Pratibha Patil]] said, "Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many – the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Commemorative-coin-on-Mother-Teresa-released/articleshow/6451687.cms|title=Commemorative coin on Mother Teresa released - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian views of Teresa are not uniformly favourable. [[Aroup Chatterjee]], a physician born and raised in Calcutta who was an activist in the city's slums for years around 1980 before moving to the UK, said that he "never even saw any nuns in those slums".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/world/asia/mother-teresa-critic.html|title=A Critic’s Lonely Quest: Revealing the Whole Truth About Mother Teresa|last=Schultz|first=Kai|date=2016-08-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-18|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research, involving more than 100 interviews with volunteers, nuns and others familiar with the Missionaries of Charity, was described in a 2003 book critical of Teresa.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Chatterjee criticized her for promoting a "cult of suffering" and a distorted, negative image of Calcutta, exaggerating work done by her mission and misusing funds and privileges at her disposal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"&gt;Chatterjee, Aroup, Introduction to ''The Final Verdict''&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, some of the hygiene problems he had criticized (needle reuse, for example) improved after Teresa's death in 1997.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya]], mayor of Kolkata from 2005 to 2010, said that "she had no significant impact on the poor of this city", glorified illness instead of treating it and misrepresented the city: "No doubt there was poverty in Calcutta, but it was never a city of lepers and beggars, as Mother Teresa presented it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-mother-teresa-snap-story.html|title=Was Mother Teresa a saint?

Secretary [[Giriraj Kishore]] said that "her first duty was to the Church and social service was incidental", accusing her of favouring Christians and conducting "secret baptisms" of the dying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eci.nic.in/ECI_Main/DJ/Frontline%201997%20Article%20published%20in%20Hindu.pdf#page=3 A life of selfless caring] - [[Frontline (magazine)]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usislam1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usislam.org/revise/6211Baptism.htm|title=Secret Baptism|publisher=Usislam.org|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a front-page tribute, the Indian fortnightly ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' dismissed the charges as "patently false" and said that they had "made no impact on the public perception of her work, especially in Calcutta".

In February 2015 [[Mohan Bhagwat]], leader of the Hindu right-wing organisation [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]], said that Teresa's objective was "to convert the person, who was being served, into a Christian".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mother-teresas-aim-was-conversion-says-bhagwat/article6926462.ece|title=Mother Teresa’s aim was conversion, says Bhagwat|last=Dhar|first=Aarti|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former RSS spokesperson M.

Teresa received the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Peace and International Understanding, given for work in South or East Asia, in 1962. According to its citation, "The Board of Trustees recognises her merciful cognisance of the abject poor of a foreign land, in whose service she has led a new congregation".&lt;ref&gt;Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation (1962) ''Citation for Mother Teresa''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s, she was an international celebrity. Teresa's fame may be partially attributed to [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]'s 1969 documentary, ''Something Beautiful for God'', and his 1971 book of the same name. Muggeridge was undergoing a spiritual journey of his own at the time.&lt;ref name=Timecrisis/&gt; During filming, footage shot in poor lighting (particularly at the Home for the Dying) was thought unlikely to be usable by the crew.

Around this time, the Catholic world began to honour Teresa publicly.

(1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, pp. 81–82. {{ISBN|1-55546-855-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and she received the [[Pacem in Terris Award]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''Quad City Times'' staff (17 October 2005).

When Teresa received the prize she was asked, "What can we do to promote world peace?" She answered, "Go home and love your family." Building on this theme in her [[Nobel Prize#Nobel lecture|Nobel lecture]], she said: "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable {{sic}} and so much, and I find that very difficult." Teresa singled out abortion as "the greatest destroyer of peace today.

==Spiritual life==
Analysing her deeds and achievements, [[Pope John Paul II]] said: "Where did Mother Teresa find the strength and perseverance to place herself completely at the service of others?

Kolodiejchuk (the official responsible for gathering evidence for her canonisation) thought that her unhappiness might be misinterpreted by some, but her faith that God was working through her was undiminished; although she pined for lost closeness to God, she did not question his existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N|first1=Ajay Kumar|title=MOTHER TERESA's SPIRITUAL LIFE :|url=https://aknandy.wordpress.com/2016/09/03/mother-teresas-spiritual-life/|website=A.

After ten years of doubt, Teresa described a brief period of renewed faith. After [[Pope Pius XII]]'s death in 1958, while she prayed for him at a requiem mass, she was relieved of "the long darkness: that strange suffering." However, five weeks later her spiritual dryness returned.&lt;ref name=Newsweekteresa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/38603|title=Hitchens Takes on Mother Teresa|work=Newsweek|accessdate=11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresa wrote many letters to her confessors and superiors over a 66-year period, most notably to Calcutta Archbishop Ferdinand Perier and Jesuit priest [[Celeste van Exem]] (her spiritual advisor since the formation of the Missionaries of Charity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-10-19/news/0310190294_1_mother-teresa-beatification-garneau|location=Baltimore|work=The Baltimore Sun|title=The dark night of 'a blessed soul'|date=19 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; She requested that her letters be destroyed, concerned that "people will think more of me—less of Jesus."&lt;ref name="Timecrisis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/524638,CST-NWS-mother24.article |title=Mother Teresa's Crisis of Faith |accessdate=26 August 2007 |work=Sun Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071011164222/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/524638,CST-NWS-mother24.article |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

I want you to pray for me—that I let Him have [a] free hand."

In ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (his first [[encyclical]]), [[Pope Benedict XVI]] mentioned Teresa three times and used her life to clarify one of the encyclical's main points: "In the example of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta we have a clear illustration of the fact that time devoted to God in prayer not only does not detract from effective and loving service to our neighbour but is in fact the inexhaustible source of that service."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XVI]] (25 December 2005). ''Deus caritas est{{Dead link|date=October 2011}}''. (PDF). Vatican City, pp.10.

==Canonisation==

=== Miracle and beatification ===

After Teresa's death in 1997, the [[Holy See]] began the process of [[beatification]] (the third step towards [[canonisation]]) and Kolodiejchuk was appointed [[postulator]] by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta|Diocese of Calcutta]]. Although he said, "We didn't have to prove that she was perfect or never made a mistake&amp;nbsp;...", he had to prove that Teresa's virtue was heroic. Kolodiejchuk submitted 76 documents, totalling 35,000 pages, which were based on interviews with 113 witnesses who were asked to answer 263 questions.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/did-mother-teresa-really-perform-miracles/|title=Did Mother Teresa really perform miracles?|date=2 September 2016|author=Brown, Mick|newspaper=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of canonisation requires the documentation of a [[miracle]] resulting from the [[intercession]] of the prospective saint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mother Teresa: The Road to Official Sainthood|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/features/teresa/sainthood.asp|work=www.americancatholic.org|accessdate=13 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014152734/http://www.americancatholic.org/features/teresa/sainthood.asp|archivedate=14 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the Vatican recognised as a miracle the healing of a tumour in the abdomen of Monica Besra, an Indian woman, after the application of a locket containing Teresa's picture. According to Besra, a beam of light emanated from the picture and her cancerous tumour was cured; however, her husband and some of her medical staff said that conventional medical treatment eradicated the tumour.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, David (10 May. 2003). "Medicine cured 'miracle' woman – not Mother Teresa, say doctors". ''The Telegraph''.

According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', calls to Sister Betta and the office of Sister Nirmala (Teresa's successor as head of the order) elicited no comment. Officials at Balurghat Hospital, where Besra sought medical treatment, said that they were pressured by the order to call her cure miraculous.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; In February 2000, former West Bengal health minister Partho De ordered a review of Besra's medical records at the Department of Health in Kolkata. According to De, there was nothing unusual about her illness and cure based on her lengthy treatment.

A subsequent investigation took place in Brazil from 19–26 June 2015 which was later transferred to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints who issued a decree recognizing the investigation to be completed.&lt;ref name=miracle2/&gt; A team of medical experts first analyzed and approved this miracle to have no scientific explanation on 10 September 2015, while theologians ascertained the miracle came about after prayers directed to Teresa after they met on 8 October. The members of the Congregation themselves met and approved the findings of the two previous boards on 15 December which allowed for them to pass on their findings to the pope two days later for his approval which he subsequently granted.

Francis canonised her at a ceremony on 4 September 2016 in [[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City.

'''Secularism in Tunisia''' is an ideological and political movement aiming at defining the relationship between religion and state and the place of religion in society during an ongoing [[modernization theory|modernization]]. The [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] affirmed Tunisia as a civil state founded on citizenship. It also declared [[Islam]] as Tunisia's religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Tunisia_2014.pdf 2014 Constitution of Tunisia adopted on 26 January 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The following religious festivals are recognized as national holidays: the [[Islamic New Year]], the birth of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]], [[Eid al-Fitr]], and [[Eid al-Adha]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171218024857/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193121.pdf Country profile: Tunisia], The United States Department of State, September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1956, Tunisia achieved formal [[Tunisian independence|independence]] from France. In 1956–1987, under the leadership of [[Habib Bourguiba]], the first President of the Republic of Tunisia, Tunisia’s post independence government pursued a program of [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Shakman Hurd. [http://www.islam-democracy.org/4th_Annual_Conference-shakman-Hurd_paper.asp ''Secularism and Democracy in the Middle East''], Center for the Study of Islam &amp; Democracy (CSID), May 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourguiba, "who has been one of the most avowedly secularist political strategists in the Arab world",&lt;ref name="Ayubi"&gt;Nazih N. Ayubi. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vYeJAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT161&amp;ots=nj0jOh74f9&amp;dq=who%20has%20Been%20one%20of%20the%20most%20avowedly%20secularism%20political%20strategists%20in%20the%20Arab%20world&amp;pg=PT161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'']. Routledge, 1991. {{ISBN|9780415054423}}&lt;/ref&gt; modified laws regarding religious endowments (habus), secularized education and unified the legal system so that all Tunisians, regardless of religion, were subject to the state courts. He restricted the influence of the religious [[University of Ez-Zitouna]] and replaced it with a faculty of theology integrated into the University of Tunis, banned the headscarf for women, made members of the religious hierarchy state employees and ordered that the expenses for the upkeep of mosques and the salaries of preachers to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Nazih N. Ayubi, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, his best known legal innovation was the [[Code of Personal Status in Tunisia|‘Code du Statut Personel’]] (CSP), the laws governing issues related to the family: marriage, guardianship of children, inheritance and most importantly the abolishing of polygamy and making divorce subject to judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie A. Brand. ''Women, the State and Political Liberalization: Middle East and North Africa Experiences'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba clearly wanted to undercut the religious establishment’s ability to prevent his secularization program, and although he was careful to locate these changes within the framework of a modernist reading of Islam and presented them as the product of ''ijtihad'' (independent interpretation) and not a break with Islam, he became well known for his [[secularism]].

Following increasing economic problems, Islamist movements came about in 1970 with the revival of religious teaching in Ez-Zitouna University and the influence which came from Arab religious leaders from Syrian and Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nazih N. Ayubi, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also influence by [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], whose members issued a magazine in Tunis named ''Azeytouna''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeytouna.net Azeytouna Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Government-induced secularization triggered the formation of the [[Rached Ghannouchi#Islamic Tendency Movement|Islamic Tendency Movement]]; the movement and its leader [[Rached Ghannouchi]] turned into a rallying point for government opponents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBs0DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA365&amp;dq=For%20Bourguiba%2C%20Islam%20represented%20the%20past%3B%20the%20west%20was%20Tunisia's%20only%20hope%20for%20a%20modern%20future.&amp;pg=PA365#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''An Introduction to International Relations''], ed. by Richard Devetak, Jim George, and Sarah Percy. Cambridge University Press, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, the struggle of Bourguiba and then [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], who succeeded him, with political Islamists went out of control, and in order to suppress the opposition the Islamist leaders were harassed, tortured, and exiled.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Arab Spring developments ==
The [[Arab Spring]] changed government in Tunisia and resulted in adoption of the [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] following a considerable debate between Islamic and secular political groups and movements.&lt;ref&gt;George Sadek, Senior Legal Information Analyst. [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/tunisia.php ''The Role of Islamic Law in Tunisia’s Constitution and Legislation Post-Arab Spring''], The Law Library of Congress, May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2011, after the secularist dictatorship of [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] collapsed in the wake of the 2011 [[Tunisian revolution]], Tunisia's interim government granted the [[Ennahda Movement|''Ennahda'']],  a moderate Islamist movement in [[Tunisia]], permission to form a political party.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12611609 |title=Tunisia legalises Islamist group Ennahda |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/20208be6-70e1-11e0-9b1d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1QD6AeB85 |first=Roula |last=Khalaf |title=Tunisian Islamists seek poll majority |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |publisher=FT.com |date=27 Apr 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011130111220856971.html |title=Tunisian leader returns from exile |work=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Matthew |last=Kaminski |title=On the Campaign Trail With Islamist Democrats |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=26 October 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204777904576651361230968584?mod=googlenews_wsj |accessdate=26 October 2011 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Ennahda Islamic Party has become the biggest and most well-organized party in Tunisia, so far outdistancing its more secular competitors.

=== Women’s rights ===
{{main|Women in Tunisia}}

In July 2017, the Tunisian parliament passed the Law on Eliminating Violence Against Women,  before there had been no specific law on domestic violence. The new law also includes provisions on harassment in public spaces and economic discrimination. It also abolished “[[marry-your-rapist law]]”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/27/tunisia-landmark-step-shield-women-violence&lt;/ref&gt; Some Islamic scholars believe that [[An-Nisa, 34]] allows for wife beating, therefore Tunisian law runs contradictory to the Quranic teachings.

Since September 2017, Tunisian Muslim women are allowed to marry non-Muslim men. The ban has been in place since 1973. Tunisian president [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] argued that the ban “violated Tunisia's constitution”, and that he wants to create "total, actual equality between men and women citizens in a progressive way".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/tunisia-muslim-women-marry-non-muslims-first-time-decades-islamic-sharia-religion-a7948916.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, as per Quran, a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry outside the Islamic faith (a non-Muslim).&lt;ref&gt;Quran [https://quran.com/2/221 2:221], [https://quran.com/60/10 60:10]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the afromentioned, Tunisian parliament is working on changing inheritance rights to make them equal for men and women. In addition to codifying equal inheritance, the Parliament advocates abolishing the death penalty, [[LGBT rights in Tunisia|decriminalizing homosexuality]] and annulling [[Mahr|dowries]]. Such rapid changes provoked a backlash from Islamists, conservatives and even some moderates who view it as “an unwelcome departure from Islamic values.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/08/tunisia-president-women-equal-inheritance-rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil state ==
A compromising notion of a ''Civil state'' that merges concepts of a ''[[Secular state]]'' and an ''[[Islamic state]]'' was suggested by [[Rached Ghannouchi]].&lt;ref&gt;Nader Hashemi. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmakkmoVsq4C&amp;pg=PT10&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;dq=secularism+in+tunisia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D5TGrTCVLz&amp;sig=m6LW9zq13iYFjSuyxcr4sHYptOg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJvKL2x5LYAhUC4IMKHZzJDNI4ChDoAQhaMAk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Islam, Secularism, and Liberal Democracy. Toward a Democratic Theory for Muslim Societies'']. Oxford University Press, 2009. {{ISBN|9780195321241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed in Turkey in 2011, he said, "We need democracy and development in Tunisia and we strongly believe in the compatibility between Islam and democracy, between Islam and modernity. So we do not need secularism in Tunisia."&lt;ref&gt;İpek Yezdani.

==Early life==
Named after actress [[Shirley Temple]] (who was six years old at the time), Shirley MacLean Beaty&lt;!-- spelling of Beaty here is correct --&gt; was born on April 24, 1934, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Her father, Ira Owens Beaty,&lt;!-- spelling of Beaty here is correct --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Boyd Roberts (Revised April 18, 2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090301172443/http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/services/articles_gbr83.asp #83 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources: A Third Set of Ten Hollywood Figures (or Groups Thereof), with a Coda on Two Directors]. New England Historic Genealogical Society&lt;/ref&gt; was a professor of psychology, public school administrator, and real estate agent, and her mother, Kathlyn Corinne ([[married and maiden names|née]] MacLean), was a drama teacher, originally from [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia]], Canada. MacLaine's younger brother is the actor, writer, and director [[Warren Beatty]]; he changed the spelling of his surname when he became an actor.&lt;ref name="60mins"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/shirley-maclaines-recent-lives/|title=Shirley MacLaine's Recent Lives|last=Kohn|first=David|author2=Mike Wallace |date=May 16, 2000|work=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate= January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their parents raised them as [[Baptist beliefs|Baptists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Warren_Beatty.html |title=The religion of Warren Beatty, actor, director|publisher=Adherents.com|date= August 30, 2005|accessdate= March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncle (her mother's brother-in-law) was [[A. A. MacLeod]], a Communist member of the Ontario legislature in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytZ7Nf7PxaAC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=%22uncle+Alex+MacLeod%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O49_VIq1OJf_yQSOvIK4Aw&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA |title=Warren Beatty: A Private Man |author=Suzanne Finstad |page=396 |website=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buw21mxhGp8C&amp;pg=PT288&amp;dq=%22uncle+Alex+MacLeod%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O49_VIq1OJf_yQSOvIK4Aw&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ |title=Star: The Life and Wild Times of Warren Beatty |author=Peter Biskind |website=Books.google.ca |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While MacLaine was still a child, Ira Beaty&lt;!-- spelling of Beaty here is correct --&gt; moved his family from Richmond to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], and then to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Waverly, Virginia|Waverly]], then back to Arlington eventually taking a position at Arlington's Thomas Jefferson Junior High School in 1945. MacLaine played baseball in an all-boys team, holding the record for most home runs, which earned her the nickname "Powerhouse". During the 1950s, the family resided in the [[Dominion Hills Historic District|Dominion Hills]] section of Arlington.&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CPHD/ons/hp/file84027.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Dominion Hills Historic District|author1=Laura Trieschmann |author2=Paul Weishar |author3=Anna Stillner |last-author-amp=yes |date= May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a toddler, she had weak ankles and would fall over with the slightest misstep, so her mother decided to enroll her in ballet class at the Washington School of Ballet at the age of three.&lt;ref name="Denis1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Denis|first=Christopher |title=The films of Shirley MacLaine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwEvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=April 11, 2011|year=1980|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=978-0-8065-0693-7|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of her interest in performing. Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually, she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in ''[[Cinderella (Prokofiev)|Cinderella]]''; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but then tightened the ribbons on her toe shoes and proceeded to dance the role all the way through before calling for an ambulance. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique. She explained that she didn't have the ideal body type, lacking the requisite "beautifully constructed feet" of high arches, high insteps and a flexible ankle.&lt;ref name="MacLaine1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=MacLaine|first=Shirley| title=My Lucky Stars: A Hollywood Memoir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSKjB8WWKoIC |accessdate=April 11, 2011|date=November 1, 1996|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-553-57233-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also slowly realizing ballet's propensity to be too all-consuming, and ultimately limiting, she moved on to other forms of dancing, acting and musical theater.

She attended [[Washington-Lee High School]], where she was on the cheerleading squad and acted in school theatrical productions.

The summer before her senior year of high school, MacLaine went to New York City to try acting on Broadway, and had some success.{{clarify|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After she graduated, she returned and was in the dancing ensemble of the Broadway production of ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953–1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards became an understudy to actress [[Carol Haney]] in ''[[The Pajama Game]]''; in May 1954 Haney injured her ankle during a Wednesday matinee, and MacLaine replaced her.&lt;ref&gt;Finstad, Suzanne, ''Warren Beatty: A Private Man'' (2005, NY, Random House) page 106. The exact nature of Haney's injury - a sprain, a torn ligament, a break, a fracture - varies from source to source.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after, with Haney still injured, film producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] saw MacLaine's performance, and signed her to work for [[Paramount Pictures]].

MacLaine made her film debut in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955), for which she won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress]]. This was quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film ''[[Artists and Models]]'' (also 1955). Soon afterwards, she had a role in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). This was followed by ''[[Hot Spell (film)|Hot Spell]]'' and a leading role in ''[[Some Came Running (film)|Some Came Running]]'' (both 1958); for the latter film, she gained her first Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination. Her second Oscar nomination came two years later for ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), starring with [[Jack Lemmon]]. The film won five Oscars, including Best Director for [[Billy Wilder]]. She later said, "I thought I would win for ''The Apartment'', but then, [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had a tracheotomy." She starred in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1961), also starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[James Garner]], based on the play by [[Lillian Hellman]], and directed by [[William Wyler]]. She was again nominated, this time for ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon. [[Don Siegel]], her director on ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), said of her: "It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine, and has too much balls. She's very, very hard."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, ''Clint: The Life and Legend'' (1999), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of her success, she replaced [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''Irma la Douce'' and ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964). Other films from this period include ''[[Gambit (1966 film)|Gambit]]'' (1966), with [[Michael Caine]], and the film version of the musical ''[[Sweet Charity]]'' (1968), based on the script for [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]'s ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' released a decade earlier.

==Lawsuits==
MacLaine sued Hal Wallis{{when|date=August 2018}} over a contractual dispute, a suit that has been credited with ending the old-style studio [[Star system (filmmaking)|star system]] of actor management.&lt;ref&gt;''Hanrihan v. Parker'', 19 Misc. 2d 467, 469 (N.Y. Misc. 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, MacLaine sued [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] for breach of contract when the studio reneged on its agreement to star MacLaine in a film version of the musical ''[[Bloomer Girl]]'', to be filmed in Hollywood, offering her instead the female dramatic lead in a [[Western (genre)#Film|Western]] to be filmed in Australia. The case was decided in Maclaine's favor, and affirmed on appeal by the [[California Supreme Court]] in 1970; the case is often cited in law-school textbooks as a major example of employment-contract law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker v.

She has a strong interest in spirituality and [[metaphysics]], the central theme of some of her best-selling books, including ''[[Out on a Limb (book)|Out on a Limb]]'' and ''Dancing in the Light''. She has undertaken such forms of spiritual exploration as walking the [[Camino de Santiago|Way of St. James]], working with [[Chris Griscom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haederle|first=Michael|title=School Founder Listened to That Little Voice|date=February 6, 1992|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-06/news/vw-1977_1_summer-school|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practicing [[Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-maharishi6feb06,1,1158944.story |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|date= February 6, 2008 |accessdate= March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her well-known interest in [[New Age]] spirituality has also made its way into several of her films. In [[Albert Brooks]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991), the recently deceased lead characters, played by Brooks and [[Meryl Streep]], are astonished to find MacLaine introducing their past lives in the "Past Lives Pavilion". In ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]'' (1990), MacLaine sings a version of "I'm Still Here", with customized lyrics created for her by composer [[Stephen Sondheim]]. One of the lyrics was changed to "I'm feeling transcendental – am I here?" In the 2001 television movie ''[[These Old Broads]]'', MacLaine's character is a devotee of New Age spirituality.

Sho Baraka was introduced to hip hop at a young age. Living in Southern California during the height of gangsta rap presented its challenges to many youths, as well as Sho. In high school Sho and some friends from his neighborhood formed a rap group that began touring with major recording artists. But his life took a different turn after the rap group fizzled out and close friends were killed or incarcerated due to the gang life they led. He decided to heed his father's advice and apply to college, pursuing education instead of the streets. There he came into contact with [[Lecrae]] and [[Tedashii]] and eventually the [[116 Clique]] and [[Reach Records]] were formed.

==Leaving Reach Records and new website==
On April 13, 2011, [[Rapzilla]] posted a blog from Sho stating that he planned to leave Reach Records after four years and two albums with the label. Although he is leaving the Reach label, Sho said he would continue to be an artist with Reach booking and continue to do concert dates and events with the label through 2011. He would also be featured on Reach projects released through the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38/3056 |title=Sho Baraka's New Future - Leaving Reach Records |publisher=Rapzilla |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sho Baraka is now a part of the music &amp; art group High Society with [[Swoope]], J.R., &amp; Suzy Rock. Lewis announced that he will release a new album, ''Talented Xth'', on January 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horton|first=Chad|title=Sho Baraka 'Talented Xth' Album Cover &amp; Tracklisting|url=http://rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/5322-sho-baraka-talented-xth-album-cover-a-tracklisting|work=[[Rapzilla]]|accessdate=November 21, 2012|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2016, he signed with Christian hip-hop label, Humble Beast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humblebeast.com/news/shobaraka |title=Sho Baraka + Humble Beast |publisher=Humble Beast Records |date=June 14, 2016 |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singh Krora''' [[Misl]], alternatively as the '''Panjgarhia''' Misl, was founded ,&lt;ref name=SW7&gt;[http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/events/m-karorasinghia.html Singh Karora history]&lt;/ref&gt; first led by Sardar Karora Singh. It had a strength of 10,000 regular horsemen.

The Karorsinghia Misl was named after Sardar Karora Singh, of Barki village in [[Lahore District]]. He was [[Sandhu]] [[Jat]]. The founder of the ''jatha'' or band of warriors that subsequently acquired the size and power of a misl, was Sardar Sham Singh of Narli village in [[Amritsar District]] who had battled with the invading forces of [[Nadir Shah]] in 1739. He was succeeded by Karam Singh, an Uppal Khatri of the village of Panjgarh in [[Gurdaspur district]]. Karam Singh fell fighting against [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in January 1748 and was succeeded by Sardar Karora Singh.

Karora Singh confined his activities to the tract lying south of the Karigra hills in [[Hoshiarpur district]], and had seized several important towns such as [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Hariana]] and Sham Chaurasi before he died in 1761. [[Baghel Singh|Baghel Singh Dhariwal]], [[Jat sikh]], who succeeded Karora Singh as leader of the Karorsinghias, is celebrated in [[History of Sikhism|Sikh history]] as the conqueror of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Delhi]]. Baghel Singh arose from the village of Jhabal Kalan, in [[Amritsar]] district, to become a formidable force in the [[Sutlej]] region.

'''''The Tao of Pooh''''' is a book written by [[Benjamin Hoff]]. The book is intended as an introduction to the Eastern belief system of [[Taoism]] for Westerners. It [[allegory|allegorically]] employs the [[fictional character]]s of [[A. A. Milne]]'s ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' stories to explain the basic principles of philosophical Taoism. Hoff later wrote ''[[The Te of Piglet]]'', a companion book.

==Background==
Hoff wrote the book at night and on weekends while working as a tree pruner in the [[Portland Japanese Garden]] in [[Washington Park, Portland|Washington Park]].&lt;ref name="nytpeace"/&gt;
[[Image:vinegar tasters.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional representation of "[[The vinegar tasters]]"]]

==Synopsis==
The book starts with a description of the [[vinegar tasters]], which is a painting portraying the three great eastern thinkers, [[Confucius]], the [[Buddha]], and [[Laozi]] over a vat of vinegar. Each tasting the vinegar of "life," Confucius finds it sour, the Buddha finds it bitter, but Laozi, the traditional founder of Taoism, finds it satisfying. Then the story unfolds backing up this analogy.

Hoff presents Winnie-the-Pooh and related others from [[A. A. Milne]]'s stories as characters that interact with him while he writes ''The Tao of Pooh'', but also quotes excerpts of their tales from Milne's actual books ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' and ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]],'' in order to exemplify his points. Hoff uses many of Milne's characters to symbolize ideas that differ from or accentuate Taoist tenets. [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] himself, for example, personifies the principles of ''[[Wu wei|wei wu wei]]'', the Taoist concept of "effortless doing," and ''[[p'u|pu]],'' the concept of being open to, but unburdened by, experience, and it is also a metaphor for natural human nature. In contrast, characters like Owl and Rabbit over-complicate problems, often [[Analysis paralysis|over-thinking to the point of confusion]], and [[Eeyore]] pessimistically complains and frets about existence, unable to just ''be''. Hoff regards Pooh's simpleminded nature, unsophisticated worldview and instinctive problem-solving methods as conveniently representative of the Taoist philosophical foundation. The book also incorporates translated excerpts from various prominent Taoist texts, from authors such as [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]].

==Reception==
The book was on the [[New York Times bestseller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]] for 49 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Official Website of Benjamin Hoff, author| url=http://www.benjaminhoffauthor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- can't find in archive of list: google query https://www.google.com/search?q=site:hawes.com+Benjamin+Hoff gives only "THE TE OF PIGLET"; --&gt;

[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).
{{Mary}}
All of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)

Many of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but which form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].

==Historical and cultural context==
{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}

There are several stories on the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php “Why does Mary have So Many Different Titles?”] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.&lt;/ref&gt; Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g. through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].

Mary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], help of the sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].&lt;ref&gt;Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as the [[Immaculate Conception]].

Mary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or "''devotional cult''" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion—which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church—would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.

The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g. via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].

Following the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.&lt;ref&gt;Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.

==Dogmatic titles==
* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (Divine and human).&lt;ref&gt;by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; This name was translated in the West as "Mater Dei" or Mother of God. From this derives the title "Blessed Mother".
* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. "Virgin Birth of Christ." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century "ever-virgin" became a popular title for Mary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&amp;f=false [[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults'', Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Variations on this include the "Virgin Mary", the "Blessed Virgin", the "Blessed Virgin Mary", and "Spouse of the Holy Spirit". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.
* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution [[Ineffabilis Deus]]. This gave rise to the titles of "Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception" and "Queen Conceived Without Original Sin". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),&lt;ref&gt;[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ "In Honor of Nuestra Señora de Guia", De AnDA (2009-11-22)],&lt;/ref&gt; [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.
*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heaven was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles "Our Lady of Assumption" and "Queen Assumed Into Heaven" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.

==Early titles of Mary==
“Our Lady” is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called "Notre Dame" and in Spanish she is "Nuestra Señora".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. "Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Mary was identified as the "[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100–165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html “Mary the New Eve,”] ''Frei Francisco''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.
* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].

==Latin America==
A number of titles of Mary found in Latin America pertain to cultic images of her represented in iconography identified with a particular already existent title adapted to a particular place. [[Our Lady of Luján]] in Argentina refers to a small terracotta image made in Brazil and sent to Argentina in May, 1630. Its appearance seems to have been inspired by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]]'s Immaculates. Our Lady of Copacabana (Bolivia): is a figure related to devotion to Mary under the title "[[Virgin of Candelaria|Most Blessed Virgin de la Candelaria]], Our Lady of Copacabana".

'''Yab-yum''' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] literally, "father-mother") is a common symbol in the [[Tibetan art|Buddhist art]] of [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], and [[Tibet]]. It represents the primordial union of wisdom and compassion, depicted as a male [[deity]] in union with his female consort. The male figure represents [[Karuṇā|compassion]] and [[Upaya|skillful means]], while the female partner represents [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]].

==Origins==
The symbolism is associated with [[Anuttarayoga tantra]] and, while there are various interpretations of the symbolism in [[twilight language]], the male figure is usually linked to compassion (''{{IAST|karuṇā}}'') and skillful means (''[[upaya|upāya-kauśalya]]''), while the female partner to "wisdom" (''prajñā'').&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien. (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'',  p. 338. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriousseekers.com/News%20and%20Articles/pallis_marriagewisdommethod.pdf The Marriage of Wisdom and Method] By Marco Pallis&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism the masculine form is active, representing the compassion and skillful means (''[[upaya]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/618636/upaya upaya] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;) that have to be developed in order to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. The feminine form is passive and represents wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]''), which is also necessary to enlightenment. United, the figures symbolize the union necessary to overcome the veils of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], the false duality of object and subject.

These figures are frequently worked in the shape of [[murti|statues]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.exoticindiaart.com/brass/paramasukhachakrasamvara_and_vajravarahi_zj03.jpg Paramasukha-Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[relief]]s, or are painted on [[thangka]]s. Yab-yum may also be represented through the [[aniconic]] signification of [[yantra]] and [[mandala]].

===Tibetan Buddhism===
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the same ideas are to be found concerning the [[bell (instrument)|bell]] and the [[dorje]], which, like the yab-yum, symbolize the dualism that must be exceeded. The sacred [[Tantra|Tantric]] practice leads to rapid development of mind by using the experience of bliss, [[non-duality]], and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] while in [[wiktionary:communion|communion]] with one's consort, either visualized, or in the case of advanced practitioners, in some cases physical. In one an important Anuttarayoga text, where [[Tilopa]] expounds the meaning to [[Naropa]], it says: 

''"When you rely on a consort, the wisdom of empty bliss will arise, so enter into union—the blessing of method and wisdom. Bring it down slowly, retain it, reverse it, and draw it back up. Bring it to the places in the body and let it spread throughout. When you remain free of desire, the wisdom of empty bliss will appear."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturalawareness.net/ganges.html|title=Natural Awareness: Mahamudra texts|website=www.naturalawareness.net|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicating the advanced nature of the actual practice with consort, the verses are the last in what is already widely considered as a text for the most advanced practitioners, a fact clearly evident in the story about Naropa's receiving the teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namsebangdzo.com/Life_of_Tilopa_p/11450.htm|title=Life of Tilopa &amp; The Ganges Mahamudra Thrangu Rinpoche|website=www.namsebangdzo.com|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Hinduism===
[[File:Kali and Bhairava in Union.jpg|thumb|Bhairava and Kali in union.]]
In [[Hinduism]] the yab-yum has a slightly different meaning. There, the embraced posture represents the [[divinity|divine]] strength of creation. The Hindu concept is the one of a passive masculine deity embracing his spouse called [[shakti]], which represents his activity or power. The iconic yab-yum of [[Chakrasamvara]]-[[Vajravarahi]] is directly influenced from the Hinduist depiction of [[Kali]] and [[Bhairava]] in union.

==Sadhana==
The symbolism of union and sexual polarity is a central teaching in [[Tantric Buddhism]], especially in Tibet. The union is realised by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann-Pfandt, Adelheid. "Yab Yum Iconography and the Role of Women in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism." ''The Tibet Journal''. Vol. XXII, No. 1. Spring 1997, pp. 12-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tantric practice, Yab-yum is akin to the [[Karmamudrā]] or "actionseal". This is the tantric yoga involving a physical partner. However, the aim of the practice is to control one's [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)|winds]]. This sadhana is part of the [[completion stage]].

{{Religious text primary|date=February 2018}}
'''Yāna'''  ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]]: "vehicle") refers to a mode or method of spiritual practice in [[Buddhism]], and in particular to divisions of various [[schools of Buddhism]] according to their type of practice.

==Nomenclature, etymology and orthography==
In form, '''yāna''' is a neuter noun derived from the Sanskrit root '''yā-''' meaning to "go to" or "move" or "reach". The suffix employed to form this noun may have different values: while primarily yāna is understood to refer to the means (kara.na) through which one goes to/ reaches a location, it may technically also refer to the action itself (bhāva). Yāna is therefore primarily a "vehicle", in most contexts relevant to the Buddhist doctrine of three yānas.

"Vehicle" is often used as a preferred translation as the word that provides the least in the way of presuppositions about the mode of travel.

In specifically Buddhist contexts, the word '''yāna''' acquires many metaphorical meanings, discussed below.

==Teaching story and metaphor==
&lt;!-- "Merit (Buddhism)#Merit and Nirvana" linked here --&gt;

In the ''[[Mahāparinibbāna Sutta]]'' (1.33-34), [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] relates a story on ''vehicles'' of conveyance utilizing the sacred river [[Ganges]], all of which may be engaged as a [[metaphor]] for ''yana'' and a gradual or direct path:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1.33     And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the river was so full that a crow could drink out of it. And some people were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.&lt;br /&gt;
1.34     And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat, looking for a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. And seeing their intentions, he uttered this verse on the spot:
::'When they want to cross the sea, the lake or pond,
::People make a bridge or raft - the wise have crossed already.'&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Walshe (1995). ''The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications, "[DN] 16: ''{{IAST|Mahāparinibbāna Sutta}}'': The Great Passing, The Buddha's Last Days," pp. 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Buddhist countries throughout Southeast Asia and the Himalaya, the crow is sacred as it voices the sacred syllable "Ah". The crow drinks of the river which is a metaphor for the continuum of mind, the [[mindstream]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These two verses are meant to teach that all vehicles, teachings and doctrine are skillful means (Skt.''[[upāya]]'').

==Introduction and qualification of the term yana==
The ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa]]'' of [[Atisha]] (980-1054 CE), quoted in [[Gampopa]]'s (1079-1153 CE) ''Jewel Ornament of Liberation''&lt;ref&gt;Dam chos yid bźin nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan&lt;/ref&gt; rendered into English by [[Herbert Guenther|Günther]], makes reference to people of three capacities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Man is to be known in three ways:&lt;br /&gt;
As inferior, mediocre and excellent.&lt;ref&gt;Sgam-po-pa (author) Guenther, Herbert V. (trans) (1959, 1986).  ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation''. Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications., Inc. {{ISBN|1-570-62614-6}}(pbk.) p.17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He who by any means whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;
Provides for the pleasures of Saṃsāra&lt;br /&gt;
For himself alone,&lt;br /&gt;
Is called an inferior man.&lt;ref name="Sgam-po-pa 1959, p.18"&gt;Sgam-po-pa (author) Guenther, Herbert V. (trans) (1959, 1986).  ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation''. Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications., Inc. {{ISBN|1-570-62614-6}}(pbk.) p.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He who turns his back to the pleasures of the world&lt;br /&gt;
And abstains from evil deeds,&lt;br /&gt;
But provides only for his own peace,&lt;br /&gt;
Is called a mediocre man.&lt;ref name="Sgam-po-pa 1959, p.18" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He who seriously wants to dispel&lt;br /&gt;
All the misery of others,&lt;br /&gt;
Because in the stream of his own being he has understood the nature of misery,&lt;br /&gt;
Is an excellent man.&lt;ref name="Sgam-po-pa 1959, p.18" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yana is determined by capacity and propensity of the "precious human body" wrought by [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]], not by a specific teaching or lineage, as Gampopa states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Therefore, because of the difficulty of its attainment, of the uneasiness of its breaking down, and of its great usefulness, we should think of the body as a boat and by its means escape from the ocean of Saṃsāra. As is written:
:Standing in the boat of the human body,
:You should cross the great flood of misery.
:Since later this boat is difficult to get,
:Do not sleep now, you fool.&lt;ref&gt;Sgam-po-pa (author) Guenther, Herbert V. (trans) (1959, 1986).  ''The Jewel Ornament of Liberation''. Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala Publications., Inc. {{ISBN|1-570-62614-6}}(pbk.) p.19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Empowerment]], [[initiation]], intention and endeavour may leaven capacity and propensity as may a [[wiktionary:grace|grace]]ful [[benediction]] of a person (in the sense of [[mindstream]]), object or place endowed or invested with holiness. In the teaching story abovementioned, Shakyamuni Buddhi and his sangha traverse the continuum directly in the body&lt;ref&gt;'Body' is to be read as [[Trikaya]].&lt;/ref&gt; of their own experience rather than constructing a gradual vehicle for passage.

==Usage==
In [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], both ''yāna'' and [[Four Noble Truths|''mārga'']] (road or path) are [[metaphor]]s depicting spiritual practice as a path or journey. Ancient texts in both religions discuss doctrines and practices associated with various ''yānas''. In Buddhism, ''yāna'' often expands the metaphor of the spiritual path with the idea of various vehicles that convey a person along that path. The ''yāna / mārga'' metaphor pervasive within Buddhism and other traditions is an analogue to the Chinese metaphor of the [[Tao]]: The Tao though is the Way as the endgoal and not just the art of wayfinding. The dialogic spiritual traditions of Indian and Chinese culture hold common cultural [[meme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Paharada Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/45.18-Paharada-S-a8.19-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 May 2015|quote=Paharada, just as the great ocean slopes gradually, slides gradually, inclines gradually, not abruptly7 like a precipice, so, too, Paharada, in this Dharma-Vinaya, the training is gradual, the task is gradual, the way is gradual—there is no sudden penetration of final knowledge at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abe|first1=Masao|title=A Study of Dogen: His Philosophy and Religion|date=1992|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791494080|page=30|quote=In other words, Dogen's view of the oneness of practice and attainment, that is, the ever-circulating way of continuous practice...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trungpa|first1=Chogyam|title=The Tantric Path of Indestructible Wakefulness|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=9781590308042|quote=...invite the Indian teacher Kamalashila to Tibet in order to debate with the Chinese Ch'an master, Hashang Mahayana.

==Vedic origins of ''-yāna'' as a spiritual journey==
The use of ''yāna'' to use as a name or to refer to a spiritual journey may date to the [[Rig Veda|''{{IAST|Ṛgveda}}'']], possibly composed circa 1500 BCE, whose 10th Mandala makes several references to ''devayāna'', (translators usually render this as the "path of the gods" or similar) and one reference to ''{{IAST|pitṛyāna}}'' ("path of the fathers"). The first verse of the {{IAST|Ṛgveda}}'s burial hymn (10.18) translates approximately as "O Death, take the other path, which is distinct from the way of the gods" (''{{IAST|paraṃ mṛtyo anu parehi panthāṃ yaste sva itaro devayānāt}}''). The "other path" is the ''{{IAST|pitṛyāna}}'', referred to in hymn 10.2 and alluded to in 10.14 and 10.16.

The ''devayāna'' and ''{{IAST|pitṛyāna}}'' evolved from the ancient Rig Vedic concern for [[immortality]] to the classical [[Hindu]] concern with ending [[samsara|{{IAST|saṃsāric}}]] existence. The [[Upanishads|{{IAST|Upaniṣads}}]], which comment on the [[Vedas]], make further reference to ''devayāna'' and ''{{IAST|pitṛyāna}}''. Among other distinctions, the pitryana was said to refer the religious practices of villagers, and the devayāna was said to refer to the practices of recluses living in the forest. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20060209031402/http://sanskrit.gde.to/doc_upanishhat/brinew-proofed.itx {{IAST|Bṛhadaraṇyaka Upaniṣad}}] (II.iv.11 and IV.v.12) also makes reference to [[ekayana|''ekayāna'']], notably in the phrase ''{{IAST|vedānāṃ [[saraswati|vāk]] ekayānam}}'', where ''ekayānam'' [[connotation|connotes]] "one journey". The phrase translates approximately to " Sacred Vedas -  intonation - (is the) one journey/destination", in the same sense that a river's journey is to the ocean.

==Yāna in early Buddhist texts==
Yāna is one of ten suggested gifts ([[Dana (Buddhism)|''dana'']]) that a lay person can appropriately give a monk or recluse, in the sense of providing a vehicle or transportation (e.g., see DN 7.33/PTS: A iv 59 and DN 10.177/PTS: A v 269).

The earliest explicit Buddhist use of -yāna in a metaphorical sense of a journey to [[bodhi|awakening]] may be the term ''dhammayānam'', "[[dharma]] chariot" (SN IV.4), where the vehicle itself serves as an extended metaphor for the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eightfold Path]]. Various parts of the chariot represent aspects of the Path (''magga''), e.g. axles represent meditation, the charioteer represents mindfulness, and so on.

Thus, metaphorical usage of yāna in the sense of a vehicle (as distinct from a path) emerged from a Buddhist context, and it did so relatively early in the evolution of Buddhism. Nevertheless, while the Pali Canon are very rich in images of wheels (''cakka'') and paths (''magga'') as metaphors for the journey to awakening, the Pali Canon rarely uses the term ''yāna'' for that purpose.

According to Fujita Kotatsu the term Three Vehicles does not occur in the Pâli tripitaka, however corresponding terms (''trîni yânâni'', ''triyâna'', ''yânatraya'') are used in the [[Ekottara Agama]], the [[Mahavastu]], and the [[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra]]. In these texts the Three Vehicles include the ''srâvakayâna'', ''pratyekabuddhayâna'', and ''buddhayâna''.&lt;ref name="Kotatsu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kotatsu|first1=Fujita|last2=Hurvitz|first2=Leon , trans.|title=One Vehicle or Three?|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|date=1975|volume=3|issue=1/2|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enumeration of ''yānas'' in Mahayana texts==
Mahayana texts are very rich in images of vehicles that serve in metaphors for journeys to awakening.

===The three carts of expedient means: the parable of the burning house===
The tradition of [[Mahayana]] texts employing the image of different types of vehicles and conveyances as salient metaphor for the journey of novice to the awakening of adept may have begun with the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]''. The Lotus Sūtra holds a parable of a devoted father with three small children entranced in childhood play within the family home, oblivious that tongues of flame are ravenously engulfing the house. The father entices the children from the burning home with the half-truth gilded promise of special carts for each of them. The carts though are only an expedient means for luring the children from the house.

Katō ''et al.'' render thus into English a tract of the ''[[Saddharma Puṇḍarīka]]'' pertaining to the cart of expedient means and the parable of the burning house:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Śāriputra! Even as that elder, though with power in body and arms, yet does not use it but only by diligent tact resoutely saves &lt;nowiki&gt;[his]&lt;/nowiki&gt; children from the calamity of the burning house and then gives each of them great carts made of precious things, so it is with the Tathāgata; though he has power and fearlessness, he does not use them, but only by his wise tact does he remove and save all living creatures from the burning house of the triple world, preaching the three vehicles: the śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and Buddha vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Katō, Bunnō (translator); revised by: Soothill, W. E.; Schiffer, Wilhelm; Tamura, Yoshirō (1975, 2004). 'The Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Law' (Saddharma-Puṇḍarīka; Myōhō-Renge-Kyō) in:  Katō, Bunnō; Tamura, Yoshirō; and Miyasaka, Kōjirō; with revisions by: Soothill, W.E.; Schiffer, Wilhelm; and Del Campana, Pier P. (1975, 2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124924/http://www.rk-world.org/publications/ThreefoldLotusSutra.pdf ''The Threefold Lotus Sutra]: Innumerable Meanings, The Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Law, and Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue. Tokyo: Kosei Publishing Co. {{ISBN|4-333-00208-7}}, p.&amp;nbsp;89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the parable, the carts are explicitly identified as corresponding to the [[three types of Buddha]]: the goat-cart represents the practices leading to the attainment of [[Arhat]]ship; the deer-cart, [[Pratyekabuddha]]hood; and the bullock-cart, [[Samyaksambuddha]]hood. The sutra goes on to say these that the teachings of the three vehicles are merely expedient means ([[Upaya|upāya]]). Their purpose is to direct people toward ''ekayāna'', the one vehicle, depicted in the parable as a jeweled cart driven by a white ox.

===The relationship of Dharma (Law) and Yana===
Tamura ''et al.'' render a section of the ''[[Innumerable Meanings Sutra]]'' (Wu-liang-i ching) that relates the relationship of the Law (Dharma) and various teachings as fundamentally determined by the audience and context:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Good sons! The Law is like water that washes off dirt. As a well, a pond, a stream, a river, a valley stream, a ditch, or a great sea, each alike effectively washes off all kinds of dirt, so the Law-water effectively washes off the dirt of all delusions of living beings.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Good sons! The nature of water is one, but a stream, a river, a well, a pond, a valley stream, a ditch, and a great sea are different from one another. The nature of the Law is like this. There is equality and no differentiation in washing off the dirt of delusions, but the three laws, the four merits, and the two ways&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; are not one and the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Good sons! Though each washes equally as water, a well is not a pond, a pond is not a stream or a river, nor is a valley stream or a ditch a sea. As the Tathāgata, the world's hero, is free in the Law, all the laws preached by him are also like this. Though preaching at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end all alike effectively wash off the delusions of living beings, the beginning is not the middle, and the middle is not the end. Preaching at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end are the same in expression but different from one another in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tamura, Yoshirō (translator); revised by: Schiffer, Wilhelm; and Del Campana, Pier P. (1975, 2004). 'The Sutra of Innumerable Meanings' (Wu-liang-i-ching-hsü) in:  Katō, Bunnō; Tamura, Yoshirō; and Miyasaka, Kōjirō; with revisions by: Soothill, W.E.; Schiffer, Wilhelm; and Del Campana, Pier P. (1975, 2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124924/http://www.rk-world.org/publications/ThreefoldLotusSutra.pdf ''The Threefold Lotus Sutra]: Innumerable Meanings, The Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Law, and Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue. Tokyo: Kosei Publishing Co. {{ISBN|4-333-00208-7}}. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

§ The three laws are the Four Noble Truths, the Twelve Causes, and the Six Pāramitās...; the four merits are srota-āpanna, sakṛdāgāmin, anāgāmin, and arhat...; and the two ways the Great-vehicle, or Mahayana, and the lesser vehicle, or Hinayana.

===Ekayāna (one yana)===

Mahayana texts such as the [[Lotus Sutra]] and the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]] sought to unite all the different teachings into a single great way. These texts serve as the inspiration for using the term ''[[Ekayāna]]'' in the sense of "one vehicle". This "one vehicle" became a key aspect of the doctrines and practices of [[Tiantai]] and [[Tendai]] Buddhist sects, which subsequently influenced [[Chán]] and [[Zen]] doctrines and practices. In [[Japan]], the one-vehicle teaching of the Lotus Sutra also inspired the formation of the [[Nichiren]] sect.

===Two yānas===
Traditionally, the '''two vehicles''' in [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhism]] consist of [[Śrāvakayāna]] and [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]]. Mahāyāna Buddhists take a vow to become the third type, namely [[bodhisattvas]]. Therefore, Mahayana Buddhist texts sometimes use terms like "followers of the two vehicles" to refer to Buddhists who do not accept the Mahayana sutras.

Some Mahāyāna sutras consider that the two vehicles together comprise the ''[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]'' – literally, inferior vehicle; sometimes, small vehicle. Modern texts sometimes refer to Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna as "two vehicles". But referring to an "inferior vehicle" is often felt to be disrespectful to those Buddhists who do not consider the Mahāyāna sutras to be ''[[buddhavacana]]''.

In [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]]/[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism [[Sutrayana|Sūtrayāna]] and [[Tantrayana|Tantrayāna]]

===Three yānas===
Mahāyāna Buddhists often express two different schemata of three yanas. First, here are three paths to liberation that culminate as one of the [[three types of Buddha]]:

*[[Śrāvakayāna]]: The Hearer vehicle: A path that meets the goals of an [[arhat]] who achieves liberation after listening to the teachings of a [[samyaksambuddha]] (fully enlightened buddha).
*[[Pratyekabuddhayāna]]: The [[Pratyekabuddha]] achieves liberation, but does not teach other beings. Pratyekabuddhas do not depend on a teacher and can discover the Dharma even if they do not encounter a buddha. They are sometimes said to remain silent and solitary.
*[[Bodhisattvayāna]]: The bodhisattva attains liberation and wishes to benefit as many beings as possible. A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a samyaksambuddha. A samyaksambuddha can establish the Dharma and lead disciples to enlightenment.

A second classification came into use with the rise of the Vajrayāna, which created a hierarchy of the teachings with the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] being the highest path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trungpa|first1=Chogyam|title=The Tantric Path of Indestructible Wakefulness|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=9781590308042|page=27|quote=The vajrayana is an extension of the mahayana ... first you should become accomplished on the hinayana level ... begin to understand innate buddha nature ... qualified to listen to the teachings of the ultimate result in the vajrayana.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vajrayāna itself became multilayered especially in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

* [[Sutrayana|Hīnayāna]]
* [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]
* [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]]

===Four yānas===
Mahayana Buddhists sometimes refer to four yanas that subsume the two different schemes of the three yanas:
* [[Śrāvakayāna]]
* [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]]
* [[Mahāyāna]]
* [[Vajrayāna]]

===Five yānas===
This is a Mahāyāna list which is found in East Asian Buddhism.

* Puruṣayāna - the human vehicle. This is the very beginning of the spiritual path
* Devayāna - the practice of ethics and meditation
* [[Śrāvakayāna]] - the practice of renunciation and the [[Four Noble Truths]]
* [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]] - practice concerned with dependent arising (''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'')
* [[Bodhisattvayāna]] - practice of the [[Six Perfections]]

===Six yānas===
The five yānas plus the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]]. This schema is associated with [[Shingon Buddhism]] in [[Japan]]. It was invented by [[Kūkai]] in order to help to differentiate the Vajrayāna teachings that he imported from [[China]] in the early 9th century. Kūkai wanted to show that the new teachings were entirely new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse|last=Abé|first=Ryûichi|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780231528870|location=|pages=196|quote=In short, Kukai presents his transmission as unique and in sharp contrast to all the other forms of Buddhist teaching known to the Buddhist communities of early Heian society under the conventional classifications of yanas as described in Mahayana texts: the "three vehicles" (Skt. triyana; Jpn. sanjo), the three separate teachings prepared by Sakyamuni Buddha for the sravaka (sravaka-yana) and the pratyekabuddhas (pratyekabuddha-yana) and the bodhisattvas (bodhisattva-yana); the "five vehicles" (Skt. panca-yana; Jpn. gojo), the expanded version of the three vehicles with the addition of the teachings for humans (manusa-yana) and for celestial denizaens (deva-yana) by the Sakyamuni Buddha; and the "Buddha vehicle" (Skt. buddha-yana; Jpn. butsujo) expounded by a Buddha of Nirmanakaya or Sambhogakaya manifestation to communicate his enlightenment to other Buddhas and advanced bodhisattvas destined to attain Buddhahood. In the Tendai (T'ien-t'ai) and Kegon (Hua-yen) doctrines, the Buddha vehicle is often identified with the "one unifying vehicle" (Skt. ekayana; Jpn. ichijo), the ultimate Mahayana that integrates within itself all the three and five vehicles. Kukai, however, presents his transmission not even as the ekayana; his transmission defies all these categorizations within the established framework of Hinayana and Mahayana; it has to be classified as a new category, that of the Vajrayana, the lightning-fast vehicle for those who are endowed with the Dharmakaya's adamantine vajra-like quality of enlightenment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nine yānas===
The [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] has nine yanas, a list made by combining the first type of three yanas, and adding the six classes of [[tantras]].
*[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]
** 1. [[Śrāvakayāna]]
** 2. [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]]
* Mahāyāna '' consisting of:''
** 3. [[Bodhisattvayāna]]
** Vajrayāna,'' consisting of:''
*** ''Outer Tantras''
**** 4. [[Kriyatantra]]
**** 5. [[Upatantra]] ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] spyod rgyud) ‘practice tantra’ and the Ubhayatantra (gnyis ka’i rgyud), ‘dual tantra’, because it practices the view of the next vehicle, Yogatantra, together with the action of the former.
**** 6. [[Yogatantra]]
***''Inner Tantras''
**** 7. [[Mahayoga|Mahāyoga]]
**** 8. [[Anuyoga]]
****9. [[Atiyoga]] (also [[Dzogchen]])

The head of the Nyingma school, [[Dudjom Rinpoche]] emphasizes the eight lower vehicles are intellectually fabricated and contrived:

{{quote|"The eight lower levels have intellectually fabricated and contrived that which is changeless solely due to fleeting thoughts that never experience what truly is. They apply antidotes to and reject that which is not to be rejected. They refer to as flawed that in which there is nothing to be purified, with a mind that desires purification. They have created division with respect to that which cannot be obtained by their hopes and fears that it can be obtained elsewhere. And they have obscured wisdom, which is naturally present, by their efforts in respect to that which is free from effort and free from needing to be accomplished. Therefore, they have had no chance to make contact with genuine, ultimate reality as it is (rnal ma'i de kho na nyid)."&lt;ref&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche. ''Wisdom Nectar''. Snow Lion 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Twelve yānas===
Another schema associated with Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna sources:

# [[Shravakayana|Śrāvakayāna]]
# [[Pratyekabuddha|Pratyekabuddhayāna]]
# [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattvayāna]]
# [[Kriyayoga]]
# [[Charyayoga]] (or [[Upayoga]])
# [[Yogatantra]]
# [[Mahayoga]]
# [[Anuyoga]]
# [[Atiyoga]]&lt;ref&gt;The Sanskrit "Atiyoga" may be rendered as "primordial" (''ati'') "communion" (''yoga'') and is also known by the Sanskrit: [[Mahāsandhiyoga]] and in Tibetan: ''Dzogpa Chenpo'' and often rendered as [[Dzogchen]] in English.&lt;/ref&gt;
## [[Semde]]
## [[Longde (Dzogchen)|Longde]]
## [[Mengagde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Masters of Meditation and Miracles: Lives of the Great Buddhist Masters of India and Tibet|last=Thondup|first=Tulku|publisher=Shambhala Publications|year=1999|isbn=9780834824829|location=|pages=35|quote=Atiyoga itself has three divisions: Semde, Longde, and Me-ngagde.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zashiki-warashi''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{lang|ja|座敷童子}} or {{lang|ja|座敷童}}, "guestroom child"), sometimes also called ''Zashiki Bokko'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|座敷ぼっこ}}, "guestroom basker"), are spirit-like beings told about mostly in the [[Iwate Prefecture]].{{sfn|Takayuki|1996|pp=173–174}} They are said to be gods that live in ''zashiki'' storage rooms,&lt;ref name="渡辺"&gt;{{Harvnb|渡辺他|1987|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they would perform pranks, and those that see one would be visited with good fortune. There are also legends of how they would bring fortune to families. They are also known from [[Kunio Yanagita]]'s ''Tōno Monogatari'', ''Ishigami Mondō'', and stories about them appear in the 17th and 18th chapters of the ''Tōno Monogatari'' and the 87th chapter titled "Zashiki-warashi" of the ''Tōno Monogatari Shūi'', and in this 17th chapter it is written "families with whom this god dwells are freely able to prosper at will" (''kono kami no yadoritamafu ihe ha fūki jizai nari to ifu koto nari'') and "''zashiki-warashi'' are also called {{lang|ja|座敷童衆}}". In recent years, they are also known from television programs and magazines that reported about various Iwate Prefecture ryokan where it is said to be possible to see a ''zashiki-warashi'' such as the [[Ryokufūsō]], the Sugawara Bekkan, and the Warabe.

It is similar to the Russian folk story of the [[Domovoi]].

==Concept==
Reports have mostly been in the Iwate Prefecture, but there are also some scattered across the [[Aomori Prefecture]], the [[Miyagi Prefecture]], the [[Akita Prefecture]], and others in the [[Tōhoku region]].

Generally they have a red face, hair that hangs down, and have the appearance of that of a child about 5 or 6 in age, but this age is also said to vary depending on the house that they settle in, with examples ranging from a minimum of around 3 years in age and a maximum of around 15 years in age.&lt;ref name="村上他"&gt;{{Harvnb|村上他|2008|pp=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a [[Bob cut]] hair or very short cropped hair. Both male and females ones have been seen, and the male ones are said to wear blackish clothes with a [[kasuri]] or [[Stripe (pattern)|striped]] pattern, and the females ones are said to wear a red chanchanko, [[kosode]], and sometimes a [[furisode]].&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt; It is also said that there are some whose appearance is unclear, making their gender unknown.&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt; Sometimes multiple would settle in a house at once, like a boy and a girl. There are also some legends that tell ones that look like a black beast, as well as ones that look like a warrior.&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt;

They like causing mischief, so they are said to leave ash or bleaching powder on top of little footprints and at night time, they are said to make sounds like that of a revolving [[spinning wheel]], and they would also make sounds in an inner room making sounds like that of a kagura performance. There are also tales told about how when someone in the family is sewing alone, there would be sounds similar to the rustling of papers or someone snorting, etc., and when the wooden door is opened there would be no one there. It is also said that at night, they would do pranks such as riding on top of guest room futons and turning over the pillows in order to not let the person sleep, and when attempts are made to stop it, it would be too strong and powerful for anyone to even affect its actions.&lt;ref name="渡辺" /&gt; Sometimes they also play with children.&lt;ref name="渡辺" /&gt;

In Iwate, there are legends of how the zashiki-warashi of a shrine at [[Mount Hayachine|Hayachine]] would follow a shrine visitor who came from afar and follow them into different lands. There is also legends of how the zashiki-warashi would teach the nursery rhyme of Iwate to the children of those lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=怪談レストラン編集委員会・[[松谷みよ子]]責任編集|title=座敷わらしレストラン|year=2007|publisher=[[童心社]]|series=[[怪談レストラン]]|isbn=978-4-494-01373-9|pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gonohe, Aomori|Gonohe]], [[Aomori Prefecture]], there is a legend of how when a new house is built, a zashiki-warashi can be called into it by burying a golden ball under the floors.{{Sfn|多田|1990|p=275}}

There are also theories about how they cannot be seen by anyone other than members of the family or how they can only be seen by children but not adults. There are stories about how when adults counted children, there would be 1 more person than there was originally, but as adults do not understand what zashiki-warashi are, they would not know who is the extra person. Stories like these also frequently appear as themes in literature.&lt;ref name="多田"&gt;{{Harvnb|多田|1990|pp=256–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to family prosperity==
An example of a very characteristic [[Folk religion|folk belief]] about how families with a ''zashiki-warashi'' would prosper and families whose ''zashiki-warashi'' have gone away would decline. This aspect shows that ''zashiki-warashi'' are like gods of fortune or [[Spirit guide|protective spirits]] that rule over a family's prosperity and decline.&lt;ref name="多田" /&gt;&lt;ref name="真野"&gt;{{Harvnb|真野他|1980|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tōno Monogatari]]'', there are tales such as one telling about how a family was wiped out by [[foodborne illness]] after its ''zashiki-warashi'' left it and another tale about how in the Iide section of the village of Tsuchibuchi, [[Iwate Prefecture]] (now part of the city of [[Tōno, Iwate|Tōno]]), a wealthy family's ''zashiki-warashi'' was shot by a kid with a bow and arrow causing it to leave the family and since then the family's fortunes declined.{{Sfn|柳田|1910|pp=23-25}} There is also the view that the way families would decline after a ''zashiki-warashi'' leaves it and the way families would prosper after a ''[[binbōgami]]'' leaves it are related.&lt;ref name="三浦"&gt;{{Harvnb|三浦他|1992|pp=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the theory that a white ''zashiki-warashi'' is a sign of good things to come and the sight of a red one (with a red face, red clothes, and a red bucket in its hands) is a sign that a ''zashiki-warashi'' would leave the family leading to bad things to come. There are also examples where a family that saw a red-clothed one all died from foodborne illness.&lt;ref name="杉山"&gt;{{Harvnb|杉山他|2008|pp=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs==
''Zashiki-warashi'' are there in inner guestrooms (''zashiki''), and their existence is said to have an effect on the direction the family goes in, so there are some families that treat them hospitably and offer them meals every day. They are said to like ''azuki meshi'', so there are families that offer some ''azuki meshi'' every day, and if it is not eaten, it is said to be an omen for the family's decline.&lt;ref name="多田" /&gt; ''Zashiki-warashi'' generally work the same way as having kitsune or having [[inugami]], but the difference between them and ''zashiki-warashi'' is that for a ''zashiki-warashi'' to live there is never considered a nuisance, and in fact they are even protected as  gods, and a family that has a zashiki-warashi is usually treated by other people around with respect.

In the area around the city of [[Ninohe, Iwate|Ninohe]], there is a custom of making up a room with desserts and toys left inside for a child who had died or were killed as infants (infanticide), and giving worship to this child, a custom that remains to the present day, and there is also a custom of making a room that a child would like in order to make a ''zashiki-warashi'' stay at the house in order to bring the family to prosperity.&lt;ref name="杉山" /&gt;

According to the ''Tonō Monogatari'', the house of a certain wealthy family in the town of Tsuchibuchi had a small space that was called the "Zatō room", and it is considered to be the room that would be used to await the Zatō (a kind of member of the build persons' guild such as the [[tōdōza]] or a ranking of members of related groups such as the [[Anma]], [[moxibustion]] practitions, and members of the ''[[biwa hōshi]]'', among other organizations) every time a banquet was called in the past,&lt;ref name="柳田"&gt;{{Harvnb|柳田|1910|pp=48–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literary researcher [[Sukeyuki Miura]] surmises that perhaps this room was used to give worship to the god's protective spirit.&lt;ref name="三浦" /&gt;

==Kinds==
''Zashiki-warashi'' have various regional names such as ''zashiki-warabe'' ({{lang|ja|座敷童}}), ''zashiki-warashi'' ({{lang|ja|座敷童衆}}), ''zashiki-bokko'' ({{lang|ja|座敷ぼっこ}}), ''okura-bokko'' ({{lang|ja|御蔵ボッコ}}), ''[[zashiki-kozō]]'' ({{lang|ja|座敷小僧}}), and karako-warashi. The name "zashiki-bokko" is used in the inland regions of Iwate, and this name was also used in the writings of [[Kenji Miyazawa]].&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt;

There are also regions and legends where ''zashiki-warashi'' have rankings, and in the ''[[Jippōan Yūreki Zakki]]'' ({{lang|ja|十方庵遊歴雑記}}), there can be statements seen about ''zashiki-warashi'' in the area of Inase, [[Esashi, Iwate|Esashi]], Iwate Prefecture (now Esashi District, [[Ōshū, Iwate|Ōshū]], and according to this, zashiki-warashi that are in a home's dirt floor room are called ''kometsuki-warashi'', ''notabariko'', ''usutsuriko'', among other names, and the white, most beautiful ''zashiki-warashi'' that is in the inner zashiki is called the ''chōpirako''.&lt;ref name="佐々木"&gt;{{Harvnb|佐々木|1973|pp=15–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, there are some that have no influence on the family's fortunes and instead merely move around the house making noises, and there are not merely a few that have been deemed creepy.&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt;

There are also some that have arms that are long and thin like vines, which they use to beckon people as well as warn of disasters like floods and tsunami, and these can be called ''hosode'' (細手, "thin arms") or ''hosode nagate'' (細手長手, "thin arms long arms").&lt;ref name="佐々木" /&gt; There is also a similar story telling of how "a poor man once threw firewood into the water, was invited into the dragon palace, and received as a gift an ugly-looking but fortune-bringing ''ryūkyū-warashi'' (dragon palace child)".{{attribution needed|date=April 2018}} There are also ''zashiki-warashi'' that stay in the [[Kura (storehouse)|dozō]], and they are called ''kura-warashi'' or ''kura-bokko'' (child of the storehouse).

According to the essay "Zashiki-warashi no Hanashi" ({{lang|ja|ザシキワラシの話}}, "Stories about Zashiki-warashi") by the folklorist [[Kizen Sasaki]], in a certain home in the aforementioned village of Tsuchibuchi, there is a ''kabukire-warashi'' (tree stump child) that lives in the "Mada no Ki" (meaning "Bodhi tree") that is said to take on the appearance of a child and sneak into the family's ''zashiki'' to perform pranks on the family's daughter, as well as take on an appearance with a red face and play on walnut trees where the tree splits into three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[佐々木喜善]]|year=1924|title=ザシキワラシの話|journal=郷土趣味|volume=5巻|issue=2号（通巻50号）|page=6|id={{NCID|AN00373399}}|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/0690201.shtml |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been interpreted to be a spirit of this Mada no Ki.{{Sfn|多田|1990|p=229}}

Despite there being many legends of the ''zashiki-warashi'' in the Tōhoku region, there are not so many only in [[Akita Prefecture]]. This is said to be because Akita has the ''[[sankichi oni]]'', so lower-class yōkai would not enter Akita.&lt;ref name="多田" /&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:Akinari Zeni-no-sei.jpg|thumb|The money spirit from the "Hinpuku-ron" story in the ''[[Ugetsu Monogatari]]'' by [[Ueda Akinari]]]]
As mentioned previously, Kizen Sasaki noted that perhaps they are the spirits of children who were crushed to death and buried at the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|others=[[志村有弘]]監修|title=図説 地図とあらすじで読む 日本の妖怪伝説|year=2008|publisher=[[青春出版社]]|isbn=978-4-413-00965-2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tōhoku region, infanticide was called ''usugoro'' ({{lang|ja|臼殺}}, or "mortar kill"), and it is said that children who were killed this way to reduce the number of mouths to feed would be killed by being crushed by a stone mortar and there was a custom of buring them not with a grave, but in the dirt floor room (''[[Machiya|doma]]'') or in the kitchen, and it is said that the spirits of such children would on rainy days walk around outer edges shaking frighting the guests, which is said to be seen to resemble deeds similar to that of a ''zashiki-warashi''.&lt;ref name="杉山" /&gt; The aforemtioned ''notabariko'' and ''usu-tsuki warashi'' are seen to be lower ranking among the ''zashiki-warashi'', and the former would peek out from the inner dirt floor (''doma'') room and crawl around while the latter would use a mortar to make a sound, and due to creepy acts such as this,&lt;ref name="佐々木" /&gt; it is sometimes suggested that these kinds of ''zashiki-warashi'' have a relation to the fact that that the location where the infantide happened is in the dirt floor (''doma'') room or underneath a mortar.&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt;

In addition to this relation to infanticide, the fact that the ''zashiki-warashi'' are in old homes as well as the fact that they are often told in relation to legends about how after a visiting Buddhist pilgrim from outside the village was killed, the family of the home came to ruin, so it has been suggested that these ''zashiki-warashi'' are signs of the dark undersides of the village's community.&lt;ref name="三浦" /&gt;

In the "Zashiki-warashi wo Mita Hitobito" ({{lang|ja|座敷わらしを見た人びと}}, "The People Who Saw Zashiki-Warashi") by the author [[Sadako Takahashi]], there are also stories about ''zashiki-warashi'' that came about as a curse that resulted from carpenters and tatami makers that weren't able to do their construction jobs in comfort, and it is said that there were rituals of taking a doll that had a bit of its wood peeled off and inserting them in between the pillars and beams.&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt;

There are also many theories that their true identity is that of a [[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]], and there are stories of ''zashiki-warashi'' being a kappa that lived in the depths who would rise up and go into a nearby home to do pranks, as well as stories of zashiki-warashi that were kappa that have settled into a home.{{Sfn|佐々木|1973|pp=65–67}}

Concerning why ''zashiki-warashi'' look like children, seeing how in Buddhism there are ''gōhō-warashi'' ([[Dharmapala|wrathful gods that protect Buddhism and take on the appearance of a child]]) have the appearance of a child, there is the theory that they come from [[folk religion|folk beliefs]] in how children connected gods and humans,&lt;ref name="真野" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|others=[[岩井宏實]]監修|title=日本の妖怪百科|year=2000|publisher=[[河出書房新社]]|volume=4|isbn=978-4-309-61384-0|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the theory that the appearance of a child embodies divinity.&lt;ref name="三浦" /&gt;

In Kunio Yanagita's view, just like the ''gōhō-warashi'' that were called forth from the heavens by high priests, the protective spirits of Buddhism and folk mikos are related to the faith in giving respect to the freshness of the spirits of young leaves, and this is related to the faith in the ''zashiki-warashi'' who became protective spirits of a home in order to convey the will of divinity to humans. In [[folkloristics]] after Yanagita as well, there has been debate on subjects such as the relation to Okunai-sama and the relation of children that come from another realm such as the ''[[Ryūgyū-warashi]]'' (dragon palace warashi), among other topics.&lt;ref name="三浦" /&gt;

Also, the folklorist [[Kazuhiko Komatsu]] views ''warashi'' (children) from the point of view of cultural anthropology, and taking on the question of the fortune of homes and the movement of wealth within a village, he notes that ''zashiki-warashi'' share in almost all their characteristics with animal spirit possession such as ''[[kuda-gitsune|izuna-tsukai]]'' ("weasel-using"), and from an analysis of the supremacy and inferiority within the community of families with a spirit haunting them, he notes that ''zashiki-warashi'' have been used as a basis for explaining changes in fortunes within folk society, especially for old homes and families.&lt;ref name="三浦" /&gt;

In [[Ueda Akinari]]'s late [[Edo period|Edo-period]] ''[[yomihon]]'' the [[Ugetsu Monogatari]], in the story "Hinpuku-ron" (Theory of Wealth and Poverty), in [[Mutsu Province]] (now [[Aomori Prefecture]]), in a certain home of a warrior family, a spirit of money appears in the form of an old man going by the name of "Ōgon no Seirei" (meanin "golden spirit") who said "I'm glad you treat money as something important to you, so I came to tell a story", but the doctor of letters Masamichi Abe gives the thought that perhaps this is an older, more prototypical type of ''zashiki-warashi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=阿部正路|title=日本の妖怪たち|year=1981|publisher=[[東京書籍]]|isbn=978-4-487-72164-1|pages=117–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends after the war==
To the people of Tōhoku, the ''zashiki-warashi'' was certainly not a legend that came around after the war, and tales of ''zashiki-warashi'' were told even in the times of Meiji, Shōwa, and beyond. According to Kunio Yanagita's ''Yōkai Dangi'' ({{lang|ja|妖怪談義}}),  it is said that in the year 1910 or Meiji 43 around the time of July, in the village of Tsuchibuchi (now [[Tōno, Iwate|Tōno]], Iwate Prefecture) in [[Kamihei District, Iwate|Kamihei District]], [[Rikuchū Province|Rikuchū]], a ''zashiki-warashi'' appeared at a school that was visible only to the first year students but not to the older students and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[柳田國男]]|title=妖怪談義|origyear=1956|year=1977|publisher=[[講談社]]|series=[[講談社学術文庫]]|isbn=978-4-06-158135-7|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain ryokan that have continued to be managed in the Shōwa and Heisei periods and beyond such as the [[Ryokufūsō]] at the [[Kindaichi Onsen]] in [[Iwate Prefecture]], the Sugawara Bekkan, and the Warabe both in Tenjin village in [[Morioka Prefecture]] are known to be lodges where a ''zashiki-warashi'' dwells, and there have been tales of guests who saw ''zashiki-warashi'', heard footsteps, were physically touched.&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt; However, unlike in the usual legends of ''zashiki-warashi'', the one at Ryokufūsō is considered to be an ancestor that died from an illness and became a protective spirit.

Close to the Warabe, there is a Hayachine Shrine that was opened more than 1200 years ago, and it is said that since festivals for making prayers towards ''zashiki-warashi'' have been done ever since the establishment of the Warabe, the shrine's ''zashiki-warashi'' goes to the Warabe.&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt;

The zashiki-warashi of the Sugawara Bekkan was originally a god of fire of the [[Edo period]] that protected the proprietress's original home from fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=安部晃司他|title=日本の謎と不思議大全|volume=東日本編|edition=|year=2006|publisher=[[人文社]]|series=ものしりミニシリーズ|isbn=978-4-7959-1986-0|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is said to have followed this proprietress when she married into the family of this establishment. There have also been tales about how guests to this ryokan have been successful in their marriage and jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=ペリー荻野|title=読売新聞|volume=2009年7月5日付日曜版|page=3|chapter=ちょんまげ道中 座敷わらしがくれる福をキャッチする心|title-link=読売新聞}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar tales across Japan==
Similar to the ''zashiki-warashi'' are the ''[[zashiki-bōzu]]'' of Kadotani, [[Tōtōmi Province]] (now [[Shizuka Prefecture]]) and the [[akashaguma]] of [[Tokushima]]. Near one of the inner temples of the Kotohira-gū in [[Shikoku]], it is said that at night time an "akashaguma" appears from a [[butsudan]]. "Akashaguma" refers to the fur of a bear that has been stained red, and it is said that a little childlike being wearing this would tickle the old woman owner of this house every night.

In the former [[Higashiyatsushiro District, Yamanashi|Higashiyatsuhiro District]] in [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], it is said that there is an ''okura-bōzu'' ({{lang|ja|お倉坊主}}, "warehouse bonze") that stays within the warehouse, and this is thought to be a type of ''zashiki-warashi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=郷田洋文|title=家の神の水神的性格|journal=西郊民俗|issue=9|page=6|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/1140646.shtml |accessdate=2014-09-23|id={{NCID|AN00086422}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[村上健司]]編著|title=妖怪事典|year=2000|publisher=[[毎日新聞社]]|isbn=978-4-620-31428-0|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], there is the ''[[makuragaeshi]]'' and it is said that if one sleeps in the ''zashiki'' of a certain house, especially if one wields two swords, has hair that stands up, wears western clothing, and puts on a haughty face, then one would get dragged into a neighboring room.

The ''zashiki-warashi'' of Shirotori, [[Ōkawa District, Kagawa|Ōkawa District]], [[Kagawa Prefecture]] (now part of [[Higashikagawa, Kagawa|Higashikawa]]), is told to appear as a little girl who is called ''oshobo'' due to the small, slight (''shobo-shobo'' in Japanese) way it hangs, and sometimes it is said to be invisible to the members of the house,&lt;ref name="村上他" /&gt; while other times it is said to be visible only to the members of this house.&lt;ref name="多田" /&gt;

In addition, in [[Hokkaido]] there is the ''[[ainukaisei]]'' said to attack people in their homes while they sleep, and in the [[Okinawa Prefecture]] there is a yōkai called the ''[[akagantaa]]'' said to play pranks on people in their homes while they sleep, and sometimes these are interpreted to be the same kind of beings as ''zashiki-warashi''.&lt;ref name="多田" /&gt;&lt;ref name="佐々木" /&gt;

The folklorist [[Shinobu Orikuchi]] enumerates examples such as the okunai-sama, the ''zashiki-bōzu'', the ''akashaguma'', the ''[[kijimuna]]'' of Okinawa, ''[[Kappa (folklore)|gaataro]]'' of [[Iki Island|Iki]], etc., and sees in them examples of tales of a faithful spirit that came from another land to do work for a certain family whose disappearance would result in the decline of the family.　He notes how ''zashiki-warashi'' do not descend into the garden and suggests that this is related to how performing arts in the past had a division between "garden", "zashiki", and "stage".&lt;ref name="渡辺" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The name breaks down to ''zashiki'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|座敷}}), a sitting room or parlor, usually with [[tatami]] flooring, and ''warashi'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|童子}}), an archaic term for a child, used particularly in the northeast of Japan.{{sfn|Matsumura|2006}}{{sfn|Yoshimura|2015|p=170}}

==Description==
The appearance of this spirit is that of a 5 or 6 year child with bobbed hair and a red face.{{sfn|Blacker|1963|p=87}} ''Zashiki-warashi'' can be found in well-maintained and preferably large old houses.{{sfn|Takayuki|1996|p=173}} It is said that once a ''zashiki warashi'' inhabits a house, it brings the residence great fortune; on the other hand, should a ''zashiki-warashi'' depart, the domain soon falls into a steep decline.{{sfn|Yoda|Alt|2013|pp=31–32}}

As the ''zashiki warashi'' is [[child]]-like in nature, it is prone to playing harmless pranks and occasionally causing mischief. They are known for running around and making noise, even adjusting the bedding of overnight guests.{{sfn|Yoshimura|2015|p=149}} Sometimes they leave little footsteps in ashes. There are different variations as to who can see the ''zashiki-warashi''; usually this is limited to inhabitants of the house, sometimes to children.{{sfn|Nomura|1987|p=121}}

''Yōkai'' similar to ''zashiki-warashi'' in other parts of Japan include: the ''makuragaeshi'' in [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] – another creature which alters bedding;{{sfn|Foster|Kijin|2015|pp=236–239}} the ''ainukaisei'' in [[Hokkaido]]; and the ''akagantā'' found in [[Okinawa]].{{sfn|Foster|Kijin|2015|p=239}}

The Ryokufūsō in [[Kindaichi Onsen]], which burned down on October 4, 2009, was famed for its ''zashiki warashi''.{{sfn|Tsuruta|Fujiyoshi|2016|p="Zashiki-Warashi Inn" Rebuilt 6 Years and 7 Months after Fire}}

==Sightings==
By the end of November 2015, Mirror website offered video footage from a home video camera in Japan. That can capture the thing of what looks like a girl wearing a kimono walking in the house. But her body is translucent and can walk through the wall. Believe that she is ''zashiki-warashi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=thai|website=Kapook.com|title=ขนหัวลุก ! คลิปผีเด็กหญิงโผล่กลางห้อง เจ้าของบ้านเชื่อเป็นภูตินำโชค|date=2015-12-02|accessdate=2018-07-22|url=https://hilight.kapook.com/view/129924}}&lt;/ref&gt;
