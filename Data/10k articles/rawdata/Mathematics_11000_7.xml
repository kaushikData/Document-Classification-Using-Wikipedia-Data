In theoretical physics, '''3D mirror symmetry''' is a version of [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]] in 3-dimensional gauge theories with N=4 [[supersymmetry]], or 8 [[supercharge]]s. It was first proposed by [[Kenneth Intriligator]] and [[Nathan Seiberg]] in their 1996 paper, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0370-2693(96)01088-X Mirror symmetry in three-dimensional gauge theories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Intriligator|first=Kenneth|author2=N. Seiberg|title=Mirror symmetry in three-dimensional gauge theories|journal=Phys. Lett. B|date=October 1996|volume=387|issue=3|page=513|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(96)01088-X|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9607207v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;], as a relation between pairs of 3-dimensional gauge theories, such that the Coulomb branch of the [[moduli (physics)|moduli]] space of one is the Higgs branch of the moduli space of the other.  It was demonstrated using [[D-brane]] cartoons by [[Amihay Hanany]] and [[Edward Witten]] 4 months later,&lt;ref&gt;In [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9611230v3 Type IIB superstrings, BPS monopoles, and three-dimensional gauge dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; where they found that it is a consequence of [[S-duality]] in type IIB string theory.

Four months later '''3D mirror symmetry''' was extended to N=2 gauge theories resulting from [[supersymmetry breaking]] in N=4 theories.&lt;ref&gt;In the article [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9703110v1 Aspects of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in three-dimensions].&lt;/ref&gt;  Here it was given a physical interpretation in terms of vortices. In 3-dimensional gauge theories, vortices are particles. [[Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound|BPS]] vortices, which are those vortices that preserve some supersymmetry, have masses which are given by the FI term of the gauge theory. In particular, on the Higgs branch, where the [[squarks]] are massless and condense yielding nontrivial vacuum expectation values (VEVs), the vortices are massive. On the other hand, Intriligator and Seiberg interpret the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory, where the scalar in the vector multiplet has a VEV, as being the regime where massless vortices condense. Thus the duality between the Coulomb branch in one theory and the Higgs branch in the dual theory is the duality between squarks and vortices.

In this theory, the [[instanton]]s are [[Hooft–Polyakov monopole|Hooft–Polyakov magnetic monopoles]] whose actions are proportional to the VEV of the scalar in the vector multiplet. In this case, instanton calculations again reproduce the nonperturbative super potential.  In particular, in the N=4 case with SU(2) gauge symmetry, the metric on the moduli space was found by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten&lt;ref&gt;In [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9607163v1 Gauge dynamics and compactification to three-dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt; using [[holomorph (mathematics)|holomorph]]y and [[supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems|supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems]] several days before Intriligator and Seiberg's 3-dimensional mirror symmetry paper appeared. Their results were reproduced using standard instanton techniques.&lt;ref&gt;In [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9803065v1 Instanton effects in three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ageometresia''' or '''ageometria''' is a word describing a defect in a work of [[geometry]].&lt;ref name="c1728"&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopaedia Perthensis; or Universal dictionary of the arts, sciences, literature, &amp;c. intended to supersede the use of other books of reference|volume=1|publisher=John Brown|date=1816|page=308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvVPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early usage of the word was in writings of [[François Viète]] on [[Copernicus]].&lt;ref name="rosen"&gt;{{citation|title=On the revolutions: Foundations of natural history|volume=1|series=Complete Works of Nicolas Copernicus|first=Edward|last=Rosen|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|date=1992|isbn=978-0-8018-4515-4|page=334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As another instance, [[Johannes Kepler]], having no direct and geometrical method of finding certain matters in his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|elliptical theory]], namely how to calculate the [[true anomaly]] from the [[mean anomaly]], has been charged by others with ageometresia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Indian science and technology in the eighteenth century: some contemporary European accounts|author=Dharampal|publisher=Impex India|date=1971|page=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ephraim|last=Chambers|authorlink=Ephraim Chambers|title=[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]|date=1728|page=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Viète wrote in [[Latin language|Latin]], the word "ageometresia" is Greek,&lt;ref name="rosen"/&gt; and the same Greek word has also subsequently been used by writers in English.&lt;ref name="c1728"/&gt; As well as its usage to indicate faults in the works of professional mathematicians, "ageometria" has also been used to describe a form of [[dyscalculia]], a disability that prevents students from understanding geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bases of Language Intervention|volume=1|series=Language intervention series|first1=Richard L.|last1=Schiefelbusch|first2=Marilyn|last2=Barket|publisher=University Park Press|date=1978|page=23|isbn=978-0-8391-1197-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Principles of Child Neurology|first=Bruce O.|last=Berg|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|date=1996|isbn=978-0-07-005193-5|page=362}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that [[Newtonian mechanics]] was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led him to develop his [[special theory of relativity]] during his time at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in [[Bern]] (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916 with his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.&lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf |title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2011.

Except for one year in Prague, Einstein lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, during which time he renounced his German citizenship in 1896, then received his academic diploma from the Swiss [[ETH Zurich|federal polytechnic school]] (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zürich in 1900. After being stateless for more than five years, he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zurich]]. The same year, he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]] during his renowned ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' (miracle year) which brought him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26. Einstein taught theoretical physics at Zurich between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin, where he was elected to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].

In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power. Because of his [[Jewish]] background, Einstein did not return to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=9 June 2017 |first=Thomas |last=Levenson |journal=The Atlantic |title=The Scientist and the Fascist |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/einstein-germany-and-the-bomb/528534/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.&lt;ref name="BoyerDubofsky2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul S.

Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the US begin similar research. This eventually led to the [[Manhattan Project]]. Einstein supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], but he generally denounced the idea of using [[nuclear fission]] as a weapon. He signed the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] with British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. He was affiliated with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955.

He scored: German 5; French 3; Italian 5; History 6; Geography 4; Algebra 6; Geometry 6; Descriptive Geometry 6; Physics 6; Chemistry 5; Natural History 5; Art and Technical Drawing 4.]]

Albert Einstein was born in [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] in the [[German Empire]], on 14&amp;nbsp;March 1879.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; His parents were [[Hermann Einstein]], a salesman and engineer, and [[Pauline Koch]]. In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded ''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein &amp; Cie'', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

The Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich, from the age of 5, for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]] (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&amp;pg=PA59 59–61]}}

In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.&lt;ref&gt;Barry R. Parker, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books – 2003, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=30–31}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether theories|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field".{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mehra |first=Jagdish |contribution=Albert Einstein's first paper |title=The Golden Age of Physics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2001 |isbn=978-981-02-4985-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The twelve year old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] at age 12.&lt;ref&gt;''The Three-body Problem from Pythagoras to Hawking'', Mauri Valtonen, Joanna Anosova, Konstantin Kholshevnikov, Aleksandr Mylläri, Victor Orlov, Kiyotaka Tanikawa, (Springer 2016), page 43, Simon and Schuster, 4 Sep 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12 year old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."&lt;ref name="Einstein page 17"&gt;Einstein: His Life and Universe, By Walter Isaacson, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; His passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve year old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure".&lt;ref name="Einstein page 17"/&gt; Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14 year old he says he had "mastered [[integral calculus|integral]] and [[differential calculus|differential]] [[calculus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Einstein: His Life and Universe, By Walter Isaacson, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 13, Einstein was introduced to [[Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him."&lt;ref name="Einstein page 17"/&gt;

In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]] in [[Zürich]] (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), p. 11}} but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=36–37}} On the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the [[Aargau|Argovian]] [[Mittelschule|cantonal school]] ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) in [[Aarau]], Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister [[Maja Einstein|Maja]] later married Winteler's son Paul.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|pp=21, 31, 56–57}} In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his [[German citizenship|citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg]] to avoid [[Conscription in Germany|military service]].{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=40}} In September 1896, he passed the Swiss [[Matura]] with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), docs. 21–27}} At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to [[Olsberg, Aargau|Olsberg]], Switzerland, for a teaching post.

Einstein's future wife, a 20-year old [[Serbs|Serbian]] woman [[Mileva Marić]], also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded the Federal Polytechnic teaching diploma.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 67}} There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Troemel-Ploetz, D. |title=Mileva Einstein-Marić: The Woman Who Did Einstein's Mathematics |journal=Women's Studies Int.

An early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named [[Lieserl Einstein|"Lieserl"]], born in early 1902 in [[Novi Sad]] where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of [[scarlet fever]] in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;J. Renn &amp; R. Schulmann, ''Albert Einstein/Mileva Marić: The Love Letters'', 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Calaprice &amp; T. Lipscombe, ''Albert Einstein: A Biography'', 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son [[Hans Albert Einstein]] was born in [[Bern]], Switzerland. Their son [[Einstein family#Eduard "Tete" Einstein (Albert's son)|Eduard]] was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that Einstein's chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin Elsa.{{Sfnp|Stachel|1966}} They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.{{sfnp|Stachel|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&amp;pg=PA50 50]}} Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Robinson2015a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Andrew|authorlink=Walter Isaacson|title=Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-16989-7|pages=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.{{sfnp|Neffe|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B8K6n177ZwcC&amp;pg=PA203 203]}}

In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be". He spoke about a "misguided love" and a "missed life" regarding his love for Marie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/bern/Die-Liebesbriefe-des-untreuen-Einstein/story/11875058 |first=Urs | last=Wüthrich |title=Die Liebesbriefe des untreuen Einstein |trans-title=The love letters of the unfaithful Einstein |newspaper=BZ Berner Zeitung |location=Bern, Switzerland |date=11 April 2015 |language=German |quote=Ich denke in innigster Liebe an Dich in jeder freien Minute und bin so unglücklich, wie nur ein Mensch es sein kann. |accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein married [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa Löwenthal]] in 1919,{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007}}{{Sfnp|Calaprice|Kennefick|Schulmann|2015|p=62}} after having a relationship with her since 1912.&lt;ref name="CalapriceLipscombe2005"/&gt; She was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally.&lt;ref name="CalapriceLipscombe2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calaprice|first1=Alice|last2=Lipscombe|first2=Trevor|title=Albert Einstein: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eWh2O_3OAQC&amp;pg=PA50|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33080-3|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emigrated to the United States in 1933.  Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.{{Sfnp|Highfield|Carter|1993|p=216}}

===Friends===
Among Einstein's well-known friends were [[Michele Besso]], [[Paul Ehrenfest]], [[Marcel Grossmann]], [[János Plesch]], [[Daniel Q. Posin]], [[Maurice Solovine]], and [[Stephen Wise]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Einstein Encyclopedia'', Alice Calaprice, Daniel Kennefick, Robert Schulmann, p. 65 et seq, Princeton University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship in February 1901,{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=82}} but for medical reasons was not [[conscription in Switzerland|conscripted]]. With the help of [[Marcel Grossmann]]'s father, he secured a job in [[Bern]] at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|Federal Office for Intellectual Property]], the patent office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Grossmann.html |title=Grossmann biography |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |editor=J J O'Connor |editor2=E F Robertson |date=May 2010 |type=scientific website? |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=63}} as an [[Patent examiner|assistant examiner – level III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Einstein at the patent office|url=https://www.ipi.ch/en/about-us/einstein/einstein-at-the-patent-office.html |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, IGE/IPI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=6 February 2014 |type=official website |accessdate=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IGEFAQ&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ about Einstein and the Institute |url=https://www.ipi.ch/en/about-us/einstein/frequently-asked-questions.html |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, IGE/IPI |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=27 May 2014 |type=official website |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein evaluated [[patent application]]s for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.&lt;ref name=IGEFAQ /&gt; In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine technology".&lt;ref name=GalisonClock&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1344127 |first=Peter | last=Galison |title=Einstein's Clocks: The Question of Time |journal=Critical Inquiry |volume=26 |issue=2 Winter |date=2000 |pp=355–389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|370}}

Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical–mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the [[thought experiment]]s that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.&lt;ref name=GalisonClock /&gt;{{rp|377}}

With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "[[Olympia Academy|The Olympia Academy]]", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Their readings included the works of [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Ernst Mach]], and [[David Hume]], which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=79-84}}

==== First scientific papers ====
[[File:Albert Einstein (Nobel).png|thumb|upright|Einstein's official 1921 portrait after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics]]
In 1900, Einstein's paper [[List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein#Journal articles|"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen"]] ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1901}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galison |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Galison |title=Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time |publisher=W. W. Norton |location=New York |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-393-02001-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905b|loc="Meinem Freunde Herr Dr. Marcel Grossmann gewidmet (Dedicated to my friend, Dr. Marcel Grossmann)"}} with [[Alfred Kleiner]], Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as ''[[Pro forma|pro-forma]]'' advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zürich]], with his dissertation "''A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions''".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905b|loc="Meinem Freunde Herr Dr. Marcel Grossmann gewidmet (Dedicated to my friend, Dr. Marcel Grossmann)"}}{{Sfnp|Einstein|1926b|loc=chap. "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions"}}

In that same year, which has been called Einstein's ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' (miracle year), he published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]], on the photoelectric effect, [[Brownian motion]], [[special relativity]], and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.

=== Academic career ===
By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the [[University of Bern]]. The following year, after giving a lecture on [[electrodynamics]] and the relativity principle at the University of Zürich, [[Alfred Kleiner]] recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Associate-Professor-at-the-Universiy-of-Zurich-und-professor-in-Prague-1909-1912 |title=Associate Professor at the University of Zurich und professor in Prague (1909–1912) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zürich, www.ethz.ch |location=Bern, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |date=2014 |type=digital library |language=German, English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein became a full professor at the German [[Charles-Ferdinand University]] in [[Prague]] in April 1911, accepting [[Austria]]n citizenship in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to do so.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=164}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/49610/1/569197996.pdf |author=von Hirschhausen, Ulrike |title=Von imperialer Inklusion zur nationalen Exklusion:Staatsbürgerschaft in Österreich- Ungarn 1867–1923 |publisher=WZB Social Science Research Center Berlin |date=2007 |location=Berlin, Germany |series=ZKD – Veröffentlichungsreihe der Forschungsgruppe, „Zivilgesellschaft, Citizenship und politische Mobilisierung in Europa" Schwerpunkt Zivilgesellschaft, Konflikte und Demokratie, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung |type=WZB Discussion Paper |issue=No. SP IV 2007–403 |issn=1860-4315 |page=8 |quote= Eine weitere Diskontinuität bestand viertens darin, dass die Bestimmungen der österreichischen Staatsbürgerschaft, die in den ersten Dritteln des Jahrhunderts auch auf Ungarn angewandt worden waren, seit 1867 nur noch für die cisleithanische Reichshälfte galten.

In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the [[ETH Zurich]], where he taught analytical mechanics and [[thermodynamics]]. He also studied [[continuum mechanics]], the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend [[Marcel Grossmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Resources/Digital-library/Einstein-Online/Professor-at-the-ETH-Zurich-1912-1914 |title=Professor at the ETH Zurich (1912–1914) |publisher=ETH-Bibliothek Zurich, ETH Zürich, www.ethz.ch |location=Zurich, Switzerland |series=Einstein Online |date=2014 |type=digital library |language=German, English |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 1913, he was voted for membership in the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin. [[Max Planck]] and [[Walther Nernst]] visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]], which was soon to be established.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|p=534}} (Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].) He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he accepted to move to the German Empire the next year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had developed a romantic affair. He joined the academy and thus the Berlin University on 1 April 1914.{{Sfnp|Weinstein|2015|pp=18–19}} As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Director in the attic|url=https://www.mpg.de/dossier/einstein/in-berlin|publisher=Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, München|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the [[German Physical Society]] (1916–1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Albert Einstein: a biography| first1=Alice |last1=Calaprice |first2=Trevor |last2=Lipscombe |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-33080-3 |page=xix |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5eWh2O_3OAQC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5eWh2O_3OAQC&amp;pg=PR19 Timeline, p. xix]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, [[Gravitational lens|light from another star should be bent]] by the Sun's gravity. In 1919, that prediction was confirmed by Sir [[Arthur Eddington]] during the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]]. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science&amp;nbsp;– New Theory of the Universe&amp;nbsp;– Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".&lt;ref name="Eddington"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrzej |first=Stasiak |date=2003 |title=Myths in science |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=4 |issue=3 |page=236 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor779 |accessdate =|doi-access=free |pmc=1315907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00000116 |title=Albert Einstein (1879–1955) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"/&gt; While the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat the cited work as an ''explanation'' but merely as a ''discovery of the law'', as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the [[Planck spectrum]] by [[S. N. Bose]]. Einstein was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1921|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921]].&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt; He also received the [[Copley Medal]] from the [[Royal Society]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt;

[[File:League of Nations Commission 067.tif|thumb|Albert Einstein at a session of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] ([[League of Nations]]) of which he was a member from 1922 to 1932.]]Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor [[John Francis Hylan]], followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]], and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the [[National Academy of Science]] on a visit to the [[White House]]. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher [[Viscount Haldane]] in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at [[King's College London]].{{Sfnp|Hoffmann|1972|pp=145–148}} {{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=499–508}}

He also published an essay, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.," in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], who published his own impressions in ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1835).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einsteinsworld.com/News-New-York-Herald-Tribune-1931-As-Einstein-Sees-America.htm "As Einstein Sees American"], ''Einstein's World'', a 1931 reprint with minor changes, of his 1921 essay.&lt;/ref&gt; For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: "What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy."&lt;ref name=Holton /&gt;{{rp|20}}

In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited [[Singapore]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Japan]], where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]], where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=307–308}} In his own travel diaries from his 1922-23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/12/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-shocking-xenophobia|title=Einstein's travel diaries reveal 'shocking' xenophobia|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=12 June 2018|work=[[TheGuardian.com]]|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-speech.html The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921: Albert Einstein. Banquet Speech by R. Nadolny (in German).] Retrieved 9 December 2015 via Nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return voyage, he visited [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, [[Sir Herbert Samuel]]. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=308}}

Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] and also received a diploma from [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montes-Santiago|first=J.|date=2017-07-16|title=[The meeting of Einstein with Cajal (Madrid, 1923): a lost tide of fortune]|journal=Revista de Neurologia|volume=43|issue=2|pages=113–117|issn=0210-0010|pmid=16838259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] of the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]] (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grandjean |first=Martin |date=2018 |title=Les réseaux de la coopération intellectuelle.

=== 1930–1931: Travel to the US ===
In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=368}}

After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], a lunch with the editors of ''The New York Times'', and a performance of ''Carmen'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as "the ruling monarch of the mind".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]], pastor at New York's [[Riverside Church]], gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}} Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at [[Madison Square Garden]] during a [[Hanukkah]] celebration.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=370}}

[[File:Albert Einstein and Charlie Chaplin - 1931.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Einstein (left) and [[Charlie Chaplin]] at the [[Hollywood]] premiere of ''[[City Lights]]'', January 1931]]
Einstein next traveled to California, where he met [[Caltech]] president and Nobel laureate, [[Robert A. Millikan]]. His friendship with Millikan was "awkward", as Millikan "had a penchant for patriotic militarism," where Einstein was a pronounced [[Pacifism|pacifist]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=373}} During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}}

This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author [[Upton Sinclair]] and film star [[Charlie Chaplin]], both noted for their pacifism. [[Carl Laemmle]], head of [[Universal Studios]], gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a "highly emotional temperament," from which came his "extraordinary intellectual energy".&lt;ref name=Chaplin&gt;Chaplin, Charles. ''Charles Chaplin: My Autobiography'', Simon and Schuster, N.Y. (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320}}

Chaplin's film, ''[[City Lights]]'', was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. [[Walter Isaacson]], Einstein's biographer, described this as "one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=374}} Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin, and recalled his "modest little flat" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was "possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis."&lt;ref name=Chaplin /&gt;{{rp|322}}

=== 1933: Emigration to the US ===
[[File:Einstein-cartoon1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cartoon of Einstein, who has shed his "Pacifism" wings, standing next to a pillar labeled "World Peace". He is rolling up his sleeves and holding a sword labeled "Preparedness" (by Charles R. Macauley, c. 1933).]]
In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] under Germany's new chancellor, [[Adolf Hitler]].{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|p=659}}{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=404}}

While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in Pasadena. He and his wife Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March, and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in [[Antwerp]] on 28 March, he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a [[Hitler Youth]] camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/albert-einstein-how-i-see-the-world/585/ |title=Albert Einstein: How I See the World |work=American Masters |publisher=PBS |author=Richard Kroehling |date=July 1991 |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Refugee status ====
[[File:Einstein's landing card (5706142737).jpg|thumb|Albert Einstein's landing card (26 May 1933), when he landed in [[Dover]] (United Kingdom) from [[Ostende]] (Belgium) to visit [[Oxford]].]]
In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} Historian [[Gerald Holton]] describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;Holton, Gerald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=prgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 "The migration of physicists to the United States"], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc., April 1984 pp. 18–24&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the [[German Student Union]] in the [[Nazi book burnings]], with Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaiming, "Jewish intellectualism is dead."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}}&lt;ref name=Jerome&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Jerome|author2=Rodger Taylor|title=Einstein on Race and Racism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4d79VQdOfFUC&amp;pg=PR10|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3952-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend [[Max Born]], who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, "...&amp;nbsp;I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=407–410}} After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a "spontaneous emotional outburst" by those who "shun popular enlightenment," and "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence."{{Sfnp|Einstein|1954|p=197}}

Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the ''Daily Herald'' on 24 July 1933.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=422}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8223551/professor-einstein-with-commander-locker-lampson-gelatin-silver-print-photograph "Professor Einstein with Commander Locker-Lampson"], ScienceMuseum.org, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet [[Winston Churchill]] at his home, and later, [[Austen Chamberlain]] and former Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=419–420}} Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian [[Martin Gilbert]] notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;Gilbert, Martin. ''Churchill and the Jews'', Henry Holt and Company, N.Y. (2007) pp. 101, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their "technical standards" and put [[Allies of World War II|the Allies']] technology ahead of theirs.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;

Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including [[Turkey]]'s Prime Minister, [[İsmet İnönü]], to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over "1,000 saved individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Reisman | first=Arnold | url=http://hnn.us/article/31946 | title=What a Freshly Discovered Einstein Letter Says About Turkey Today | publisher=History News Network, George Mason University | date=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;"Denunciation of German Policy is a Stirring Event", ''Associated Press'', 27 July 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech he described Einstein as a "citizen of the world" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Their leaders in Germany have not driven out her cut-throats and her blackguards. She has chosen the cream of her culture and has suppressed it. She has even turned upon her most glorious citizen, Albert Einstein, who is the supreme example of the selfless intellectual...The man, who, beyond all others, approximates a citizen of the world, is without a home. How proud we must be to offer him temporary shelter."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;"Stateless Jews: The Exiles from Germany, Nationality Plan", ''The Guardian'' (UK) 27 July 1933&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], US, to become a resident scholar.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}

==== Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study ====
[[File:Einstein-formal portrait-35.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Einstein taken in 1935 at Princeton]]
In October 1933 Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study,{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=649, 678}} noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Arntzenius2011" /&gt; At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their [[Jewish quota]]s, which lasted until the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="Arntzenius2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Linda G. | last=Arntzenius|title=Institute for Advanced Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHHguITir80C&amp;pg=PA19|date=2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-7409-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including [[Christ Church, Oxford]] where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Oxford Chabad Society |url=http://www.oxfordchabad.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/457396/jewish/Albert-Einstein.htm |title=Oxford Jewish Personalities |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Oxford Times |date=2012 |url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/leisure/history_heritage/9617968.How_Einstein_fled_from_the_Nazis_to_an_Oxford_college/ |title=How Einstein fled from the Nazis to an Oxford college |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}}{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=686–687}}

Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief |title=In Brief |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=4 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100329064405/http://www.ias.edu/people/einstein/in-brief| archivedate= 29 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being [[John von Neumann]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. [[Bruria Kaufman]], his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a [[unified field theory]] and to refute the [[Copenhagen interpretation|accepted interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]], both unsuccessfully.

==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====
{{See also|Einstein–Szilárd letter}}
In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist [[Leó Szilárd]] attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as [[Edward Teller]] and [[Eugene Wigner]], "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the [[German nuclear energy project|race to build an atomic bomb]], and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=630}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gosling |first=F.

Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.

The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=J.

Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the "race" to develop the bomb, drawing on its "immense material, financial, and scientific resources" to initiate the [[Manhattan Project]].

For Einstein, "war was a disease&amp;nbsp;... [and] he called for resistance to war." By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Einstein, Albert |date=1952 |title=On My Participation in the Atom Bomb Project |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/EinsteinResponse.shtml |publisher=AJ Software &amp; Multimedia |via=atomicarchive.org |page= |accessdate=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, [[Linus Pauling]], "I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them&amp;nbsp;..."{{Sfnp|Clark|1971|p=???}}

==== US citizenship ====
[[File:Citizen-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein accepting [[Citizenship in the United States|US citizenship]] certificate from judge [[Phillip Forman]]]]
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the [[meritocracy]] in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=432}}

Einstein joined the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] of African Americans. He considered racism America's "worst disease,"&lt;ref name="Jerome" /&gt; seeing it as "handed down from one generation to the next".&lt;ref&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2005) ''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html The new quotable Einstein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622063213/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html |date=22 June 2009 }}''. pp.148–149 Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist [[W.

''Paul Robeson Speaks'', Citadel (2002) p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|565}} When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.&lt;ref name=civil /&gt;

In 1946 Einstein visited [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania, a [[historically black college]], where he was awarded an honorary degree. (Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to [[African Americans]]; alumni include [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]].)

=== Personal life ===
[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein in 1947]]
==== Assisting Zionist causes ====
Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the [[World Zionist Organization]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], to help raise funds for the planned university.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=290}} He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.

Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as [[malaria]], which he called an "evil" that was undermining a third of the country's development.&lt;ref name=Rowe /&gt;{{rp|161}} Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.&lt;ref name=Rowe&gt;Rowe, David E. and Schulmann, Robert, editors.

==== Love of music ====
[[File:Rabindranath with Einstein.jpg|thumb|Einstein (right) with writer, musician and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1930]]
Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age, and later wrote: "If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = The relative beauty of the violin|date = 28 January 2011|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/features/the-relative-beauty-of-the-violin-2196313.html|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Duchen, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Einstein and his love of music |date=January 2005 |url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/einstein/stuff/einstein&amp;music.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Physics World]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828225916/http://www.pha.jhu.edu/einstein/stuff/einstein%26music.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the [[violin]], not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein began playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.&lt;ref name=Botstein /&gt;

When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of [[Mozart]], whereupon "Einstein fell in love" with Mozart's music and studied music more willingly. He taught himself to play without "ever practicing systematically", he said, deciding that "love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."&lt;ref name=Botstein&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Galison|author2=Gerald James Holton|author3=Silvan S. Schweber|title=Einstein for the 21st Century: His Legacy in Science, Art, and Modern Culture|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13520-5|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played [[Beethoven]]'s [[violin sonata]]s, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was "remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'." What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student."&lt;ref name=Botstein /&gt;

Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the [[Köchel catalogue]] of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by [[Alfred Einstein]], who may have been a distant relation.&lt;ref&gt;Article "Alfred Einstein", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed.

In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the [[Zoellner Quartet]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-22/entertainment/ca-20526_1_life-estate Cariaga, Daniel, "Not Taking It with You: A Tale of Two Estates," ''Los Angeles Times''], 22 December 1985.

Einstein's political view was in favor of [[socialism]] and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as "[[Why Socialism?]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|title=Why Socialism?|journal=Monthly Review|date=May 1949|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/|editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last=Sweezy |editor2-first=Leo |editor2-last=Huberman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David E. | last=Rowe|author2=Robert Schulmann|last-author-amp=yes|title=What Were Einstein's Politics?|journal=[[History News Network]]|date=8 June 2007|url=http://hnn.us/articles/39445.html|accessdate=29 July 2012|editor1-first=Walsh|editor1-last=David A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic [[World government|global government]] that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=487, 494, 550}} The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/science-march-einstein-fbi-genius-science/| first=Mitch | last=Waldrop| title=Why the FBI Kept a 1,400-Page File on Einstein| publisher=National Geographic| date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was deeply impressed by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].

Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious [[secular humanist|humanist]] and [[Ethical Culture]] groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]],&lt;ref&gt;Dowbiggin, Ian (2003). ''A Merciful End''. New York: Oxford University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1AKtIEIIvUC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41.]&lt;/ref&gt; and was an honorary associate of the [[Rationalist Association]], which publishes ''[[New Humanist]]'' in Britain. For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the [[Felix Adler (professor)#New York Society for Ethical Culture|New York Society for Ethical Culture]], he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1995). ''Ideas And Opinions''.

=== Death ===
On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced [[internal bleeding]] caused by the rupture of an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], which had previously been reinforced surgically by [[Rudolph Nissen]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436253 |title=The Case of the Scientist with a Pulsating Mass |date=14 June 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Albert Einstein Archives |title=Draft of projected Telecast Israel Independence Day, April 1955 (last statement ever written) |publisher=Einstein Archives Online |date=April 1955 |url=http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Digital/EAR000020078#page/1/mode/1up |accessdate=14 March 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070313231657/http://www.alberteinstein.info/| archivedate= 13 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.&lt;ref name=PubList /&gt;

==== Theory of critical opalescence ====
{{Main|Critical opalescence}}
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Levenson |first=Thomas |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ |title=Einstein's Big Idea |publisher=WBGH |type=public broadcaster website |via=NOVA by [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), Arlington, VA, USA |location=Boston, MA, USA |date=9 September 1997 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

=== Special relativity ===
{{Main|History of special relativity}}
Einstein's "''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper''"{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}} ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between [[Maxwell's equations]] (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=178–198}} Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.

This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to [[Time dilation|slow down]], and the body itself would [[Length contraction|contract]] in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In [[wikisource:Translation:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|his paper]], Einstein wrote: "The introduction of a 'luminiferous æther' will be proved to be superfluous in so far, as according to the conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce neither a 'space absolutely at rest' endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper on [[mass–energy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as a consequence of his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [https://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&amp;pg=PA215 215]}} Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Thomas F. Glick, ed., ''The Comparative Reception of Relativity'' (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1987), {{ISBN|90-277-2498-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382–386}}

Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]] reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of [[spacetime]]. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=151–152}}

=== General relativity ===

==== General relativity and the equivalence principle ====
{{Main|History of general relativity}}

[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]
General relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.

As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled "On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational red shift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179–183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900–1909|pp=273–274}}

In 1911, Einstein published another article "On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194–195}}

In 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=Näherungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688–696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=Über Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its [[Lorentz invariance]] which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160211-gravitational-waves-found-spacetime-science/ |title=Found!

==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====
{{Main|Hole argument}}
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken&lt;ref&gt;van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; and abandoned the theory in November 1915.

==== Physical cosmology ====
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
{{cosmology|scientists}}
In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285–286}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=J.D.|title=The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology|date=1965|publisher=Dover|location=New York|pages=81–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931&lt;ref name="einstein-1931"&gt;Einstein, A. 1931.

In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder". The astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/books/review/brilliant-blunders-by-mario-livio.html|title=The Genius of Getting It Wrong|date=9 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Zimmer|first1=Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist [[Cormac O'Raifeartaigh]] discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-lost-theory-uncovered-1.14767|title=Einstein's lost theory uncovered|volume=506|issue=7489|pages=418–419|journal=Nature News &amp; Comment|doi=10.1038/506418a|pmid=24572403|year=2014|last1=Castelvecchi|first1=Davide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/14/135th-birthday-einstein-still-full-surprises/|title=On His 135th Birthday, Einstein is Still Full of Surprises|work=Out There|date=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.&lt;ref name="cor-steady-state"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Raifeartaigh | first1 = C. | last2 = McCann | first2 = B. | last3 = Nahm | first3 = W. | last4 = Mitton | first4 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Einstein's steady-state theory: an abandoned model of the cosmos | arxiv=1402.0132 | journal = Eur.

'Einstein’s aborted attempt at a dynamic steady state universe’. Physics ArXiv preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4099&lt;/ref&gt; As he stated in the paper, "In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [''sic''] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ... "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space."

It thus appears that Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoyle | year = 1948 | title = A New Model for the Expanding Universe | url = | journal = MNRAS | volume = 108 | issue = 5| page = 372 |bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..372H | doi=10.1093/mnras/108.5.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bondi | last2 = Gold | year = 1948 | title = The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe | url = | journal = MNRAS | volume = 108 | issue = 3| page = 252 |bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B | doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.&lt;ref name="cor-steady-state"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Einstein’s aborted model"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2014/03/07/einsteins-lost-theory-describes-a-universe-without-a-big-bang/|title=Einstein's Lost Theory Describes a Universe Without a Big Bang – The Crux|work=The Crux|date=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====
{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}
General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.

Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.

The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others.

==== Wormholes ====
{{Main|Wormhole}}
In 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein–Rosen bridges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |author2=Rosen, Nathan |last-author-amp=yes |date=1935 |title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |page=73 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73 |bibcode=1935PhRv...48...73E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 – General Relativity's Centennial|publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|date=2015|url=https://journals.aps.org/general-relativity-centennial|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper "Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Focus: The Birth of Wormholes|journal=Physics |volume=15 |first=David | last=Lindley|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v15/st11|date=25 March 2005|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.

==== Einstein–Cartan theory ====
{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.

==== Equations of motion ====
{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}
The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the [[Einstein equations]] which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]] which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.

Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.

This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.

==== Photons and energy quanta ====
[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|thumb|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]
{{Main|Photon|Quantum}}
In a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].

Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}

==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====
{{Main|Einstein solid}}
In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html Celebrating Einstein "Solid Cold". U.S. DOE.], [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]], 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ====
{{main|Adiabatic invariant}}
Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].

Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.

==== Bose–Einstein statistics ====
{{Main|Bose–Einstein statistics}}
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |title=Cornell and Wieman Share 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics |date=9 October 2001 |accessdate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610080506/https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |archivedate=10 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.&lt;ref name=Instituut-Lorentz /&gt;

==== Wave–particle duality ====
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]
{{Main|Wave–particle duality}}
Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In "''Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''" ("[[s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

==== Zero-point energy ====
{{Main|Zero-point energy}}
In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his "second quantum theory". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912–1914|pp=270ff}}

==== Stimulated emission ====
{{main|Stimulated emission}}
In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}
This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.

==== Matter waves ====
{{main|Matter wave}}
Einstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
==== Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics ====
[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|Newspaper headline on 4 May 1935]]
Einstein was displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925. Contrary to popular belief, his doubts were not due to a conviction that God "is not playing at dice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations |first1=Robert |last1=Andrews |publisher=Penguin UK |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-14-196531-4 |page=499 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0vR4fsaigC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0vR4fsaigC&amp;pg=PT499 Extract of page 499]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it was Einstein himself, in his 1917 paper that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]],{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}} who first proposed the fundamental role of chance in explaining quantum processes.{{Sfnp|Stone|2013|pp=181–192}} Rather, he objected to what quantum mechanics implies about the nature of reality. Einstein believed that a physical reality exists independent of our ability to observe it. In contrast, Bohr and his followers maintained that all we can know are the results of measurements and observations, and that it makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=460–461}}

{{Main|Bohr–Einstein debates}}
[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks sceptical.|thumb|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about [[quantum mechanics]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1949"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm | title = Discussions with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics | accessdate =30 August 2010 | author = Bohr N | work=The Value of Knowledge: A Miniature Library of Philosophy | publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100913033345/http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm| archivedate= 13 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} From Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist (1949), publ.

==== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ====
{{Main|EPR paradox}}
In 1935, Einstein returned quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the [[EPR paradox|"EPR paper"]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} In a [[Einstein's thought experiments|thought experiment]], he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp.448–453}}

Given Einstein's concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called "spooky action at a distance").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp.448–453}}

Einstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which "particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated."{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}

Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, [[Quantum entanglement|''entangled quantum states'']], has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in [[Physical Review]]. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of [[quantum information theory]].{{Sfnp|Fine|2017}}

Following his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his "[[unified field theory]]" in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article titled "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.

=== Other investigations ===
{{Main|Einstein's unsuccessful investigations}}
Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.

=== Collaboration with other scientists ===
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists. Einstein is in the center.]]
In addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.

==== Einstein–de Haas experiment ====
{{Main|Einstein–de Haas effect}}
Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.

==== Schrödinger gas model ====
Einstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

This formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Moore |first=Walter |date=1989 |title=Schrödinger: Life and Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43767-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Einstein refrigerator ====
{{Main|Einstein refrigerator}}
In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.&lt;ref name="Goettling"&gt;Goettling, Gary.

Retrieved on 12 November 2014. [[Leó Szilárd]], a Hungarian physicist who later worked on the Manhattan Project, is credited with the discovery of the [[chain reaction]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 1930, {{US patent|1781541}} was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company [[Electrolux]].&lt;ref&gt;In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled.{{Cite news | last = Alok | first = Jha | title = Einstein fridge design can help global cooling |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 21 September 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange | accessdate =22 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124172925/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange| archivedate= 24 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-scientific legacy ==
While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to [[The Hebrew University]]. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/12/obituaries/margot-einstein-86-is-dead-stepdaughter-of-physicist.html |title=Obituary |newspaper=The New York Times |date=12 July 1986 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Albert Einstein in popular culture}}
In the period before World War II, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' published a vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that theory". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1939/01/14/1939_01_14_011_TNY_CARDS_000176356|title=Disguise|first=E. | last=Libman|date=14 January 1939|journal=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cindymctee.com/einsteins_dream.html |title=Einstein's Dream for orchestra |first=Cindy |last=McTee |publisher=Cindymctee.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a favorite model for depictions of [[mad scientist]]s and [[absent-minded professor]]s; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".&lt;ref name="slqbwn"&gt;{{Cite news |last =Golden |first =Frederic |title =Person of the Century: Albert Einstein|magazine =Time |date =3 January 2000 |url =http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.html |accessdate =25 February 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060221080452/http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.html| archivedate= 21 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
{{Main|Einstein's awards and honors}}
Einstein received numerous awards and honors and in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by [[Alfred Nobel]], so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921 |publisher=Nobel Prize |access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfréd Rényi''' (20 March 1921 – 1 February 1970) was a Hungarian [[mathematician]] who made contributions in [[combinatorics]], [[graph theory]], [[number theory]] but mostly in [[probability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Life==
Rényi was born in [[Budapest]] to Artur Rényi and Barbara Alexander; his father was a mechanical engineer while his mother was the daughter of a philosopher and literary critic, [[Bernhard Alexander]]; his uncle was [[Franz Alexander]] a Hungarian-American psychoanalyst and physician.
He was prevented from enrolling in university in 1939 due to the anti-Jewish laws then in force, but enrolled at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] in 1940 and finished his studies in 1944. At this point he was drafted to [[Labour service (Hungary)|forced labour service]], escaped, and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1947 at the [[University of Szeged]], under the advisement of [[Frigyes Riesz]]. He married Katalin Schulhof (who used Kató Rényi as her married name), herself a mathematician, in 1946; their daughter Zsuzsanna was born in 1948. After a brief assistant professorship at Budapest, he was appointed Professor Extraordinary at the [[University of Debrecen]] in 1949. In 1950, he founded the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics|Mathematics Research Institute]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], now bearing his name, and directed it until his early death. He also headed the Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics of the [[Eötvös Loránd University]], from 1952. He was elected a corresponding member (1949), full member (1956) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

==Work==
Rényi proved, using the [[large sieve]], that there is a number &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that every even number is the sum of a prime number and a number that can be written as the product of at most &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; primes. [[Chen's theorem]], a strengthening of this result, shows that the theorem is true for ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, for all sufficiently large even numbers. The case ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is the still-unproven [[Goldbach conjecture]].

In [[information theory]], he introduced the spectrum of [[Rényi entropy|Rényi entropies]] of order α, giving an important generalisation of the [[Shannon entropy]] and the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]].  The Rényi entropies give a spectrum of useful [[diversity indices]], and lead to a spectrum of [[fractal dimension]]s. The [[Rényi–Ulam game]] is a guessing game where some of the answers may be wrong.

In probability theory, he is also known for his [[Rényi's parking constants|parking constants]], which characterize the solution to the following problem: given a street of given length and cars of constant length parking on a random free position on the street, what is the density of cars when there are no more free positions? The solution to that problem is approximately equal to 74.75979% {{OEIS|A050996}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=Rényi's Parking Constants

| last=Weisstein
| work=[[MathWorld]]
| accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote 32 joint papers with [[Paul Erdős]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://wwwp.oakland.edu/Assets/upload/docs/Erdos-Number-Project/erdtrib.pdf
| title=Paul Erdős: The Master of Collaboration

It has been suggested that this sentence was originally formulated in German, where it can be interpreted as a wordplay on the double meaning of the word ''Satz'' (theorem or coffee residue), but it is more likely that the original formulation was in Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">In [[theoretical computer science]], '''Baker's technique''' is a method for designing [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]]s (PTASs) for problems on [[planar graph]]s. It is named after [[Brenda Baker]], who announced it in a 1983 conference and published it in the ''[[Journal of the ACM]]'' in 1994.

The idea for Baker's technique is to break the graph into layers, such that the problem can be solved optimally on each layer, then combine the solutions from each layer in a reasonable way that will result in a feasible solution.  This technique has given PTASs for the following problems: [[subgraph isomorphism]], [[maximum independent set]], [[minimum vertex cover]], [[minimum dominating set]], minimum [[edge dominating set]], maximum triangle matching, and many others.

The [[bidimensionality|bidimensionality theory]] of  [[Erik Demaine]], Fedor Fomin, [[Mohammad Hajiaghayi|Hajiaghayi]], and Dimitrios Thilikos and its offshoot ''simplifying decompositions'' ({{harvtxt|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|Kawarabayashi|2005}},{{harvtxt|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|Kawarabayashi|2011}}) generalizes and greatly expands the applicability of Baker's technique
for a vast set of problems on [[planar graph]]s and more generally  [[graph minor|graphs excluding a fixed minor]], such as bounded genus graphs, as well as to other classes of graphs not closed under taking minors such as the [[1-planar graph]]s.

==Example of technique==
The example that we will use to demonstrate Baker's technique is the maximum weight [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] problem.

===Algorithm===
 INDEPENDENT-SET(&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;)
 Choose an arbitrary vertex &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;k = 1/\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
 find the breadth-first search levels for &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; rooted at &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\pmod k&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\{V_0,V_1, \ldots, V_{k-1} \}&lt;/math&gt;
 for &lt;math&gt;\ell = 0, \ldots, k-1&lt;/math&gt;
 find the components &lt;math&gt;G^\ell_1, G^\ell_2, \ldots,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; after deleting &lt;math&gt;V_\ell&lt;/math&gt;
 for &lt;math&gt;i = 1,2, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;
 compute &lt;math&gt;S_i^\ell&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum-weight independent set of &lt;math&gt;G_i^\ell&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;S^\ell = \cup_i S_i^\ell&lt;/math&gt;
 let &lt;math&gt;S^{\ell^*}&lt;/math&gt; be the solution of maximum weight among &lt;math&gt;\{S^0,S^1, \ldots, S^{k-1} \}&lt;/math&gt;
 return &lt;math&gt;S^{\ell^*}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the above algorithm is feasible because each &lt;math&gt;S^\ell &lt;/math&gt; is the union of disjoint independent sets.

===Dynamic programming===
[[Dynamic programming]] is used when we compute the maximum-weight independent set for each &lt;math&gt;G_i^\ell&lt;/math&gt;. This dynamic program works because each &lt;math&gt;G_i^\ell&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-[[outerplanar graph]]. Many NP-complete problems can be solved with dynamic programming on &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-outerplanar graphs.

In [[geometry]], the '''tritetratrigonal tiling''' or '''cantic order-4 hexagonal tiling''' is a [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform]] tiling of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. It has [[Schläfli symbol]] of t&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;{(4,4,3)} or h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{6,4}.

[[File:Cartesian Product qtl1.svg|thumb|Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A \times B&lt;/math&gt; of the sets &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A=\{x,y,z\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B=\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;]]

In [[set theory]] (and, usually, in other parts of [[mathematics]]), a '''Cartesian product''' is a [[mathematical operation]] that returns a [[set (mathematics)|set]] (or '''product set''' or simply '''product''') from multiple sets. That is, for sets ''A'' and ''B'', the Cartesian product {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is the set of all [[ordered pair]]s {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} where {{nowrap|''a'' ∈ ''A''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ∈ ''B''}}. Products can be specified using [[set-builder notation]], e.g.
: &lt;math&gt;A\times B = \{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A \ \mbox{ and } \ b\in B\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=S.|title=Modern Algebra|page=6|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product {{nowrap|''rows'' × ''columns''}} is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form {{nowrap|(row value, column value)}}.

More generally, a Cartesian product of ''n'' sets, also known as an '''''n''-fold Cartesian product''', can be represented by an array of ''n'' dimensions, where each element is an ''n''-[[tuple]]. An ordered pair is a [[Tuple#Names for tuples of specific lengths|2-tuple or couple]].

The Cartesian product is named after [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartesian|date=2009|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=December 1, 2009|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cartesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose formulation of [[analytic geometry]] gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of [[direct product]].

== Examples ==

=== A deck of cards ===
[[File:Piatnikcards.jpg|thumb|Standard 52-card deck]]

An illustrative example is the [[standard 52-card deck]]. The [[Playing cards#Anglo-American|standard playing card]] ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits {{nowrap|{♠, {{color|#c00000|♥}}, {{color|#c00000|♦}}, ♣} }} form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 [[ordered pairs]], which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards. 

{{nowrap|''Ranks'' × ''Suits''}} returns a set of the form {(A, ♠), (A, {{color|#c00000|♥}}), (A, {{color|#c00000|♦}}), (A, ♣), (K, ♠), ..., (3, ♣), (2, ♠), (2, {{color|#c00000|♥}}), (2, {{color|#c00000|♦}}), (2, ♣)}.

{{nowrap|''Suits'' × ''Ranks''}} returns a set of the form {(♠, A), (♠, K), (♠, Q), (♠, J), (♠, 10), ..., ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 6), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 5), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 4), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 3), ({{color|#c00000|♥}}, 2)}.

Both sets are distinct, even disjoint.

=== A two-dimensional coordinate system ===
[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|thumb|Cartesian coordinates of example points]]

The main historical example is the [[Cartesian plane]] in [[analytic geometry]]. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, [[René Descartes]] assigned to each point in the plane a pair of [[real number]]s, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its ''x'' and ''y'' coordinates, respectively (see picture). The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product {{nowrap|ℝ×ℝ}} with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.

== Most common implementation (set theory) ==
{{Main article|Implementation of mathematics in set theory}}

A formal definition of the Cartesian product from [[set theory|set-theoretical]] principles follows from a definition of [[ordered pair]]. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the [[Ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski definition]], is &lt;math&gt;(x, y) = \{\{x\},\{x, y\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Under this definition, &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(X \cup Y))&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of that set, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[power set]] operator. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in [[ZFC]] follows from the axioms of [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of union|union]], [[axiom of power set|power set]], and [[axiom schema of specification|specification]]. Since [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are usually defined as a special case of [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.

=== Non-commutativity and non-associativity ===
Let ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' be sets.

The Cartesian product {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is not [[commutative]],
: &lt;math&gt;A \times B \neq B \times A,&lt;/math&gt;
because the [[ordered pair]]s are reversed unless at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:&lt;ref name="cnx"/&gt;
* ''A'' is equal to ''B'', or
* ''A'' or ''B'' is the [[empty set]].

For example:
: ''A'' = {1,2}; ''B'' = {3,4}
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = {1,2} × {3,4} = {(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)}
:: ''B'' × ''A'' = {3,4} × {1,2} = {(3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2)}

: ''A'' = ''B'' = {1,2}
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = ''B'' × ''A'' = {1,2} × {1,2} = {(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)}

: ''A'' = {1,2}; ''B'' = ∅
:: ''A'' × ''B'' = {1,2} × ∅ = ∅
:: ''B'' × ''A'' = ∅ × {1,2} = ∅


Strictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not [[associative]] (unless one of the involved sets is empty).
: &lt;math&gt;(A\times B)\times C \neq A \times (B \times C)&lt;/math&gt;
If for example ''A'' = {1}, then (''A'' × ''A'') × ''A'' = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = ''A'' × (''A'' × ''A'').

=== Intersections, unions, and subsets ===

The Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]] (see leftmost picture).
: &lt;math&gt;(A \cap B) \times (C \cap D) = (A \times C) \cap (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="planetmath"&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=359|title=CartesianProduct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with [[Union (set theory)|union]] (see middle picture).
: &lt;math&gt;(A \cup B) \times (C \cup D) \neq (A \times C) \cup (B \times D)&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, we have that:
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times C) \cup (B \times D) = [(A \setminus B) \times C] \cup [(A \cap B) \times (C \cup D)] \cup [(B \setminus A) \times D]&lt;/math&gt;

For the set difference we also have the following identity:
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times C) \setminus (B \times D) = [A \times (C \setminus D)] \cup [(A \setminus B) \times C] &lt;/math&gt;

Here are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (see rightmost picture):&lt;ref name="cnx"&gt;Singh, S. (August 27, 2009). ''Cartesian product''. Retrieved from the Connexions Web site: http://cnx.org/content/m15207/1.5/&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A \times (B \setminus C) = (A \times B) \setminus (A \times C),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(A \times B)^\complement = (A^\complement \times B^\complement) \cup (A^\complement \times B) \cup (A \times B^\complement),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="planetmath"/&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A^\complement&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[absolute complement]] of ''A''.

Other properties related with [[subset]]s are:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{if } A \subseteq B \text{ then } A \times C \subseteq B \times C,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\text{if both } A,B \neq \emptyset \text{ then } A \times B \subseteq C \times D \iff A \subseteq C\text{ and } B \subseteq D.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartesian Product of Subsets. (February 15, 2011). ''ProofWiki''. Retrieved 05:06, August 1, 2011 from https://proofwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Cartesian_Product_of_Subsets&amp;oldid=45868&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardinality ===
{{See also|Cardinal arithmetic}}

The [[cardinality]] of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: {{nowrap|1=''A'' = {a, b}}} and {{nowrap|1=''B'' = {5, 6}.}} Both set ''A'' and set ''B'' consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}}, results in a new set which has the following elements:
: ''A'' × ''B'' = {(a,5), (a,6), (b,5), (b,6)}.

Each element of ''A'' is paired with each element of ''B''. Each pair makes up one element of the output set.
The number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case.
The cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets. That is,
: |''A'' × ''B''| = |''A''| · |''B''|.
In this case, |''A'' × ''B''| = 4

Similarly
: |''A'' × ''B'' × ''C''| = |''A''| · |''B''| · |''C''|
and so on.

The set {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} is [[infinite set|infinite]] if either ''A'' or ''B'' is infinite and the other set is not the empty set.&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. (1998). A Crash Course in the Mathematics of Infinite Sets. ''St. John's Review, 44''(2), 35–59. Retrieved August 1, 2011, from http://www.mathpath.org/concepts/infinity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartesian products of several sets ==

=== &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-ary Cartesian product ===
The Cartesian product can be generalized to the '''''n''-ary Cartesian product''' over ''n'' sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the set

: &lt;math&gt;X_1\times\cdots\times X_n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \mid x_i \in X_i \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

of [[tuple|''n''-tuple]]s. If tuples are defined as [[Tuple#Tuples_as_nested_ordered_pairs|nested ordered pairs]], it can be identified with {{nowrap|(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × ... × ''X&lt;sub&gt;n−1&lt;/sub&gt;'') × ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If a tuple is defined as a function on {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''n''} }} that takes its value at ''i'' to be the ''i''th element of the tuple, then the Cartesian product ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×...×''X''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the set of functions

: &lt;math&gt;\{ x:\{1,\ldots,n\}\to X_1\cup\ldots\cup X_n \ | \ x(i)\in X_i \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-ary Cartesian power ===
The '''Cartesian square''' of a set ''X'' is the Cartesian product {{nowrap|1=''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''X'' × ''X''}}.
An example is the 2-dimensional [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''R''' × '''R'''}} where '''R''' is the set of [[real number]]s: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all points {{nowrap|(''x'',''y'')}} where ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers (see the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]).

The ''' ''n''-ary Cartesian power''' of a set ''X'' can be defined as

: &lt;math&gt; X^n = \underbrace{ X \times X \times \cdots \times X }_{n}= \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \ | \ x_i \in X \ \text{for every} \ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

An example of this is {{nowrap|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = '''R''' × '''R''' × '''R'''}}, with '''R''' again the set of real numbers, and more generally '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The ''n''-ary cartesian power of a set ''X'' is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the space of functions from an ''n''-element set to ''X''.  As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of ''X'' may be taken to be a [[singleton set]], corresponding to the [[empty function]] with [[codomain]] ''X''.

=== Infinite Cartesian products ===
It is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly [[Infinity|infinite]]) [[indexed family]] of sets. If ''I'' is any [[index set]], and &lt;math&gt;\{X_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of sets indexed by ''I'', then the Cartesian product of the sets in ''X'' is defined to be 

: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i = \left\{\left. f: I \to \bigcup_{i \in I} X_i\ \right|\ (\forall i)(f(i) \in X_i)\right\},&lt;/math&gt; 

that is, the set of all functions defined on the [[index set]] such that the value of the function at a particular index ''i'' is an element of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Even if each of the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the [[axiom of choice]] (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.

For each ''j'' in ''I'', the function 
: &lt;math&gt;  \pi_{j}: \prod_{i \in I} X_i \to X_{j},&lt;/math&gt;
defined by &lt;math&gt;\pi_{j}(f) = f(j)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''''j''th [[Projection (mathematics)|projection map]]'''.

'''Cartesian power''' is a Cartesian product where all the factors ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the same set ''X''. In this case, 
: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} X_i = \prod_{i \in I} X&lt;/math&gt; 
is the set of all functions from ''I'' to ''X'', and is frequently denoted ''X&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;''. This case is important in the study of [[cardinal exponentiation]]. An important special case is when the index set is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[natural numbers]]: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the ''i''th term in its corresponding set ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. For example, each element of 
: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{n = 1}^\infty \mathbb R = \mathbb R \times \mathbb R \times \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
can be visualized as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\omega&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Other forms ==

=== Abbreviated form ===
If several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, then some authors&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, M., and Rubinstein, A., 1994. ''A Course in Game Theory''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply &lt;big&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/big&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Cartesian product of functions ===
If ''f'' is a function from ''A'' to ''B'' and ''g'' is a function from ''X'' to ''Y'', their Cartesian product {{nowrap|''f'' × ''g''}} is a function from {{nowrap|''A'' × ''X''}} to {{nowrap|''B'' × ''Y''}} with
: &lt;math&gt;(f\times g)(a, x) = (f(a), g(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be extended to [[tuple]]s and infinite collections of functions.
This is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.

=== Cylinder ===
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''cylinder'' of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;B \times A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

Normally, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, then the cylinder of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;B \times \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definitions outside set theory ==

===Category theory===
Although the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, [[category theory]] provides a more general interpretation of the [[product (category theory)|product]] of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] in category theory, which is a generalization of the [[fiber product]].

[[Exponential object|Exponentiation]] is the [[right adjoint]] of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a [[final object]]) is a [[Cartesian closed category]].

===Graph theory===
In [[graph theory]] the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product of two graphs]] ''G'' and ''H'' is the graph denoted by {{nowrap|''G'' × ''H''}} whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product {{nowrap|''V''(''G'') × ''V''(''H'')}} and such that two vertices (''u'',''v'') and (''u''′,''v''′) are adjacent in {{nowrap|''G'' × ''H''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''u'' = ''u''′}} and ''v'' is adjacent with ''v''′ in ''H'', ''or'' {{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''v''′}} and ''u'' is adjacent with ''u''′ in ''G''.  The Cartesian product of graphs is not a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the sense of category theory.  Instead, the categorical product is known as the [[tensor product of graphs]].

'''Channel use''' is a quantity used in [[signal processing]] or [[telecommunication]] related to [[symbol rate]] and [[channel capacity]]. Capacity is measured in bits per input symbol into the channel (bits per channel use). If a symbol enters the channel every ''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; seconds (for every symbol period a symbol is transmitted) the channel capacity in [[bits per second]] is ''C/T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. The phrase "1 [[bit]] per channel use" denotes the transmission of 1 symbol (of duration ''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) containing 1 data bit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5395">In [[mathematics]], a '''coercive function''' is a function that "grows rapidly" at the extremes of the space on which it is defined. Depending on the context
different exact definitions of this idea are in use.

==Coercive vector fields ==
A vector field ''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is called '''coercive''' if

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x) \cdot x}{\| x \|} \to + \infty \mbox{ as } \| x \| \to + \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;" denotes the usual [[dot product]] and &lt;math&gt;\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the usual Euclidean [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the vector ''x''.

A coercive vector field is in particular norm-coercive since
&lt;math&gt;\|f(x)\| \geq  (f(x) \cdot x) / \| x \|&lt;/math&gt; for
&lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\} &lt;/math&gt;, by
[[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality|Cauchy Schwarz inequality]].
However a norm-coercive mapping
''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
is not necessarily a coercive vector field. For instance
the rotation
''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f(x) = (-x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''
by 90° is a norm-coercive mapping which fails to be a coercive vector field since
&lt;math&gt;f(x) \cdot x = 0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Coercive operators and forms==
A [[self-adjoint operator]] &lt;math&gt;A:H\to H,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a real [[Hilbert space]], is called '''coercive''' if there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;\langle Ax, x\rangle \ge c\|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[bilinear form]] &lt;math&gt;a:H\times H\to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is called '''coercive''' if there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;a(x, x)\ge c\|x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the [[Riesz representation theorem]] that any symmetric (defined as:&lt;math&gt;a(x, y)=a(y, x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;), continuous (&lt;math&gt;|a(x, y)|\le k\|x\|\,\|y\|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and some constant &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) and coercive bilinear form &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; has the representation

: &lt;math&gt;a(x, y)=\langle Ax, y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for some self-adjoint operator &lt;math&gt;A:H\to H,&lt;/math&gt; which then turns out to be a coercive operator. Also, given a coercive self-adjoint operator &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; the bilinear form &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; defined as above is coercive.

If &lt;math&gt;A:H\to H&lt;/math&gt; is a coercive operator then it is a coercive mapping (in the sense of coercivity of a vector field, where one has to replace the dot product with the more general inner product). Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\langle Ax, x\rangle \ge C\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; for big &lt;math&gt;\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;\|x\|&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, then it readily follows); then replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x\|x\|^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; we get that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a coercive operator.
One can also show that the converse holds true if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is self-adjoint. The definitions of coercivity for vector fields, operators, and bilinear forms are closely related and compatible.

==Norm-coercive mappings==
A mapping
&lt;math&gt;f : X \to X' &lt;/math&gt; between two normed vectorspaces
&lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot \|)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(X', \| \cdot \|')&lt;/math&gt;
is called '''norm-coercive''' iff

:&lt;math&gt; \|f(x)\|' \to + \infty \mbox{ as } \|x\| \to +\infty &lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \to X' &lt;/math&gt; between two [[topological space]]s &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; is called '''coercive''' if for every [[compact space|compact subset]] &lt;math&gt;K'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt; there exists a compact subset &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;f (X \setminus K) \subseteq X' \setminus K'.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[function composition|composition]] of a [[bijection|bijective]] [[proper map]] followed by a coercive map is coercive.

==(Extended valued) coercive functions==
An (extended valued) function
&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{- \infty, + \infty\}&lt;/math&gt;
is called '''coercive''' iff
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \to + \infty \mbox{ as } \| x \| \to + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
A realvalued coercive function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
is in particular norm-coercive. However a norm-coercive function
&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is not necessarily coercive.
For instance the identity function on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt; is norm-coercive
but not coercive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12898">A '''color appearance model''' (abbreviated '''CAM''') is a mathematical model that seeks to describe the [[perception|perceptual]] aspects of human [[color vision]], i.e. viewing conditions under which the appearance of a color does not tally with the corresponding physical measurement of the stimulus source. (In contrast, a [[color model]] defines a [[coordinate space]] to describe colors, such as the [[RGB color model|RGB]] and [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] color models.)

==Color appearance==
[[Color]] originates in the mind of the observer; “objectively”, there is only the [[spectral power distribution]] of the light that meets the eye. In this sense, ''any'' color perception is subjective. However, successful attempts have been made to map the spectral power distribution of light to human sensory response in a quantifiable way. In 1931, using [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] measurements, the [[International Commission on Illumination|International Commission on Illumination (CIE)]] created the [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ color space]]&lt;ref&gt;“XYZ” refers to a color ''model'' and a color ''space'' at the same time, because the XYZ color space is the only color space that uses the XYZ color model. This differs from e.g. the RGB color model, which many color spaces (such as [[sRGB]] or [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB (1998)]]) use.&lt;/ref&gt; which successfully models human color vision on this basic sensory level.

However, the XYZ color model presupposes specific viewing conditions (such as the retinal locus of stimulation, the luminance level of the light that meets the eye, the background behind the observed object, and the luminance level of the surrounding light). Only if all these conditions stay constant will two identical stimuli with thereby identical XYZ [[CIE 1931 color space#Tristimulus values|tristimulus]] values create an identical color ''appearance'' for a human observer. If some conditions change in one case, two identical stimuli with thereby identical XYZ tristimulus values will create ''different'' color ''appearances'' (and vice versa: two different stimuli with thereby different XYZ tristimulus values might create an ''identical'' color ''appearance'').

Therefore, if viewing conditions vary, the XYZ color model is not sufficient, and a color appearance model is required to model human color perception.

==Color appearance parameters==
The basic challenge for any color appearance model is that human color perception does not work in terms of XYZ tristimulus values, but in terms of '''appearance parameters''' ([[hue]], [[lightness]], [[brightness]], [[colorfulness|chroma, colorfulness and saturation]]). So any color appearance model needs to provide transformations (which factor in viewing conditions) from the XYZ tristimulus values to these appearance parameters (at least hue, lightness and chroma).

==Color appearance phenomena==
This section describes some of the color appearance phenomena that color appearance models try to deal with.

===Chromatic adaptation===
[[Chromatic adaptation]] describes the ability of human color perception to abstract from the [[white point]] (or [[color temperature]]) of the illuminating light source when observing a reflective object. For the human eye, a piece of white paper looks white no matter whether the illumination is blueish or yellowish. This is the most basic and most important of all color appearance phenomena, and therefore a '''chromatic adaptation transform''' ('''CAT''') that tries to emulate this behavior is a central component of any color appearance model.

This allows for an easy distinction between simple tristimulus-based color models and color appearance models. A simple tristimulus-based color model ignores the white point of the illuminant when it describes the surface color of an illuminated object; if the white point of the illuminant changes, so does the color of the surface as reported by the simple tristimulus-based color model. In contrast, a color appearance model takes the white point of the illuminant into account (which is why a color appearance model requires this value for its calculations); if the white point of the illuminant changes, the color of the surface as reported by the color appearance model remains the same.

Chromatic adaptation is a prime example for the case that two different stimuli with thereby different XYZ tristimulus values create an ''identical'' color ''appearance''. If the color temperature of the illuminating light source changes, so do the spectral power distribution and thereby the XYZ tristimulus values of the light reflected from the white paper; the color ''appearance'', however, stays the same (white).

===Hue appearance===
Several effects change the perception of hue by a human observer:

* '''[[Bezold–Brücke shift|Bezold–Brücke hue shift]]:''' The hue of monochromatic light changes with [[luminance]].
* '''[[Abney effect]]:''' The hue of monochromatic light changes with the addition of white light (which would be expected color-neutral).

===Contrast appearance===
[[File:Bartleson-Breneman effect.png|thumb|200px|Bartleson-Breneman effect]]
Several effects change the perception of [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] by a human observer:

* '''Stevens effect:''' Contrast increases with luminance.
* '''Bartleson-Breneman effect:''' Image contrast (of emissive images such as images on an LCD display) increases with the luminance of surround lighting.

===Colorfulness appearance===
There is an effect which changes the perception of colorfulness by a human observer:

* '''Hunt effect:''' Colorfulness increases with luminance.

===Brightness appearance===
There is an effect which changes the perception of brightness by a human observer:

* '''[[Helmholtz–Kohlrausch effect]]:''' Brightness increases with saturation.

===Spatial phenomena===
Spatial phenomena only affect colors at a specific location of an image, because the human brain interprets this location in a specific contextual way (e.g. as a shadow instead of gray color). These phenomena are also known as [[optical illusion#Color and brightness constancies|optical illusions]]. Because of their contextuality, they are especially hard to model; color appearance models that try to do this are referred to as [[ICAM (Color Appearance Model)|image color appearance models (iCAM)]].

==Color appearance models==
Since the color appearance parameters and color appearance phenomena are numerous and the task is complex, there is no single color appearance model that is universally applied; instead, various models are used.

This section lists some of the color appearance models in use. The chromatic adaptation transforms for some of these models are listed in [[LMS color space]].

===CIELAB===
In 1976, the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] set out to replace the many existing, incompatible color difference models by a new, universal model for color difference. They tried to achieve this goal by creating a ''perceptually uniform'' color space, i.e. a color space where identical spatial distance between two colors equals identical amount of perceived color difference. Though they succeeded only partially, they thereby created the [[Lab color space#CIELAB|CIELAB (“L*a*b*”)]] color space which had all the necessary features to become the first color appearance model. While CIELAB is a very rudimentary color appearance model, it is one of the most widely used because it has become one of the building blocks of [[color management]] with [[ICC profile]]s. Therefore, it is basically omnipresent in digital imaging.

One of the limitations of CIELAB is that it does not offer a full-fledged chromatic adaptation in that it performs the [[von Kries transform]] method directly in the XYZ color space (often referred to as “wrong von Kries transform”), instead of changing into the [[LMS color space]] first for more precise results. ICC profiles circumvent this shortcoming by using the [[LMS color space#CIECAM97s, LLAB|Bradford transformation matrix]] to the LMS color space (which had first appeared in the [[#LLAB|LLAB color appearance model]]) in conjunction with CIELAB.

===Nayatani et al. model===
The Nayatani et al. color appearance model focuses on illumination engineering and the color rendering properties of light sources.

===Hunt model===
The Hunt color appearance model focuses on color image reproduction (its creator worked in the [[Kodak#Kodak_Research_Laboratories|Kodak Research Laboratories]]). Development already started in the 1980s and by 1995 the model had become very complex (including features no other color appearance model offers, such as incorporating [[rod cell]] responses) and allowed to predict a wide range of visual phenomena. It had a very significant impact on [[#CIECAM02|CIECAM02]], but because of its complexity the Hunt model itself is difficult to use.

===RLAB===
RLAB tries to improve upon the significant limitations of [[#CIELAB|CIELAB]] with a focus on image reproduction. It performs well for this task and is simple to use, but not comprehensive enough for other applications.

===LLAB===
LLAB is similar to [[#RLAB|RLAB]], also tries to stay simple, but additionally tries to be more comprehensive than RLAB. In the end, it traded some simplicity for comprehensiveness, but was still not fully comprehensive. Since [[#CIECAM97s|CIECAM97s]] was published soon thereafter, LLAB never gained widespread usage.

===CIECAM97s===
After starting the evolution of color appearance models with [[#CIELAB|CIELAB]], in 1997, the CIE wanted to follow up itself with a comprehensive color appearance model. The result was CIECAM97s, which was comprehensive, but also complex and partly difficult to use. It gained widespread acceptance as a standard color appearance model until [[#CIECAM02|CIECAM02]] was published.

===IPT===
Ebner and Fairchild addressed the issue of non-constant lines of hue in their color space dubbed ''IPT''.&lt;ref&gt;

 | year = 1998
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The IPT color space converts [[Illuminant D65|D65]]-adapted [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ]] data (XD65, YD65, ZD65) to long-medium-short cone response data (LMS) using an adapted form of the Hunt-Pointer-Estevez matrix (MHPE(D65)).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPT color appearance model excels at providing a formulation for hue where a constant hue value equals a constant perceived hue independent of the values of lightness and chroma (which is the general ideal for any color appearance model, but hard to achieve). It is therefore well-suited for [[Color management#Gamut mapping|gamut mapping]] implementations.

===ICtCp===
ITU-R BT.2100 includes a color space called ''[[ICtCp]]'', which improves the original IPT by exploring higher dynamic
range and larger colour gamuts.&lt;ref&gt;

 | title = ICtCp Introduction
 | url = https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-vision/ictcp-white-paper.pdf
 | year = 2016
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIECAM02===
After the success of [[#CIECAM97s|CIECAM97s]], the CIE developed [[CIECAM02]] as its successor and published it in 2002. It performs better and is simpler at the same time. Apart from the rudimentary [[#CIELAB|CIELAB]] model, CIECAM02 comes closest to an internationally agreed upon “standard” for a (comprehensive) color appearance model.

===iCAM06===
[[ICAM (Color Appearance Model)|iCAM06]] is an [[ICAM (Color Appearance Model)|image color appearance model]]. As such, it does not treat each pixel of an image independently, but in the context of the complete image.  This allows it to incorporate spatial color appearance parameters like contrast, which makes it well-suited for [[High-dynamic-range imaging|HDR]] images.  It is also a first step to deal with [[#Spatial phenomena|spatial appearance phenomena]].

[[image|Images]] take a rather prominent place in contemporary life in the western societies. Together with language, they have been connected to human culture from the very beginning. For about one century – after several millennia of written word's dominance – their part is increasing again remarkably. Steps toward a general science of images, which we may call 'general visualistics' in analogy to general linguistics, have only been taken recently. So far, a unique scientific basis for circumscribing and describing the heterogeneous phenomenon "image" in an interpersonally verifiable manner hasstill been missing while distinct aspects falling in the domain of visualistics have predominantly been dealt with in several other disciplines, among them in particular [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[art history]]. Last (though not least), important contributions to certain aspects of a new science of images have come from computer science.

In [[computer science]], too, considering pictures evolved originally along several more or less independent questions, which lead to proper sub-disciplines: [[computer graphics]] is certainly the most "visible" among them. Only just recently, the effort has been increased to finally form a unique and partially autonomous branch of computer science dedicated to images in general. In analogy to [[computational linguistics]], the artificial expression ''computational visualistics'' is used for addressing the whole range of investigating scientifically pictures "in" the computer.

==Areas covered==
For a science of images within computer science, the abstract [[data type]] »image« (or perhaps several such types) stands in the center of interest together with the potential implementations (cf. [http://www.jrjs.de/Work/Papers/P05/P05-3/index.html Schirra 2005]). There 
are three main groups of [[algorithms]] for that data type to be considered in computational visualistics:

===Algorithms from »image« to »image«===
In the field called [[image processing]], the focus of attention is formed by the operations that take (at least) one picture (and potentially several secondary parameters that are not images) and relate it to another picture. With these operations, we can define algorithms for improving the quality of images (e.g., contrast reinforcement), and procedures for extracting certain parts of an image (e.g., edge finding) or for stamping out pictorial patterns following a particular Gestalt criterion (e.g., blue screen technique). Compression algorithms for the efficient storing or transmitting of pictorial data also belong into this field.

===Algorithms from »image« to "not-image"===
Two disciplines share the operations transforming images into non-pictorial data items. The field of [[pattern recognition]] is actually not restricted to pictures. But it has performed important precursory work for computational visualistics since the early 1950s in those areas that essentially classify information in given images: the identification of simple geometric Gestalts (e.g., "circular region"), the classification of letters (recognition of handwriting), the "seeing" of spatial objects in the images or even the association of stylistic attributes of the representation. That is, the images are to be associated with instances of a non-pictorial data type forming a description of some of their aspects. The neighboring field of [[computer vision]] is the part of AI ([[artificial intelligence]]) in which computer scientists try to teach – loosely speaking – computers the ability of visual [[perception]]. Therefore, a problem rather belongs to computer vision to the degree to which its goal is "semantic", i.e., the result approximates the human seeing of objects in a picture.

===Algorithms from "not-image" to »image«===
The investigation of possibilities gained by the operations that result in instances of the data type »image« but take as a starting point instances of non-pictorial data types is performed in particular in [[computer graphics]] and [[information visualization]]. The former deals with images in the closer sense, i.e., those pictures showing spatial configurations of objects (in the colloquial meaning of 'object') in a more or less naturalistic representation like, e.g., in virtual architecture. The starting point of the picture-generating algorithms in computer graphics is usually a data type that allows us to describe the geometry in three dimensions and the lighting of the scene to be depicted together with the important optical properties of the surfaces considered. Scientists in information visualization are interested in presenting pictorially any other data type, in particular those that consist of non-visual components in a "space" of states: in order to do so, a convention of visual presentation has firstly to be determined – e.g., a code of colors or certain icons. The well-known fractal images (e.g., of the [[Mandelbrot set]]) form a borderline case of information visualization since an abstract mathematical property has been visualized.

==Computational Visualistics Degree Programmes==
The subject of computational visualistics was introduced at the [[Otto-von-Guericke_University_Magdeburg|University of Magdeburg]], Germany, in the fall of 1996. It was initiated by Thomas Strothotte, Prof. for computer graphics in Magdeburg and largely supported by Jörg Schirra together with a whole team of interdisciplinary researchers from the social and technical sciences as well as from medicine.
This five-year diploma programme has computer science courses as its core: students learn about digital methods and electronic tools for solving picture-related problems. The technological areas of endeavour are complemented by courses on pictures in the humanities. In
addition to learning about the traditional (i.e. not computerized) contexts of using pictures, students intensively practice their communicative skills. As the third component of the program, an application subject such as biology and medicine gives students an early opportunity to apply their knowledge in that they learn the skills needed for co-operating with clients and experts in other fields where digital image data are essential, e.g. microscopy and radiologic image data in biology and medicine. Bachelor and Master's programmes have been introduced in 2006.  

The expression 'computational visualistics' is also used for a similar degree programme of the [[University of Koblenz and Landau|University at Koblenz-Landau]].

'''CIAA''', the '''International Conference on Implementation and Application of Automata''' is an annual [[academic conference]] in the field of [[computer science]]. 
Its purpose is to bring together members of the academic, research, and industrial community who have an interest in the theory, implementation, and application of automata and related structures. There, the conference concerns research on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects. In 2000, the conference grew out of the '''Workshop on Implementation of Automata (WIA)'''.

Like most theoretical computer science conferences its contributions are strongly peer-reviewed; the articles appear in proceedings published in [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]]. Extended versions of selected papers of each year's conference alternatingly appear in the journals [[Theoretical Computer Science (journal)|Theoretical Computer Science]] and [[International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science]]. Every year a best paper award is presented.

== Topics of the Conference ==
Since the focus of the conference is on applied theory, 
contributions usually come from a widespread range of application domains.  
Typical topics of the conference include, among others, the following, 
as they relate to automata:

* [[Bio-inspired computing]]
* Complexity of automata operations, [[state complexity]]
* [[Compiler]]s
* Computer-aided verification, [[model checking]]
* Concurrency
* [[Data compression|Data and image compression]]
* Design and architecture of automata software
* Document engineering
* [[Natural language processing]]
* [[Pattern matching]]
* Teaching of [[automata theory]]
* [[Text processing]]
* Techniques for graphical display of automata

== History of the Conference ==

The CIAA conference series was founded by [[Sheng Yu (computer scientist)|Sheng Yu]] and [[Derick Wood]].
Since 2013, the Steering committee is chaired by [[Kai Salomaa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43515">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], a '''copula''' is a multivariate probability distribution for which the [[marginal probability]] distribution of each variable is [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]]. Copulas are used to describe the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependence]] between [[random variable]]s. Their name comes from the Latin for "link" or "tie", similar but unrelated to grammatical [[Copula (linguistics)|copulas]] in [[linguistics]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.  Copulas have been used widely in quantitative finance to model and minimize tail risk&lt;ref name="Banking 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Alcock|first2=J.|last3=Faff|first3=R.|last4=Brailsford|first4=T.|title=Canonical vine copulas in the context of modern portfolio management: Are they worth it?|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|date=2013|volume=37|issue=8|doi= 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.02.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portfolio optimization applications.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abe Sklar|Sklar]]'s theorem states that any multivariate [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint distribution]] can be written in terms of univariate [[marginal distribution|marginal-distribution]] functions and a copula which describes the dependence structure between the variables.

Copulas are popular in high-dimensional statistical applications as they allow one to easily model and estimate the distribution of random vectors by estimating marginals and copulae separately. There are many parametric copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular parametric copula models are outlined below.

Two-dimensional copulas are known in some other areas of mathematics under the name ''permutons'' and ''doubly-stochastic measures''.

==Mathematical definition==
Consider a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose its marginals are continuous, i.e. the marginal [[Cumulative distribution function|CDFs]] &lt;math&gt;F_i(x) = \mathrm{Pr}[X_i\leq x] &lt;/math&gt; are continuous functions. By applying the [[probability integral transform]] to each component, the random vector
:&lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)=\left(F_1(X_1),F_2(X_2),\dots,F_d(X_d)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
has [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] distributed marginals.

The copula of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint cumulative distribution function]] of &lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[U_1\leq u_1,U_2\leq u_2,\dots,U_d\leq u_d] .&lt;/math&gt;

The copula ''C'' contains all information on the dependence structure between the components of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; whereas the marginal cumulative distribution functions &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; contain all information on the marginal distributions.

The importance of the above is that the reverse of these steps can be used to generate [[pseudo-random]] samples from general classes of [[multivariate probability distribution]]s. That is, given a procedure to generate a sample &lt;math&gt;(U_1,U_2,\dots,U_d)&lt;/math&gt; from the copula distribution, the required sample can be constructed as
:&lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d) = \left(F_1^{-1}(U_1),F_2^{-1}(U_2),\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The inverses &lt;math&gt;F_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are unproblematic as the &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; were assumed to be continuous. The above formula for the copula function can be rewritten to correspond to this as:
:&lt;math&gt;C(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\leq F_1^{-1}(u_1),X_2\leq F_2^{-1}(u_2),\dots,X_d\leq F_d^{-1}(u_d)] .&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==

In [[probability theory|probabilistic]] terms, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if ''C'' is a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] of a ''d''-dimensional random vector on the [[unit cube]] &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; with [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[marginal distribution|marginals]].&lt;ref name="nelsen"&gt;{{Citation |first=Roger B. |last=Nelsen |year=1999 |title=An Introduction to Copulas |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-98623-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Multivariable calculus|analytic]] terms, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if
:* &lt;math&gt;C(u_1,\dots,u_{i-1},0,u_{i+1},\dots,u_d)=0 &lt;/math&gt;, the copula is zero if one of the arguments is zero,
:*  &lt;math&gt;C(1,\dots,1,u,1,\dots,1)=u &lt;/math&gt;, the copula is equal to ''u'' if one argument is ''u'' and all others 1,
:* ''C'' is ''d''-non-decreasing, i.e., for each [[hyperrectangle]] &lt;math&gt;B=\prod_{i=1}^{d}[x_i,y_i]\subseteq [0,1]^d &lt;/math&gt; the ''C''-volume of ''B'' is non-negative:
:*:&lt;math&gt; \int_B dC(u) =\sum_{\mathbf z\in \times_{i=1}^{d}\{x_i,y_i\}} (-1)^{N(\mathbf z)} C(\mathbf z)\ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;
::where the &lt;math&gt;N(\mathbf z)=\#\{k : z_k=x_k\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For instance, in the bivariate case, &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a bivariate copula if &lt;math&gt;C(0,u) = C(u,0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C(1,u) = C(u,1) = u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(u_2,v_2)-C(u_2,v_1)-C(u_1,v_2)+C(u_1,v_1) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;0 \leq u_1 \leq u_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \leq v_1 \leq v_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Sklar's theorem==
[[File:Gaussian copula gaussian marginals.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of a Bivariate Gaussian Distribution]]
[[File:Biv gumbel dist.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of two Normal marginals joint with a Gumbel copula]]

Sklar's theorem,&lt;ref name="Sklar 1959"&gt;{{citation | last=Sklar | first=A. | authorlink = Abe Sklar | title=Fonctions de répartition à n dimensions et leurs marges | journal=Publ. Inst. Statist. Univ. Paris | year=1959 | volume=8 | pages=229–231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Abe Sklar]], provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas.
Sklar's theorem states that every [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|multivariate cumulative distribution function]]
:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d)=\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\leq x_1,\dots,X_d\leq x_d]&lt;/math&gt;
of a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of its marginals &lt;math&gt;F_i(x_i) = \mathrm{Pr}[X_i\leq x_i] &lt;/math&gt; and
a copula &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d) = C\left(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d) \right). &lt;/math&gt;

In case that the multivariate distribution has a density &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and this is available, it holds further that
:&lt;math&gt;h(x_1,\dots,x_d)= c(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))\cdot f_1(x_1)\cdot\dots\cdot f_d(x_d),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the copula.

The theorem also states that, given &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the copula is unique on &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Ran}(F_1)\times\cdots\times \operatorname{Ran}(F_d) &lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[cartesian product]] of the [[Range (mathematics)|ranges]] of the marginal cdf's. This implies that the copula is unique if the marginals &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; are continuous.

The converse is also true: given a copula &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; and margins &lt;math&gt;F_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;C\left(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d) \right)&lt;/math&gt; defines a ''d''-dimensional cumulative distribution function.

==Fréchet–Hoeffding copula bounds==
[[File:copule ord.svg|thumb|right|Graphs of the bivariate Fréchet–Hoeffding copula limits and of the independence copula (in the middle).]]

The Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem (after [[Maurice René Fréchet]] and [[Wassily Hoeffding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hoeffding.html |title=Biography of Wassily Hoeffding |author="J J O'Connor and E F Robertson" |date= March 2011 |publisher= School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) states that for any Copula &lt;math&gt;C:[0,1]^d\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;(u_1,\dots,u_d)\in[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; the following bounds hold:
: &lt;math&gt;W(u_1,\dots,u_d) \leq C(u_1,\dots,u_d) \leq M(u_1,\dots,u_d).&lt;/math&gt;
The function '''W''' is called lower Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; W(u_1,\ldots,u_d) = \max\left\{1-d+\sum\limits_{i=1}^d {u_i} , 0 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The function '''M''' is called upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; M(u_1,\ldots,u_d) = \min \{u_1,\dots,u_d\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The upper bound is sharp: ''M'' is always a copula, it corresponds to [[comonotonicity|comonotone random variables]].

The lower bound is point-wise sharp, in the sense that for fixed '''u''', there is a copula &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}(u) = W(u)&lt;/math&gt;. However, ''W'' is a copula only in two dimensions, in which case it corresponds to countermonotonic random variables.

In two dimensions, i.e. the bivariate case, the Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem states
: &lt;math&gt;\max(u+v-1,0) \leq C(u,v) \leq \min\{u,v\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Families of copulas==

Several families of copulas have been described.

===Gaussian copula===
[[File:Copula gaussian.svg|thumb|Cumulative and density distribution of Gaussian copula with ''ρ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.4]]

The Gaussian copula is a distribution over the unit cube &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt;. It is constructed from a [[multivariate normal distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; by using the [[probability integral transform]].

For a given [[correlation matrix]] &lt;math&gt;R\in[-1, 1]^{d\times d}&lt;/math&gt;, the Gaussian copula with parameter matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; C_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u) = \Phi_R\left(\Phi^{-1}(u_1),\dots, \Phi^{-1}(u_d) \right), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_R&lt;/math&gt; is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to the correlation matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. While there is no simple analytical formula for the copula function, &lt;math&gt;C_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u)&lt;/math&gt;, it can be upper or lower bounded, and  approximated using numerical integration.&lt;ref name="bo16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botev|first1=Z.

:&lt;math&gt; c_R^{\text{Gauss}}(u)
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det{R}}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_d)\end{pmatrix}^T \cdot
\left(R^{-1}-I\right) \cdot
\begin{pmatrix}\Phi^{-1}(u_1)\\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(u_d)\end{pmatrix}
\right), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity matrix.

===Archimedean copulas===

Archimedean copulas are an associative class of copulas. Most common Archimedean copulas admit an explicit formula, something not possible for instance for the Gaussian copula.
In practice, Archimedean copulas are popular because they allow modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter, governing the strength of dependence.

A copula '''C''' is called Archimedean if it admits the representation&lt;ref name="Nelsen 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelsen |first=R. B. |year=2006 |title=An Introduction to Copulas, Second Edition |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media Inc. |location=New York, NY 10013, USA |isbn=978-1-4419-2109-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; C(u_1,\dots,u_d;\theta) = \psi^{[-1]}\left(\psi(u_1;\theta)+\cdots+\psi(u_d;\theta);\theta\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi\!:[0,1]\times\Theta \rightarrow [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous, strictly decreasing and convex function such that &lt;math&gt;\psi(1;\theta)=0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter within some parameter space &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the so-called generator function and &lt;math&gt;\psi^{[-1]}&lt;/math&gt; is its pseudo-inverse defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \psi^{[-1]}(t;\theta) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \psi^{-1}(t;\theta) &amp; \mbox{if }0 \leq t \leq \psi(0;\theta) \\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if }\psi(0;\theta) \leq t \leq\infty. \end{array}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the above formula for '''C''' yields a copula for &lt;math&gt;\psi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\psi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[d-monotone function|d-monotone]] on &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McNeil |first=A.

That is, if it is &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; times differentiable and the derivatives satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; (-1)^k\psi^{-1,(k)}(t;\theta) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,\dots,d-2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{d-2}\psi^{-1,(d-2)}(t;\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is nonincreasing and [[convex function|convex]].

The following tables highlight the most prominent bivariate Archimedean copulas, with their corresponding generator. Note that not all of them are [[completely monotone function|completely monotone]], i.e. ''d''-monotone for all &lt;math&gt;d\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; or ''d''-monotone for certain &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \Theta&lt;/math&gt; only.

==Expectation for copula models and Monte Carlo integration==

In statistical applications, many problems can be formulated in the following way. One is interested in the expectation of a response function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; applied to some random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J. McNeil, Rudiger Frey and Paul Embrechts (2005) "Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques, and Tools", Princeton Series in Finance&lt;/ref&gt; If we denote the cdf of this random vector with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity of interest can thus be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{E}\left[ g(X_1,\dots,X_d) \right] = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} g(x_1,\dots,x_d) \,  dH(x_1,\dots,x_d).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is given by a copula model, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;H(x_1,\dots,x_d)=C(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))&lt;/math&gt;

this expectation can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{[0,1]^d}g(F_1^{-1}(u_1),\dots,F_d^{-1}(u_d)) \, dC(u_1,\dots,u_d).&lt;/math&gt;

In case the copula '''C''' is [[absolutely continuous]], i.e. '''C''' has a density '''c''', this equation can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{[0,1]^d}g(F_1^{-1}(u_1),\dots,F_d^{-1}(u_d))\cdot c(u_1,\dots,u_d) \, du_1\cdots du_d,&lt;/math&gt;
and if each marginal distribution has the density &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; it holds further that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}g(x_1,\dots x_d)\cdot c(F_1(x_1),\dots,F_d(x_d))\cdot f_1(x_1)\cdots f_d(x_d) \, dx_1\cdots dx_d.&lt;/math&gt;

If copula and margins are known (or if they have been estimated), this expectation can be approximated through the following Monte Carlo algorithm:
# Draw a sample &lt;math&gt;(U_1^k,\dots,U_d^k)\sim C\;\;(k=1,\dots,n)&lt;/math&gt; of size '''n''' from the copula '''C'''
# By applying the inverse marginal cdf's, produce a sample of &lt;math&gt;(X_1,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;(X_1^k,\dots,X_d^k)=(F_1^{-1}(U_1^k),\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d^k))\sim H\;\;(k=1,\dots,n)&lt;/math&gt;
# Approximate &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]&lt;/math&gt; by its empirical value:
:::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}\left[g(X_1,\dots,X_d)\right]\approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n g(X_1^k,\dots,X_d^k)&lt;/math&gt;

==Empirical copulas==

When studying multivariate data, one might want to investigate the underlying copula. Suppose we have observations
:&lt;math&gt;(X_1^i,X_2^i,\dots,X_d^i), \, i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;
from a random vector &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\dots,X_d)&lt;/math&gt; with continuous margins. The corresponding "true" copula observations would be
:&lt;math&gt;(U_1^i,U_2^i,\dots,U_d^i)=\left(F_1(X_1^i),F_2(X_2^i),\dots,F_d(X_d^i)\right), \, i=1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
However, the marginal distribution functions &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; are usually not known. Therefore, one can construct pseudo copula observations by using the empirical distribution functions
:&lt;math&gt;F_k^n(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}(X_k^i\leq x)&lt;/math&gt;
instead. Then, the pseudo copula observations are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(\tilde{U}_1^i,\tilde{U}_2^i,\dots,\tilde{U}_d^i)=\left(F_1^n(X_1^i),F_2^n(X_2^i),\dots,F_d^n(X_d^i)\right), \, i=1,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
The corresponding empirical copula is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;C^n(u_1,\dots,u_d) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}\left(\tilde{U}_1^i\leq u_1,\dots,\tilde{U}_d^i\leq u_d\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The components of the pseudo copula samples can also be written as &lt;math&gt;\tilde{U}_k^i=R_k^i/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R_k^i&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of the observation &lt;math&gt;X_k^i&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;R_k^i=\sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{1}(X_k^j\leq X_k^i)&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the empirical copula can be seen as the empirical distribution of the rank transformed data.

In [[quantitative finance]] copulas are applied to [[risk management]], to [[investment management|portfolio management]] and [[portfolio optimization|optimization]], and to [[derivatives pricing]].

For the former, copulas are used to perform [[Stress test (financial)|stress-tests]] and robustness checks that are especially important during "downside/crisis/panic regimes" where extreme downside events may occur (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007–2008).  The formula was also adapted for financial markets and was used to estimate the probability distribution of losses on [[Securitization|pools of loans or bonds]].

During a downside regime, a large number of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in 'safer' investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a [[flight-to-quality]] effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers in a short period of time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, anecdotally, we often read financial news headlines reporting the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on the stock exchange in a single day; however, we rarely read reports of positive stock market gains of the same magnitude and in the same short time frame.

Copulas aid in analyzing the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the [[marginal distribution|marginals]] and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting of a large number of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to [[herd behavior|herd their trading behaviour and decisions]]. (See also [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants, or agents.)

The users of the formula have been criticized for creating "evaluation cultures" that continued to use simple copulæ despite the simple versions being acknowledged as inadequate for that purpose.&lt;ref name = "MacKenzieSpears"&gt;{{cite techreport |last1= MacKenzie |first1= Donald |last2= Spears |first2= Taylor |title= "The Formula That Killed Wall Street"?

The Clayton canonical vine copula allows for the occurrence of extreme downside events and has been successfully applied in [[portfolio optimization]] and risk management applications. The model is able to reduce the effects of extreme downside correlations and produces improved statistical and economic performance compared to scalable elliptical dependence copulas such as the Gaussian and Student-t copula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other models developed for risk management applications are panic copulas that are glued with market estimates of the marginal distributions to analyze the effects of [[financial panic|panic regimes]] on the portfolio profit and loss distribution. Panic copulas are created by [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|Monte Carlo simulation]], mixed with a re-weighting of the probability of each scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As regards [[derivatives pricing]], dependence modelling with copula functions is widely used in applications of [[Financial risk modeling|financial risk assessment]] and [[actuarial analysis]] – for example in the pricing of [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Meneguzzo|first1=David|title=Copula sensitivity in collateralized debt obligations and basket default swaps|date=Nov 2003|journal=[[Journal of Futures Markets]]|volume=24|issue=1|pages=37–70|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;|doi=10.1002/fut.10110|id=|quote=|last2=Vecchiato|first2=Walter|authorlink=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2008-10-29 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe the methodology of applying the Gaussian copula to [[credit derivative]]s to be one of the reasons behind the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant?currentPage=all Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street] ''Wired'', 2/23/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Despite this perception, there are documented attempts within the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the limitations of the Gaussian copula and of copula functions more generally, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics.  The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the variance-covariance matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''disjoint union of graphs''' is an operation that combines two or more [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] to form a larger graph.
It is analogous to the [[disjoint union|disjoint union of sets]], and is constructed by making the vertex set of the result be the disjoint union of the vertex sets of the given graphs, and by making the edge set of the result be the disjoint union of the edge sets of the given graphs. Any disjoint union of two or more nonempty graphs is necessarily [[connectivity (graph theory)|disconnected]].

==Notation==
The disjoint union is also called the '''graph sum''', and may be represented either by a [[plus sign]] or a circled plus sign: If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are two graphs, then &lt;math&gt;G+H&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;G\oplus H&lt;/math&gt; denotes their disjoint union.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics|series=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|first=Kenneth H.|last=Rosen|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=9780849301490|page=515|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yJIMx9nXB6kC&amp;pg=PA515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related graph classes==
Certain special classes of graphs may be represented using disjoint union operations. In particular:

More generally, every graph is the disjoint union of [[connected graph]]s, its [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s.

The [[cograph]]s are the graphs that can be constructed from single-vertex graphs by a combination of disjoint union and [[Complement graph|complement]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Corneil | first1=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6683">'''Distributed algorithmic mechanism design''' (DAMD) is an extension of [[algorithmic mechanism design]].

DAMD differs from [[Algorithmic mechanism design]] since the [[algorithm]] is computed in a distributed manner rather than by a central authority.  This greatly improves [[Computational complexity theory#Computational resources|computation time]] since the burden is shared by all [[Agent (economics)|agents]] within a [[Computer network|network]].

One major obstacle in DAMD is ensuring that [[Agent (economics)|agents]] reveal the true costs or [[preference]]s related to a given scenario.  Often these [[Agent (economics)|agents]] would rather lie in order to improve their own [[utility]].
DAMD is full of new challenges since one can no longer assume an obedient networking and mechanism infrastructure where rational players control the message paths and mechanism computation.

== Game Theoretic Model ==
[[Game theory]] and [[distributed computing]] both deal with a system with many agents, in which the agents may possibly pursue different goals. However they have different focuses. For instance one of the concerns of distributed computing is to prove the correctness of algorithms that tolerate faulty agents and agents performing actions concurrently. On the other hand, in game theory the focus is on devising a strategy which leads us to an equilibrium in the system.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halpern|first1=Joseph Y.|title=Computer science and game theory: A brief survey|journal=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nash equilibrium ===
[[Nash equilibrium]] is the most commonly-used notion of equilibrium in game theory. However Nash equilibrium does not deal with faulty or unexpected behavior. A protocol that reaches Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to execute correctly in the face of rational agents, with no agent being able to improve its utility by deviating from the protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Osborne|last2=Rubinstein|first2=Ariel|title=A course in game theory|date=1994|publisher=MIT press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solution Preference ===
There is no trusted center as there is in [[Algorithmic mechanism design|AMD]].  Thus, mechanisms must be implemented by the agents themselves. The solution preference assumption requires that each agent prefers any outcome to no outcome at all:  thus, agents have no incentive to disagree on an outcome or cause the algorithm to fail. In other words, as Afek et al. said, “agents cannot gain if the algorithm fails”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Afek|first1=Yehuda|last2=Ginzberg|first2=Yehonatan|last3=Feibish|first3=Shir Landau|last4=Sulamy|first4=Moshe|title=Distributed computing building blocks for rational agents|journal=PODC '14 Proceedings of the 2014 ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, though agents have preferences, they have no incentive to fail the algorithm.

=== Truthfulness ===
A mechanism is considered to be truthful if the agents gain nothing by lying about 
their or other agents' values.
A good example would be a [[leader election]] algorithm that selects a computation server within a network. The algorithm specifies that agents should send their total computational power to each other, after which the most powerful agent is chosen as the leader to complete the task. In this algorithm agents may lie about their true computation power because they are potentially in danger of being tasked with CPU-intensive jobs which will reduce their power to complete local jobs. This can be overcome with the help of truthful mechanisms which, without any a priori knowledge of the existing data and inputs of each agent, cause each agent to respond truthfully to requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=hneidman|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Parkes|first2=David|title=Specification faithfulness in networks with rational nodes|journal=twenty-third annual ACM symposium on principles of distributed computing: PODC|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known truthful mechanism in game theory is the [[Vickrey auction]].

== Classic distributed computing problems ==

=== Leader Election(Completely connected network, synchronous case) ===
[[Leader election]] is a fundamental problem in distributed computing and there are numerous protocols to solve this problem. System agents are assumed to be rational, and therefore prefer having a leader to not having one. The agents may also have different preferences regarding who becomes the leader (an agent may prefer that he himself becomes the leader). Standard protocols may choose leaders based on the lowest or highest ID of system agents. However, since agents have an incentive to lie about their ID in order to improve their utility such protocols are rendered useless in the setting of algorithmic mechanism design. &lt;br/&gt;
A protocol for leader election in the presence of rational agents has been introduced by Ittai et al.:
* At round 1, each agent i sends everyone his id; 
* At round 2, agent i sends each other agent j the set of ids that he has received (including his own). If the sets received by agent i are not all identical or if i does not receive an id from some agent, then i sets its output to Null, and leader election fails. Otherwise, let n be the cardinality of the set of ids.
* Agent i chooses a random number N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in {0, ..., n-1} and sends it to all the other agents.
* Each agent i then computes ∑&lt;sub&gt;i=1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (mod n), and then takes the agent with the Nth highest id in the set to be the leader. (If some agent j does not send i a random number, then i sets its output to Null.)
This protocol correctly elects a leader while reaching equilibrium and is truthful since no agent can benefit by lying about its input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abraham|first1=Ittai|last2=Dolev|first2=Danny|title=Distributed Protocols for Leader Election: a Game-Theoretic Perspective|journal=DISC|date=2013|pages=61–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4364">In the mathematical field of [[differential geometry]], a '''Frobenius manifold''', introduced by Dubrovin&lt;ref&gt;B. Dubrovin: ''Geometry of 2D topological field theories.'' In: Springer LNM, 1620 (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;120–348.&lt;/ref&gt;, is a flat [[Riemannian manifold]] with a certain compatible multiplicative structure on the [[tangent space]].  The concept generalizes the notion of [[Frobenius algebra]] to tangent bundles.

Frobenius manifolds occur naturally in the subject of [[symplectic topology]], more specifically [[quantum cohomology]].  The broadest definition is in the category of Riemannian [[supermanifold]]s.  We will limit the discussion here to smooth (real) manifolds.  A restriction to complex manifolds is also possible.

== Definition ==
Let ''M'' be a smooth manifold.  An ''affine flat'' structure on ''M'' is a [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt; of vector spaces that pointwisely span ''TM'' the tangent bundle and the tangent bracket of pairs of its sections vanishes.

As a local example consider the coordinate vectorfields over a chart of ''M''.  A manifold admits an affine flat structure if one can glue together such vectorfields for a covering family of charts.

Let further be given a [[Riemannian metric]] ''g'' on ''M''.  It is compatible to the flat structure if ''g''(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is locally constant for all flat vector fields ''X'' and&amp;nbsp;''Y''.

A Riemannian manifold admits a compatible affine flat structure if and only if its [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]] vanishes everywhere.

A family of ''commutative products *'' on ''TM'' is equivalent to a section ''A'' of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(T&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''M'')&amp;nbsp;⊗&amp;nbsp;''TM'' via

:&lt;math&gt;X*Y = A(X,Y). \, &lt;/math&gt;

We require in addition the property

:&lt;math&gt;g(X*Y,Z)=g(X,Y*Z). \, &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the composition ''g''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;∘''A'' is a symmetric 3-tensor.

This implies in particular that a linear Frobenius manifold (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g'',&amp;nbsp;*) with constant product is a Frobenius algebra ''M''.

Given (''g'',&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''A''), a ''local potential Φ'' is a local smooth function such that

:&lt;math&gt;g(A(X,Y),Z)=X[Y[Z[\Phi]]] \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all flat vector fields ''X'', ''Y'', and&amp;nbsp;''Z''.

A ''Frobenius manifold'' (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g'',&amp;nbsp;*) is now a flat Riemannian manifold (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''g'') with symmetric 3-tensor ''A'' that admits everywhere a local potential and is associative.

== Elementary properties ==
The associativity of the product * is equivalent to the following quadratic [[partial differential equation|PDE]] in the local potential ''&amp;Phi;''
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi_{,abe}g^{ef}\Phi_{,cdf} = \Phi_{,ade}g^{ef}\Phi_{,bcf} \, &lt;/math&gt;
where Einstein's sum convention is implied, Φ&lt;sub&gt;,a&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the partial derivative of the function Φ by the coordinate vectorfield ∂/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; which are all assumed to be flat.  ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ef''&lt;/sup&gt; are the coefficients of the inverse of the metric.

The equation is therefore called associativity equation or Witten–Dijkgraaf–Verlinde–Verlinde (WDVV) equation.

== Examples ==
Beside Frobenius algebras, examples arise from quantum cohomology.  Namely, given a semipositive [[symplectic manifold]] (''M'',&amp;nbsp;''ω'') then there exists an open neighborhood ''U'' of 0 in its even [[quantum cohomology]] QH&lt;sup&gt;even&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',&amp;nbsp;''ω'') with Novikov ring over '''C''' such that the big quantum product *&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''a'' in ''U'' is analytic.  Now ''U'' together with the [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;·,·&amp;gt; is a (complex) Frobenius manifold.

The second large class of examples of Frobenius manifolds come from the singularity theory. Namely, the space of miniversal deformations of an isolated singularity has a Frobenius manifold structure. This Frobenius manifold structure also relates to [[Kyoji Saito]]'s primitive forms.

In [[mathematical analysis]] '''Fubini's theorem''', introduced by [[Guido Fubini]] in 1907, is a result that gives conditions under which it is possible to compute a [[double integral]] using [[iterated integral]]s. One may switch the order of integration if the double integral yields a finite answer when the integrand is replaced by its absolute value.
: &lt;math&gt;\int_X\left(\int_Y f(x,y)\,\text{d}y\right)\,\text{d}x=\int_Y\left(\int_X f(x,y)\,\text{d}x\right)\,\text{d}y=\int_{X\times Y} f(x,y)\,\text{d}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
As a consequence it allows the [[Order of integration (calculus)|order of integration]] to be changed in iterated integrals.
Fubini's theorem implies that the two repeated integrals of a function of two variables are equal if the function is integrable. '''Tonelli's theorem''', introduced by [[Leonida Tonelli]] in 1909, is similar but applies to functions that are non-negative rather than integrable.

==History==
The special case of Fubini's theorem for continuous functions on a product of closed bounded subsets of real vector spaces was known to Euler in the 18th century. {{harvs|txt|last=[[Lebesgue]]|year=1904}} extended this to bounded measurable functions on a product of intervals. {{harvtxt|Levi|1906}} conjectured that the theorem could be extended to functions that were integrable rather than bounded, and this was proved by {{harvtxt|Fubini|1907}}. {{harvtxt|Tonelli|1909}} gave a variation of Fubini's theorem that applies to non-negative functions rather than integrable functions.

==Product measures==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are measure spaces with measures, there are several natural ways to define a [[product measure]] on their product.

The product ''X''&amp;times;''Y'' of measure spaces (in [[Product (category theory)|the sense of category theory]]) has as its measurable sets the [[σ-algebra]] generated by the products ''A''&amp;times;''B'' of measurable subsets of ''X'' and ''Y''.

A measure μ on ''X''&amp;times;''Y'' is called a '''product measure''' if μ(''A''&amp;times;''B'')=μ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'')μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'') for measurable subsets ''A&amp;sub;X'' and ''B&amp;sub;Y'' and measures µ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on ''X'' and µ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on ''Y''. In general there may be many different product measures on ''X''&amp;times;''Y''. Fubini's theorem and Tonelli's theorem both need technical conditions to avoid this complication; the most common way is to assume all measure spaces are [[σ-finite measure|σ-finite]], in which case there is a unique  product measure on ''X''&amp;times;''Y''. There is always a unique maximal product measure on ''X''&amp;times;''Y'', where the measure of a measurable set is the inf of the measures of sets containing it that are countable unions of products of measurable sets.  The maximal product measure can be constructed by applying [[Carathéodory's extension theorem]] to the additive function μ such that μ(''A''&amp;times;''B'')=μ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'')μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'') on the ring of sets generated by products of measurable sets. (Carathéodory's extension theorem gives a measure on a measure space that in general contains more measurable sets than the measure space ''X''&amp;times;''Y'', so strictly speaking the measure should be restricted to the [[σ-algebra]] generated by the products ''A''&amp;times;''B'' of measurable subsets of ''X'' and ''Y''.)

The product of two [[complete measure space]]s is not usually complete. For example, the product of the [[Lebesgue measure]] on the unit interval ''I'' with itself is not the Lebesgue measure on the square ''I''&amp;times;''I''. There is a variation of Fubini's theorem for complete measures, which uses the completion of the product of measures rather than the uncompleted product.

==For integrable functions==
Suppose ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[sigma-finite measure|σ-finite]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure spaces]], and suppose that ''X&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;Y'' is given the product measure (which is unique as ''X'' and ''Y'' are σ-finite). Fubini's theorem states that if ''f(x,y)'' is ''X&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;Y'' integrable, meaning that it is [[measurable function|measurable]] and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{X\times Y} |f(x,y)|\,\text{d}(x,y)&lt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;
then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X\left(\int_Y f(x,y)\,\text{d}y\right)\,\text{d}x=\int_Y\left(\int_X f(x,y)\,\text{d}x\right)\,\text{d}y=\int_{X\times Y} f(x,y)\,\text{d}(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

The first two integrals are iterated integrals with respect to two measures, respectively, and the third is an integral with respect to the product measure. The partial integrals &lt;math&gt;\int_Y f(x,y)\,\text{d}y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_X f(x,y)\,\text{d}x&lt;/math&gt; need not be defined everywhere, but this does not matter as the points where they are not defined form a set of measure 0.

If the above integral of the absolute value is not finite, then the two iterated integrals may have different values.  See [[#Rearranging a conditionally convergent iterated integral|below]] for an illustration of this possibility.

The condition that ''X'' and ''Y'' are σ-finite is usually harmless because in practice almost all measure spaces one wishes to use Fubini's theorem for are σ-finite.
Fubini's theorem has some rather technical extensions to the case when ''X'' and ''Y'' are not assumed to be σ-finite {{harv|Fremlin|2003}}. The main extra complication in this case is that there may be more than one product measure on ''X''&amp;times;''Y''. Fubini's theorem continues to hold for the maximal product measure, but can fail for other product measures. For example, there is a product measure and a non-negative measurable function ''f'' for which the double integral of |''f''| is zero but the two iterated integrals have different values; see the section on counterexamples below for an example of this. Tonelli's theorem and the Fubini–Tonelli theorem (stated below) can fail on non σ-finite spaces even for the maximal product measure.

==Tonelli's theorem for non-negative functions==
'''Tonelli's theorem''' (named after [[Leonida Tonelli]]) is a successor of Fubini's theorem. The conclusion of Tonelli's theorem is identical to that of Fubini's theorem, but the assumption that &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; has a finite integral is replaced by the assumption that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is non-negative.

Tonelli's theorem states that if (''X'', ''A'', μ) and (''Y'', ''B'', ν) are [[Sigma-finite measure|σ-finite measure spaces]], while ''f'' from ''X×Y'' to [0,∞] is non-negative and measurable, then
: &lt;math&gt;\int_X\left(\int_Y f(x,y)\,\text{d}y\right)\,\text{d}x=\int_Y\left(\int_X f(x,y)\,\text{d}x\right)\,\text{d}y=\int_{X\times Y} f(x,y)\,\text{d}(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

A special case of Tonelli's theorem is in the interchange of the summations, as in &lt;math&gt;\sum_x \sum_y a_{xy}=\sum_y \sum_x a_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a_{xy}&lt;/math&gt; are non-negative for all ''x'' and ''y''. The crux of the theorem is that the interchange of order of summation holds even if the series diverges. In effect, the only way a change in order of summation can change the sum is when there exist some subsequences that diverge to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; '''and''' others diverging to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. With all elements non-negative, this does not happen in the stated example.

Without the condition that the measure spaces are σ-finite it is possible for all three of these integrals to have different values. 
Some authors give generalizations of Tonelli's theorem to some measure spaces that are not σ-finite but these generalizations often add conditions that immediately reduce the problem to the σ-finite case.  For example, one could take the σ-algebra on ''A''&amp;times;''B'' to be that generated by the product of subsets of finite measure, rather than that generated by all products of measurable subsets, though this has the undesirable consequence that the projections from the product to its factors ''A'' and ''B''  are not measurable. Another way is to add the condition that the support of ''f'' is contained in a countable union of products of sets of finite measure. {{harvtxt|Fremlin|2003}} gives some rather technical extensions of Tonelli's theorem to some non σ-finite spaces. None of these generalizations have found any significant applications outside abstract measure theory, largely because almost all measure spaces of practical interest are σ-finite.

==The Fubini–Tonelli theorem==
Combining Fubini's theorem with Tonelli's theorem gives
the Fubini–Tonelli theorem (often just called Fubini's theorem), which states that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[σ-finite measure]] spaces, and if ''f'' is a measurable function, then
: &lt;math&gt;\int_X\left(\int_Y |f(x,y)|\,\text{d}y\right)\,\text{d}x=\int_Y\left(\int_X |f(x,y)|\,\text{d}x\right)\,\text{d}y=\int_{X\times Y} |f(x,y)|\,\text{d}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
Besides if any one of the three integrals
: &lt;math&gt;\int_X\left(\int_Y |f(x,y)|\,\text{d}y\right)\,\text{d}x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int_Y\left(\int_X |f(x,y)|\,\text{d}x\right)\,\text{d}y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int_{X\times Y} |f(x,y)|\,\text{d}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
is finite
then
: &lt;math&gt;\int_X\left(\int_Y f(x,y)\,\text{d}y\right)\,\text{d}x=\int_Y\left(\int_X f(x,y)\,\text{d}x\right)\,\text{d}y=\int_{X\times Y} f(x,y)\,\text{d}(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of ''f'' in the conditions above can be replaced by either the positive or the negative part of ''f''; these forms include Tonelli's theorem as a special case as the negative part of a non-negative function is zero and so has finite integral. Informally all these conditions say that the double integral of ''f'' is well defined, though possibly infinite.

The advantage of the Fubini–Tonelli over Fubini's theorem is that the repeated integrals of the absolute value of |''f''| may be easier to study than the double integral. As in Fubini's theorem, the single integrals may fail to be defined on a measure 0 set.

==For complete measures==
The versions of Fubini's and Tonelli's theorems above do not apply to integration on the product of the real line '''R''' with itself with Lebesgue measure.  The problem is that Lebesgue measure on '''R'''&amp;times;'''R''' is not the product of Lebesgue measure on '''R''' with itself, but rather the completion of this: a product of two complete measure spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is not in general complete.  For this reason one sometimes uses versions of Fubini's theorem for complete measures: roughly speaking one just replaces all measures by their completions.  The various versions of Fubini's theorem are similar to the versions above, with the following minor differences:
*Instead of taking a product ''X''&amp;times;''Y'' of two measure spaces, one takes the completion of some product.
*If ''f'' is a measurable  on the completion of ''X''&amp;times;''Y'' then its restrictions to vertical or horizontal lines may be non-measurable for a measure zero subset of lines, so one has to allow for the possibility that the vertical or horizontal integrals are undefined on a set of measure 0 because they involve integrating non-measurable functions. This makes little difference, because they can already be undefined due to the functions not being integrable. 
*One generally also assumes that the measures on ''X'' and ''Y'' are complete, otherwise the two partial integrals along vertical or horizontal lines may be well-defined but not measurable. For example, if ''f'' is the characteristic function of a product of a measurable set and a non-measurable set contained in a measure 0 set then its single integral is well defined everywhere but non-measurable.

==Proofs==

Proofs of the Fubini and Tonelli theorems are necessarily somewhat technical, as they have to use a hypothesis related to σ-finiteness. Most proofs involve building up to the full theorems by proving them for increasingly complicated functions as follows.
*Step 1. Use the fact that the measure on the product is a product measure to prove the theorems for the characteristic functions of rectangles. 
*Step 2. Use the condition that the spaces are σ-finite (or some related condition) to prove the theorem for the characteristic functions of measurable sets. This also covers the case of simple measurable functions (measurable functions taking only a finite number of values).
*Step 3. Use the condition that the functions are measurable to prove the theorems for positive measurable functions by approximating them by simple measurable functions.  This proves Tonelli's theorem.
*Step 4. Use the condition that the functions are integrable to write them as the difference of two positive integrable functions, and apply Tonelli's theorem to each of these. This proves Fubini's theorem.

==Counterexamples==

The following examples show how Fubini's theorem and Tonelli's theorem can fail if any of their hypotheses are omitted.

===Failure of Tonelli's theorem for non σ-finite spaces===

Suppose that ''X'' is the unit interval with the Lebesgue measurable sets and Lebesgue measure, and ''Y'' is the unit interval with all subsets measurable and the [[counting measure]], so that ''Y'' is not σ-finite. If ''f'' is the characteristic function of the diagonal of ''X''&amp;times;''Y'', then integrating ''f'' along ''X'' gives the 0 function on ''Y'', but integrating ''f'' along ''Y'' gives the function 1 on ''X''. So the two iterated integrals are different. This shows that Tonelli's theorem can fail for spaces that are not σ-finite no matter what product measure is chosen. The measures are both [[decomposable measure|decomposable]], showing that Tonelli's theorem fails for decomposable measures (which are slightly more general than σ-finite measures).

===Failure of Fubini's theorem for non-maximal product measures===

Fubini's theorem holds for spaces even if they are not assumed to be σ-finite provided one uses the maximal product measure.
In the example above, for the maximal product measure, the diagonal has infinite measure so the double integral of |''f''| is infinite, and Fubini's theorem holds vacuously.
However, if we give ''X''&amp;times;''Y'' the product measure such that the measure of a set is the sum of the Lebesgue measures of its horizontal sections, then the double integral of |''f''| is zero, but the two iterated integrals still have different values. This gives an example of a product measure where Fubini's theorem fails.

This gives an example of two different product measures on the same product of two measure spaces. For products of two σ-finite measure spaces, there is only one product measure.

===Failure of Tonelli's theorem for non-measurable functions===

Suppose that ''X'' is the first uncountable ordinal, with the finite measure where the measurable sets are either countable (with measure 0) or the sets of countable complement (with measure 1). The (non-measurable) subset ''E'' of ''X''&amp;times;''X'' given by pairs (''x'',''y'') with ''x''&lt;''y'' is countable on every horizontal line and has countable complement on every vertical line. If ''f'' is the characteristic function of ''E'' then the two iterated integrals of ''f'' are defined and have different values 1 and 0. The function ''f'' is not measurable. This shows that Tonelli's theorem can fail for non-measurable functions.

===Failure of Fubini's theorem for non-measurable functions===

A variation of the example above shows that Fubini's theorem can fail for non-measurable functions even if |''f''| is integrable and both repeated integrals are well defined: if we take ''f'' to be 1 on ''E'' and –1 on the complement of ''E'', then |''f''| is integrable on the product with integral 1, and both repeated integrals are well defined, but have different values 1 and –1.

Assuming the continuum hypothesis, one can identify ''X'' with the unit interval ''I'', so there is a bounded non-negative function on ''I''&amp;times;''I''  whose two iterated integrals (using Lebesgue measure) are both defined but unequal. This example was found by {{harvs|txt|last=Sierpiński|year=1920}}.
The stronger versions of Fubini's theorem on a product of two unit intervals with Lebesgue measure, where the function is no longer assumed to be measurable but merely that the two iterated integrals are well defined and exist, are independent of the standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] of [[set theory]].  The continuum hypothesis and [[Martin's axiom]] both imply that there exists a function on the unit square whose iterated integrals are not equal, while {{harvs|txt|last=Friedman|year=1980}} showed that it is consistent with ZFC that a strong Fubini-type theorem for [0,&amp;nbsp;1] does hold, and whenever the two iterated integrals exist they are equal.  See [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC]].

===Failure of Fubini's theorem for non-integrable functions===
Fubini's theorem tells us that (for measurable functions on a product of σ-finite measure spaces) if the integral of the absolute value is finite, then the order of integration does not matter; if we integrate first with respect to ''x'' and then with respect to ''y'', we get the same result as if we integrate first with respect to ''y'' and then with respect to ''x''.  The assumption that the integral of the absolute value is finite is "[[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrability]]", and without it the two repeated integrals can have different values.

A simple example to show that the repeated integrals can be different in general is to take the two measure spaces to be the positive integers, and to take the function ''f''(''x'',''y'') to be 1 if ''x''=''y'', −1 if ''x''=''y''+1, and 0 otherwise. Then the two repeated integrals have different values 0 and 1.

Another example is as follows for the function
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2-y^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2} = -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x\partial y}\arctan(y/x).&lt;/math&gt;
The [[double integral|iterated integral]]s

does not [[absolute convergence|converge absolutely]] (in other words the integral of the [[absolute value]] is not finite):

'''Interdependence theory''' is a [[social exchange]] theory that shows how the rewards and costs associated with [[interpersonal relationships]] collaborate with peoples' expectations from them. 
This theory comes from the idea that closeness is the key to all relationships; that people communicate to become closer to one another. The theory states that there are rewards and costs to any relationship and that people try to maximize the rewards while minimizing the costs.

== Authors ==

Interdependence theory was first introduced by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[John Thibaut]] in 1959 in their book, ''The Social Psychology of Groups''.&lt;ref&gt;Thibaut, J.W., &amp; Kelley, H.H., (1959). The social psychology of groups. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In their second book, ''Interpersonal Relations: A Theory of Interdependence,''&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, H.H. &amp; Thibaut, J.W., (1978). Interpersonal relations: A theory of interdependence. New York: Wiley-Interscience."&lt;/ref&gt; the theory was completely formulized in 1978.

== Rewards and costs ==

Interdependence theory stipulates that an ideal relationship is characterized with high levels of rewards and low levels of costs. Rewards are "exchanged resources that are pleasurable and gratifying," while costs are "exchanged resources that result in a loss or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Sprecher, S., (1998). Social exchange theories and sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 35(1), 32–43.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different types of rewards and costs discussed in this theory. This theory distinguishes between four types of rewards and costs. These types are as follows: emotional, social, instrumental, and opportunity.

=== Emotional ===

Emotional rewards and costs are the positive and negative feelings, respectively, that are experienced in a relationship. These types of rewards and costs are especially pertinent to close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Anderson, P.A., &amp; Afifi, W.A. (2007). Close encounters: Communication in relationships.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social ===

Social rewards and costs are those related with a person's social appearance and the ability to interact in social environments. Social rewards deal with the positive aspect of a person's social appearance and the enjoyable social situations in which one must engage. On the other hand, social costs are those that relate to the negative aspect of a person's social appearance and the uninteresting social situations to which a person must attend.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Anderson, P.A., &amp; Afifi, W.A. (2007). Close encounters: Communication in relationships.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrumental ===

Instrumental rewards and costs deal with activities and/or tasks in a relationship. Instrumental rewards are those that are obtained when a person's partner is proficient in handling tasks, such as getting all the laundry finished. Instrumental costs are just the opposite; they occur when a person's relationship partner causes unnecessary work or the partner impedes the other's progress in a task, such as one person in a relationship not doing any of the housework.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Anderson, P.A., &amp; Afifi, W.A. (2007). Close encounters: Communication in relationships.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opportunity ===

Opportunity rewards and costs are associated with the opportunities that arise in relationships. Opportunity rewards are those gains that a person is able to receive in their relationship, which they would not be able to receive on their own. Opportunity costs occur when a person must give up something that they normally would not for the sake of the relationship.

== Outcomes ==
With every relationship there is an outcome. These outcomes are determined by comparing the amount of rewards present in a relationship versus the amount of costs present. "According to interdependence theory, people mentally account for rewards and costs so they can evaluate the outcome of their relationship as either positive or negative."&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Anderson, P.A., &amp; Afifi, W.A. (2007). Close encounters: Communication in relationships.&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome is determined to be positive when the rewards outweigh the costs in a relationship. Conversely, the outcome is negative when the costs outweigh the rewards.

== Comparison level ==
Interdependence theory also takes into account comparison level. This involves the expectation of the kinds of outcomes a person expects to receive in a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Thibaut, J.W., &amp; Kelley, H.H., (1959). The social psychology of groups. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations are 'compared' to a person's past relationships and current observations of others' relationships. "Satisfaction depends on expectation, which is shaped by prior experience, especially gripping events of the recent past."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/socialexchange.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A person will have a high comparison level, if all the relationships that they have been exposed to are happy. Therefore, to determine whether or not someone is in a satisfying relationship, it is necessary to consider both the rewards and costs evident in that relationship as well as that person's own comparison level.

== Quality of alternatives ==
Comparison level correlated with the rewards and costs of a relationship determine satisfaction and commitment for a particular person in a relationship. However, there are some situations where people may be committed, but not have a satisfying relationship or they may be satisfied in their relationship, but not committed to it. Thus, the quality of alternatives helps people understand the 'alternatives' they have outside of their current relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Anderson, P.A., &amp; Afifi, W.A. (2007). Close encounters: Communication in relationships.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatives can be any other option rather than the one currently held. When people have good alternatives, they tend to be less committed to their relationships. By contrast, when people have poor alternatives, they tend to be highly committed to their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, D. W., Feng, D., Fischer, J.L., &amp; Diana L.K., (2003). The influence of love, equity, and alternatives on commitment in romantic relationships. Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal, 13, 253–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4013">The '''Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma''' is a result in [[system analysis]] and [[control theory]] which states: Given a number &lt;math&gt;\gamma &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, two n-vectors B, C and an n x n [[Hurwitz matrix]] A, if the pair &lt;math&gt;(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is completely [[controllability|controllable]], then a symmetric matrix P and a vector Q satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;A^T P + P A = -Q Q^T&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P B-C = \sqrt{\gamma}Q&lt;/math&gt;

exist if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma+2 Re[C^T (j\omega I-A)^{-1}B]\ge 0
&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, the set &lt;math&gt;\{x: x^T P x = 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is the unobservable subspace for the pair &lt;math&gt;(C,A)&lt;/math&gt;.

The lemma can be seen as a generalization of the [[Lyapunov equation]] in stability theory.  It establishes a relation between a [[linear matrix inequality]] involving the [[state space]] constructs A, B, C and a condition in the [[frequency domain]].

In that paper the relation to solvability of the Lur’e equations was also established. Both papers considered scalar-input systems.

==Multivariable Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma==
Given &lt;math&gt;A \in \R^{n \times n}, B \in \R^{n \times m}, M = M^T \in \R^{(n+m) \times (n+m)}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\det(j\omega I - A) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A, B)&lt;/math&gt; controllable, the following are equivalent: 
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for all &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \R \cup \{\infty\} &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; \left[\begin{matrix} (j\omega I - A)^{-1}B \\ I \end{matrix}\right]^*   M   \left[\begin{matrix} (j\omega I - A)^{-1}B \\ I \end{matrix}\right] \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there exists a matrix &lt;math&gt;P \in \R^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P = P^T&lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt;M + \left[\begin{matrix} A^T P + PA &amp; PB \\ B^T P &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right] \le 0. &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1360">The '''Katětov–Tong insertion theorem''' is a [[theorem]] of [[point-set topology]] proved independently by [[Miroslav Katětov]]&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Katětov, ''On real-valued functions in topological spaces'', Fundamenta Mathematicae 38 (1951), 85–91. [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/tresc.php?wyd=1&amp;tom=38]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hing Tong]]&lt;ref&gt;Hing Tong, ''Some characterizations of normal and perfectly normal spaces'', Duke Mathematical Journal 19 (1952), 289–292. {{doi|10.1215/S0012-7094-52-01928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1950s. &lt;!--[[Miroslav Katětov]] shares the name for a revised version of the theorem and an improved proof.--&gt;

The theorem states the following:

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a normal [[topological space]] and let &lt;math&gt;g, h\colon X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be functions with g upper [[semicontinuous]], h lower semicontinuous and &lt;math&gt;g \leq h&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g \leq f \leq h.&lt;/math&gt;

This theorem has a number of applications and is the first of many classical insertion theorems. In particular it implies the [[Tietze extension theorem]] and consequently [[Urysohn's lemma]], and so the conclusion of the theorem is equivalent to normality.

In [[cryptography]], a '''key''' is a piece of information (a [[parameter]]) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic [[algorithm]]. For [[encryption]] algorithms, a key specifies the transformation of [[plaintext]] into [[ciphertext]], and vice versa for [[decryption]] algorithms. Keys also specify transformations in other cryptographic algorithms, such as [[digital signature]] schemes and [[message authentication code]]s.

== Need for secrecy ==

In designing security systems, it is wise to assume that the details of the cryptographic algorithm are already available to the attacker. This is known as [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] — "''only secrecy of the key provides security''", or, reformulated as [[Claude Shannon#Shannon's maxim|Shannon's maxim]], "''the enemy knows the system''". The [[history of cryptography]] provides evidence that it can be difficult to keep the details of a widely used algorithm secret (see [[security through obscurity]]). A key is often easier to protect (it's typically a small piece of information) than an encryption algorithm, and easier to change if compromised. Thus, the security of an encryption system in most cases relies on some key being kept secret.

Trying to keep keys secret is one of the most difficult problems in practical cryptography; see [[key management]]. An attacker who obtains the key (by, for example, theft, extortion, [[dumpster diving]], assault, torture, or [[social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]]) can recover the original message from the encrypted data, and issue signatures.

== Key scope ==
Keys are generated to be used with a given ''suite of algorithms'', called a [[cryptosystem]].  Encryption algorithms which use the same key for both encryption and decryption are known as [[symmetric key algorithm]]s.  A newer class of "public key" cryptographic algorithms was invented in the 1970s.  These [[asymmetric key algorithm]]s use a pair of keys—or ''keypair''—a public key and a private one.  Public keys are used for encryption or signature verification; private ones decrypt and sign.  The design is such that finding out the private key is extremely difficult, even if the corresponding public key is known.  As that design involves lengthy computations, a keypair is often used to [[key exchange|exchange]] an on-the-fly symmetric key, which will only be used for the current session.  [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] are two popular public-key cryptosystems;  DSA keys can only be used for signing and verifying, not for encryption.

== Ownership and revocation ==
Part of the security brought about by cryptography concerns confidence about who signed a given document, or who replies at the other side of a connection.  Assuming that keys are not compromised, that question consists of determining the owner of the relevant public key.  To be able to tell a key's owner, public keys are often enriched with attributes such as names, addresses, and similar identifiers.  The packed collection of a public key and its attributes can be digitally signed by one or more supporters.  In the [[Public-key infrastructure|PKI]] model, the resulting object is called a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] and is signed by a [[certificate authority]] (CA).  In the [[Web of trust|PGP]] model, it is still called a "key", and is signed by various people who personally verified that the attributes match the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalmonki.com |title=The GNU Privacy Handbook |editor=Mike Ashley |author1=Matthew Copeland |author2=Joergen Grahn |author3=David A. Wheeler |date=1999 |website=GnuPG |accessdate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412183457/http://digitalmonki.com/ |archivedate=12 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both PKI and PGP models, compromised keys can be revoked.  Revocation has the side effect of disrupting the relationship between a key's attributes and the subject, which may still be valid.  In order to have a possibility to recover from such disruption, signers often use different keys for everyday tasks:  Signing with an ''intermediate certificate'' (for PKI) or a ''subkey'' (for PGP) facilitates keeping the principal private key in an offline safe.

Deleting a key on purpose to make the data inaccessible is called [[crypto-shredding]].

== Key sizes ==
{{main|Key size}}

For the [[one-time pad]] system the key must be at least as long as the message. In encryption systems that use a [[cipher]] algorithm, messages can be much longer than the key. The key must, however, be long enough so that an attacker cannot try all possible combinations.

A key length of 80 bits is generally considered the minimum for strong security with symmetric encryption algorithms. 128-bit keys are commonly used and considered very strong. See the [[key size]] article for a more complete discussion.

The keys used in [[public key cryptography]] have some mathematical structure. For example, public keys used in the [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] system are the product of two prime numbers. Thus public key systems require longer key lengths than symmetric systems for an equivalent [[level of security]]. 3072 bits is the suggested key length for systems based on [[Factorization|factoring]] and integer [[discrete logarithm]]s which aim to have security equivalent to a 128 bit symmetric cipher. [[Elliptic curve cryptography]] may allow smaller-size keys for equivalent security, but these algorithms have only been known for a relatively short time and current estimates of the difficulty of searching for their keys may not survive. As early as 2004, a message encrypted using a 109-bit key elliptic curve algorithm had been broken by brute force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Internet Encyclopedia |first=Hossein |last=Bidgoli |publisher=John Wiley |year=2004 |isbn=0-471-22201-1 |page=567 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0J2QcUtMKcC&amp;pg=PA567 |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current rule of thumb is to use an ECC key twice as long as the symmetric key security level desired. Except for the random [[one-time pad]], the security of these systems has not been [[Mathematical proof|proven mathematically]] {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, so a theoretical breakthrough could make everything one has encrypted an open book (see [[P versus NP problem#Consequences of solution|P versus NP problem]]). This is another reason to err on the side of choosing longer keys.

== Key choice ==

To prevent a key from being guessed, keys need to be generated truly [[random]]ly and contain sufficient [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]. The problem of how to safely generate truly random keys is difficult, and has been addressed in many ways by various cryptographic systems. There is a [[Request for comment|RFC]] on [[random number generator|generating randomness]] (RFC 4086, ''Randomness Requirements for Security''). Some operating systems include tools for "collecting" entropy from the timing of unpredictable operations such as [[disk drive]] head movements. For the production of small amounts of keying material, ordinary [[dice]] provide a good source of high quality randomness.

== Key vs password ==

For most computer security purposes and for most users, "key" is not synonymous with "password" (or "[[passphrase]]"), although a password can in fact be used as a key. The primary practical difference between keys and passwords is that the latter are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user (though the user may delegate those tasks to password management software). A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, and so human readability etc. is not required. In fact, most users will, in most cases, be unaware of even the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications.

If a [[password]] ''is'' used as an encryption key, then in a well-designed crypto system it would not be used as such on its own. This is because passwords tend to be human-readable and,hence, may not be particularly strong. To compensate, a good crypto system will use the ''password-acting-as-key'' not to perform the primary encryption task itself, but rather to act as an input to a [[key derivation function]] (KDF). That KDF uses the password as a starting point from which it will then generate the actual secure encryption key itself. Various methods such as adding a [[Salt (cryptography)|salt]] and key stretching may be used in the generation.

[[File:Lucas number spiral.svg|400x240px|thumb|right|The Lucas spiral, made with quarter-arcs, is a good approximation of the [[golden spiral]] when its terms are large. However, when its terms become very small, the arc's radius decreases rapidly from 3 to 1 then increases from 1 to 2.]]
The '''Lucas numbers''' or '''Lucas series''' are an [[integer sequence]] named after the mathematician [[Édouard Lucas|François Édouard Anatole Lucas]] (1842&amp;ndash;91), who studied both that sequence and the closely related [[Fibonacci number]]s. Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers form complementary instances of [[Lucas sequence]]s.

The Lucas sequence has the same recursive relationship as the [[Fibonacci sequence]], where each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but with different starting values. This produces a sequence where the ratios of successive terms approach the [[golden ratio]], and in fact the terms themselves are [[rounding]]s of integer powers of the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=Matt |title=Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension |date=2014 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0-374-53563-6 |page=284 |language=English |chapter=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence also has a variety of relationships with the Fibonacci numbers, like the fact that adding any two Fibonacci numbers two terms apart in the Fibonacci sequence results in the Lucas number in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parker |first1=Matt |title=Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension |date=2014 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0-374-53563-6 |page=282 |language=English |chapter=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Similar to the Fibonacci numbers, each Lucas number is defined to be the sum of its two immediate previous terms, thereby forming a [[Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers#Fibonacci integer sequences|Fibonacci integer sequence]].  The first two Lucas numbers are ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 as opposed to the first two Fibonacci numbers ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.  Though closely related in definition, Lucas and Fibonacci numbers exhibit distinct properties.

The Lucas numbers may thus be defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; 
  L_n :=
  \begin{cases}
    2               &amp; \text{if } n = 0; \\
    1               &amp; \text{if } n = 1; \\
    L_{n-1}+L_{n-2} &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1. \\
   \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
(where n belongs to the natural numbers)

The sequence of Lucas numbers is:
:&lt;math&gt;2,\;1,\;3,\;4,\;7,\;11,\;18,\;29,\;47,\;76,\;123,\; \ldots\;&lt;/math&gt;{{OEIS|id=A000032}}.

All Fibonacci-like integer sequences appear in shifted form as a row of the [[Wythoff array]]; the Fibonacci sequence itself is the first row and the Lucas sequence is the second row. Also like all Fibonacci-like integer sequences, the ratio between two consecutive Lucas numbers [[limit of a sequence|converges]] to the [[golden ratio]].

==Extension to negative integers==
Using ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, one can extend the Lucas numbers to negative integers to obtain a doubly infinite sequence: 
:..., &amp;minus;11, 7, &amp;minus;4, 3, &amp;minus;1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ...  (terms &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;-5\leq{}n\leq5&lt;/math&gt; are shown).
The formula for terms with negative indices in this sequence is
: &lt;math&gt;L_{-n}=(-1)^nL_n.\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to Fibonacci numbers==
[[File:Comparison_Fibonacci_and_Lucas_numbers.svg|thumb|300px|The first identity expressed visually]]
The Lucas numbers are related to the Fibonacci numbers by the identities
* &lt;math&gt;\,L_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n+1}=F_n+2F_{n-1} = F_{n+2}-F_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\,L_{m+n} = L_{m+1}F_{n}+L_mF_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\,L_n^2 = 5 F_n^2 + 4 (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt;, and thus as &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches [[Extended real number line|+∞]], the ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{L_n}{F_n}&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{5}.&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\,F_{2n} = L_n F_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\,F_{n+k} + (-1)^k F_{n-k} = L_k F_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\,F_n = {L_{n-1}+L_{n+1} \over 5} = {L_{n-3}+L_{n+3} \over 10} &lt;/math&gt;

Their [[Closed-form expression|closed formula]] is given as:
:&lt;math&gt;L_n = \varphi^n + (1-\varphi)^{n} = \varphi^n + (- \varphi)^{-n}=\left({ 1+ \sqrt{5} \over 2}\right)^n + \left({ 1- \sqrt{5} \over 2}\right)^n\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]]. Alternatively, as for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; the magnitude of the term &lt;math&gt;(-\varphi)^{-n}&lt;/math&gt; is less than 1/2, &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is the closest integer to &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n&lt;/math&gt; or, equivalently, the integer part of &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n+1/2&lt;/math&gt;, also written as &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \varphi^n+1/2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining the above with [[Binet's formula]],

:&lt;math&gt;F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - (1-\varphi)^{n}}{\sqrt{5}}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

a formula for &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n&lt;/math&gt; is obtained:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = {{L_n + F_n \sqrt{5}} \over 2}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

==Congruence relations==
If ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ge; 5 is a Fibonacci number then no Lucas number is divisible by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is congruent to 1 mod&amp;nbsp;''n'' if ''n'' is prime, but some composite values of ''n'' also have this property. These are the [[Lucas pseudoprime#Bruckman-Lucas pseudoprimes|Bruckman-Lucas pseudoprimes]].

== Lucas primes ==
A '''Lucas prime''' is a Lucas number that is [[prime number|prime]]. The first few Lucas primes are
:2, 3, 7, 11, 29, 47, 199, 521, 2207, 3571, 9349, 3010349, 54018521, 370248451, 6643838879, ... {{OEIS|id=A005479}}.

For these ''n''s are
:0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 31, 37, 41, 47, 53, 61, 71, 79, 113, 313, 353, 503, 613, 617, 863, 1097, 1361, 4787, 4793, 5851, 7741, 8467, ... {{OEIS|id=A001606}}.

If ''L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is prime then ''n'' is either 0, prime, or a power of 2.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Caldwell, "[http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=LucasPrime The Prime Glossary: Lucas prime]" from The [[Prime Pages]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is prime for ''m''&amp;nbsp;= 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;4 and no other known values of&amp;nbsp;''m''.

==Generating series==
Let

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = 2 + x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \cdots = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty L_nx^n&lt;/math&gt;

be the [[generating series]] of the Lucas numbers. By a direct computation,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \Phi(x) &amp;= L_0 + L_1x + \sum_{n = 2}^\infty L_nx^n \\
          &amp;= 2 + x + \sum_{n = 2}^\infty (L_{n - 1} + L_{n - 2})x^n \\
          &amp;= 2 + x + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty L_nx^{n + 1} + \sum_{n = 0}^\infty L_nx^{n + 2} \\
          &amp;= 2 + x + x(\Phi(x) - 2) + x^2 \Phi(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged as

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \frac{2 - x}{1 - x - x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;


The partial fraction decomposition is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{1 - \varphi x} + \frac{1}{1 - \phi x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the golden ratio and &lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is its conjugate.

==Lucas polynomials==
In the same way as [[Fibonacci polynomial]]s are derived from the [[Fibonacci number]]s, the [[Lucas polynomials]] ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are a [[polynomial sequence]] derived from the Lucas numbers.

'''László "Laci" Babai''' (born July 20, 1950 in [[Budapest]])&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140211143337/http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/CV.pdf Curriculum vitae] from Babai's web site, retrieved 2016-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] professor of computer science and mathematics at the [[University of Chicago]]. His research focuses on [[computational complexity theory]], [[algorithms]], [[combinatorics]], and [[finite groups]], with an emphasis on the interactions between these fields.

==Life==
In 1968, Babai won a gold medal at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. Babai studied mathematics at [[Eötvös Loránd University]] from 1968 to 1973, received a Ph.D. from the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 1975, and received a D.Sc. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1984.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=78102}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held a teaching position at Eötvös Loránd University since 1971; in 1987 he took joint positions as a professor in algebra at Eötvös Loránd and in computer science at the University of Chicago. In 1995, he began a joint appointment in the mathematics department at Chicago and gave up his position at Eötvös Loránd.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

==Work==
He is the author of over 180 academic papers.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

=== Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time ===

From 10 November to 1 December 2015, Babai gave three lectures on «Graph Isomorphism in [[Time complexity#Quasi-polynomial time|Quasipolynomial Time]]» in the «Combinatorics and Theoretical Computer Science» Seminar at the [[University of Chicago]]. He outlined a proof to show that the [[Graph isomorphism problem]] can be solved in [[quasi-polynomial time]].&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Babai (University of Chicago): [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?eid=czNzOXNtZ2tydG00OG5obDJlZ3I3c21uY2cgYzU3c2hpY2k0NW0xN3FsMGdodmw1NmVrMzhAZw&amp;ctz=America/Chicago&amp;pli=1&amp;t=AKUaPmbNo4fEHI_fQA5RP4AEOVRvY_38tKCShSSp7z2RGnSSoAFNkqX7djaXeyZLSyiagv-Jnb0pK6iajFFbAnvp8q5SsF0K4g&amp;sf=true&amp;output=xml#eventpage_6 Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time I]: The "Local Certificates Algorithm" // Combinatorics and Theoretical Computer Science seminar, 10 November 2015, 15:00 – 16:00&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/a-big-result-on-graph-isomorphism/ A Big Result On Graph Isomorphism] // November 4, 2015, [https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/a-fast-graph-isomorphism-algorithm/ A Fast Graph Isomorphism Algorithm] // November 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uchicago.edu/calendar?calendar=Combinatorics%20and%20Theoretical%20Computer%20Science Combinatorics and Theoretical Computer Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222101053/http://www.math.uchicago.edu/calendar?calendar=Combinatorics%20and%20Theoretical%20Computer%20Science |date=2015-12-22 }} calendar // [http://theory.cs.uchicago.edu/index.php Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Chicago].

The best previous bound for GI was  &lt;math&gt; \exp \left( O \left( \sqrt {n\log n} \right) \right),&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of vertices ([[Eugene M. Luks|Luks]], 1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar,  &lt;math&gt;\quad \qquad \exp \left( \tilde O \left( \sqrt n \right) \right),&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983).
&lt;br/&gt;
The algorithm builds on Luks's SI framework and attacks the barrier configurations for Luks's algorithm by group theoretic «local certificates» and combinatorial canonical partitioning techniques. We show that in a well-defined sense, [[Johnson graph]]s are the only obstructions to effective canonical partitioning.

'''Marion Scheepers''' is a mathematician and a teaching faculty of the Department of Mathematics of [[Boise State University]] in Boise, Idaho since 1988.

He was born in December 1957, in [[Thabazimbi]], South Africa. He completed his [[Ph.D.]]&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=61022}}&lt;/ref&gt; thesis entitled “The Meager-Nowhere Dense Game” at the [[University of Kansas]] under the supervision of [[Fred Galvin]]. His research interests cover [[set theory]] and its relatives, [[game theory]], [[cryptology]], elementary [[number theory]] and algorithmic phenomena in biology.

Presently, Scheepers is studying [[biological]] [[encryption]] mechanisms in certain [[single-cell organism]]s in collaboration with researchers from the [[University of Witten-Herdecke]] in [[Germany]], and the Boise State Department of Biological Sciences. For this study, he has received grant funding from the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://works.bepress.com/marion_scheepers/ About Marion Scheepers]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is particularly known for his work on selection principles and on infinite topological and set-theoretic games. He introduced themes that are common to many selection principles and is responsible for the [[Selection principle#Scheepers.27 diagram|Scheepers diagram]].

{{Astrodynamics |Efficiency measures}}

In [[aerospace engineering]], '''mass ratio''' is a measure of the efficiency of a [[rocket]]. It describes how much more massive the vehicle is with [[propellant]] than without; that is, the ratio of the rocket's ''wet mass'' (vehicle plus contents plus propellant) to its ''dry mass'' (vehicle plus contents).  A more [[specific impulse|efficient]] rocket design requires less propellant to achieve a given goal, and would therefore have a lower mass ratio; however, for any given efficiency a higher mass ratio typically permits the vehicle to achieve higher [[delta-v]].

The mass ratio is a useful quantity for back-of-the-envelope rocketry calculations: it is an easy number to derive from either [[delta-v|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{v}&lt;/math&gt;]] or from rocket and propellant mass, and therefore serves as a handy bridge between the two.  It is also a useful for getting an impression of the size of a rocket: while two rockets with [[propellant mass fraction|mass fraction]]s of, say, 92% and 95% may appear similar, the corresponding mass ratios of 12.5 and 20 clearly indicate that the latter system requires much more propellant.

Typical [[multistage rocket]]s have mass ratios in the range from 8 to 20.  The [[Space Shuttle]], for example, has a mass ratio around 16.

== Derivation ==

The definition arises naturally from [[Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v_e \ln \frac {m_0} {m_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:*[[delta-v|Δ''v'']] is the desired change in the rocket's velocity
:*''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the effective exhaust velocity (see [[specific impulse]])
:*''m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the initial mass (rocket plus contents plus propellant)
:*''m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the final mass (rocket plus contents)

This equation can be rewritten in the following equivalent form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {m_0} {m_1} = e ^ { \Delta v / v_e }&lt;/math&gt;

The fraction on the left-hand side of this equation is the rocket's mass ratio by definition.

This equation indicates that a Δv of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times the exhaust velocity requires a mass ratio of &lt;math&gt;e^n&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, for a vehicle to achieve a &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; of 2.5 times its exhaust velocity would require a mass ratio of &lt;math&gt;e^{2.5}&lt;/math&gt; (approximately 12.2).  One could say that a "velocity ratio" &lt;!-- A term used in http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/app-a2.htm for instance --&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; requires a mass ratio of &lt;math&gt;e^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Sutton defines the mass ratio inversely as:&lt;ref&gt;Rocket Propulsion Elements, 7th Edition by George P. Sutton, Oscar Biblarz&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_R = \frac {m_1} {m_0}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the values for mass fraction are always less than 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14459">'''Newton's Minimal Resistance Problem''' is a problem of finding a [[solid of revolution]] which experiences a minimum resistance when it moves through a homogeneous fluid with constant velocity in the direction of the axis of revolution, named after [[Isaac Newton]], who studied the problem in 1685 and published it in 1687 in his [[Principia Mathematica]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Isaac. "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)." London (1687) (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first example of a problem solved in what is now called the [[calculus of variations]], appearing a decade before the [[Brachistochrone curve|brachistochrone problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstine, Herman Heine. A History of the Calculus of Variations from the 17th through the 19th Century. Vol. 5. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton published the solution in [[Principia Mathematica]] without his derivation and [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] was the first person who approached Newton and persuaded him to write an analysis for him. Then the derivation was shared with his students and peers by Gregory.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, I. " Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, translation" by A. Motte (1729), revised by F. Cajori (1934)." Berkeley, CA: University of California Press 140: 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to I Bernard Cohen, in his Guide to Newton’s Principia, "The key to Newton’s reasoning was found in the 1880s, when the earl of Portsmouth gave his family’s vast collection of Newton’s scientific and mathematical papers to Cambridge University. Among Newton’s manuscripts they found the draft text of a letter, … in which Newton elaborated his mathematical argument. [This]
was never fully understood, however, until the publication of the major manuscript documents by D. T. Whiteside [1974], whose analytical and historical commentary has enabled students of Newton not only to follow fully Newton’s path to discovery and proof, but also Newton’s later (1694) recomputation of the surface of least resistance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=I. Bernard|last2=Whitman|first2=Anne|title=Principia, A New Translation|date=1999|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whiteside|first1=D. T.|title=The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton, Vol 6|date=1974|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=456, 470–480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventhough Newton's model for the fluid was wrong as per our current understanding, the fluid he had considered finds its application in [[Hypersonic flow]] theory as a limiting case.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, W. D., &amp; Probstein, R. F. (1967). Hypersonic flow theory: Inviscid flows. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

In Proposition 34 of Book 2 of the Principia, Newton wrote, ''If in a rare medium, consisting of equal particles freely disposed at equal distances from each other, a globe and a cylinder described on equal diameter move with equal velocities in the direction of the axis of the cylinder, the resistance of the globe will be but half as great as that of the cylinder.''

Following this proposition is a scholium containing the famous condition that the curve which, when rotated about its axis, generates the solid that experiences less resistance than any other solid having a fixed length, and width.

In modern form, Newton's problem is to minimize the following integral:&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan. Newton's Principia for the common reader. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Harold Thayer. Introduction to nonlinear differential and integral equations. Courier Corporation, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I = \int \frac{y \dot{y}^3}{1 + \dot{y}^2} dx &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; represents the curve which generates a solid when it is rotated about the x-axis and &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}=dy/dx&lt;/math&gt;.

I is the reduction in resistance caused by the particles impinging upon the sloping surface DNG, formed by rotating the curve, instead of perpendicularly upon the horizontal projection of DNG on the rear disc DA from the direction of motion, in Fig. 1. Note that the front of the solid is the disc BG, the triangles GBC and GBR are not part of it, but are used below by Newton to express the minimum condition.

This integral is related to the total resistance experienced by the body by the following relation: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{H^2}{2} + \int \frac{y \dot{y}^3}{1 + \dot{y}^2} dx &lt;/math&gt;

The problem is to find the curve that generates the solid that experiences less resistance than any other solid having a fixed axial length = L, and a fixed width, H.

Since the solid must taper in the direction of motion, H is the radius of the disc forming the rear surface of the curve rotated about the x-axis. The units are chosen so that the constant of proportionality is unity. Also, note that &lt;math&gt; \dot{y} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and the integral, which is evaluated between x = 0 and x = L is negative. Let y = h when x = L.

When the curve is the horizontal line, DK, so the solid is a cylinder, &lt;math&gt; y = H, \dot{y} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the integral is zero and the resistance of the cylinder is: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{H^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which explains the constant term.

== Condition for a minimum resistance solid ==

The simplest way to apply the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] to this problem is to rewrite the resistance as:

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{H^2}{2} + \int \frac{y}{1 + \dot{x}^2} dy &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \dot{x}=dx/dy &lt;/math&gt;, and the integral, which is evaluated between y = H and y = h &lt; H, is negative.

Substituting the integrand &lt;math&gt; F(y,\dot{x}) = y/(1+\dot{x}^2) &lt;/math&gt; into the Euler-Lagrange equation
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dy} \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \dot{x}}\right) = \frac{d}{dy} \left(\frac{-2\dot{x}y}{(1+\dot{x}^2)^2}\right) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and it follows that &lt;math&gt; \frac{\dot{x}y}{(1+\dot{x}^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; y = K_1\frac{(1+ p^2)^2}{p^3} &lt;/math&gt;   (1)   where &lt;math&gt; p = -\dot{y} &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and where &lt;math&gt; K_1 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

Although the curves that satisfy the minimum condition cannot be described by a simple function, y = f(x), they may be plotted using p as a parameter, to obtain the corresponding coordinates (x,y) of the curves. The equation of x as a function of p is obtained from the minimum condition (1), and an equivalent of it was first found by Newton.

Differentiating: &lt;math&gt; dy = - pdx = K_1(1 - \frac{2}{p^2} - \frac{3}{p^4})dp &lt;/math&gt;, and integrating

:&lt;math&gt;x = K_2 - K_1 \left(\ln p + \frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{3}{4p^4}\right) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; K_2 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

Since &lt;math&gt; y = H &lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt; x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; y = h &lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt; x = L &lt;/math&gt;, the constants &lt;math&gt;K_1, \ K_2&lt;/math&gt; can be determined in terms of H, h and L. Because y from equation (1) can never be zero or negative, the front surface of any solid satisfying the minimum condition must be a disc, GB.

As this was the first example of this type of problem, Newton had to invent a completely new method of solution. Also, he went much deeper in his analysis of the problem than simply finding the condition (1).

== Solid Experiencing Least Resistance ==

While a solid of least resistance must satisfy (1), the converse is not true. Fig. 2 shows the family of curves that satisfy it for different values of &lt;math&gt; K_1 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt; K_1 &lt;/math&gt; increases the radius, Bg = h, of the disc at x = L decreases and the curve becomes steeper.

Directly before the minimum resistance problem, Newton stated that if on any elliptical or oval figure rotated about its axis, p becomes greater than unity, one with less resistance can be found. This is achieved by replacing the part of the solid that has p &gt; 1 with the [[frustum]] of a cone whose vertex angle is a right angle, as shown in Fig. 2 for curve &lt;math&gt; D\nu \phi \gamma B &lt;/math&gt;. This has less resistance than &lt;math&gt; D\nu \phi \Gamma B &lt;/math&gt;. Newton does not prove this, but adds that it might have applications in shipbuilding. Whiteside supplies a proof and contends that Newton would have used the same reasoning.

In Fig. 2, since the solid generated from the curve Dng satisfies the minimum condition and has p &lt; 1 at g, it experiences less resistance than that from any other curve with the same end point g. However, for the curve DνΓ, with p &gt; 1 at end point Γ, this is not the case for although the curve satisfies the minimum condition, the resistance experienced by φγ and γΓ together is less than that by φΓ.

Newton concluded that of all solids that satisfy the minimum resistance condition, the one experiencing the least resistance, DNG in Fig. 2, is the one that has p = 1 at G. This is shown schematically in Fig. 3 where the overall resistance of the solid varies against the radius of the front surface disc, the minimum occurring when h = BG, corresponding to p = 1 at G.

In the Principia, in Fig.  1 the condition for the minimum resistance solid is translated into a geometric form as follows: draw GR parallel to the tangent at N, so that &lt;math&gt; p = \frac{GB}{BR} &lt;/math&gt;, and equation (1) becomes: &lt;math&gt; \frac{NM.GB^3}{ BR^3(1 + (GB/BR)^2)^2} = \frac{NM.BR.GB^3}{GR^4} = K_1 &lt;/math&gt;

At G, &lt;math&gt; NM = BG &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; BR = BC = BG &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; GR^2 = 2BG^2 &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; \frac{NM.BR.GB^3}{GR^4} = \frac{GB}{4} = K_1 &lt;/math&gt; which appears in the Principia in the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{NM}{GR} = \frac{GR^3}{4BR.GB^2} &lt;/math&gt;

== Newton’s Derivation of the Minimum Resistance Condition ==

Although this appears fairly simple, it has several subtleties that have caused much confusion.

In Fig 4, assume DNSG is the curve that when rotated about AB generates the solid whose resistance is less than any other such solid with the same heights, AD = H, BG = h and length, AB = L.

Fig. 5. shows the infinitesimal region of the curve about N and I in more detail. Although NI, Nj and NJ are really curved, they can be approximated by straight lines provided NH is sufficiently small.

[[File:Min Resistance Surface.png|Min Resistance Surface]]

Let HM = y, AM = x, NH = u, and HI = w = dx. Let the tangent at each point on the curve, &lt;math&gt; p = - \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{u}{w} &lt;/math&gt;. The reduction of the resistance of the sloping ring NI compared to the vertical ring NH rotated about AB is &lt;math&gt; r = \frac{yp^3}{1 + p^2}dx  = \frac{yu^3}{u^2 + w^2} &lt;/math&gt;   (2)

Let the minimum resistance solid be replaced by an identical one, except that the arc between points I and K is shifted by a small distance to the right &lt;math&gt; IJ = KL = o &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, or to the left &lt;math&gt; Ij = Kl = o &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, as shown in more detail in Fig. 5. In either case, HI becomes &lt;math&gt; HJ,Hj = w + o &lt;/math&gt;.

The resistance of the arcs of the curve DN and SG are unchanged. Also, the resistance of the arc IK is not changed by being shifted, since the slope remains the same along its length. The only change to the overall resistance of DNSG is due to the change to the gradient of arcs NI and KS. The 2 displacements have to be equal for the slope of the arc IK to be unaffected, and the new curve to end at G.

The new resistance due to particles impinging upon NJ or Nj, rather that NI is:

&lt;math&gt; r + \delta r = \frac {yu^3}{u^2 + (w + o)^2} = r - \frac {2ywu^3 o}{(u^2 + w^2)^2} &lt;/math&gt; + w.(terms in ascending powers of &lt;math&gt; \frac{o}{w} &lt;/math&gt;  starting with the 2nd).

The result is a change of resistance of: &lt;math&gt; - \frac {2NM.HI.HN^3 o}{NI^4} &lt;/math&gt; + higher order terms, the resistance being  reduced if o &gt; 0 (NJ less resisted than NI).

This is the original 1685 derivation where he obtains the above result using the series expansion in powers of o. In his 1694 revisit he differentiates (2) with respect to w. He sent details of his later approach to David Gregory, and these are included as an appendix in Motte’s translation of the Principia.

Similarly, the change in resistance due to particles impinging upon SL or Sl rather that SK is: &lt;math&gt; + \frac {2TS.OK.OS^3 o}{SK^4} &lt;/math&gt; + higher order terms.

The overall change in the resistance of the complete solid, &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho = ( - \frac {2NM.HI.HN^3}{NI^4} + \frac {2TS.OK.OS^3}{SK^4})o &lt;/math&gt; + w.(terms in ascending powers of &lt;math&gt; \frac{o}{w} &lt;/math&gt;  starting with the 2nd).
 
Fig 6 represents the total resistance of DNJLSG, or DNjlSG as a function of o. Since the original curve DNIKSG has the least resistance, any change o of whatever sign, must result in an increase in the resistance. This is only possible if the coefficient of o in the expansion of &lt;math&gt; \rho (o) &lt;/math&gt; is zero, so:

&lt;math&gt; \frac {NM.HI.HN^3}{NI^4} = \frac {TS.OK.OS^3}{SK^4} &lt;/math&gt;  (2)

If this was not the case, it would be possible to choose a value of o with a sign that produced a curve DNJLSG, or DNjlSG with less resistance than the original curve, contrary to the initial assumption. The approximation of taking straight lines for the finite arcs, NI and KS becomes exact in the limit as HN and OS approach zero. Also, NM and HM can be taken as equal, as can OT and ST.

However, N and S on the original curve are arbitrary points, so for any 2 points anywhere on the curve the above equality must apply. This is only possible if in the limit of any infinitesimal arc HI, anywhere on the curve, the expression,

&lt;math&gt; \frac {NM.HI.HN^3}{NI^4} &lt;/math&gt; is a constant. (3)

This has to be the case since, if &lt;math&gt; \frac {NM.HI.HN^3}{NI^4} &lt;/math&gt; was to vary along the curve, it would be possible to find 2 infinitesimal arcs NI and KS such that (2) was false, and the coefficient of o in the expansion of &lt;math&gt; \delta \rho &lt;/math&gt; would be non-zero. Then a solid with less resistance could be produced by choosing a suitable value of o.

This is the reason for the constant term in the minimum condition in (3). As noted above, Newton went further, and claimed that the resistance of the solid is less than that of any other with the same length and width, when the slope at G is equal to unity. Therefore, in this case, the constant in (3) is equal to one quarter of the radius of the front disc of the solid, &lt;math&gt; \frac{GB}{4} &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="636">'''Orthogonal collocation''' is a method for the [[numerical partial differential equations|numerical solution of partial differential equations]]. It uses [[collocation method|collocation]] at the zeros of some [[orthogonal polynomials]] to transform the [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) to a set of [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs). The ODEs can then be solved by any method. It has been shown that it is usually advantageous to choose the collocation points as the zeros of the corresponding [[Jacobi polynomial]] (independent of the PDE system).

'''Percy John Daniell''' (9 January 1889 – 25 May 1946) was a pure and [[applied mathematician]].  In a series of papers published between 1918 and 1928, he developed and expanded a generalized theory of integration and differentiation, which is today known as the [[Daniell integral]]. In the setting of integration, he also worked on results that lead to the [[Kolmogorov extension theorem|Daniell-Kolmogorov extension theorem]]  in the theory of stochastic processes, independently of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Aldrich,  But you have to remember PJ Daniell of Sheffield, Electronic Journal for History of Probability and Statistics, Vol. 3, number 2, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt; He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1920 at Strasbourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1920/Main/icm1920.0130.0136.ocr.pdf|pages=130–136|year=1921|title=Compte rendu du Congrès international des mathématiciens tenu à Strasbourg du 22 au 30 Septembre 1920|chapter=''Stieltjes-Volterra Products'' by P. J. Daniell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniell was born in [[Valparaiso]], [[Chile]]. His family returned to [[England]] in 1895. Daniell attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]] and proceeded to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (where he was the last  [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1909). At this time Daniell was an applied mathematician/[[theoretical physicist]]. For a year he lectured at the [[University of Liverpool]] and then he was appointed to the new [[Rice Institute]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. The Rice Institute had him spend a year  at the [[University of Göttingen]] studying with [[Max Born]] and [[David Hilbert]]. Daniell was at Rice from 1914 to 1923 when he returned to England to a chair at the [[University of Sheffield]].  During [[World War II]] Daniell advised the British [[Ministry of Supply]].  The strain of work during the war took a heavy toll on his health. He died on 25 May 1946, after having collapsed at his home a few weeks earlier.

The Phyre and Phyre2 servers predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein sequence using the principles and techniques of [[homology modeling]].
Because the structure of a protein is more conserved in evolution than its amino acid sequence, a protein sequence of interest (the target) can be modeled with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related sequence of known structure (the template), provided that the relationship between target and template can be discerned through [[sequence alignment]]. Currently the most powerful and accurate methods for detecting and aligning remotely related sequences rely on [[position-specific scoring matrix|profiles]] or [[hidden markov model|hidden Markov models (HMMs)]]. These profiles/HMMs capture the mutational propensity of each position in an amino acid sequence based on observed mutations in related sequences and can be thought of as an 'evolutionary fingerprint' of a particular protein.

Typically, the amino acid sequences of a representative set of all known three-dimensional protein structures is compiled, and these sequences are processed by scanning against a large protein sequence database. The result is a database of profiles or HMMs, one for each known 3D structure. A user sequence of interest is similarly processed to form a profile/HMM. This user profile is then scanned against the database of profiles using profile-profile or HMM-HMM alignment techniques. These alignments can also take into account patterns of predicted or known secondary structure elements and can be scored using various statistical models. See [[protein structure prediction]] for more information.
 
The first Phyre server was released in June 2005 and uses a profile-profile alignment algorithm based on each protein's [[position-specific scoring matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/prot.21688| title = Exploring the extremes of sequence/structure space with ensemble fold recognition in the program Phyre| journal = Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics| volume = 70| issue = 3| pages = 611–25| year = 2007| last1 = Bennett-Lovsey | first1 = R.

A. | pmid=17876813}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phyre2 server was publicly released February 2011 as a replacement for the original Phyre server and provides extra functionality over Phyre, a more advanced interface, fully updated fold library and uses the [[HHpred / HHsearch]] package for homology detection among other improvements.

==Standard usage==
After pasting a protein amino acid sequence into the Phyre or Phyre2 submission form, a user will typically wait between 30 minutes and several hours (depending on factors such as sequence length, number of homologous sequences and frequency and length of insertions and deletions) for a prediction to complete. An email containing summary information and the predicted structure in [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB format]] are sent to the user together with a link to a web page of results. The Phyre2 results screen is divided into three main sections, described below.

=== Secondary structure and disorder prediction ===
[[Image:Phyre2 secondary structure and disorder.png|thumb|border|Example Phyre2 output for secondary structure and disorder prediction]]
The user-submitted protein sequence is first scanned against a large sequence database using [[PSI-BLAST]]. The profile generated by PSI-BLAST is then processed by the neural network secondary structure prediction program PsiPred&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.4.404| title = The PSIPRED protein structure prediction server| journal = Bioinformatics| volume = 16| issue = 4| pages = 404–5| year = 2000| last1 = McGuffin | first1 = L. J.| last2 = Bryson | first2 = K.| last3 = Jones | first3 = D. T. | pmid=10869041}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the protein disorder predictor Disopred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/prot.10528| title = Prediction of disordered regions in proteins from position specific score matrices| journal = Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics| volume = 53| pages = 573–8| year = 2003| last1 = Jones | first1 = D. T. | last2 = Ward | first2 = J. J. | pmid=14579348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predicted presence of alpha-helices, beta-strands and disordered regions is shown graphically together with a color-coded confidence bar.

=== Domain analysis ===
[[Image:Phyre2 domain analysis.png|thumb|Example Phyre2 output showing multiple domains and pop-up model viewer]]
Many proteins contain multiple [[protein domains]]. Phyre2 provides a table of template matches color-coded by confidence and indicating the region of the user sequence matched. This can aid in the determination of the domain composition of a protein.

=== Detailed template information ===
[[Image:Phyre2 main results table.png|thumb|Example Phyre2 detailed template information table]]
The main results table in Phyre2 provides confidence estimates, images and links to the three-dimensional predicted models and information derived from either [[Structural Classification of Proteins database|Structural Classification of Proteins database (SCOP)]] or the [[Protein Data Bank|Protein Data Bank (PDB)]] depending on the source of the detected template. For each match a link takes the user to a detailed view of the alignment between the user sequence and the sequence of known three-dimensional structure.

=== Alignment view ===
[[Image:Phyre2 alignment view.png|thumb|Example Phyre2 detailed view of the alignment between a user sequence and a known protein structure.]]
The detailed alignment view permits a user to examine individual aligned residues, matches between predicted and known secondary structure elements and the ability to toggle information regarding patterns of sequence conservation and secondary structure confidence. In addition [[Jmol]] is used to permit interactive 3D viewing of the protein model.

== Improvements in Phyre2 ==
Phyre2 uses a fold library that is updated weekly as new structures are solved. It uses a more up-to-date interface and offers additional functionality over the Phyre server 
as described below.

=== Additional functionality ===

==== Batch processing ====
The batch processing feature permits users to submit more than one sequence to Phyre2 by uploading a file of sequences in [[FASTA format]]. By default, users have a limit of 100 sequences in a batch. This limit can be raised by contacting the administrator.
Batch jobs are processed in the background on free computing power as it becomes available. Thus, batch jobs will often take longer than individually submitted jobs, but this is necessary to allow a fair distribution of computing resources to all Phyre2 users.

==== One to one threading ====
One to one threading allows you to upload both a sequence you wish modelled AND the template on which to model it. Users sometimes have a protein sequence that they wish to model on a specific template of their choice. This may be for example a newly solved structure that is not in the Phyre2 database or because of some additional biological information that indicates the chosen template would produce a more accurate model than the one(s) automatically chosen by Phyre2.

==== Backphyre ====
Instead of predicting the 3D structure of a protein sequence, often users have a solved structure and they are interested in determining if there is a related structure in a genome of interest. In Phyre2 an uploaded protein structure can be converted into a hidden Markov model and then scanned against a set of genomes (more than 20 genomes as of March 2011). This functionality is called "BackPhyre" to indicate how Phyre2 is being used in reverse.

==== Phyrealarm ====
Sometimes Phyre2 can't detect any confident matches to known structures. However, the fold library database increases by about 40-100 new structures each week. So even though there might be no decent templates this week, there may well be in the coming weeks.
Phyrealarm allows users to submit a protein sequence to be automatically scanned against new entries added to the fold library every week. If a confident hit is detected, the user is automatically notified by email together with the results of the Phyre2 search. Users can also control the level of alignment coverage and confidence in the match required to trigger an email alert.

==== 3DLigandSite ====
Phyre2 is coupled to the 3DLigandSite&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq406| title = 3DLigand ''Site'': Predicting ligand-binding sites using similar structures| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| volume = 38| pages = W469| year = 2010| last1 = Wass | first1 = M. N.| last2 = Kelley | first2 = L. A.| last3 = Sternberg | first3 = M. J. E. | pmid=20513649 | pmc=2896164}}&lt;/ref&gt; server for protein binding site prediction. 3DLigandSite has been one of the top performing servers for binding site prediction at the [[CASP|Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP)]] in ([[CASP]]8 and [[CASP]]9). Confident models produced by Phyre2 (confidence &gt;90%) are automatically submitted to 3DLigandSite.

==== Transmembrane topology prediction ====
The program memsat_svm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl677| title = Improving the accuracy of transmembrane protein topology prediction using evolutionary information| journal = Bioinformatics| volume = 23| issue = 5| pages = 538–44| year = 2007| last1 = Jones | first1 = D. T.| pmid=17237066}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to predict the presence and topology of any transmembrane helices present in the user protein sequence.

==== Multi-template modelling ====
Phyre2 permits users to choose 'Intensive' modelling from the main submission screen. This mode:
	
* Examines the list of hits and applies heuristics in order to select templates that maximise sequence coverage and confidence.
* Constructs models for each selected template.
* Uses these models to provide pairwise distance constraints that are input to the ''ab initio'' and multi-template modelling tool Poing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.01.074| title = Protein Folding Requires Crowd Control in a Simulated Cell| journal = Journal of Molecular Biology| volume = 397| issue = 5| pages = 1329–38| year = 2010| last1 = Jefferys | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Kelley | first2 = L. A. | last3 = Sternberg | first3 = M. J. E. | pmid=20149797 | pmc=2891488}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Poing synthesises the user protein in the context of these distance constraints, modelled by springs. Regions for which there is no template information are modelled by the ''ab initio'' simplified physics model of Poing.
* The complete model generated by Poing is combined with the original templates as input to [[MODELLER]].

==Applications and performance==
Applications of Phyre and Phyre2 include protein structure prediction, function prediction, domain prediction, domain boundary prediction, evolutionary classification of proteins, guiding [[site-directed mutagenesis]] and solving protein crystal structures by [[molecular replacement]]. In the [[CASP]]8 blind protein structure prediction experiment, Phyre_de_novo (the predecessor of Phyre2) was ranked 4th out of 71 automatic structure prediction servers. In [[CASP]]9, Phyre2 was ranked 5th on all template-based modelling (TBM) targets and 2nd on the more difficult TBM/FM (free modelling) targets out of the 79 participating servers.

==History==
Phyre and Phyre2 are the successors to the 3D-PSSM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.2000.3741| title = Enhanced genome annotation using structural profiles in the program 3D-PSSM| journal = Journal of Molecular Biology| volume = 299| issue = 2| pages = 501–522| year = 2000| last1 = Kelley | first1 = L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">In [[mathematics]], the '''prime end''' compactification is a method to [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactify]] a [[topological disc]] (i.e. a simply connected open set in the plane) by adding a circle in an appropriate way.

==Historical notes==
The concept of prime ends was introduced by [[Constantin Carathéodory]] to describe the boundary behavior of [[conformal map]]s in the [[complex plane]] in geometric terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Epstein|1981|p=385}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory has been generalized to more general open sets.&lt;ref name="Epst.1981.par2"&gt;{{harv|Epstein|1981|loc=§2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The expository paper of {{harvtxt|Epstein|1981}} provides a good account of this theory with complete proofs: it also introduces a definition which make sense in any open set and dimension.&lt;ref name="Epst.1981.par2" /&gt; Also {{harvtxt|Milnor|2006}} gives an accessible introduction to prime ends in the context of complex dynamical systems.

==Formal definition==
The set of prime ends of the domain&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}} is the set of equivalence classes of chains of arcs converging to a point on the boundary of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}}.

In this way, a point in the boundary may correspond to many points in the prime ends of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}}, and conversely, many points in the boundary may correspond to a point in the prime ends of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}}.&lt;ref&gt;A more precise and formal definition of the concepts of "chains of arcs" and of their equivalence classes is given in the [[Prime end#References|references]] cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Carathéodory's principal theorem on the correspondence between boundaries under conformal mappings can be expressed as follows:

If {{mvar|ƒ}} maps the [[unit disk]] conformally and one-to-one onto the domain&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}}, it induces a [[one-to-one mapping]] between the points on the [[unit circle]] and the prime ends of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">'''Quasiperiodicity''' is the property of a [[system]] that displays irregular [[periodic function|periodicity]].  Periodic behavior is defined as recurring at regular intervals, such as "every 24 hours".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/periodicity Periodicity – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Quasiperiodic behavior is a pattern of recurrence with a component of unpredictability that does not lend itself to precise measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quasiperiodic Quasiperiodic – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is different from the mathematical concept of an [[almost periodic function]], which has increasing regularity over multiple periods. The mathematical definition of [[quasiperiodic function]] is a completely different concept; the two should not be confused.

==Climatology==
In [[climatology]], oscillations that appear to follow a regular pattern but which do not have a fixed period are called ''quasiperiodic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.unisdr.org/english/library/catalogue/v.php?id=1975 Not Found – UNISDR]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The meteorological glossary: 2d ed.''  1930.  Meteorological Office, Great Britain. "Certain phenomena which recur more or less regularly but without the exactness of truly periodic phenomena are termed quasi-periodic."&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a [[dynamical system]] such as the ocean-atmosphere oscillations may occur regularly, when they are forced by a regular external forcing: for example, the familiar winter-summer cycle is forced by variations in sunlight from the (very close to perfectly) periodic motion of the earth around the sun. Or, like the recent [[ice age]] cycles, they may be less regular but still locked by external forcing. However, when the system contains the potential for an oscillation, but there is no strong external forcing it to be [[phase-locked]] to it, the "period" is likely to be irregular.

The canonical example of quasiperiodicity in climatology is [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]]. In the modern era, it has a "period" somewhere between four and twelve years and a peak [[spectral density]] around five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/paper/8668/3895 |last = Dorin| first = Joshua N.| title = Detecting ENSO Period Changes in a Proxy Record Spanning the Last Millennium | date = 2009 |publisher=Pennsylvanai State University (PhD Thesis)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''recommender system''' or a '''recommendation system''' (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of [[information filtering system]] that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference"  a user would give to an item.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1992403,00.html|title=Facebook, Pandora Lead Rise of Recommendation Engines - TIME|date=27 May 2010|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts,&lt;ref name="expertseer"&gt;H. Chen, A. G. Ororbia II, C. L.

== Overview ==

Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways – through [[collaborative filtering]] or through [[content-based filtering]] (also known as the personality-based approach).&lt;ref&gt;Hosein Jafarkarimi; A.T.H. Sim and R. Saadatdoost [http://www.ijiet.org/show-31-222-1.html A Naïve Recommendation Model for Large Databases], International Journal of Information and Education Technology, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative filtering]] approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.&lt;ref name="Recommender2010"&gt;Prem Melville and Vikas Sindhwani, [http://www.prem-melville.com/publications/recommender-systems-eml2010.pdf Recommender Systems], Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Content-based filtering]] approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.&lt;ref name="mooney99"&gt;
{{cite conference |author1=R. J. Mooney  |author2=L. Roy  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1999 |title = Content-based book recommendation using learning for text categorization |conference = In Workshop Recom. Sys.: Algo. and Evaluation }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are often combined (see [[Recommender system#Hybrid recommender systems|Hybrid Recommender Systems]]).

The differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two popular music recommender systems – [[Last.fm]] and [[Pandora Radio]].
* Last.fm creates a "station" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.
* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a "station" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user "dislikes" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user "likes" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.

Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]] problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example, it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed).

Recommender systems are a useful alternative to [[search algorithm]]s since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise. Of note, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.

Recommender systems were first mentioned in a technical report as a "digital bookshelf" in 1990 by [[Jussi Karlgren]] at Columbia University,&lt;ref&gt;Karlgren, Jussi. 1990. "An Algebra for Recommendations." Syslab Working Paper 179 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by Jussi Karlgren, then at SICS,&lt;ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Collaborative filtering ===
{{Main article|Collaborative filtering}}

One approach to the design of recommender systems that has  wide use is [[collaborative filtering]].&lt;ref name="Breese98"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=John S. Breese |author2=David Heckerman |author3=Carl Kadie  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1998 |title = Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering |conference =  In Proceedings of the Fourteenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI'98) }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of information on users’ behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }},&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past.

When building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].

Examples of explicit data collection include the following:
* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.
* Asking a user to search.
* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.
* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.
* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes.

Examples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:
* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.
* Analyzing item/user viewing times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.
* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.
* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.

The recommender system compares the collected data to similar and dissimilar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended items for the user. Several commercial and non-commercial examples are listed in the article on [[collaborative filtering|collaborative filtering systems]].

One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6,266,649.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,266,649&amp;RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&amp;RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include:
* As previously detailed, [[Last.fm]] recommends music based on a comparison of the listening habits of similar users, while [[Readgeek]] compares books ratings for recommendations.
* [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[LinkedIn]], and other social networks use collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections (by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends).&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] uses many signals and in-memory computations for recommending to its users whom they should "follow."&lt;ref name="twitterwtf" /&gt;
Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.&lt;ref name="Lee2007"&gt;Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZEI50fmXTh&amp;sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&amp;f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cold start: These systems often require a large amount of existing data on a user in order to make accurate recommendations.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elahi2016"/&gt;
* Scalability: In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.
* Sparsity: The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.

A particular type of collaborative filtering algorithm uses [[matrix factorization (recommender systems)|matrix factorization]], a [[low rank approximation|low-rank matrix approximation]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;I. Markovsky, Low-Rank Approximation: Algorithms, Implementation, Applications, Springer, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4471-2226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Takács |first = G. |last2 = Pilászy |first2 = I. |last3 = Németh |first3 = B. |last4 = Tikk |first4 = D. |url = http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume10/takacs09a/takacs09a.pdf |title = Scalable Collaborative Filtering Approaches for Large Recommender Systems |journal = Journal of Machine Learning Research |volume = 10 |date=March 2009 |pages = 623–656 |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model based collaborative filtering. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is user-based algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of model-based approaches is Kernel-Mapping Recommender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025512002587|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content-based filtering ===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

Another common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal16Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=Recommender Systems: The Textbook|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319296579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Peter Brusilovsky]]|title=The Adaptive Web|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-72078-2|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a content-based recommender system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.

To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the 
[[tf–idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).

To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:

1. A model of the user's preference.

2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.

Basically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems – How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct feedback from a user, usually in the form of a [[like button|like or dislike button]], can be used to assign higher or lower weights on the importance of certain attributes (using [[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]] or other similar techniques).

A key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing.

Pandora Radio is an example of a content-based recommender system that plays music with similar characteristics to that of a song provided by the user as an initial seed. There are also a large number of content-based recommender systems aimed at providing movie recommendations, a few such examples include [[Rotten Tomatoes]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Jinni (search engine)|Jinni]], [[Rovi Corporation]], and [[Jaman]]. Document related recommender systems aim at providing document recommendations to knowledge workers. Public health professionals have been studying recommender systems to personalize health education and preventative strategies.&lt;ref name="pmid27318270"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Macedo AA, Pollettini JT, Baranauskas JA, Chaves JC| title=A Health Surveillance Software Framework to deliver information on preventive healthcare strategies. | journal=J Biomed Inform | year= 2016 | volume= 62 | issue=  | pages= 159–70 | pmid=27318270 | doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2016.06.002 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=27318270  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19745443"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fernandez-Luque L, Karlsen R, Vognild LK| title=Challenges and opportunities of using recommender systems for personalized health education. | journal=Stud Health Technol Inform | year= 2009 | volume= 150 | issue=  | pages= 903–7 | pmid=19745443 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19745443  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid recommender systems ===

Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining [[collaborative filtering]] and content-based filtering could be more effective in some cases. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see&lt;ref name="Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems" /&gt; for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrate that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate
recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.

[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1145/2843948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).

A variety of techniques have been proposed as the basis for recommender systems: collaborative, content-based, knowledge-based, and demographic techniques. Each of these techniques has known shortcomings, such as the well known [[Cold start (computing)|cold-start]] problem for collaborative and content-based systems (what to do with new users with few ratings) and the knowledge engineering bottleneck&lt;ref&gt;Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web – Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches. A hybrid recommender system is one that combines multiple techniques together to achieve some synergy between them.

*[[Collaborative filtering|Collaborative]]: The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. Collaborative systems locate peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item and generate recommendations using this neighborhood. The user-based and the item based nearest neighbor algorithms can be combined to deal with the cold start problem and improve recommendation results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Recommender Systems:An Introduction |author1 = Dietmar Jannach |author2 = Markus Zanker |author3 = Alexander Felfernig |author4 = Gerhard Friedrich |year = 2010 |url = http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831032309/http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2015-08-31 |publisher = CUP |isbn = 978-0-521-49336-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Content-based: The system generates recommendations from two sources: the features associated with products and the ratings that a user has given them. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features.
*Demographic: A demographic recommender provides recommendations based on a demographic profile of the user. Recommended products can be produced for different demographic niches, by combining the ratings of users in those niches.
*[[Knowledge base|Knowledge-based]]: A [[knowledge-based recommender system|knowledge-based recommender]] suggests products based on inferences about a user’s needs and preferences. This knowledge will sometimes contain explicit functional knowledge about how certain product features meet user needs.&lt;ref name=hybrids&gt;Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems], pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constraintbased"&gt;Alexander Felfernig and Robin Burke.

The term hybrid recommender system is used here to describe any recommender system that combines multiple recommendation techniques together to produce its output. There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized, for example, two different content-based recommenders could work together, and a number of projects have investigated this type of hybrid: NewsDude,
which uses both naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classifiers in its news recommendations is just one example.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

Seven hybridization techniques:
*Weighted: The score of different recommendation components are combined numerically.
*Switching: The system chooses among recommendation components and applies the selected one.
*Mixed: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.
*Feature Combination: Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.
*Feature Augmentation: One recommendation technique is used to compute a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.
*Cascade: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.
*Meta-level: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

== Beyond accuracy ==
Typically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. However, there are a number of factors that are also important.

*'''Diversity''' – Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity, e.g. items from different artists.&lt;ref name="Ziegler2005"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ziegler, C.N., McNee, S.M., Konstan, J.A. and Lausen, G.| chapter=Improving recommendation lists through topic diversification| title=Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web| year=2005| pages=22–32|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Recommender persistence''' – In some situations, it is more effective to re-show recommendations,&lt;ref name="Beel2013e"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joeran Beel |author2=Stefan Langer |author3=Marcel Genzmehr |author4=Andreas Nürnberger | chapter=Persistence in Recommender Systems: Giving the Same Recommendations to the Same Users Multiple Times| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| volume=8092| pages=390–394| publisher=Springer|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | series=Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS)| url=http://docear.org/papers/persistence_in_recommender_systems_--_giving_the_same_recommendations_to_the_same_users_multiple_times.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or let users re-rate items,&lt;ref name="Cosley2003"&gt;{{cite book| author=Cosley, D., Lam, S.K., Albert, I., Konstan, J.A., Riedl, {J}.| chapter=Is seeing believing?: how recommender system interfaces affect users' opinions| title=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems| year=2003| pages=585–592| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time, for instance, because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully.
*'''Privacy''' – Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns&lt;ref name="Pu2012"&gt;{{cite journal| author={P}u, {P}., {C}hen, {L}., {H}u, {R}.| title=Evaluating recommender systems from the user's perspective: survey of the state of the art| journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction| year=2012| pages=1–39| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; because users have to reveal sensitive information. Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view. Many European countries have a strong culture of [[information privacy|data privacy]], and every attempt to introduce any level of user [[Profiling (information science)|profiling]] can result in a negative customer response. A number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the [[Netflix Prize]] competition. Although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy, in 2007 two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 Rise of the Netflix Hackers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124011808/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 |date=January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in December 2009, an anonymous Netflix user sued Netflix in Doe v. Netflix, alleging that Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/netflix-privacy-lawsuit/|title=Netflix Spilled Your Brokeback Mountain Secret, Lawsuit Claims|date=17 December 2009|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led in part to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in 2010.&lt;ref name="nfcancel"/&gt; Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. Ramakrishnan et al. have conducted an extensive overview of the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties (an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations) and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset.&lt;ref name="privacyoverview"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naren Ramakrishnan |author2=Benjamin J. Keller |author3=Batul J. Mirza |author4=Ananth Y. Grama |author5=George Karypis |year = 2001 |title = Privacy Risks in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Internet Computing |volume = 5 |issue = 6 |url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/schein02methods.html |isbn = 1-58113-561-0 |publisher = [[IEEE Educational Activities Department]] |location = Piscataway, NJ |pages = 54–62 |doi = 10.1109/4236.968832 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''User demographics''' – Beel et al. found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations.&lt;ref name="Beel2013f"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joeran Beel |author2=Stefan Langer |author3=Andreas Nürnberger |author4=Marcel Genzmehr | chapter=The Impact of Demographics (Age and Gender) and Other User Characteristics on Evaluating Recommender Systems| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| pages=400–404| publisher=Springer|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | url=http://docear.org/papers/the_impact_of_users'_demographics_(age_and_gender)_and_other_characteristics_on_evaluating_recommender_systems.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users.
*'''Robustness''' – When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.&lt;ref name="Konstan2012"&gt;{{cite journal| author={K}onstan, {J}.{A}., {R}iedl, {J}.| title=Recommender systems: from algorithms to user experience| journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction| year=2012| pages=1–23| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Serendipity''' – [[Serendipity]] is a measure of "how surprising the recommendations are".&lt;ref name="Ricci2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author={R}icci, {F}., {R}okach, {L}., {S}hapira, {B}., {K}antor {B}. {P}.| title=Recommender systems handbook| journal=Recommender Systems Handbook| year=2011| pages=1–35| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate, but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy. However, high scores of serendipity may have a negative impact on accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonçalves|first=Diogo|last2=Costa|first2=Miguel|last3=Couto|first3=Francisco M.|date=2016-09-15|title=A Flexible Recommendation System for Cable TV|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307907905_A_Flexible_Recommendation_System_for_Cable_TV|journal=3rd Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Television and online Video (RecSysTV), At Boston, MA, USA|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Trust''' – A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system.&lt;ref name="Montaner2002"&gt;{{cite book| author=Montaner, Miquel, L{\'o}pez, Beatriz, de la Rosa, Josep Llu{\'\i}s| chapter=Developing trust in recommender agents| title=Proceedings of the first international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems: part 1| year=2002| pages=304–305| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.
*'''Labelling''' – User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations.&lt;ref name="Beel2013a"&gt;{{cite book| author=Beel, Joeran, Langer, Stefan, Genzmehr, Marcel| chapter=Sponsored vs. Organic (Research Paper) Recommendations and the Impact of Labeling| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| pages=395–399| url=http://docear.org/papers/sponsored_vs._organic_(research_paper)_recommendations_and_the_impact_of_labeling.pdf|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the cited study [[click-through rate]] (CTR) for recommendations labeled as "Sponsored" were lower (CTR=5.93%) than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as "Organic" (CTR=8.86%). Recommendations with no label performed best (CTR=9.87%) in that study.

== Mobile recommender systems ==
{{see|Location based recommendation}}
One growing area of research in the area of recommender systems is mobile recommender systems. With the increasing ubiquity of internet-accessing [[smart phones]], it is now possible to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with (it is heterogeneous, noisy, requires spatial and temporal auto-correlation, and has validation and generality problems&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Yong Ge |author2=Hui Xiong |author3=Alexander Tuzhilin |author4=Keli Xiao |author5=Marco Gruteser |author6=Michael J. Pazzani |year = 2010 |title = An Energy-Efficient Mobile Recommender System |conference = Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining |url = http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~gruteser/papers/KDD10.pdf |publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |location = [[New York City|New York City, New York]] |pages = 899–908 |accessdate = 2011-11-17 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem – recommendations may not apply in all regions (for instance, it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available).

One example of a mobile recommender system is one that offers potentially profitable driving routes for taxi drivers in a city.&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"/&gt; This system takes input data in the form of GPS traces of the routes that taxi drivers took while working, which include location (latitude and longitude), time stamps, and operational status (with or without passengers). It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits. This type of system is obviously location-dependent, and since it must operate on a handheld or embedded device, the computation and energy requirements must remain low.

Another example of mobile recommendation is what (Bouneffouf et al., 2012) developed for professional users. Using GPS traces of the user and his agenda, it suggests suitable information depending on his situation and interests. The system uses machine learning
techniques and reasoning processes in order to dynamically adapt the mobile recommender system to the evolution of the user’s interest. The author called his algorithm hybrid-ε-greedy.&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2012"&gt;{{citation|last=Bouneffouf |first=Djallel |contribution=Following the User's Interests in Mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems: The Hybrid-e-greedy Algorithm |pages=657–662 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |title=Proceedings of the 2012 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops |year=2012 |url=http://www-inf.int-evry.fr/~bounef_d/index_fichiers/Hybrid-e-greedy%20for%20Mobile%20Context-aware%20Recommender%20System.pdf |isbn=978-0-7695-4652-0 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the "Web of Data" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM&lt;ref name="Ruotsalo2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tuukka Ruotsalo |author2=Krister Haav |author3=Antony Stoyanov |author4=Sylvain Roche |author5=Elena Fani |author6=Romina Deliai |author7=Eetu Mäkelä |author8=Tomi Kauppinen |author9=Eero Hyvönen | title = SMARTMUSEUM: A Mobile Recommender System for the Web of Data | pages = 657–662 | publisher = Elsevier| year = 2013 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826813000061 | doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2013.03.001 | volume=20 | journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning
techniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data.

There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results: the context, the recommendation method and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pimenidis |first1=Elias |last2=Polatidis |first2=Nikolaos |last3=Mouratidis |first3=Haralambos |title=Mobile recommender systems: Identifying the major concepts |journal=Journal of Information Science |date=3 August 2018 |pages=016555151879221 |doi=10.1177/0165551518792213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk-aware recommender systems ==
The majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information and do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user in specific situation. However, in many applications, such as recommending personalized content, it is also important to consider the risk of upsetting the user so as not to push recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process.

===Risk definition===
"The risk in recommender systems is the possibility to disturb or to upset the user
which leads to a bad answer of the user".&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"&gt;{{citation | type=Ph.D.
 | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System
 | publisher = Institut National des Télécommunications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these challenges, the authors in ''DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System''&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"/&gt; have developed a dynamic risk sensitive recommendation system called DRARS (Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System), which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm. They have shown that DRARS improves the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy, the currently available best algorithm, by calculating the most optimal exploration value to maintain a trade-off between exploration and exploitation based on the risk level of the current user's situation. The authors conducted experiments in an industrial context with real data and real users and have shown that taking into account the risk level of users' situations significantly increased the performance of the recommender systems.

== The Netflix Prize ==
{{Main article|Netflix Prize}}

One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/technology/internet/22netflix.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/ProgressPrize2007_KorBell.pdf |author1=R. Bell |author2=Y. Koren |author3=C. Volinsky |title = The BellKor solution to the Netflix Prize |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors. ''Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single technique.''  Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project. Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets. Some members from the team that finished second place founded [[Gravity R&amp;D]], a recommendation engine that's active in the RecSys community.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodoky|first1=Thomas|title=Mátrixfaktorizáció one million dollars|url=http://index.hu/tech/net/2009/08/07/matrixfaktorizacio_egymillio_dollarert/|website=Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4-Tell, Inc. created a Netflix project–derived solution for ecommerce websites.

A second contest was planned, but was ultimately canceled in response to an ongoing lawsuit and concerns from the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name="nfcancel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/this-is-neil-hunt-chief-product-officer.html | title = Netflix Prize Update | date = 2010-03-12 | publisher = Netflix Prize Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance measures ==
Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms. The commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Recently, diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: Temporal diversity in recommender systems. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210–217. ACM, New York&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.&lt;ref name="Turpin2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225–231|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beel|first=Joeran|last2=Genzmehr|first2=Marcel|last3=Langer|first3=Stefan|last4=Nürnberger|first4=Andreas|last5=Gipp|first5=Bela|date=2013-01-01|title=A Comparative Analysis of Offline and Online Evaluations and Discussion of Research Paper Recommender System Evaluation|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532511|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=7–14|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532511|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude "we would suggest treating results of offline evaluations [i.e. classic performance measures] with skepticism".

== Multi-criteria recommender systems ==
Multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria. Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion values, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5751215&amp;tag=1 |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64–76 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; See this chapter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an extended introduction.

== Opinion-based recommender systems ==
In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated text are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and the user’s evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as user’s rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]] and [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]).

== Recommender system evaluation ==
To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; User studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge, which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|last=Jannach|first=Dietmar|last2=Lerche|first2=Lukas|last3=Gedikli|first3=Fatih|last4=Bonnin|first4=Geoffray|date=2013-06-10|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642388439|editor-last=Carberry|editor-first=Sandra|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=25–37|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|editor-last2=Weibelzahl|editor-first2=Stephan|editor-last3=Micarelli|editor-first3=Alessandro|editor-last4=Semeraro|editor-first4=Giovanni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turpin|first=Andrew H.|last2=Hersh|first2=William|date=2001-01-01|title=Why Batch and User Evaluations Do Not Give the Same Results|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/383952.383992|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval|series=SIGIR '01|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=225–231|doi=10.1145/383952.383992|isbn=1581133316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|last1=Langer|first1=Stefan|date=2015-09-14|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319245911|editor-last=Kapidakis|editor-first=Sarantos|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=153–168|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|editor-last2=Mazurek|editor-first2=Cezary|editor-last3=Werla|editor-first3=Marcin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms.&lt;ref name="BasaranNtoutsi2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basaran|first1=Daniel|last2=Ntoutsi|first2=Eirini|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|title=Redundancies in Data and their Effect on the Evaluation of Recommendation Systems: A Case Study on the Amazon Reviews Datasets|year=2017|pages=390–398|doi=10.1137/1.9781611974973.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducibility in recommender system research ==
In recent years there was a growing understanding in the community that  lots of previous research had little impact on the practical application of recommender systems. Ekstrand, Konstan, et al. criticize that "it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results,” and that evaluations are “not handled consistently".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekstrand|first=Michael D.|last2=Ludwig|first2=Michael|last3=Konstan|first3=Joseph A.|last4=Riedl|first4=John T.|date=2011-01-01|title=Rethinking the Recommender Research Ecosystem: Reproducibility, Openness, and LensKit|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2043932.2043958|journal=Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=133–140|doi=10.1145/2043932.2043958|isbn=9781450306836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that "the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge […] often because the research lacks the […] evaluation to be properly judged and, hence, to provide meaningful contributions.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konstan|first=Joseph A.|last2=Adomavicius|first2=Gediminas|date=2013-01-01|title=Toward Identification and Adoption of Best Practices in Algorithmic Recommender Systems Research|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532513|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=23–28|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532513|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, lots of research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Breitinger|first1=Corinna|last2=Langer|first2=Stefan|last3=Lommatzsch|first3=Andreas|last4=Gipp|first4=Bela|date=2016-03-12|title=Towards reproducibility in recommender-systems research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=69–101|doi=10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|issn=0924-1868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question, which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems. Said &amp; Bellogín conducted a study of recent papers published in the field, as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results, even when the same algorithms and data sets were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Said|first=Alan|last2=Bellogín|first2=Alejandro|date=2014-10-01|title=Comparative recommender system evaluation: benchmarking recommendation frameworks

They conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "(1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research."

While reproducibility has not been considered for a long time in the recommender-system community, this aspects is much more considered recently, with several workshops and conferences focusing on reproducibility in recommender system research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamopoulos|first=Panagiotis|last2=Bellogín|first2=Alejandro|last3=Castells|first3=Pablo|last4=Cremonesi|first4=Paolo|last5=Steck|first5=Harald|date=2014-01-01|title=REDD 2014 – International Workshop on Recommender Systems Evaluation: Dimensions and Design|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2645710.2645780|journal=Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=393–394|doi=10.1145/2645710.2645780|isbn=9781450326681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anticipatory design ==
Anticipatory design is the combination of Internet of Things, User experience design and machine learning. Anticipatory design differs from conventional design, in that within anticipatory design the goal is to simplify the process and minimize difficulty by making decisions on behalf of the users. Examples of services that use various levels of anticipatory designs are: Amazon and Netflix production recommendation which recommend products based on previous behavior, the mobile application Peapod which uses a recommendation engine to allow users to fill their shopping basket based on previous orders, and the Nest thermostat which predicts the perfect room temperature based on user input and time of day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/anticipatory-design/|title=What You Need To Know About Anticipatory Design|date=2015-09-10|work=Smashing Magazine|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[set theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''reflection principle''' says that it is possible to find sets that resemble the class of all sets. There are several different forms of the reflection principle depending on exactly what is meant by "resemble". Weak forms of the reflection principle are theorems of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory|ZF set theory]] due to {{harvtxt|Montague|1961}}, while stronger forms can be new and very powerful axioms for set theory. 

The name "reflection principle" comes from the fact that properties of the universe of all sets are "reflected" down to a smaller set.

==Motivation==

A naive version of the reflection principle states that "for any property of the universe of all sets we can find a set with the same property". This leads to an immediate contradiction: 
the universe of all sets contains all sets, but there is no set with the property that it contains all sets. To get useful (and non-contradictory) reflection principles we need to be more careful about what we mean by "property" and what properties we allow. 

To find non-contradictory reflection principles we might argue informally as follows. Suppose that we have some collection ''A'' of methods for forming sets (for example, taking powersets, subsets, the axiom of replacement, and so on). We can imagine taking all sets obtained by repeatedly applying all these methods, and form these sets into a class ''V'', which can be thought of as a model of some set theory. But now we can introduce the following new principle for forming sets: "the collection of all sets obtained from some set by repeatedly applying all methods in the collection ''A'' is also a set". If we allow this new principle for forming sets, we can now continue past ''V'', and consider the class ''W'' of all sets formed using the principles ''A'' and the new principle. In this class ''W'', ''V'' is just a set, closed under
all the set-forming operations of ''A''. In other words the universe ''W'' contains a ''set'' ''V'' which resembles ''W'' in that it is closed under all the methods ''A''.

We can use this informal argument in two ways. We can try to formalize it in (say) ZF set theory; by doing this we obtain some theorems of ZF set theory, called reflection theorems. 
Alternatively we can use this argument to motivate introducing new axioms for set theory.

==In ZFC==

In trying to formalize the argument for the reflection principle of the previous section in ZF set theory, it turns out to be necessary to add some conditions about the collection of properties ''A'' (for example, ''A'' might be finite). Doing this produces 
several closely related "reflection theorems" of ZFC all of which state that we can find a set that is almost a model of ZFC. 

One form of the reflection principle in ZFC says that for any '''finite''' set of axioms of ZFC we can find a countable [[set model|transitive model]] satisfying these axioms. (In particular this proves that, unless inconsistent, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable because if it were it would prove the existence of a model of itself, and hence prove its own consistency, contradicting Gödel's second incompleteness theorem.) This version of the reflection theorem is closely related to the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]. 

Another version of the reflection principle says that for any '''finite''' number of formulas of ZFC we can find a set ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[cumulative hierarchy]] such that all the formulas in the set are [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]] for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; (which means very roughly that they hold in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if they hold in the universe of all sets). So this says that the set ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; resembles the universe of all sets, at least as far as the given finite number of formulas is concerned. In particular for any formula of ZFC there is a theorem of ZFC that the formula is logically equivalent to a version of it with all quantifiers relativized to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; See {{harv|Jech|2002|p=168}}.

If &amp;kappa; is a strong inaccessible, then there is a closed unbounded subset ''C'' of &amp;kappa;, such that for every α∈''C'', the identity function from V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; to V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;kappa;&lt;/sub&gt; is an elementary embedding.

==As new axioms==

Bernays used a reflection principle as an axiom for one version of set theory (not [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], which is a weaker theory). His reflection principle stated roughly that if ''A'' is a class with some property, then one can find a transitive set ''u'' such that ''A∩u'' has the same property when considered as a subset of the "universe" ''u''. This is quite a powerful axiom and implies the existence of several of the smaller [[large cardinal]]s, such as [[inaccessible cardinal]]s. (Roughly speaking, the class of all ordinals in ZFC is an inaccessible cardinal apart from the fact that it is not a set, and the reflection principle can then be used to show that there is a set which has the same property, in other words which is an inaccessible cardinal.) Unfortunately, this cannot be axiomatized directly in ZFC, and a class theory like [[Morse–Kelley set theory|MK]] normally has to be used. The consistency of Bernays's reflection principle is implied by the existence of a [[Erdős cardinal|ω-Erdős cardinal]]. 

There are many more powerful reflection principles, which are closely related to the various large cardinal axioms. For almost every known large cardinal axiom there is a known reflection principle that implies it, and conversely all but the most powerful known reflection principles are implied by known large cardinal axioms {{harv|Marshall R.|1989}}. An example of this is the [[wholeness axiom]], which implies the existence of [[huge cardinal|super-n-huge cardinal]]s for all finite n and its consistency is implied by an I3 [[rank-into-rank|rank-into-rank cardinal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4982">In [[mathematics]], the '''Riesz potential''' is a [[potential theory|potential]] named after its discoverer, the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]] [[Marcel Riesz]].  In a sense, the Riesz potential defines an inverse for a power of the [[Laplace operator]] on Euclidean space.  They generalize to several variables the [[Riemann–Liouville integral]]s of one variable.

If 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', then the Riesz potential ''I''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' of a [[locally integrable function]] ''f'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the function defined by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(I_{\alpha}f) (x)= \frac{1}{c_\alpha} \int_{{\mathbb{R}}^n} \frac{f(y)}{| x - y |^{n-\alpha}} \, \mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where the constant is given by

:&lt;math&gt;c_\alpha = \pi^{n/2}2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\alpha/2)}{\Gamma((n-\alpha)/2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[singular integral]] is well-defined provided ''f'' decays sufficiently rapidly at infinity, specifically if ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;[[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)]] with 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''/&amp;alpha;. In fact, for any 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p'' (p&gt;1 is classical, due to Sobolev, while for p=1 see  {{harv|Schikorra | Spector | Van Schaftingen}}), the rate of decay of ''f'' and that of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' are related in the form of an inequality (the [[Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality]])
:&lt;math&gt;\|I_\alpha f\|_{p^*} \le C_p \|Rf\|_p,\quad p^*=\frac{np}{n-\alpha p},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Rf=DI_1f&lt;/math&gt; is the vector-valued Riesz transform.  More generally, the operators ''I''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; are well-defined for [[complex number|complex]] &amp;alpha; such that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''.

The Riesz potential can be defined more generally in a [[distribution (mathematics)|weak sense]] as the [[convolution]]

:&lt;math&gt;I_\alpha f = f*K_\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; is the locally integrable function:
:&lt;math&gt;K_\alpha(x) = \frac{1}{c_\alpha}\frac{1}{|x|^{n-\alpha}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The Riesz potential can therefore be defined whenever ''f'' is a compactly supported distribution.  In this connection, the Riesz potential of a positive [[Borel measure]] &amp;mu; with [[support (measure theory)|compact support]] is chiefly of interest in [[potential theory]] because ''I''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;mu; is then a (continuous) [[subharmonic function]] off the support of &amp;mu;, and is [[lower semicontinuous]] on all of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Consideration of the [[Fourier transform]] reveals that the Riesz potential is a [[Fourier multiplier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Samko|1998|loc=section II}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{K_\alpha}(\xi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} K_{\alpha}(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi }\, \mathrm{d}x = |2\pi\xi|^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
and so, by the [[convolution theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{I_\alpha f}(\xi) = |2\pi\xi|^{-\alpha} \hat{f}(\xi).&lt;/math&gt;

The Riesz potentials satisfy the following [[semigroup]] property on, for instance, [[rapidly decreasing]] [[continuous function]]s
:&lt;math&gt;I_\alpha I_\beta = I_{\alpha+\beta}\ &lt;/math&gt;
provided
:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \operatorname{Re\,} \alpha, \operatorname{Re\,} \beta &lt; n,\quad 0 &lt; \operatorname{Re\,} (\alpha+\beta) &lt; n.&lt;/math&gt;
Furthermore, if 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;Re&amp;nbsp;&amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;&lt;''n'', then
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta I_{\alpha+2} = -I_\alpha.\ &lt;/math&gt;
One also has, for this class of functions,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\alpha\to 0^+} (I_\alpha f)(x) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, the '''Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem''' relates [[linear functional]]s on spaces of continuous functions on a [[locally compact space]] to [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] in measure theory.  The theorem is named for {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Frigyes Riesz|first=Frigyes |last=Riesz|year=1909}} who introduced it for [[Continuous function|continuous functions]] on the [[unit interval]], {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Andrey Markov, Jr.| first=Andrey |last=Markov|year=1938}} who extended the result to some non-compact spaces, and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Shizuo Kakutani|first=Shizuo |last=Kakutani|year=1941}} who extended the result to [[Compact Hausdorff space|compact Hausdorff spaces]].

There are many closely related variations of the theorem, as the linear functionals can be complex, real, or [[Positive linear functional|positive]], the space they are defined on may be the unit interval or a compact space or a [[locally compact space]],  the continuous functions may be [[Vanish at infinity|vanishing at infinity]] or have [[compact support]], and the measures can be [[Baire measure]]s or regular [[Borel measure]]s or [[Radon measure]]s or [[signed measure]]s or [[complex measure]]s.

== The representation theorem for positive linear functionals on ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X'') ==

The following theorem represents positive [[linear functionals]] on ''C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X''), the space of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[compact space|compactly]] [[support (mathematics)|supported]] complex-valued functions on a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] ''X''. The [[Borel set]]s in the following statement refer to the [[σ-algebra]] generated by the [[Open set|''open'' sets]].

A non-negative countably additive Borel measure μ on a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] ''X'' is '''regular''' [[if and only if]]

* μ(''K'') &lt; ∞ for every compact ''K'';
* For every Borel set ''E'',
:: &lt;math&gt; \mu(E) = \inf \{\mu(U): E \subseteq U, U \mbox{ open}\} &lt;/math&gt;
*  The relation
:: &lt;math&gt; \mu(E) = \sup \{\mu(K): K \subseteq E, K \mbox{ compact}\} &lt;/math&gt;
holds whenever ''E'' is open or when ''E'' is Borel and ''μ''(''E'') &lt; ∞ .

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]].  For any [[positive linear functional]] &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; on ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), there is a unique [[regular Borel measure]] μ on ''X'' such that
:&lt;math&gt; \psi(f) = \int_X f(x) \, d \mu(x) \quad &lt;/math&gt;
for all ''f'' in C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

One approach to [[measure theory]] is to start with a [[Radon measure]], defined as a positive linear functional on ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). This is the way adopted by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]; it does of course assume that ''X'' starts life as a [[topological space]], rather than simply as a set. For locally compact spaces an integration theory is then recovered.

Without the condition of [[Regular measure|regularity]] the Borel measure need not be unique. For example, let ''X'' be the set of ordinals at most equal to the [[first uncountable ordinal]] Ω, with the topology generated by "[[Open interval|open intervals]]". The linear functional taking a continuous function to its value at Ω corresponds to the regular Borel measure with a point mass at Ω. However it also corresponds to the (non-regular) Borel measure that assigns measure 1 to any Borel set &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq [0,\Omega]&lt;/math&gt; if there is [[club set|closed and unbounded set]] &lt;math&gt;C\subseteq [0,\Omega[&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;C\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, and assigns measure 0 to other Borel sets. (In particular the singleton {Ω} gets measure 0, contrary to the point mass measure.)

Historical remark: In its original form by F. Riesz  (1909) the theorem states that every continuous linear functional ''A''[''f''] over the space ''C''([0, 1]) of continuous functions in the interval [0,1] can be represented in the form

:&lt;math&gt;A[f] = \int_0^1 f(x)\,d\alpha(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α''(''x'') is a function of [[bounded variation]] on the interval [0, 1], and the integral is a [[Riemann–Stieltjes integral]]. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between Borel regular measures in the interval and functions of bounded variation (that assigns to each function of bounded variation the corresponding Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, and the integral with respect to the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure agrees with the Riemann–Stieltjes integral for continuous functions ), the above stated theorem generalizes the original statement of F. Riesz. (See Gray(1984), for a historical discussion).

== The representation theorem for the continuous dual of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') ==

The following theorem, also referred to as the ''Riesz–Markov theorem'', gives a concrete realisation of the [[Dual space#Continuous dual space|topological dual space]] of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), the set of [[continuous function]]s on ''X'' which [[vanish at infinity]].  The [[Borel set]]s in the statement of the theorem also refers to the σ-algebra generated by the ''open'' sets.

If μ is a complex-valued countably additive Borel measure, μ is called regular if the non-negative countably additive measure |μ| is regular as defined above.

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''X'' be a locally compact Hausdorff space.  For any continuous [[linear functional]] ψ on ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), there is a unique ''regular'' countably additive complex [[Borel measure]] μ on ''X'' such that
:&lt;math&gt; \psi(f) = \int_X f(x) \, d \mu(x) \quad &lt;/math&gt;
for all ''f'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). The norm of ψ as a linear functional is the [[total variation]] of μ, that is
:&lt;math&gt; \|\psi\| = |\mu|(X).&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, ψ is [[positive linear functional|positive]] if and only if the measure μ is non-negative.

One can deduce this statement about linear functionals from the statement about positive linear functionals by first showing that a bounded linear functional can be written as a finite linear combination of positive ones.

In [[statistics]] and its applications, the '''root mean square''' (abbreviated '''RMS''' or '''rms''') is defined as the [[square root]] of the [[mean square]] (the [[arithmetic mean]] of the [[square (algebra)|squares]] of a set of numbers).&lt;ref name=dicphys&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The RMS is also known as the '''quadratic mean''' and is a particular case of the [[Generalized mean#Quadratic|generalized mean]] with exponent 2.
RMS can also be defined for a continuously varying [[function (mathematics)|function]] in terms of an [[integral]] of the squares of the instantaneous values during a cycle.

For [[Alternating current|alternating electric current]], RMS is equal to the value of the [[direct current]] that would produce the same average power dissipation in a [[Resistor|resistive load]].&lt;ref name=dicphys/&gt;

In [[estimation theory]], the [[root mean square error]] of an estimator is a measure of the imperfection of the fit of the estimator to the data.

==Definition==
The RMS value of a set of values (or a [[continuous-time]] [[waveform]]) is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the values, or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform. In physics, the RMS current is the "value of the direct current that dissipates power in a resistor."

In the case of a set of ''n'' values &lt;math&gt;\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, the RMS

:&lt;math&gt;
x_{\mathrm{rms}} =
\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} \left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 \right) }.
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding formula for a continuous function (or waveform) ''f(t)'' defined over the interval &lt;math&gt;T_1 \le t \le T_2&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
f_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt {{1 \over {T_2-T_1}} {\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {[f(t)]}^2\, dt}},
&lt;/math&gt;

and the RMS for a function over all time is

:&lt;math&gt;
f_\mathrm{rms} = \lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \sqrt {{1 \over {T}} {\int_{0}^{T} {[f(t)]}^2\, dt}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The RMS over all time of a [[periodic function]] is equal to the RMS of one period of the function. The RMS value of a continuous function or signal can be approximated by taking the RMS of a sequence of equally spaced samples. Additionally, the RMS value of various waveforms can also be determined without [[Calculus#Integral calculus|calculus]], as shown by Cartwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
|last = Cartwright|first = Kenneth V|title = Determining the Effective or RMS Voltage of Various Waveforms without Calculus|journal = Technology Interface|volume = 8|issue = 1|pages = 20 pages|date = Fall 2007|url = http://tiij.org/issues/issues/fall2007/30_Cartwright/Cartwright-Waveforms.pdf|others = |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the RMS statistic of a [[random process]], the [[expected value]] is used instead of the mean.

==In common waveforms==

[[File:Sine wave voltages.svg|thumb|right|400px|Graph of a sine wave's voltage vs. time (in degrees), showing RMS, peak (PK), and peak-to-peak (PP) voltages.]]
If the [[waveform]] is a pure [[sine wave]], the relationships between amplitudes (peak-to-peak, peak) and RMS are fixed and known, as they are for any continuous [[period (physics)|periodic]] wave. However, this is not true for an arbitrary waveform, which may or may not be periodic or continuous. For a zero-mean sine wave, the relationship between RMS and peak-to-peak amplitude is:
: ''Peak-to-peak'' &lt;math&gt; = 2 \sqrt{2} \times {RMS} \approx 2.8 \times {RMS}.&lt;/math&gt;  

For other waveforms the relationships are not the same as they are for sine waves.  For example, for either a triangular or sawtooth wave
: ''Peak-to-peak'' &lt;math&gt; = 2 \sqrt{3} \times {RMS} \approx 3.5 \times {RMS}.&lt;/math&gt;

===In waveform combinations===
Waveforms made by summing known simple waveforms have an RMS that is the root of the sum of squares of the component RMS values, if the component waveforms are [[orthogonal]] (that is, if the average of the product of one simple waveform with another is zero for all pairs other than a waveform times itself).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;RMS_\text{Total} =\sqrt{{RMS_1}^2 + {RMS_2}^2 + \cdots + {RMS_n}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

(If the waveforms are in phase, then their RMS amplitudes sum directly.)

==Uses==

===In electrical engineering===

====Voltage{{anchor|Voltage}}====
{{further information|Root mean square AC voltage}}
A special case of RMS of waveform combinations is:
:&lt;math&gt;RMS_\text{Total} = \sqrt{{{RMS_\text{DC}}^2 + {RMS_\text{AC}}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;RMS_\text{DC}&lt;/math&gt; refers to the [[direct current]] component of the signal and &lt;math&gt;RMS_\text{AC}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[alternating current]] component of the signal.

====Average electrical power{{anchor|Average power}}====
{{further information|AC power}}Electrical engineers often need to know the [[power (physics)|power]], ''P'', dissipated by an [[electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]], ''R''. It is easy to do the calculation when there is a constant [[electric current|current]], ''I'', through the resistance. For a load of ''R'' ohms, power is defined simply as:

:&lt;math&gt;P = I^2 R.&lt;/math&gt;

However, if the current is a time-varying function, ''I(t)'', this formula must be extended to reflect the fact that the current (and thus the instantaneous power) is varying over time. If the function is periodic (such as household AC power), it is still meaningful to discuss the ''average'' power dissipated over time, which is calculated by taking the average power dissipation:
:{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0
|-
|&lt;math&gt;P_\text{avg}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;{} = \left\langle I(t)^2R \right\rangle \,\!&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\langle \ldots \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Mean#Mean of a function|mean]] of a function)
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;{} = R\left\langle I(t)^2 \right\rangle\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (as ''R'' does not vary over time, it can be factored out)
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;{} = I_\text{RMS}^2R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (by definition of RMS)
|}
So, the RMS value, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;, of the function ''I(t)'' is the constant current that yields the same power dissipation as the time-averaged power dissipation of the current ''I(t)''.

Average power can also be found using the same method that in the case of a time-varying [[voltage]], ''V(t)'', with RMS value ''V''&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{Avg} = {V_\text{RMS}^2 \over R}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be used for any periodic [[waveform]], such as a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] or [[sawtooth wave]]form, allowing us to calculate the mean power delivered into a specified load.

By taking the square root of both these equations and multiplying them together, the power is found to be:

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{Avg} = V_\text{RMS}I_\text{RMS}.&lt;/math&gt;

Both derivations depend on voltage and current being proportional (i.e., the load, ''R'', is purely resistive). [[Electrical reactance|Reactive]] loads (i.e., loads capable of not just dissipating energy but also storing it) are discussed under the topic of [[AC power]].

In the common case of [[alternating current]] when ''I(t)'' is a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] current, as is approximately true for mains power, the RMS value is easy to calculate from the continuous case equation above. If ''I''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the peak current, then:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{RMS} = \sqrt{{1 \over {T_2 - T_1}} \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \left[I_\text{p} \sin(\omega t)\right]^2 dt}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is time and ''ω'' is the [[angular frequency]] (''ω''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2π/''T'', where ''T'' is the period of the wave).

Since ''I''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is a positive constant:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{RMS} = I_\text{p} \sqrt{{1 \over {T_2 - T_1}} {\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {\sin^2(\omega t)}\, dt}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using a [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identity]] to eliminate squaring of trig function:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I_\text{RMS} &amp;= I_\text{p} \sqrt{{1 \over {T_2 - T_1}} {\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {{1 - \cos(2\omega t) \over 2}}\, dt}} \\
  I_\text{RMS} &amp;= I_\text{p} \sqrt{{1 \over {T_2 - T_1}} \left[ {t \over 2} - {\sin(2\omega t) \over 4\omega} \right]_{T_1}^{T_2} }
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

but since the interval is a whole number of complete cycles (per definition of RMS), the ''sin'' terms will cancel out, leaving:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{RMS}} = I_\text{p} \sqrt{{1 \over {T_2 - T_1}} \left[ {{t \over 2}} \right]_{T_1}^{T_2} } = I_\text{p} \sqrt{{1 \over {T_2 - T_1}} {{{T_2 - T_1} \over 2}} } = {I_\text{p} \over \sqrt{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A similar analysis leads to the analogous equation for sinusoidal voltage:

:&lt;math&gt;V_\text{RMS} = {V_\text{p} \over {\sqrt 2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; represents the peak current and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; represents the peak voltage.

Because of their usefulness in carrying out power calculations, listed [[voltage]]s for power outlets (e.g., 120 V in the USA, or 230 V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies ''V''{{sub|P}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;{{radic|2}}, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;{{radic|2}}, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak mains voltage in Europe is about 325 volts, and the peak-to-peak mains voltage, about 650 volts.

RMS quantities such as electric current are usually calculated over one cycle.  However, for some purposes the RMS current over a longer period is required when calculating transmission power losses.  The same principle applies, and (for example) a current of 10 amps used for 12 hours each day represents an RMS current of 5 amps in the long term.

The term "RMS power" is sometimes erroneously used in the audio industry as a synonym for "mean power" or "average power" (it is proportional to the square of the RMS voltage or RMS current in a resistive load). For a discussion of audio power measurements and their shortcomings, see [[Audio power]].

===Speed===
{{main article|Root-mean-square speed}}

In the [[physics]] of [[gas]] molecules, the '''root-mean-square speed''' is defined as the square root of the average squared-speed. The RMS speed of an ideal gas is [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution#Distribution for the velocity vector|calculated]] using the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;{v_\text{RMS}} = {\sqrt{3RT \over {M}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' represents the [[ideal gas constant]], 8.314&amp;nbsp;J/(mol·K), ''T'' is the temperature of the gas in [[kelvin]]s, and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] of the gas in kilograms per mole. The generally accepted terminology for speed as compared to velocity is that the former is the scalar magnitude of the latter. Therefore, although the average speed is between zero and the RMS speed, the average velocity for a stationary gas is zero.

===Error===
{{Main article|Root-mean-square error}}
When two data sets—one set from theoretical prediction and the other from actual measurement of some physical variable, for instance—are compared, the RMS of the pairwise differences of the two data sets can serve as a measure how far on average the error is from 0. The [[mean]] of the pairwise differences does not measure the variability of the difference, and the variability as indicated by the [[standard deviation]] is around the mean instead of 0. Therefore, the RMS of the differences is a meaningful measure of the error.

==In frequency domain==
The RMS can be computed in the frequency domain, using [[Parseval's theorem]]. For a sampled signal &lt;math&gt;x[n]=x(t=nT)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the sampling period,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N{x^2[n]} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{m=1}^N \bigl| X[m] \bigr|^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;X[m] = \operatorname{FFT}\{x[n]\}&lt;/math&gt; and ''N'' is number of samples and FFT coefficients.

In this case, the RMS computed in the time domain is the same as in the frequency domain:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{RMS}\{x[n]\}
    = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_n{x^2[n]}}
    = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_m{\bigl| X[m] \bigr|}^2}
    = \sqrt{\sum_m{\left| \frac{X[m]}{N} \right|^2}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to other statistics==
If &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[arithmetic mean]] and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard deviation]] of a [[Statistical Population|population]] or a [[waveform]] then:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Digital signal transmission
 | edition = 2nd
 | author = Chris C. Bissell and David A. Chapman
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press
 | year = 1992
 | isbn = 978-0-521-42557-5
 | page = 64
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \overline{x}^2 + \sigma_{x}^2 = \overline{x^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this it is clear that the RMS value is always greater than or equal to the average, in that the RMS includes the "error" / square deviation as well.

Physical scientists often use the term "root mean square" as a synonym for [[standard deviation]] when it can be assumed the input signal has zero mean, i.e., referring to the square root of the mean squared deviation of a signal from a given baseline or fit.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 | title = ROOT, TH1:GetRMS
 | url=http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TH1.html#TH1:GetRMS
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is useful for electrical engineers in calculating the "AC only" RMS of a signal. Standard deviation being the root mean square of a signal's variation about the mean, rather than about 0, the [[DC component]] is removed (i.e. RMS(signal) = Stdev(signal) if the mean signal is 0).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9219">'''S''' is an [[axiomatic set theory]] set out by [[George Boolos]] in his 1989 article, "Iteration Again". '''S''', a [[first order logic|first-order]] theory, is two-sorted because its [[ontology]] includes “stages” as well as [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. Boolos designed '''S''' to embody his understanding of the “iterative conception of set“ and the associated [[iterative hierarchy]]. '''S''' has the important property that all axioms of [[Zermelo set theory]] ''Z'', except the [[axiom of extensionality]] and the [[axiom of choice]], are theorems of '''S''' or a slight modification thereof.

==Ontology==
Any grouping together of [[mathematical object|mathematical]], [[abstract object|abstract]], or concrete objects, however formed, is a ''collection'', a synonym for what other [[set theory|set theories]] refer to as a [[Class (set theory)|class]]. The things that make up a collection are called [[element (mathematics)|element]]s or members. A common instance of a collection is the [[domain of discourse]] of a [[first-order theory]]. 

All sets are collections, but there are collections that are not sets. A synonym for collections that are not sets is [[proper class]]. An essential task of [[axiomatic set theory]] is to distinguish sets from proper classes, if only because mathematics is grounded in sets, with proper classes relegated to a purely descriptive role.

The [[Von Neumann universe]] implements the “iterative conception of set” by stratifying the universe of sets into a series of "stages", with the sets at a given stage being possible members of the sets formed at all higher stages. The notion of stage goes as follows. Each stage is assigned an [[ordinal number]]. The lowest stage, stage 0, consists of all entities having no members. We assume that the only entity at stage 0 is the [[empty set]], although this stage would include any [[urelement]]s we would choose to admit. Stage ''n'', ''n''&gt;0, consists of all possible sets formed from elements to be found in any stage whose number is less than ''n''. Every set formed at stage ''n'' can also be formed at every stage greater than ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998:88).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence the stages form a nested and [[well-ordered]] sequence, and would form a [[hierarchy (mathematics)|hierarchy]] if set membership were [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The iterative conception has gradually become more accepted, despite an imperfect understanding of its historical origins.

The iterative conception of set steers clear, in a well-motivated way, of the well-known [[paradox]]es of [[Russell's paradox|Russell]], [[Burali-Forti paradox|Burali-Forti]], and [[Cantor's paradox|Cantor]]. These paradoxes all result from the [[unrestricted comprehension|unrestricted use of the principle of comprehension]] of [[naive set theory]]. Collections such as "the class of all sets" or "the class of all [[ordinal number|ordinals]]" include sets from all stages of the iterative hierarchy. Hence such collections cannot be formed at any given stage, and thus cannot be sets.

==Primitive notions==
This section follows Boolos (1998: 91). The variables ''x'' and ''y'' range over sets, while ''r'', ''s'', and ''t'' range over stages. There are three [[primitive notion|primitive]] two-place [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]]:
* Set–set: ''x''∈''y'' denotes, as usual, that set ''x'' is a member of set ''y'';
* Set–stage: ''Fxr'' denotes that set ''x'' “is formed at” stage ''r'';
* Stage–stage: ''r''&lt;''s'' denotes that stage ''r'' “is earlier than” stage ''s''.

The axioms below include a defined two-place set-stage predicate, ''Bxr'', which abbreviates:
:&lt;math&gt;\exist s[s&lt;r \land Fxs].&lt;/math&gt;
''Bxr'' is read as “set ''x'' is formed before stage ''r''.”

[[identity (mathematics)|Identity]], denoted by infix ‘=’, does not play the role in '''S''' it plays in other set theories, and Boolos does not make fully explicit whether the background [[first-order logic|logic]] includes identity. '''S''' has no [[axiom of extensionality]] and identity is absent from the other '''S''' axioms. Identity does appear in the axiom schema distinguishing '''S+''' from '''S''',&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 97).&lt;/ref&gt; and in the derivation in '''S''' of the [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of empty set|null set]], and [[axiom of infinity|infinity]] axioms of '''[[Zermelo set theory|Z]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 103–04).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
The symbolic axioms shown below are from Boolos (1998: 91), and govern how sets and stages behave and interact. The natural language versions of the axioms are intended to aid the intuition.
&lt;!-- The symbolic axioms should not be changed without discussion on the talk page. Altering these axioms would constitute original research. However the English descriptions may be changed.--&gt;

The axioms come in two groups of three. The first group consists of axioms pertaining solely to stages and the stage-stage relation ‘&lt;’.

'''Tra''': &lt;math&gt; \forall r \forall s \forall t[r&lt;s \land s&lt;t \rightarrow r&lt;t] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

“Earlier than” is transitive.

'''Net''': &lt;math&gt; \forall s \forall t \exist r[t&lt;r \land s&lt;r] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A consequence of ''Net'' is that every stage is earlier than some stage.

'''Inf''': &lt;math&gt; \exist r \exist u [u&lt;r \land \forall t[t&lt;r \rightarrow \exist s[t&lt;s \land s&lt;r]]] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The sole purpose of ''Inf'' is to enable deriving in '''S''' the [[axiom of infinity]] of other set theories.

The second and final group of axioms involve both sets and stages, and the predicates other than '&lt;':

'''All''': &lt;math&gt;  \forall x \exist r Fxr \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Every set is formed at some stage in the hierarchy.

'''When''': &lt;math&gt; \forall r \forall x [Fxr \leftrightarrow [\forall y (y \in x \rightarrow Byr) \land \lnot Bxr] ] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

A set is formed at some stage [[iff]] its members are formed at earlier stages.

Let ''A''(''y'') be a formula of '''S''' where ''y'' is free but ''x'' is not. Then the following axiom schema holds:

'''Spec''': &lt;math&gt; \exist r \forall y[A(y) \rightarrow Byr] \rightarrow \exist x \forall y[y \in x \leftrightarrow A(y)] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If there exists a stage ''r'' such that all sets satisfying ''A''(''y'') are formed at a stage earlier than ''r'', then there exists a set ''x'' whose members are just those sets satisfying ''A''(''y''). The role of ''Spec'' in '''S''' is analogous to that of the [[axiom schema of specification]] of [[Z]].

==Discussion==
Boolos’s name for [[Zermelo set theory]] minus extensionality was ''Z-''. Boolos derived in '''S''' all axioms of ''Z-'' except the [[axiom of choice]].&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 95–96; 103–04).&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this exercise was to show how most of conventional set theory can be derived from the iterative conception of set, assumed embodied in '''S'''. [[Extensionality]] does not follow from the iterative conception, and so is not a theorem of '''S'''. However, '''S''' + Extensionality is free of contradiction if '''S''' is free of contradiction.

Boolos then altered ''Spec'' to obtain a variant of '''S''' he called '''S+''', such that the [[axiom schema of replacement]] is derivable in '''S+'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Extensionality. Hence '''S+''' + Extensionality has the power of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]]. Boolos also argued that the [[axiom of choice]] does not follow from the iterative conception, but did not address whether Choice could be added to '''S''' in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Boolos (1998: 97).&lt;/ref&gt; Hence '''S+''' + Extensionality cannot prove those theorems of the conventional set theory [[ZFC]] whose proofs require Choice.

'''Inf''' guarantees the existence of stages ω, and of ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' for finite ''n'', but not of stage ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω. Nevertheless, '''S''' yields enough of [[transfinite number|Cantor's paradise]] to ground almost all of contemporary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;”…the overwhelming majority of 20th century mathematics is straightforwardly representable by sets of fairly low infinite ranks, certainly less than ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;20.” (Potter 2004: 220). The exceptions to Potter's statement presumably include [[category theory]], which requires the weakly [[inaccessible cardinal]]s afforded by [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], and the higher reaches of set theory itself.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boolos compares '''S''' at some length to a variant of the system of [[Frege]]’s ''Grundgesetze'', in which [[Hume's principle]], taken as an axiom, replaces Frege’s Basic Law V, an [[unrestricted comprehension]] axiom which made Frege's system inconsistent; see [[Russell's paradox]].

[[Venn diagram]] of &lt;math&gt;~A \triangle B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The symmetric difference is &lt;br&gt;
the [[Union (set theory)|union]] [[Complement (set theory)#Relative complement|without]] the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]]:&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Venn0111.svg|40px]] &lt;math&gt;~\setminus~&lt;/math&gt; [[File:Venn0001.svg|40px]] &lt;math&gt;~=~&lt;/math&gt; [[File:Venn0110.svg|40px]]
]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''symmetric difference''', also known as the '''disjunctive union''', of two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] is the set of elements which are in either of the sets and not in their intersection.  The symmetric difference of the sets ''A'' and ''B'' is commonly denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;A \ominus B,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the symmetric difference of the sets &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{3,4\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,4\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[power set]] of any set becomes an [[abelian group]] under the operation of symmetric difference, with the [[empty set]] as the [[neutral element]] of the group and every element in this group being its own [[inverse element|inverse]]. The power set of any set becomes a [[Boolean ring]] with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] as the multiplication of the ring.

]]

The symmetric difference is equivalent to the [[union (set theory)|union]] of both [[complement (set theory)|relative complement]]s, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = (A \smallsetminus B) \cup (B \smallsetminus A),&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetric difference can also be expressed using the [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation ⊕ on the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] describing the two sets in [[set-builder notation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = \{x : (x \in A) \oplus (x \in B)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The same fact can be stated as the [[indicator function]] (which we denote here by &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;) of the symmetric difference being the XOR (or addition [[Modular arithmetic|mod 2]]) of the indicator functions of its two arguments: &lt;math&gt;\chi_{(A\,\triangle\,B)} = \chi_A \oplus \chi_B&lt;/math&gt; or using the [[Iverson bracket]] notation &lt;math&gt;[x \in A\,\triangle\,B] = [x \in A] \oplus [x \in B]&lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetric difference can also be expressed as the union of the two sets, minus their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]:

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = (A \cup B) \smallsetminus (A \cap B),&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, &lt;math&gt;A\triangle B\subseteq A\cup B&lt;/math&gt;; the equality in this non-strict [[Subset|inclusion]] occurs [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[disjoint sets]]. Furthermore, if we denote &lt;math&gt;D = A\triangle B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I = A \cap B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are always disjoint, so &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; [[Partition of a set|partition]] &lt;math&gt;A \cup B&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, assuming intersection and symmetric difference as primitive operations, the union of two sets can be well ''defined'' in terms of symmetric difference by the right-hand side of the equality

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\cup\,B = (A\,\triangle\,B)\,\triangle\,(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetric difference is [[commutativity|commutative]] and [[associativity|associative]] (and consequently the leftmost set of parentheses in the previous expression were thus redundant):

:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,B = B\,\triangle\,A,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\,\triangle\,B)\,\triangle\,C = A\,\triangle\,(B\,\triangle\,C).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[empty set]] is [[identity element|neutral]], and every set is its own inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,\varnothing = A,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\,\triangle\,A = \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

Taken together, we see that the [[power set]] of any set ''X'' becomes an [[abelian group]] if we use the symmetric difference as operation. (More generally, any [[field of sets]] forms a group with the symmetric difference as operation.) A group in which every element is its own inverse (or, equivalently, in which every element has [[Order (group theory)|order]] 2) is sometimes called a [[Boolean group]];&lt;ref name="GivantHalmos2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Givant |first1=Steven |last2=Halmos |first2=Paul |authorlink2=Paul Halmos |year=2009 |title=Introduction to Boolean Algebras |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-387-40293-2 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Humberstone2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Humberstone |first=Lloyd |year=2011 |title=The Connectives |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-01654-4 |page=782}}&lt;/ref&gt; the symmetric difference provides a prototypical example of such groups. Sometimes the Boolean group is actually defined as the symmetric difference operation on a set.&lt;ref name="Rotman2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rotman |first=Joseph J. |year=2010 |title=Advanced Modern Algebra |publisher=American Mathematical Soc. |isbn=978-0-8218-4741-1 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case where ''X'' has only two elements, the group thus obtained is the [[Klein four-group]].

Equivalently, a Boolean group is an [[Elementary abelian group|elementary abelian 2-group]]. Consequently, the group induced by the symmetric difference is in fact a [[vector space]] over the [[finite field|field with 2 elements]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''X'' is finite, then the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of this vector space, and its [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] is therefore equal to the number of elements of ''X''. This construction is used in [[graph theory]], to define the [[cycle space]] of a graph.

From the property of the inverses in a Boolean group, it follows that the symmetric difference of two repeated symmetric differences is equivalent to the repeated symmetric difference of the [[Multiset#Operations|join]] of the two multisets, where for each double set both can be removed. In particular:

:&lt;math&gt;(A\,\triangle\,B)\,\triangle\,(B\,\triangle\,C) = A\,\triangle\,C.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies triangle inequality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rudin |first1=Walter |date=January 1, 1976 |title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0070542358 |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; the symmetric difference of ''A'' and ''C'' is contained in the union of the symmetric difference of ''A'' and ''B'' and that of ''B'' and ''C''. (But note that for the [[diameter]] of the symmetric difference the triangle inequality does not hold.)

Intersection [[distributivity|distributes]] over symmetric difference:
:&lt;math&gt;A \cap (B\,\triangle\,C) = (A \cap B)\,\triangle\,(A \cap C),&lt;/math&gt;
and this shows that the power set of ''X'' becomes a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with symmetric difference as addition and intersection as multiplication. This is the prototypical example of a [[Boolean ring]].
Further properties of the symmetric difference:

* &lt;math&gt;A\triangle B=A^c\triangle B^c&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;B^c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;'s complement,&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;'s complement, respectively, relative to any (fixed) set that contains both.
* &lt;math&gt;\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}}A_\alpha\right)\triangle\left(\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}}B_\alpha\right)\subseteq\bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathcal{I}}\left(A_\alpha\triangle B_\alpha\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary non-empty index set.
* If &lt;math&gt;f : S \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt; is any function and &lt;math&gt;A, B \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; are any sets in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'s codomain, then &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\left(A \triangle B\right) = f^{-1}\left(A\right) \triangle f^{-1}\left(B\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The symmetric difference can be defined in any [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], by writing
:&lt;math&gt; x\,\triangle\,y = (x \lor y) \land \lnot(x \land y) = (x \land \lnot y) \lor (y \land \lnot x) = x \oplus y.&lt;/math&gt;
This operation has the same properties as the symmetric difference of sets.

==''n''-ary symmetric difference==
The repeated symmetric difference is in a sense equivalent to an operation on a [[multiset]] of sets giving the set of elements which are in an odd number of sets.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

As above, the symmetric difference of a collection of sets contains just elements which are in an odd number of the sets in the collection:
:&lt;math&gt;\triangle M = \left\{ a \in \bigcup M: |\{A\in M:a \in A\}| \mbox{ is odd}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Evidently, this is well-defined only when each element of the union &lt;math&gt;\bigcup M&lt;/math&gt; is contributed by a finite number of elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;M=\{M_{1},M_{2}, \ldots , M_{n}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multiset]] and &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a formula for &lt;math&gt;|\triangle M|&lt;/math&gt;, the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;\triangle M&lt;/math&gt;, given solely in terms of intersections of elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;|\triangle M| = \sum_{l=1}^{n} (-2)^{l-1} \sum_{1\leq i_{1} &lt; i_{2} &lt; \ldots &lt; i_{l} \leq n} |M_{i_{1}} \cap M_{i_{2}} \cap \ldots \cap M_{i_{l}}|&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetric difference on measure spaces==
As long as there is a notion of "how big" a set is, the symmetric difference between two sets can be considered a measure of how "far apart" they are. 
First consider a finite set ''S'' and the [[counting measure]] on subsets given by their size. Now consider two subsets of ''S'' and set their distance apart as the size of their symmetric difference. This distance is in fact a [[metric  (mathematics)|metric ]] so that the [[power set]] on ''S'' is a [[metric space]]. If ''S'' has ''n'' elements, then the distance from the [[empty set]] to ''S'' is ''n'', and this is the maximum distance for any pair of subsets.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Flament (1963) ''Applications of Graph Theory to Group Structure'', page 16, [[Prentice-Hall]] {{mr|id=0157785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the ideas of [[measure theory]], the separation of measurable sets can be defined to be the measure of their symmetric difference. 
If μ is a [[Sigma-finite|σ-finite]] [[measure space|measure]] defined on a [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] Σ, the function
:&lt;math&gt;d_\mu(X,Y) = \mu(X\,\triangle\,Y)&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[Pseudometric space|pseudometric]] on Σ.  ''d&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes a [[metric space|metric]] if Σ is considered modulo the [[equivalence relation]] ''X'' ~ ''Y'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mu(X\,\triangle\,Y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It is sometimes called [[Fréchet]]-[[Nikodym]] metric.  The resulting metric space is [[Separable space|separable]] if and only if [[L^2|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(μ)]] is separable.

If &lt;math&gt;\mu(X), \mu(Y) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we have: &lt;math&gt;|\mu(X) - \mu(Y)| \leq \mu(X\,\triangle\,Y)&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
|\mu(X) - \mu(Y)| &amp; = |(\mu(X \setminus Y) + \mu(X\cap Y)) - (\mu(X \cap Y) + \mu(Y \setminus X))| \\
&amp; = |\mu(X \setminus Y) - \mu(Y \setminus X)| \\
&amp; \leq |\mu(X \setminus Y)| + |\mu(Y \setminus X)| \\
&amp; = \mu(X \setminus Y) + \mu(Y \setminus X) \\
&amp; = \mu((X \setminus Y) \cup (Y \setminus X)) \\
&amp; = \mu(X\, \triangle \, Y)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S=\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mu\right)&lt;/math&gt; be some measure space and let &lt;math&gt;F,G\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D},\mathcal{E}\subseteq\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

Symmetric difference is measurable: &lt;math&gt;F\triangle G\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

We write &lt;math&gt;F=G\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mu\left(F\triangle G\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. The relation "&lt;math&gt;=\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;" is an equivalence relation on the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-measurable sets.

We write &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{E}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff to each &lt;math&gt;D\in\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; there's some &lt;math&gt;E\in\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;D=E\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;. The relation "&lt;math&gt;\subseteq\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;" is a partial order on the family of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

We write &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{E}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{E}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}\subseteq\mathcal{D}\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;.  The relation "&lt;math&gt;=\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;" is an equivalence relationship between the subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

The "symmetric closure" of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the collection of all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-measurable sets that are &lt;math&gt;=\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; to some &lt;math&gt;D\in\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. The symmetric closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a sub-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, so is the symmetric closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;F=G\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\left|\mathbf{1}_F-\mathbf{1}_G\right|=0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\left[\mathcal{A},\mu\right]&lt;/math&gt;-a.e.

== Hausdorff distance vs. symmetric difference ==
[[File:HausdorffVsSymmetric.png|thumb|right]]
The [[Hausdorff distance]] and the (area of the) symmetric difference are both pseudo-metrics on the set of measurable geometric shapes. However, they behave quite differently. The figure at the right shows two sequences of shapes, "Red" and "Red ∪ Green". When the Hausdorff distance between them becomes smaller, the area of the symmetric difference between them becomes larger, and vice versa. By continuing these sequences in both directions, it is possible to get two sequences such that the Hausdorff distance between them converges to 0 and the symmetric distance between them diverges, or vice versa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3461">In [[scholastic logic]], a '''syncategorematic term''' (or '''syncategorema''') is a word that cannot serve as the subject or the predicate of a proposition, and thus cannot stand for any of Aristotle's categories, but can be used with other terms to form a proposition. Words such as 'all', 'and', 'if' are examples of such terms.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar and logic==
The distinction between categorematic and syncategorematic terms was established in ancient Greek grammar. Words that designate self-sufficient entities (i.e., nouns or adjectives) were called categorematic, and those that do not stand by themselves were dubbed syncategorematic, (i.e., prepositions, logical connectives, etc.). [[Priscian]] in his ''Institutiones grammaticae''&lt;ref&gt;Priscian, ''Institutiones grammaticae'', II, 15&lt;/ref&gt; translates the word as ''consignificantia''. Scholastics retained  the difference, which became a dissertable topic after the 13th century revival of logic. [[William of Sherwood]], a representative of [[Philosophical terminism|terminism]], wrote a treatise called ''Syncategoremata''. Later his pupil, [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]], produced a similar work entitled ''Syncategoreumata''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peter-spain/#4 Peter of Spain], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propositional calculus==
In [[propositional calculus]], a '''syncategorematic term''' is a term that has no individual meaning (a term with an individual meaning is called ''categorematic''). Whether a term is syncategorematic or not is determined by the way it is defined or introduced in the language.

In the common definition of propositional logic, examples of syncategorematic terms are the logical connectives. Let us take the connective &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; for instance, its semantic rule is:

&lt;math&gt;\lVert \phi \land \psi \rVert = 1&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\lVert \phi \rVert = \lVert \psi \rVert = 1&lt;/math&gt;

So its meaning is defined when it occurs in combination with two formulas &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. But it has no meaning when taken in isolation, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\lVert \land \rVert&lt;/math&gt; is not defined.

We could however define the &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; in a different manner, e.g., using [[Lambda calculus|&amp;lambda;-abstraction]]: &lt;math&gt;(\lambda b.(\lambda v.b(v)(b)))&lt;/math&gt;, which expects a pair of Boolean-valued arguments, i.e., arguments that are either ''TRUE'' or ''FALSE'', defined as &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(\lambda y.x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(\lambda y.y))&lt;/math&gt; respectively. This is an expression of [[type system|type]] &lt;math&gt;\langle \langle t, t \rangle, t \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Its meaning is thus a binary function from pairs of entities of type [[truth-value]] to an entity of type truth-value. Under this definition it would be non-syncategorematic, or categorematic. Note that while this definition would formally define the &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; function, it requires the use of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-abstraction, in which case the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; itself is introduced syncategorematically, thus simply moving the issue up another level of abstraction.

[[Image:Tangram set 00.jpg|thumb|300px|Like most modern sets, this wooden tangram is stored in the square configuration.]]
The '''tangram''' ({{zh|c=七巧板|p=qīqiǎobǎn|l=seven boards of skill}}) is a [[dissection puzzle]] consisting of seven flat shapes, called ''tans'', which are put together to form shapes. The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only an outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap. It is reputed to have been invented in [[China]] during the [[Song Dynasty]],&lt;ref name="inthandbook"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jiannong Shi |title=International Handbook of Intelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbNLJl_L6MMC&amp;pg=PA330 |date=2 February 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-00402-2 |editor=Robert J. Sternberg |pages=330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then carried over to [[Europe]] by trading ships in the early 19th century. It became very popular in Europe for a time then, and then again during [[World War I]]. It is one of the most popular [[dissection puzzles]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tao of Tangram |last=Slocum |first=Jerry |year=2001 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn=978-1-4351-0156-2 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Manual of Play |last=Forbrush |first=William Byron |year=1914 |publisher=Jacobs |page=315 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FpoWAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=%22The+Anchor+Puzzle%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Anchor%20Puzzle%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese psychologist has termed the tangram "the earliest psychological test in the world", albeit one made for entertainment rather than for analysis.&lt;ref name="inthandbook"/&gt;

==Etymology==

The origin of the word 'tangram' is unclear. The '-gram' element is apparently from Greek γράμμα ('written character, letter, that which is drawn'). The 'tan-' element is variously conjectured to be Chinese ''t'an'' 'to extend' or Cantonese ''t'ang'' 'Chinese'.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1910, ''[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/197515 s.v.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Reaching the Western world (1815–1820s)===
[[File:Tangram caricature France 1818.jpg|thumb|290px|left|A caricature published in France in 1818, when       the tangram craze was at its peak. The caption reads: " 'Take care of yourself, you're not made of steel. The fire has almost gone out and it is winter.' 'It kept me busy all night. Excuse me, I will explain it to you. You play this game, which is said to hail from China. And I tell you that what Paris needs right now is to welcome that which comes from far away.' "]]

The tangram had already existed in China for a long time when it was first brought to America by Captain M. Donnaldson, on his ship, ''Trader'', in 1815.  When it docked in Canton, the captain was given a pair of author Sang-Hsia-koi's tangram books from 1815.&lt;ref name="tanbook1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=9781402704130|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were then brought with the ship to Philadelphia, where it docked in February 1816.  The first tangram book to be published in America was based on the pair brought by Donnaldson.

[[File:The 8th Book of Tan Part I.jpg|thumb|right|Cover art from ''The 8th Book of Tan'', by Sam Loyd, a spoof of the puzzle's history that began the tangram craze in the Western World]]
The puzzle was originally popularized by [[Sam Loyd]]'s ''The Eighth Book Of Tan'', a fictitious history of the tangram, which claimed that the game was invented 4,000 years prior by a god named Tan. The book included 700 shapes, some of which are impossible to solve.&lt;ref name="isbn0-486-29225-8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Costello, Matthew J. |title=The Greatest Puzzles of All Time |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |isbn=0-486-29225-8|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The puzzle eventually reached England, where it became very fashionable.&lt;ref name="tanbook1"/&gt;  The craze quickly spread to other European countries.&lt;ref name="tanbook1"/&gt;  This was mostly due to a pair of British tangram books, ''The Fashionable Chinese Puzzle'', and the accompanying solution book, ''Key''.&lt;ref name="tanbook2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=9781402704130|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, tangram sets were being exported in great number from China, made of various materials, from glass, to wood, to tortoise shell.&lt;ref name="tanbook3"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=9781402704130|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these unusual and exquisite tangram sets made their way to [[Denmark]]. Danish interest in tangrams skyrocketed around 1818, when two books on the puzzle were published, to much enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="tanbook5"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=9781402704130|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first of these was ''Mandarinen'' (About the Chinese Game).  This was written by a student at [[Copenhagen University]], which was a non-fictional work about the history and popularity of tangrams.  The second, ''Det nye chinesiske Gaadespil'' (The new Chinese Puzzle Game), consisted of 339 puzzles copied from ''The Eighth Book of Tan'', as well as one original.&lt;ref name="tanbook5"/&gt;

One contributing factor in the popularity of the game in Europe was that although the [[Catholic Church]] forbade many forms of recreation on the sabbath, they made no objection to puzzle games such as the tangram.&lt;ref name="tanbook4"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tangram Book|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2003|publisher=Sterling|isbn=9781402704130|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second craze in Germany (1891–1920s)===

Tangrams were first introduced to the German public by industrialist [[Friedrich Adolf Richter]] around 1891.&lt;ref name="arclab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archimedes-lab.org/tangramagicus/pagetang1.html|title=Tangram the incredible timeless 'Chinese' puzzle 2|first=sarcone &amp;|last=waeber|website=www.archimedes-lab.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sets were made out of stone or false [[earthenware]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Treasury Decisions Under customs and other laws, Volume 25 |year=1890–1926 |publisher=United States Department Of The Treasury |page=1421 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MeUWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1421&amp;lpg=PA1421&amp;dq=%22The+Anchor+Puzzle%22 |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marketed under the name "The Anchor Puzzle".&lt;ref name="arclab"/&gt;

More internationally, the First World War saw a great resurgence of interest in tangrams, on the homefront and trenches of both sides.  During this time, it occasionally went under the name of "The [[Sphinx]]" an alternative title for the "Anchor Puzzle" sets.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A10423595 |title=Tangram – The Chinese Puzzle |author=Wyatt |date=26 April 2006 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kids Around The World Play! |last=Braman |first=Arlette |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-471-40984-7 |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fNnoxIfJg5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kids+Around+The+World+Play! |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxes==
A tangram [[paradox]] is a dissection fallacy: Two figures composed with the same set of pieces, one of which seems to be a proper subset of the other.&lt;ref name="mathematica"&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TangramParadox.html Tangram Paradox], by Barile, Margherita, From MathWorld – A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein.&lt;/ref&gt; One famous paradox is that of the two [[monk]]s, attributed to [[Dudeney]], which consists of two similar shapes, one with and the other missing a foot.&lt;ref name="dudeney"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dudeney, H. |title=Amusements in Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the area of the foot is compensated for in the second figure by a subtly larger body. Another tangram paradox is proposed by [[Sam Loyd]] in ''The 8th Book of Tan'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tangram-channel.com/the-eighth-book-of-tan-by-sam-loyd-page-1/''The 8th Book of Tan''] (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number of configurations ==
[[Image:convex_tangram_shapes.svg|thumb|The 13 convex shapes matched with tangram set]]
Over 6500 different tangram problems have been created from 19th century texts alone, and the current number is ever-growing.&lt;ref name="taonum"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tao of Tangram|last=Slocum|first=Jerry|year=2001|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0156-2|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fu Traing Wang and Chuan-Chin Hsiung proved in 1942 that there are only thirteen [[convex polygon|convex]] tangram configurations (config segment drawn between any two points on the configuration's edge always pass through the configuration's interior, i.e., configurations with no recesses in the outline).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=Fu Traing Wang |author2=Chuan-Chih Hsiung |date=November 1942 |title=A Theorem on the Tangram |journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=596–599 |jstor=2303340|doi=10.2307/2303340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-486-21483-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Read, Ronald C. |title=Tangrams : 330 Puzzles |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |page=53 |isbn=0-486-21483-4 |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pieces==
Choosing a unit of measurement so that the seven pieces can be assembled to form a square of side one unit and having area one square unit, the seven pieces are:

* 2 large [[Right angle triangle|right triangles]] (hypotenuse 1, sides {{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|2}}, area {{sfrac|1|4}})
* 1 medium right triangle (hypotenuse {{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|2}}, sides {{sfrac|1|2}}, area {{sfrac|1|8}})
* 2 small right triangles (hypotenuse {{sfrac|1|2}}, sides {{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|4}}, area {{sfrac|1|16}})
* 1 [[Square (geometry)|square]] (sides {{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|4}}, area {{sfrac|1|8}})
* 1 [[parallelogram]] (sides of {{sfrac|1|2}} and {{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|4}}, area {{sfrac|1|8}})

Of these seven pieces, the parallelogram is unique in that it has no [[reflection symmetry]] but only [[rotational symmetry]], and so its [[mirror image]] can be obtained only by flipping it over. Thus, it is the only piece that may need to be flipped when forming certain shapes.

'''Thomas''' "'''Tim'''" '''Daniel Cochran''' (April 7, 1955 – December 16, 2014) was a [[professor]] of [[Mathematics]] at [[Rice University]] specializing in [[topology]], especially [[low-dimensional topology]], [[knot theory|the theory of knots and links]] and associated algebra.

==Education and career==
[[File:Tim Cochran 1986 (enlarged headshot).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Cochran in 1986]]
Tim Cochran was a valedictorian for the [[Severna Park High School]] Class of 1973. Later, he was an undergraduate at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1982 (''Embedding 4-manifolds in S&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogyProject|id=18770}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to MIT as a C.L.E. Moore Postdoctoral Instructor from 1982 to 1984. He was an [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] postdoctoral fellow from 1985 to 1987. Following brief appointments at Berkeley and [[Northwestern University]], he started at Rice University as an [[Associate Professor|associate professor]] in 1990. He became a [[full professor]] at Rice University in 1998. He died unexpectedly, aged 59, on December 16, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.rice.edu/2014/12/18/rice-mourns-loss-of-mathematician-tim-cochran/|title=Rice mourns loss of mathematician Tim Cochran |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on a year-long sabbatical leave supported by a fellowship from the [[Simons Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.rice.edu/2014/07/09/2-rice-mathematicians-honored/ | title=2 Rice mathematicians honored|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research contributions==
With his coauthors [[Kent Orr]] and [[Peter Teichner]], Cochran defined the [[solvable filtration]] of the [[link concordance|knot concordance group]], whose lower levels encapsulate many classical knot concordance invariants.

Cochran was also responsible for naming the [[slam-dunk]] move for [[Dehn surgery|surgery diagrams]] in low-dimensional topology.

==Awards and honors==
While at Rice, he was named an Outstanding Faculty Associate (1992–93), and received the Faculty Teaching and Mentoring Award from the Rice Graduate Student Association (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rice.edu/2014/05/02/gsa-honors-those-who-support-grad-students-at-rice/| title = GSA honors those who support grad students at Rice| accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list |title=List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014, for ''contributions to low-dimensional topology, specifically knot and link concordance, and for mentoring numerous junior mathematicians''.

[[File:Matrix transpose.gif|thumb|200px|right|The transpose '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; of a matrix '''A''' can be obtained by reflecting the elements along its main diagonal. Repeating the process on the transposed matrix returns the elements to their original position.]]

In [[linear algebra]], the '''transpose''' of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal, that is it switches the row and column indices of the matrix by producing another matrix denoted as '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; (also written '''A'''′, '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;tr&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'''A''' or '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;). It is achieved by any one of the following equivalent actions:
* reflect '''A''' over its [[main diagonal]] (which runs from top-left to bottom-right) to obtain '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,
* write the rows of '''A''' as the columns of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,
* write the columns of '''A''' as the rows of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.

Formally, the ''i''-th row, ''j''-th column element of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the ''j''-th row, ''i''-th column element of '''A''':

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}\right]_{ij} = \left[\mathbf{A}\right]_{ji}.&lt;/math&gt;

If '''A''' is an {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} matrix, then '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is an {{nowrap|''n'' × ''m''}} matrix.

The transpose of a matrix was introduced in 1858 by the British mathematician [[Arthur Cayley]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Cayley (1858) [https://books.google.com/books?id=flFFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A memoir on the theory of matrices"], ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''148''' : 17–37.  The transpose (or "transposition") is defined on page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

    1 &amp; 2
  \end{bmatrix}^{\operatorname{T}}
  = \,
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1   \\

  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

  \begin{bmatrix}
     1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\\
     2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==
For matrices '''A''', '''B''' and scalar ''c'' we have the following properties of transpose:

{{ordered list
|1= &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T} \right)^\operatorname{T} = \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
:The operation of taking the transpose is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (self-[[Inverse matrix|inverse]]).
|2= &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}\right)^\operatorname{T} = \mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T} + \mathbf{B}^\operatorname{T}.&lt;/math&gt;
:The transpose respects addition.
|3= &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A B}\right)^\operatorname{T} = \mathbf{B}^\operatorname{T} \mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Note that the order of the factors reverses. From this one can deduce that a [[square matrix]] '''A''' is [[Invertible matrix|invertible]] if and only if '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is invertible, and in this case we have ('''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ('''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  By induction this result extends to the general case of multiple matrices, where we find that ('''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;…'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.
|4= &lt;math&gt;\left(c \mathbf{A}\right)^\operatorname{T} = c \mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}.&lt;/math&gt;
:The transpose of a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] is the same scalar. Together with (2), this states that the transpose is a [[linear map]] from the [[Vector space|space]] of {{nowrap|''m'' × ''n''}} matrices to the space of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''m''}} matrices.
|5= &lt;math&gt;\det\left(\mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}\right) = \det(\mathbf{A}).&lt;/math&gt;
:The [[determinant]] of a square matrix is the same as the determinant of its transpose.
|6= The [[dot product]] of two column [[vector space|vector]]s '''a''' and '''b''' can be computed as the single entry of the matrix product:
:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \right] = \mathbf{a}^{\operatorname{T}} \mathbf{b},&lt;/math&gt;
which is written as '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; in [[Einstein summation convention]].
|7= If '''A''' has only real entries, then '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''A''' is a [[positive-semidefinite matrix]].
|8= &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}\right)^{-1} = \left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\right)^\operatorname{T}.&lt;/math&gt;
: The transpose of an invertible matrix is also invertible, and its inverse is the transpose of the inverse of the original matrix.  The notation '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;−T&lt;/sup&gt; is sometimes used to represent either of these equivalent expressions.
|9= If '''A''' is a square matrix, then its [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] are equal to the eigenvalues of its transpose, since they share the same [[characteristic polynomial]].
}}

== Special transpose matrices ==
A square matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a [[symmetric matrix]]; that is, '''A''' is symmetric if
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{\operatorname{T}} = \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

A square matrix whose transpose is equal to its negative is called a [[skew-symmetric matrix]]; that is, '''A''' is skew-symmetric if
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{\operatorname{T}} = -\mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

A square [[complex number|complex]] matrix whose transpose is equal to the matrix with every entry replaced by its [[complex conjugate]] (denoted here with an overline) is called a [[Hermitian matrix]] (equivalent to the matrix being equal to its [[conjugate transpose]]); that is, '''A''' is Hermitian if
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{\operatorname{T}} = \overline{\mathbf{A}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A square [[complex number|complex]] matrix whose transpose is equal to the negation of its complex conjugate is called a [[skew-Hermitian matrix]]; that is, '''A''' is skew-Hermitian if
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{\operatorname{T}} = -\overline{\mathbf{A}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A square matrix whose transpose is equal to its inverse is called an [[orthogonal matrix]]; that is, '''A''' is orthogonal if
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{\operatorname{T}} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

A square complex matrix whose transpose is equal to its conjugate inverse is called a [[unitary matrix]]; that is, '''A''' is unitary if
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{\operatorname{T}} = \overline{\mathbf{A}^{-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Products==
If '''A''' is an ''m'' × ''n'' matrix and '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is its transpose, then the result of [[matrix multiplication]] with these two matrices gives two square matrices: '''A A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is ''m'' × ''m'' and '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; '''A''' is ''n'' × ''n''. Furthermore, these products are [[symmetric matrices]]. Indeed, the matrix product '''A A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; has entries that are the [[inner product]] of a row of '''A''' with a column of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. But the columns of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; are the rows of '''A''', so the entry corresponds to the inner product of two rows of '''A'''. If ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; is the entry of the product, it is obtained from rows i and j in '''A'''. The entry ''p''&lt;sub&gt;j i&lt;/sub&gt; is also obtained from these rows, thus ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;j i&lt;/sub&gt;, and the product matrix (''p''&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt;) is symmetric. Similarly, the product '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; '''A''' is a symmetric matrix.

A quick proof of the symmetry of '''A A'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; results from the fact that it is its own transpose:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}\right)^\operatorname{T} = \left(\mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}\right)^\operatorname{T} \mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T}= \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^\operatorname{T} .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Strang]] (2006) ''Linear Algebra and its Applications'' 4th edition, page 51, Thomson [[Brooks/Cole]] {{ISBN|0-03-010567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transpose of a linear map ==
{{see also|Transpose of a linear map}}

The transpose may be defined more generally:

If {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is a [[linear map]] between right ''R''-[[Module (mathematics)|module]]s ''V'' and ''W'' with respective [[dual module]]s ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and ''W''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, the ''transpose'' of ''f'' is the linear map
:&lt;math&gt;{}^\operatorname{T} f : W^* \to V^* : \varphi \mapsto \varphi \circ f .&lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, the transpose &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' is defined by the relation
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \varphi , f ( v ) \right\rangle = \left\langle {}^\operatorname{T} f ( \varphi ) , v \right\rangle \quad \forall \varphi \in W^* , v \in V ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap|{{langle}}·,·{{rangle}}}} is the [[natural pairing]] of each dual space with its respective vector space. This definition also applies unchanged to left modules and to vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Bourbaki |title=Algebra I |section=II §2.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the transpose may be seen to be independent of any bilinear form on the vector spaces, unlike the adjoint ([[#Adjoint of a bilinear map|below]]).

If the matrix ''A'' describes a linear map with respect to [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] of ''V'' and ''W'', then the matrix ''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; describes the transpose of that linear map with respect to the dual bases.

=== Transpose of a bilinear form ===
{{main|Bilinear form}}

Every linear map to the dual space {{math|1=''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} defines a bilinear form {{math|1=''B'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''F''}}, with the relation {{math|1=''B''(''v'', ''w'') = ''f''(''v'')(''w'')}}. By defining the transpose of this bilinear form as the bilinear form &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''B'' defined by the transpose {{math|1=&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' : ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt; → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} i.e. {{math|1=&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''B''(''w'', ''v'') = &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''f''(Ψ(''w''))(''v'')}}, we find that {{math|1=''B''(''v'', ''w'') = &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;''B''(''w'', ''v'')}}. Here, Ψ is the natural homomorphism {{math|''V'' → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} into the [[double dual]].

=== Adjoint ===
{{distinguish|Hermitian adjoint}}

If the vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' have respectively [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]] [[bilinear form]]s ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt;, a concept known as the ''adjoint,'' which is closely related to the transpose'','' may be defined:

If {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is a [[linear map]] between [[vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'', we define ''g'' as the ''adjoint'' of ''f'' if {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''W'' → ''V''}} satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;B_V\big(v, g(w)\big) = B_W\big(f(v), w\big) \quad \forall v \in V, w \in W.&lt;/math&gt;

These bilinear forms define an [[isomorphism]] between ''V'' and ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, and between ''W'' and ''W''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in an isomorphism between the transpose and adjoint of ''f''. The matrix of the adjoint of a map is the transposed matrix only if the [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] are orthonormal with respect to their bilinear forms. In this context, many authors use the term transpose to refer to the adjoint as defined here.

The adjoint allows us to consider whether {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''W'' → ''V''}} is equal to {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; : ''W'' → ''V''}}. In particular, this allows the [[orthogonal group]] over a vector space ''V'' with a quadratic form to be defined without reference to matrices (nor the components thereof) as the set of all linear maps {{nowrap|''V'' → ''V''}} for which the adjoint equals the inverse.

Over a complex vector space, one often works with [[sesquilinear form]]s (conjugate-linear in one argument) instead of bilinear forms. The [[Hermitian adjoint]] of a map between such spaces is defined similarly, and the matrix of the Hermitian adjoint is given by the conjugate transpose matrix if the bases are orthonormal.

== Implementation of matrix transposition on computers ==
{{See also|In-place matrix transposition}}

On a [[computer]], one can often avoid explicitly transposing a matrix in [[Random access memory|memory]] by simply accessing the same data in a different order. For example, [[software libraries]] for [[linear algebra]], such as [[BLAS]], typically provide options to specify that certain matrices are to be interpreted in transposed order to avoid the necessity of data movement.

However, there remain a number of circumstances in which it is necessary or desirable to physically reorder a matrix in memory to its transposed ordering. For example, with a matrix stored in [[row-major order]], the rows of the matrix are contiguous in memory and the columns are discontiguous. If repeated operations need to be performed on the columns, for example in a [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithm, transposing the matrix in memory (to make the columns contiguous) may improve performance by increasing [[memory locality]].

Ideally, one might hope to transpose a matrix with minimal additional storage. This leads to the problem of transposing an ''n''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''m'' matrix [[in-place]], with [[Big O notation|O(1)]] additional storage or at most storage much less than ''mn''. For ''n''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''m'', this involves a complicated [[permutation]] of the data elements that is non-trivial to implement in-place. Therefore, efficient [[in-place matrix transposition]] has been the subject of numerous research publications in [[computer science]], starting in the late 1950s, and several algorithms have been developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''type constructor''' is a feature of a typed [[formal language]] that builds new types from old ones. [[Basic type]]s are considered to be built using [[nullary]] type constructors. Some type constructors take another type as an argument, e.g., the constructors for [[product type]]s, [[function type]]s&lt;!-- needs writing --&gt;, power types and [[list type]]s&lt;!-- ibid --&gt;. New types can be defined by recursively composing type constructors.

For example, [[simply typed lambda calculus]] can be seen as a language with a single type constructor&amp;mdash;the function type constructor. Product types can generally be considered "built-in" in [[Typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] via [[currying]].

Abstractly, a type constructor is an ''n''-ary '''type operator''' taking as argument zero or more types, and returning another type. Making use of currying, ''n''-ary type operators can be (re)written as a sequence of applications of unary type operators. Therefore, we can view the type operators as a simply typed lambda calculus, which has only one basic type, usually denoted &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, and pronounced "type", which is the type of all types in the underlying language, which are now called ''proper types'' in order to distinguish them from the types of the type operators in their own calculus, which are called ''[[Kind (type theory)|kind]]s''.

Instituting a simply typed lambda calculus over the type operators results in more than just a formalization of type constructors though. Higher-order type operators become possible. Type operators correspond to the 2nd axis in the [[lambda cube]], leading to the simply typed lambda-calculus with type operators, λ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;; while this is not so well known, combining type operators with polymorphic lambda calculus ([[system F]]) yields [[system F-omega]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7484">'''Victor Joseph Katz''' (born 31 December 1942, [[Philadelphia]])&lt;ref&gt;biographical information from American Men and Women of Science, Thomson Gale 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  is an American mathematician, historian of mathematics, and teacher known for using the history of mathematics in teaching mathematics.

==Biography==
Katz received in 1963 from [[Princeton University]] a bachelor's degree and in 1968  from [[Brandeis University]] a Ph.D. in mathematics under [[Maurice Auslander]] with thesis ''The Brauer group of a regular local ring''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogyProject|id=20444}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became at Federal City College an assistant professor and then in 1973 an associate professor and, after the merger of Federal City College into the [[University of the District of Columbia]] in 1977, a full professor there in 1980. He retired there as professor emeritus in 2005.

As a mathematician Katz specializes in algebra, but he is mainly known for his work on the history of mathematics and its uses in teaching. He wrote a textbook ''History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (1993), for which he won in 1995 the [[Watson Davis and Helen Miles Davis Prize]]. He organized workshops and congresses for the MAA and the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]]. The MAA published a collection of teaching materials by Katz as a compact disk with the title ''Historical Modules for the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics''. With Frank Swetz, he was a founding editor of a free online journal on the history of mathematics under the aegis of the MAA; the journal is called ''Convergence: Where Mathematics, History, and Teaching Interact''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/about-convergence MAA, Convergence]&lt;/ref&gt; In the journal ''Convergence'', Katz and Swetz published a series ''Mathematical Treasures''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-omar-khayyams-algebra Katz, Swetz, Mathematical Treasures, Omar Khayyam's Algebra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|author=Katz, V.

== Personal ==
He has been married since 1969 to Phyllis Katz (née Friedman), a science educator who developed and directed the U.S. national nonprofit organization ''[[Hands On Science Outreach, Inc.]]'' (HOSO). The couple have three children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7362">A '''weight function''' is a mathematical device used when performing a sum, integral, or average to give some elements more "weight" or influence on the result than other elements in the same set. The result of this application of a weight function is a '''weighted sum''' or [[weighted average]]. Weight functions occur frequently in [[statistics]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], and are closely related to the concept of a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]].  Weight functions can be employed in both discrete and continuous settings. They can be used to construct systems of calculus called "weighted calculus"&lt;ref&gt;Jane Grossman, Michael Grossman, Robert Katz. [https://books.google.com/books?as_brr=0&amp;q=%22The+First+Systems+of+Weighted+Differential+and+Integral+Calculus%E2%80%8E%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books,''The First Systems of Weighted Differential and Integral Calculus''], {{isbn|0-9771170-1-4}}, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and "meta-calculus".&lt;ref&gt;Jane Grossman.[https://books.google.com/books?q=%22Non-Newtonian+Calculus%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0, ''Meta-Calculus: Differential and Integral''], {{isbn|0-9771170-2-2}}, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrete weights ==
=== General definition ===
In the discrete setting, a weight function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle w\colon A \to {\Bbb R}^+&lt;/math&gt; is a positive function defined on a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] '''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;''', which is typically
[[finite set|finite]] or [[countable]].  The weight function &lt;math&gt;w(a) := 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the ''unweighted'' situation in which all elements have equal weight.  One can then apply this weight to various concepts.

If the function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f\colon A \to {\Bbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[real number|real]]-valued [[mathematical function|function]], then the ''unweighted [[summation|sum]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on '''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;''''' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a \in A} f(a);&lt;/math&gt;

but given a ''weight function'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle w\colon A \to {\Bbb R}^+&lt;/math&gt;, the '''weighted sum''' or [[conical combination]] is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a \in A} f(a) w(a).&lt;/math&gt;

One common application of weighted sums arises in [[numerical integration]].

If ''B'' is a [[finite set|finite]] subset of ''A'', one can replace the unweighted [[cardinality]] ''|B|'' of ''B'' by the ''weighted cardinality'' 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{a \in B} w(a).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''A'' is a [[finite set|finite]] non-empty set, one can replace the unweighted [[mean]] or [[average]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|A|} \sum_{a \in A} f(a)&lt;/math&gt;

by the [[weighted mean]] or [[weighted average]] 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sum_{a \in A} f(a) w(a)}{\sum_{a \in A} w(a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this case only the ''relative'' weights are relevant.

=== Statistics ===
Weighted means are commonly used in [[statistics]] to compensate for the presence of [[Bias_(statistics)|bias]].  For a quantity  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; measured multiple independent times &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; with [[variance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sigma^2_i&lt;/math&gt;, the best estimate of the signal is obtained 
by averaging all the measurements with weight &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle w_i=\frac 1 {\sigma_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and
the resulting variance is smaller than each of the independent measurements
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sigma^2=1/\sum w_i&lt;/math&gt;. The [[maximum likelihood]] method weights the difference between fit and data using the same weights &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[expected value]] of a random variable is the weighted average of the possible values it might take on, with the weights being the respective [[probability|probabilities]]. More generally, the expected value of a function of a random variable is the probability-weighted average of the values the function takes on for each possible value of the random variable.

In [[linear regression|regressions]] in which the [[dependent variable]] is assumed to be affected by both current and lagged (past) values of the [[independent variable]], a [[distributed lag]] function is estimated, this function being a weighted average of the current and various lagged independent variable values. Similarly, a [[moving average model]] specifies an evolving variable as a weighted average of current and various lagged values of a random variable.

=== Mechanics ===
The terminology ''weight function'' arises from [[mechanics]]: if one has a collection of ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'' objects on a [[lever]], with weights &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle w_1, \ldots, w_n&lt;/math&gt; (where [[weight]] is now interpreted in the physical sense) and locations :&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dotsc,\boldsymbol{x}_n&lt;/math&gt;, then the lever will be in balance if the [[Lever|fulcrum]] of the lever is at the [[center of mass]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \boldsymbol{x}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i},&lt;/math&gt;

which is also the weighted average of the positions &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{x}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

== Continuous weights ==
In the continuous setting, a weight is a positive [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] such as &lt;math&gt;w(x) \, dx&lt;/math&gt; on some [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;,which is typically a [[subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\Bbb R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, for instance &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; could be an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; is [[Lebesgue measure]] and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle w\colon \Omega \to \R^+&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative [[measurable]] [[mathematical function|function]].  In this context, the weight function &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes referred to as a [[density]].

=== General definition ===
If &lt;math&gt;f\colon \Omega \to {\Bbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[real number|real]]-valued [[mathematical function|function]], then the ''unweighted'' [[integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega f(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;

can be generalized to the ''weighted integral'' 

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega f(x) w(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

Note that one may need to require &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to be [[absolutely integrable function|absolutely integrable]] with respect to the weight &lt;math&gt;w(x) \, dx&lt;/math&gt; in order for this integral to be finite.

=== Weighted volume ===
If ''E'' is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[volume]] vol(''E'') of ''E'' can be generalized to the ''weighted volume'' 
:&lt;math&gt; \int_E w(x)\ dx,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Weighted average ===
If &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; has finite non-zero weighted volume, then we can replace the unweighted [[average]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\mathrm{vol}(\Omega)} \int_\Omega f(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;

by the '''weighted average''' 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\int_\Omega f(x)\ w(x) dx}{\int_\Omega w(x)\ dx}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bilinear form ===
If &lt;math&gt; f\colon \Omega \to {\Bbb R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g\colon \Omega \to {\Bbb R}&lt;/math&gt; are two functions, one can generalize the unweighted [[bilinear form]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f, g \rangle := \int_\Omega f(x) g(x)\ dx&lt;/math&gt;

to a weighted bilinear form 

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f, g \rangle := \int_\Omega f(x) g(x)\ w(x)\ dx.&lt;/math&gt;

See the entry on [[orthogonal polynomials]] for examples of weighted [[orthogonal functions]].

'''Zoe Heriot''' (sometimes spelled '''Zoe Herriot''') is a fictional character played by [[Wendy Padbury]] in the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. A young [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] who lived on a [[Rotating wheel space station|space wheel]] in the 21st century, she was a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Second Doctor]] and a regular in the programme from 1968 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doctor Who: Companions|authorlink1=David J. Howe|last1=Howe|first1=David J.|last2=Stammers|first2=Mark|publisher=Virgin Publishing|year=1995|ISBN=1-85227-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doctor Who: 25 Glorious Years|last1=Haining|first1=Peter|authorlink1=Peter Haining (author)|year=1988|publisher=W.H.Allen|ISBN=1-85227-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
Zoe first appears in the serial ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'',&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/wendy-padbury/ |title=Wendy Padbury &amp;#124; Doctor Who Interview Archive |publisher=Drwhointerviews.wordpress.com |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she is the librarian&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/companions/page12.shtml |title=Doctor Who – Classic Series – Companions – Zoe Herriot |publisher=BBC |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; on board Space Station W3, also known as the Wheel. When the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] attack, she aids [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] and [[Jamie McCrimmon|Jamie]] in defeating them before stowing away aboard the [[TARDIS]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/04/22/doctor-who-the-10-best-companions/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]]'s script for ''The Wheel in Space'', Zoe's last name is spelled "Heriot", but the double-"r" misspelling is also seen in reference works.

Zoe's age is not given in the series, but according to initial publicity she was fifteen when she joined the TARDIS crew.&lt;ref name="The Invasion DVD"&gt;{{cite video
  | people =
  | title = [[Doctor Who DVD releases#Releases|Doctor Who – The Invasion]] (production subtitles)
  | medium = [[DVD]]
  | publisher = 2 Entertain Video
  | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She holds a degree in pure mathematics&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; and is a genius, with intelligence scores comparable to the Doctor's. Coupled with her [[eidetic memory|photographic memory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/11/a-companion-to-the-doctors-companions-zoe-heriot/ |title=A Companion To The Doctor's Companions: Zoe Heriot &amp;#124; Anglophenia |publisher=BBC America |date= |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the advanced learning techniques of her era, this makes her somewhat like a human calculator, able to perform complicated mathematics in her head. Part of the reason for her wanting to travel with the Doctor is her chafing at the restrictions and sterile surroundings of her station-bound existence. However, her real-world experience is severely limited, causing her to get herself into trouble frequently.

Together with the Doctor and Jamie, she meets the Cybermen again when they invade 20th century [[London]], enters the surreal Land of Fiction, fights the [[Ice Warrior]]s&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt; and survives the battlefields of [[List of Doctor Who villains#W|the War Chief]]'s [[The War Games|war games]]. Her journeys with the Doctor come to an end in that serial, when the [[Time Lord]]s finally catch up with the Doctor. As well as forcing a [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regeneration]] on him and exiling him to [[Earth]], the Time Lords return Jamie and Zoe to their own times, wiping their memories of their experiences with the Doctor (save for their first encounters with him) in the process.

==Other appearances==
Zoe's life after her return to her own time is not further explored in the series. In the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] short story "The Tip of the Mind" by [[Peter Anghelides]], it is revealed that although her intellect allows her to resist the memory blocks by the Time Lords, she is unable to access the memories of her time with the Doctor consciously. This causes her strange dreams, and makes her work suffer. An encounter with the [[Third Doctor]] makes the memory blocks permanent, but she ultimately never reaches her full potential.

Padbury has appeared in ''Doctor Who'' audio adventures from [[Big Finish Productions]], first as a character other than Zoe in the full-cast audio ''[[Davros (Doctor Who audio)|Davros]]'', and then as Zoe in ''[[Fear of the Daleks]]'', part of the "Companion Chronicles" talking book series. The latter story portrays an older Zoe having detailed dreams of her adventures with the Doctor; she suspects that something is blocking her memory, but she does not know what, and is seeing a psychiatric counselor in an effort to understand the "dreams". She has returned as Zoe in several more Big Finish plays such as ''[[Echoes of Grey]]'' and her second Companion Chronicle, ''[[The Second Doctor Boxset#Prison in Space|Prison in Space]]'', based on an unmade TV story. ''Echoes of Grey'' and subsequent follow-up stories, ''The Memory Cheats'' and ''The Uncertainty Principle'' depict Zoe being essentially taken prisoner by an unnamed Company whose experiments in creating a new form of life were disrupted by the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe- the TARDIS arriving on Earth a few decades in Zoe's future- in ''Echoes of Grey'', subsequent stories seeing the Company arresting Zoe's older, contemporary self on trumped-up charges to try and provoke Zoe into unlocking her lost memories of her time with the Doctor so that they can harness the secret of time travel. This comes to a head in the audio ''Second Chances'' when Zoe has a 'flashback' of the destruction of a space station that will actually take place a few days in the future from her current point in time, allowing Zoe to interact with her past self as she tries to change her history and prevent the station's destruction. Although this part of her plan fails, the audio ends with Zoe using a computer virus that has mutated to attack physical matter to destroy the Company and escape, although her mental state and memories of her time with the Doctor are still lost.

An older Zoe is reunited with the Doctor in [[Sixth Doctor|his sixth incarnation]] in ''[[Legend of the Cybermen]]'', where she returns to the Land of Fiction after she is nearly converted by the Cybermen after leaving the Doctor, her attempt to trap the Cybermen in the Land resulting in the universe being endangered by the risk that the Cybermen will harness the computer that controls the Land and use that to influence the imagination of the entire universe. After Zoe draws the Doctor into the Land, she created a fictional duplicate of Jamie to protect the Doctor until he learns the full situation and helps Zoe drive the Cybermen out, at the cost of Zoe losing her memories again as the Doctor takes her home. Zoe and Jamie also meet the Sixth Doctor in the audio ''[[Last of the Cybermen]]'', but in this case the Sixth Doctor has swapped with the Second shortly before the events of "[[The War Games]]", the Doctor's attempt to change his personal history to let his companions keep their memories failing when history is 'reset' as the Second Doctor returns to his proper place in history..

The novelisation of the TV serial ''[[The Mind Robber]]'' mentions, in passing, that Zoe discussed that adventure "long afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Mind Robber |last=Ling |first=Peter |year=1986 |publisher=Target Books |isbn=0-426-20286-4 |page=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that she eventually recovered some or all of her lost memories.

Wendy Padbury returned to ''Doctor Who'' as an illusory image of Zoe in the 20th anniversary episode, ''[[The Five Doctors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/fivedoctors/detail.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
