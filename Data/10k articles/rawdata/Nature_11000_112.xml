The '''6DJ8''' is a miniature nine-pin medium gain dual [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]].   It is distinguished by its very high [[transconductance]], mostly the result of its frame grid construction. Versions of the tube are named ECC88, E88CC, 6922, 6N23P, and 6N11.

== Origins == 
[[File:Philips JAN 6922.jpg|right|thumb|A Philips JAN 6922 made in the USA]]
Developed by [[Amperex Electronic|Amperex]], the American division of Philips in 1958. It was developed by Philips in the Netherlands under European designation ECC88. The series-string version 7DJ8 / PCC88 was also introduced at the same time. The 6DJ8 was designed for use as a low-noise amplifier in [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] TV tuners, an improved successor to the usual 6BK7, but due to its high gain it was used in much high-end test equipment.  Most high-quality oscilloscopes from the 1950s to the 1960s have many 6DJ8 tubes.

== Audio ==
[[File:Headphone amp 6922.jpg|right|thumb|Two 6922s used in a headphone amp]]
Although not originally designed for the purpose, it became popular in [[hi-fi]] audio amplifiers.  European-produced version of the tube is designated '''ECC88'''.  An industrial (improved/higher ratings) version of the tube was designated '''6922''' / E88CC between 1959 and 1961. Siemens introduced their own super ECC88 / 6DJ8 at the same time under CCa type.   New Old Stock (NOS) '''6DJ8'''s and '''ECC88'''s produced in the past by major American or West European vacuum tube manufacturers (such as [[Philips]] or [[Amperex]]) remain extremely popular with and highly sought by [[audiophiles]].  A version (direct equivalent) of this tube was also produced in the Soviet Union as '''6N23P''' (Russian: '''6Н23П''') and in China as '''6N11'''.

{{As of|2015}} the tube was being produced in three versions in Eastern Europe - [[Slovakia]] by [[JJ Electronic]] ([[Tesla (Czechoslovak company)|ex-Tesla]]), and in Russia - '''6DJ8''' for [[Sovtek]] and '''6922''' for [[Electro-Harmonix]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36020">In the aftermath of the [[First World War]], the '''Adriatic Question''' or '''Adriatic Problem''' concerned the fate of the territories along the eastern coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] that formerly belonged to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. The roots of the dispute lay in the secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], signed during the war (26 April 1915), and in growing nationalism, especially [[Italian irredentism]] and [[Yugoslavism]], which led ultimately to the [[creation of Yugoslavia]]. The question was a major barrier to agreement at the  [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], but was partially resolved by the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] between Italy and Yugoslavia on 12 November 1920.

==Background==

Austria-Hungary exited the war on 3 November 1918, when it ordered its troops to cease fighting. The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], signed with Italy that day, took effect on 4 November, and on 13 November  the [[Armistice of Belgrade]] was signed with Italy's allies on the Balkan front. Italy began immediately to occupy territories ceded to it by the treaty of 1915, while simultaneously the South Slavs formed local governments in opposition to both Italian expansion and Austro-Hungarian authority. A [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] was set up in [[Zagreb]] on 5–6 October, and the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] was proclaimed there on 29 October and that same day the ''[[Sabor]]'', the legitimate parliament of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], declared independence from Austria-Hungary. On 1 December the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia) was formed in [[Belgrade]] by union of this new state with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].

==Arguments==

===Populations===
The main argument presented by Yugoslavia was that the territories under consideration contained about seven million Slavs, almost the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", ''Edinburgh Review'', 231:472 (1920), 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Dalmatian islands, only [[Lošinj]] (Lussin) had an Italian majority.&lt;ref name=Peace215/&gt; When the hinterland of Fiume was included along with its suburbs the Yugoslav majority increased further. The Italian claim on Gorizia and Gradisca was generally recognised, as was its claim on the Slavic settlements around [[Friuli]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Conference of Oppressed Nationalities]] in Rome (8–10 April 1918), Italy lent official support to the [[Declaration of Corfu]] (20 July 1917), a Yugoslavist document supported by Britain and France that expressed the need to unite the South Slavs politically.&lt;ref&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===
The Italians argued that the natural geographic boundary of Italy included the [[Julian Alps|Julian]] and [[Dinaric Alps]], and that therefore the Austro-Hungarian littoral lay within geographic Italy.&lt;ref name=Peace215&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic importance of the geography of the eastern coast of the Adriatic has been generally accepted. The Chief of the Division of Boundary Geography with the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, [[Douglas Wilson Johnson]], wrote at the time, "Any naval power on the [Adriatic] eastern coast must find itself possessing immense advantages over Italy."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Johnson, "Geographic Aspects of the Adriatic Problem", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 59:6 (1920), 512–16. For a biography of Johnson, see Walter H. Bucher, [http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/djohnson24.pdf "Douglas Wilson Johnson, 1878–1944"], National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Biographical Memoirs (1946), vol. XXIV, no. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson went on to note that the offer of [[Pula]] (Pola), [[Vlorë]] (Valona) and a central Dalmatian island group to the Italians effectively settled the strategic problem and balanced the two Adriatic powers.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, "Geographical Aspects", 513.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allied occupation==

===Joint occupation of Fiume===
On 29 October 1918 the Austro-Hungarians evacuated Fiume, and its Croatian mayor, [[Rikard Lenac]], proclaimed the town's adherence to the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 30 October the Italian community set up a "national council" and proclaimed Fiume's union with Italy.&lt;ref name=SetonWatson325&gt;[[Hugh Seton-Watson]] and Christopher Seton-Watson, ''The Making of a New Europe: R. W. Seton-Watson and the Last Days of Austria-Hungary'' (London: Methuen, 1981), 325–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the local governor handed over power to the Italians, as did the governor of Trieste.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sondhaus, ''The Naval Policy of Austria-Hungary, 1867–1918: Navalism, Industrial Development, and the Politics of Dualism'' (Purdue Research Foundation, 1994), 354.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November an Italian naval detachment under Admiral [[Guglielmo Rainer]] aboard the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Emanuele Filiberto||2}} arrived in the harbour of Fiume. Rainer declared the local government dissolved and, on 14 November Italian Prime Minister [[Vittorio Orlando]], acting on the advice of Chief of Staff [[Armando Diaz]], order Rainer to land a troop of marines.&lt;ref name=SetonWatson325/&gt; The next day (15 November) Diaz requested Allied troops take part in the occupation of Fiume. The commander of British forces on the Italian Front, the [[Rudolph Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan|Earl of Cavan]], was ordered to send a company "to show that the occupation is allied, and to keep order".&lt;ref name=SetonWatson325/&gt; That same day 2,000 Serbian soldiers arrived on the outskirts of Fiume. 

France and the United States also sent naval contingents to Fiume, and on 17 November some American, British and French naval officers met with Mayor Lenac and Ivan Lorković, a delegate from the Slovene–Croat–Serb state, in the abandoned governor's palace. It was agreed that the Serb troops should evacuate the area that afternoon and that the Italian marines should not be landed for another three days, pending orders from the [[Supreme Council of the Paris Peace Conference]]. Although Rainer agreed, he was countermanded by his superior, on the grounds that he had acted without instruction, and an Italian troops force eighty strong entered the city that afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 223.&lt;/ref&gt; They ordered Lenac's government out of the palace and removed all Serbian flags on public display.&lt;ref name=SetonWatson325/&gt; On 18 November the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs officially protested to the allied commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson and Seton-Watson, ''A New Europe'', 334 n. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of an American battalion on 19 November prevented any outbreak of violence, but the Italians eventually posted 12,000 troops in the city—"an Italian military occupation in overwhelming force, for political reasons" wrote Admiral [[Edward Buxton Kiddle|Edward Kiddle]],&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson and Seton-Watson, ''A New Europe'', 334 n. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and Commodore [[Howard Kelly (Royal Navy officer)|Howard Kelly]], commanding the [[British Adriatic Force]], could remark on 22 November that "the Italian occupation has all the appearance of an annexation to the Italian Crown."&lt;ref name=SetonWatson325/&gt;

===Establishment of a naval commission===
When Italy first began occupying land east of the [[Tagliamento]], the former boundary between Italy and Austria-Hungary, it employed troops of the [[332nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|332nd Infantry Regiment]] of the United States (which were under Italian command on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]]), with the goal of appearing to be an international occupation force. Although this misuse of American troops led the [[United States War Department]] to order them withdrawn, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] countermanded the order to prevent a breakdown in negotiations over the Adriatic Question in Paris. Thereafter, as a result, the international control for the Adriatic was a naval responsibility.&lt;ref name=Gabriel428&gt;Ralph H. Gabriel, "American Experience with Military Government", ''American Political Science Review'', 37:3 (1943), 427–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 1918 representatives of the Allied navies—American, British, French and Italian—met in [[Venice]] to establish the Naval Commission (or Committee) for the Adriatic. At several sessions held in Rome from 26 November, the commission decided the fate of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian fleet]] and of its coastline. The fleet was divided in control between the Americans, French and Italians pending a final political decision regarding its fate, while the coast was divided into three zones of control, an Italian in the north (mainly corresponding to the [[Austrian Littoral]]), an American in the middle (mainly [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]]) and a French in the south (mainly [[Principality of Albania|Albania]]).&lt;ref name=Gabriel428/&gt; This arrangement eventually received political ratification in Paris. [[Josephus Daniels]], United States Secretary of the Navy, wrote to his Chief of Naval Operations, [[William S. Benson]], also American naval advisor to the Paris Peace Commission, that "due to possible Adriatic developments and [American] desire to show sympathy with [the] Slavonic government being formed in the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, consider it desirable to send flag officer ... immediately into the Adriatic."&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic2&gt;Dragoljub R. Živojinović, [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/OP%2015.pdf "The United States and Its Unknown Role in the Adriatic Conflicts of 1918–21"], 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Benson later wrote to Admiral [[William H. G. Bullard]], commanding American naval forces in their zone, that "the general principles laid down by the President", i.e. the [[Fourteen Points]], which stressed [[national self-determination]], should be furthered, implying active American support for Yugoslav nationhood.&lt;ref name=Gabriel428/&gt;

===Split incident===
{{main|1918–1920 unrest in Split}}
The Naval Commission began its work in Fiume in early December, but in January the Italian representative, Admiral [[Vittorio Mola]], resigned in protest. At the demands of the American, British and French admirals, Italy appointed Rear Admiral [[Ugo Rombo]] to replace him on 1 February 1919. At a meeting in Venice on 8 February Rombo told Admiral [[Albert Parker Niblack]] that the Americans did not understand the Adriatic problem, leading to a breakdown in negotiations between the Italians and the rest. In the end the Commission's report was not publicised.&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic5&gt;Živojinović, "The United States", 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Commission moved to Split, the admirals tasked the Yugoslavs with maintaining order, but on 24 February some Yugoslav (mostly Croat) citizens attacked some Italian officers meeting with local Italianophiles. Rombo demanded the Allies patrol the city, but Niblack and Benson vetoed it.&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic5/&gt;

===Austro-Hungarian fleet allocation===
On 8 October 1918, in response to the recent opening of the National Council in Zagreb, the ''[[Imperial Council (Austria)|Reichsrat]]'', one of the two parliaments of Austria-Hungary, freed 348 of the 379 sailors still in custody after the [[Gulf of Kotor Mutiny|mutiny of 1–3 February]] in [[Kotor]] (Cattaro). On 22–24 October officers conducted talks with sailors in their native languages on all ships explaining [[Charles I of Austria|Emperor Charles I]]'s plan to federalise [[Cisleithania]], but it was too late to restore morale or loyalty to the crown. On 26 October the forbidden call to mutiny, ''Hurra-Rufe'', was heard on the {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich}} in Kotor, and two days later on the battleships in Pula.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sondhaus, "Austro-Hungarian Naval Mutinies of World War I", ''Rebellion, Repression, Reinvention: Mutiny in Comparative Perspective'', ed. Jane Hathaway (Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2001), 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; The sailors organised councils but did not openly rebel or riot. On 31 October 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Navy, with all its ships and other craft, supplies, stores and facilities (ports, arsenals, etc.) was handed over to the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs by Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], acting under orders received from the emperor the previous day.&lt;ref name=Sondhaus351&gt;Sondhaus, ''The Naval Policy of Austria-Hungary'', 351–54.&lt;/ref&gt; All non-Yugoslav sailors were furloughed and all officers were given the option to continue in service to the new nation. The emperor's order contained a proviso that in the future all the "nations" of Austria-Hungary should have a right to claim compensation for their share of the value of the fleet.&lt;ref name=Sondhaus351/&gt; The formal handover at Kotor took place on 1 November, the same day the Italians sank the battleship {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} at Pula, whether yet aware it was a Yugoslav ship or not. Admiral [[William Sims]], commander of the United States Navy in Europe, ordered Admiral Bullard to go to Pula aboard the {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}} and escort the former Austro-Hungarian ships that had been taken over by Yugoslavia to Corfu under white flags.&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic2/&gt;

By the end of the day, 1 November, Chief of the Naval Staff [[Paolo Emilio Thaon di Revel]] had informed the government that "the entire Austrian fleet or at least a great part of it has pulled down the Austrian flag and raised the Yugoslav. The fleet or a good part of it is already in the hands of the Yugoslav National Committee."&lt;ref name=Sondhaus357&gt;Sondhaus, ''The Naval Policy of Austria-Hungary'', 357.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not effect negotiations at Villa Giusti, and the armistice was signed on behalf of the navy by [[Prince Johann of Liechtenstein]] of the Austrian Navy League and Captain Georg Zwierkowski of the [[Danube Flotilla (Austria-Hungary)|Danube Flotilla]]. The treaty promised the Italians a share of the Austro-Hungarian fleet (although this had in fact ceased to exist some days before):&lt;ref name=Sondhaus357/&gt;
* two dreadnoughts: {{SMS|Prinz Eugen}} and {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|6}}
* one pre-dreadnought: {{SMS|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand}}
* three cruisers: {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|6}}, {{SMS|Novara|1913|6}} and {{SMS|Saida}}
* the {{sclass-|Tátra|destroyer|2}}s
Shortly before the armistice came into effect at 3:00 p.m. on 4 November, the Italian navy occupied Vis (Lissa). This was done "to exorcise the old demons of 1866 [i.e., the [[Austro-Prussian War]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and restore the honour of the Italian navy while the war at least technically was still underway."&lt;ref name=Sondhaus358&gt;Sondhaus, ''The Naval Policy of Austria-Hungary'', 358.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the day Fiume, Trieste and Pula had been occupied, and on 5 November [[Šibenik]] (Sebenico) followed. The Yugoslavs abandoned all the vessels they could not man to the Italians, and on 7 November the {{SMS|Radetzky}} sailed out of Pula for the unoccupied port of [[Bakar]] (Buccari). On 9 November the Italian flag was raised on all remaining vessels in Pula. That day, cruisers of the British, French and Italian navies sailed into the [[Bay of Kotor]] (Bocche di Cattaro) and the last unoccupied Austro-Hungarian port. The sailors there cut up their Austro-Hungarian ensigns—to prevent them from being taken by the Italians as trophies—and distributed them as souvenirs. That same day, at an inter-Allied conference on [[Corfu]], the Italian diplomat [[Ugo Conz]] retorted to his British colleagues, "There can be no fleet where there is no state. There can be no Yugoslav fleet as long as such a state has not yet been founded or as long as peace has not been definitively concluded."&lt;ref name=Sondhaus358/&gt;

===American occupation zone===
{{see also|1918–1920 incidents in Split}}
In Dalmatia, the American occupation zone, the citizens had elected a provisional assembly and a governor, and both supported the nascent State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Order was kept by the local militia, which was often unreliable, and by Serbian troops which had begun to garrison the area in small numbers. This arrangement was supported by the Americans, but "[b]y early 1919, disturbed local conditions forced the [Naval] Committee for the Adriatic to circulate four armed inter-allied patrols night and day throughout the area under the command of the American admiral."&lt;ref name=Gabriel428/&gt; After a few months of this the Admiral Bullard supplanted the inter-allied patrol with a patrol composed entirely of Americans to assist the local police in maintaining order for a few hours each day.&lt;ref name=Gabriel429&gt;Gabriel, "American Experience", 429–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several times Italian troops crossed the frontier into the American zone of occupation, but in each case they were turned back, either by a warning or, in one case, by the arrival of American warships and landing of American forces. In several towns the Americans posted notice that they would protect the lives and property of Dalmatians against any Italian injustice. This latter sort of propaganda was the most effective means of keeping the peace, since the American admiral had to rely on Serbian troops for garrisoning the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Živojinović, "The United States", 1: "The US admirals carried out their authority through the local administration, while the Yugoslav troops stationed in the zone were under the Yugoslav Supreme Command; the Americans relied on these troops to preserve order."&lt;/ref&gt; His own garrison was minuscule, and reinforcements were only landed in emergencies.&lt;ref name=Gabriel429/&gt; One Yugoslav mayor from the Italian zone sent a letter of thanks to the American admiral for protecting his people from the Italians.

The first effort to bring American naval forces in the Adriatic home took place in December 1919. In February 1920 the Italians requested four Austro-Hungarian ships allocated to Italy by the [[Allied Military Committee of Versailles]] and which were being guarded at Split by American forces. The Italian ambition to receive these vessels led to the decision to retain American ships in the Adriatic longer.&lt;ref&gt;Živojinović, "The United States", 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The American occupation ended only after the Italian forces had evacuated their zone and the [[International Committee for the Destruction of Enemy Warships]] had allocated all the formerly Austro-Hungarian vessels under its command to the [[Regia Marina|Italian Navy]].&lt;ref name=Gabriel429/&gt; The last American troops left aboard the {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|6}} on 29 September 1921, after the Treaty of Rapallo had been signed.
&lt;!-- "Italy prepared itself for the new situation. Its naval and army units were dispatched to the eastern Adriatic immediately, and its government refused to demobilize. The Italians entrenched themselves in these territories and imposed harsh measures against Yugoslav committees and organizations for self-government which had been established during the last months of the Austro-Hungarian administration. Those who opposed the Italian presence were deported or jailed. Yugoslavs from Austria-Hungary were considered enemies and were treated accordingly."&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic2/&gt; 

After this Armistice the American troops formed part of the Allied force stationed in Austria and along the Dalmatian coast. The 1st and 3rd Battalions were at Cormons near Gorizia. Later in November the 1st Battalion was ordered to go to Treviso and the 3rd Battalion to Fiume, Austria. The 2nd Battalion was stationed at Cattaro, Dalmatia and a detachment from it was sent to Cetinje, Montenegro. In March 1919 the regiment was assembled in Genoa and by April 4th its last elements embarked from that seaport and Marseilles for the United States. --&gt;

==Negotiations==
The negotiations attending the Adriatic Question at the Paris Peace Conference may be divided into three periods based on the dominant Italian personality of the time: January–June 1919, the Baron Sonnino period; June–September 1919, the Tittoni period; and 12 September – 9 December 1919, the d'Annunzio period.&lt;ref&gt;This is the periodisation found in "The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 224–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

From January until June 1919 negotiations were dominated by Baron [[Sidney Sonnino]], the Italian Foreign Minister, who divided and conquered his allies, forcing Britain and France to acquiesce in the Treaty of London and endeavouring to negotiate directly with America from a position of strength. At the same time he whipped up the Italian people with nationalistic propaganda.&lt;ref name=Peace224&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; When the government of Orlando was replaced by that of [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]] on 23 June, Sonnino was replaced by [[Tommaso Tittoni]]. The nationalist fervour he had stoked, however, broke into open violence in Fiume, where, on 6 July 1919, an element of the Italian population massacred some of the occupying French soldiers.&lt;ref name=Peace224/&gt; 

On 15 April President Wilson issued a memorandum proposing a line, the so-called "Wilson Line", dividing the Istrian peninsula between Italy and Yugoslavia. Trieste and Pula, with the railway connecting them, lay on the Italian side; Fiume and [[Ljubljana]] (Laibach), with the railway connecting them, on the Yugoslav. [[Učka]] (Monte Maggiore) was to be Italian, but the Wilson Line ran further west of Fiume than that of the Treaty of London. Italy would have none of the rights in northern Dalmatia granted it by that treaty, but it would receive the islands of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa) and Lošinj (Lussin). The [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslav fleet]], inherited from Austria-Hungary, was to be reduced, and the area of the frontier demilitarised generally.&lt;ref name=Peace224/&gt; The Italians alleged that the Wilson line did not give sufficient protection to the Trieste–Pula railway.&lt;ref name=Peace226&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tittoni altered the course of negotiations by abandoning the Treaty of London and strengthening the Franco-Italian alliance, but he did not accept President Wilson's proposed "line". The French diplomat [[André Tardieu]] worked as an intermediary between Tittoni and the Americans, and he first suggested the creation of a buffer state out of a strip of land around Fiume, the future [[Free State of Fiume]]. The main American objection at the time was that the buffer state denied its inhabitants the right of self-determination.&lt;ref name=Peace226/&gt;

===Memoranda and compromise===
On 12 September 1919, [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] led a band of disaffected soldiers of the ''[[Granatieri di Sardegna]]'' in a march on Fiume—the so-called ''[[impresa di Fiume]]'' ("Fiume enterprise")—defying the international commission and the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia. Tittoni petitioned the international community, represented by French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] after the American and British heads of government had both gone home, and the Yugoslav government for time to allow Italy to rein in d'Annunzio. In October he proposed that Fiume itself and a coastal strip leading to it should be conceded to Italy, that besides Lošinj and Vis she should possess the islands of [[Cres]] (Cherso) and [[Lastovo]] (Lagosta) and that the city of [[Zadar]] (Zara) should be a free city under Italian protection.&lt;ref&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the departure of the president, [[Frank Polk]] headed up the [[American Commission to Negotiate Peace]] in Paris. He was the driving force behind the memorandum of 9 December, signed by American, British and French delegates. This statement denied the Italians Fiume and most Yugoslav islands and even restricted their mandate over Albania. This memorandum was quickly abandoned by the British and French, whose prime ministers signed a compromise with their Italian counterpart on 14 January 1920 without American participation. Therein it was agreed to concede Fiume and a coastal strip to Italy and in exchange hive off the northern part of Albania and give it to Yugoslavia. To gain the latter's acceptance the signatories of the new compromise threatened to otherwise enforce the Treaty of London.&lt;ref&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

This last compromise aroused the anger of President Wilson, who, in a statement issued 10 February, denounced it as "a positive denial of the principles for which America entered the war".&lt;ref name=Peace229&gt;"The Peace Conference and the Adriatic Question", 229.&lt;/ref&gt; He threatened to withdraw the United States from the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and from the Franco-American agreement of the past June. On 26 February, Clemenceau and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] published a note offering to disavow the January compromise and suggesting that the memorandumg of December be similarly sidelined. They expressed their wish to see Yugoslavia and Italy negotiate directly, and, contrary to Wilson's desire, stood by their intention to enforce the Treaty of London if all else failed.&lt;ref name=Peace229/&gt; It was suggested by some at the time that Lloyd George had personally frustrated the efforts of Wilson by a private agreement with Nitti whereby the latter would support Britain against France on the [[Eastern Question|Eastern (i.e., Russian and Turkish) Question]].

==Ancillary issues==

===Albanian question===
In a presidential note published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 4 March 1920, Woodrow Wilson affirmed that "he cannot approve any plan which assigns to Jugo-Slavia in the Northern district of Albania territorial compensation for what she is deprived of elsewhere," thus forestalling the concession of [[Shkodër]] (Scutari) to Yugoslavia in exchange for Yugoslav recognition of Italian rights to Fiume.&lt;ref&gt;H. Charles Woods, "Some Adriatic Problems", ''Contemporary Review'', 117 (1920), 636.&lt;/ref&gt; In an internal memorandum dated 9 December 1919, the delegates of America, Britain and France recognised the borders of the [[Principality of Albania]] as laid down in 1913. The Yugoslav delegation, in a memo dated 14 January 1920, was in favour of an independent Albania free of foreign influence, but if that should not be feasible the delegates favoured territorial concessions to Yugoslavia in the north. The Allies were already content to recognise an Italian mandate over central Albania and Yugoslav rights of transit through northern Albania, with the attendant right to build and operate railroads on its territory.&lt;ref name=Woods641&gt;Woods, "Some Adriatic Problems", 641.&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian representatives at the [[Congress of Lushnjë]] (27–31 January) voted against any Italian mandate, despite the fact that as a solution it was made to counter Italy's designs on [[Vlorë]] (Valona).&lt;ref name=Woods641/&gt;

===Montenegrin question===
&lt;div style="float: right; margin: 1em; padding: .5em; width: 300px; border: solid 2px gray; background-color: lavender;"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;It was in connection with this problem of Montenegro that my faith in Self-Determination as the remedy for all human ills became clouded with doubts and reservations.&lt;br&gt;—British diplomat [[Harold Nicolson]]&lt;ref&gt;Benson Lee Grayson, "American Diplomacy and the Loss of Montenegrin Independence", ''East European Quarterly'', 19:1 (1985), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After the collapse of [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]]'s army in 1916, the government and the court went into exile in France. The Allied governments gave King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] an income, but by the end of 1916 the British and the French had become convinced that he was responsible for the surrender of his army and were refusing to countenance an independent Montenegro after the war.&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic65&gt;Dragoljub R. Živojinović, "The Nitti Government and the Problem of Montenegro, 1919–1920", ''East European Quarterly'', 6:1 (1972), 65, agrees that Nicholas was responsible for Montenegro's fall.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the war's end the king and his government continued to receive financial support and diplomatic recognition by the Allies—"an inexplicable state of affairs".&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic65/&gt; The Ally with the most interest in Montenegro was Italy, which had trade relations with her and which saw here as a part of the same sphere of influence as Albania. Italian policy favoured the restoration of Nicholas and immediately after the Austro-Hungarian armistice army and navy troops were moved up the Montenegrin coast in order to keep order pending the return of Montenegrin (royal) self-government. The French refused to allow Nicholas to return, and lent their support to the Montenegrin Yugoslavists. The Italians allowed some of Nicholas's supporters to enter Montenegro with them and gave their tacit support to the royalist [[Christmas Uprising]] of December 1918 against the Yugoslavists.&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic66&gt;Živojinović, "The Nitti Government", 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Paris, Baron Sonnino defended Montenegrin independence, argued for her presence at the negotiating table and attacked irregularities in the election of members for the [[Podgorica Assembly]]. Queen [[Elena of Italy]], a daughter of the king of Montenegro, even interceded with Woodrow Wilson on her father's behalf.&lt;ref name=Zivojinovic66/&gt; Although the king was prepared to accept an autonomous Montenegro in a federal Yugoslavia, the Allies believed that any autonomy given to that state would only furnish grounds for continuing Italian intervention. On 7 July 1919, Foreign Minister Tittoni approached Major Johnson, the American geographical expert at Paris, with a proposal: in exchange for sovereignty over the Montenegrin [[Bay of Kotor]] (Boka Kotorska) and [[Mount Lovćen]] Italy would cede all her rights in northern Dalmatia and certain islands. He also conveyed his preference for continued Montenegrin independence, which Johnson (and the British delegate Sir [[Eyre Crowe]]) considered a regional danger, and asked Johnson to forward his proposals to the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, [[Ante Trumbić]]. After getting Secretary Lansing's approval the next day (8 July), Johnson informed a surprised Trumbić. That same evening the Yugoslav delegation unanimously rejected Italy's "big shot" proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Živojinović, "The Nitti Government", 68–69. The term was Tittoni's (12 July).&lt;/ref&gt; After this rebuff, the Italians began negotiating directly with the Yugoslavs through their delegates in the [[Allied Shipping Commission]] in London, although the Montenegrin question was mostly avoided. Despite "the preservation of an independent Montenegro" being "among the major postulates of her foreign policy", in Prime Minister Nitti's words, it was felt that in the long term Yugoslav–Montenegrin unification was inevitable and being alone in pressing for her independence would be unseemly in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Živojinović, "The Nitti Government", 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of 1919 the Bay of Kotor, as well as the towns of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Antivari), [[Budva]] (Budua) and [[Ulcinj]] (Dulcigno) were occupied by army and navy personnel of Britain, France, Italy and Yugoslavia. Clashes were frequent between the last two. The Italians armed and transported the royalist rebels, and spread propaganda about Serb actions in Montenegro. On 20 July 1919 the Yugoslav army attacked some Montenegrin royalists seeking Italian protection in [[Kotor]] and several were killed. The Italian government clamped down on its commander in the Balkans, General Settimio Piacentini. In a secret cable of 29 July Tittoni claimed that the Yugoslavs were willing to recognise an Italian potectorate in Albania if Italy would give up any claim in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;Živojinović, "The Nitti Government", 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In debate in the [[House of Lords]] on 11 March 1920, Foreign Secretary [[Lord Curzon]] affirmed that the Allies did not recognise the legitimacy of the Podgorica Assembly or its deposition of King Nicholas and proclaimed union with Serbia.&lt;ref name=Woods638&gt;Woods, "Some Adriatic Problems", 638.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February, the Leader of the House of Commons, [[Bonar Law]], urged that "the real point at issue is ... whether what is being done, or what will be done, is in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the Montenegrin people."&lt;ref name=Woods638/&gt; In April 1919, the [[John Francis Charles, 7th Count de Salis-Soglio|Count de Salis]], former ambassador to Montenegro (1911–16) at [[Cetinje]], was dispatched there to report on the state of the union with Serbia. The supporters of the Podgorica Assembly argued that Montenegro's adherence to the Allies was nominal at best and that members of the royal family had conspired with the enemy after the defeat of the winter of 1915–16. The supporters of Montenegrin independence argued that the Assembly was a fraud perpetrated by Serbian conquerors, who had endeavoured with French connivance to eliminate Montenegro since its defeat.&lt;ref name=Woods638/&gt;

==Aftermath==

On 8 September 1920, D'Annunzio occupied the city of [[Rijeka]] (Fiume) and proclaimed the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]], but the approval of the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] on 12 November 1920 turned the territory into an independent state, the [[Free State of Fiume]]. Other parts of the Treaty of Rapallo were supposed to solve the dispute between the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). It included Italian annexation of parts of Carniola, several Adriatic islands, and the city of [[Zadar]] (Zara).

'''Aerography''' is the production of [[weather chart]]s. The information is supplied by [[radiosonde]] observations, principally. ''Constant-pressure'' charts are routinely constructed at standard [[air pressure]]s. Standard air pressures are 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, and 200 [[millibar]]s ([[hectopascal]]s) ([[hPa]]) ([[SI]]). Weather charts are sometimes drawn at lower air pressures that occur above 40,000 feet (12&amp;nbsp;km). The lines of equal air pressure are called ''isobars''. ''Isotherms'' are the lines of equal air temperature.

'''''Book of Imaginary Beings''''' was written by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] with Margarita Guerrero and published in 1957 under the original Spanish title ''Manual de zoología fantástica''.&lt;ref name=LCC /&gt; It was expanded in 1967 and 1969 in Spain to the final ''El libro de los seres imaginarios''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The English edition, created in collaboration with translator [[Norman Thomas di Giovanni]], contains descriptions of 120 [[legendary creature|mythical beasts]] from [[folklore]] and literature.

In the preface, Borges states that the book is to be read "as with all miscellanies... not... straight through... Rather we would like the reader to dip into the pages at random, just as one plays with the shifting patterns of a [[kaleidoscope]]"; and that "legends of men taking the shapes of animals" have been omitted.

Although a work of fiction, it is situated in a tradition of Paper Museums, bestiaries, and natural history writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nappi|first1=Carla|title=The Monkey and the Inkpot: Natural History and Its Transformations in Early Modern China|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqeJ2xLk7NUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creatures mentioned ==
; [[Á Bao A Qu]] : A creature that lives on the staircase of the [[Tower of Victory]] in [[Chittorgarh|Chittor]]. It may only move when a traveler climbs the staircase, and it follows close at the person's heels. Its form becomes more complete the closer it gets to the terrace at the tower's top. It can only achieve this ultimate form if the traveler has obtained [[Nirvana]], otherwise it finds itself unable to continue.
; [[Abtu]] and Anet : Two identical [[fish]] that according to Egyptian legend swam in front of the prow of the sun god's ship on the lookout for danger.
; [[Alicanto]] : A [[shaft mining|mine shaft]]-dwelling [[bird]] that feeds upon gold. It is pursued by miners.
; [[Amphisbaena]] : A two-headed snake, with one head being where its tail would normally be. It is venomous and, if chopped in half, its two parts can reunite.
; An Animal Imagined by [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] : A [[kangaroo]]-like animal with a flat, human-like face and a very long tail.
; [[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket|An Animal Imagined by Poe]] : A small, flat animal with pure white fur and bright red claws and teeth. Its head is feline, except for its canine-like ears.
; [[Animals in the Form of Spheres]] : At the time of its writing, some believed that planets and stars were actually living beings, and that the movement of the heavenly bodies was voluntary.

The '''Central European mixed forest''' [[ecoregion]] (WWF ID:PA0412) is a temperate hardwood forest covering much of northeastern Europe, from Germany to Russia.  The area is only about one-third forested, with pressure from human agriculture leaving the rest in a patchwork of traditional pasture, meadows, wetlands.  The ecoregion is in the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]] biome, and the [[Palearctic ecozone]], with a Humid Continental climate.  It covers {{convert|731154|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="gs-1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Central European mixed forest|url=https://www.globalspecies.org/ecoregions/display/PA0412|website=Ecoregions of the World|publisher=GlobalSpecies.org|access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and description ==
The ecoregion covers the formerly-glaciated central plains of Central Europe, from eastern Germany and the shores of the Baltic Sea, through large parts of the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus, Ukraine and a small part of Russia (in [[Bryansk Oblast]]).  The terrain is mostly flat lowlands in the center, hilly moraine-dominated in the north, and uplands to the south along the [[Carpathian mountains]].&lt;ref name="gs-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwf2"&gt;{{cite web|title=PA0412: Central Europe: Austria, Belarus, Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Moldovia, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa0412|publisher=World Wildlife Federation|access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the north is the [[Sarmatic mixed forests]] ecoregion, the forests of which feature more spruce and pine.  To the east is the [[East European forest steppe]], in which the forest stands thin out into grasslands.  To the south is the [[Carpathian montane forests]] ecoregion, featuring mountain pastures and forests of beech, spruce, elm, and dwarf pine.&lt;ref name="gs-1"/&gt;  To the north are the [[Mixed Baltic forests]] of oaks, hornbeam, and linden trees on flat, acidic soils.  To the west is the [[Western European broadleaf forests]] ecoregion, which is now mostly cultivated agricultural land.

== Climate ==
The region has a [[Humid continental climate|Humid continental, cool summer climate]] (Koppen classification [[Humid continental climate#Koppen Dfb|(Dfb)]]).  This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with relatively cool summers.  The "cool summer" designation indicates that at least no month averages above {{convert|22|C|F}}.  The summers become hotter and the winters colder as you move east across the ecoregion, due to the movement towards the center of the continent ("continentality").  The mean January temperature is {{convert|-1|C|F}} in Germany to {{convert|-6|C|F}} in Belarus.  Precipitation average between 500&amp;nbsp;mm and 700&amp;nbsp;mm, mostly falling during the summer growing season.&lt;ref name="wwf2"/&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
Oak forests are characteristic throughout the region, with some pine forests in the north.  Forest cover ranges from 15% in Ukraine to 33% in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="wwf2"/&gt;   The most common tree in the ecoregion, covering half of the forested area, is the [[Scots pine]] (Pinus sylvestris), which has been planted extensively over the past 200 years.&lt;ref name="wwf2"/&gt;  The truly mixed deciduous forests have been replaced mostly by agriculture.  The non-forested areas are largely meadows and pastures dedicated to human agricultural uses.  There are also extensive wetlands in the lowlands.
The wetlands support diverse bird communities, but mammals are heavily pressured by human land use.  Because of the uniformity of the terrain and openness to other regions, there are no endemic species in the ecoregion.  In some countries, 20-30 of the mammal species are threatened.&lt;ref name="wwf2"/&gt;

== Protections ==
The Central European mixed forest has been affected heavily by human pressure.  Most protected areas of nature are small and fragmented.  Some of the large or more representative protected areas in the ecoregion include:
* [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park]] / [[Białowieża National Park]], are the Belarus and Polish sides, respectively of the side of the Białowieża (Area: 1,500 km2 / 150 km2)
* [[Białowieża Forest]] (Belarus, Poland), the last large fragment of [[Old-growth forest]] that used to stretch across the [[European Plain]].  P(Area: 3,086 km2)
* [[Biebrza National Park]], the largest national park in Poland, is 25% forested, the remainder is field, meadow, and marsh.  (Area: 592 km2)
* [[Bryansky Les Nature Reserve]], is an area of old-growth forest on the eastern tip of the ecoregion in Bryansk Oblast, Russia.  (Area: 122 km2)
* [[Lower Polissia National Nature Park]], in northwestern Ukraine, is representative of the [[Polesia]] area of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. (Area: 88 km2)
* [[Middle Elbe Biosphere Reserve]], stretches along the [[Elbe River]] in Saxon-Anhalt, Germany, covering the largest river-meadow complex in Middle Europe.  (Area: 430 km2)
* [[Narew National Park]] (Poland), covers wetlands along the moraines of the [[Narew river]], exemplifying a [[Braided river]].  (Area: 78 km2)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2703">'''Charles Hector Jacquinot''' (1796-1879) was a noted mariner, best known for his role in early French Antarctic surveys.

Jacquinot served as an ensign on the ''Coquille''.  He served with [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]] in the Mediterranean and was junior officer on the expedition led by [[Louis Freycinet]] from 1817-1820, and on [[Isidore Duperrey]]'s expedition of 1822-1825.&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;{{cite book | last = Quanchi | first = Max|authorlink=| year = 2005 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands | publisher = [[The Scarecrow Press]]  | location =  |page=85| isbn = 0810853957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first trip to [[Antarctica]] was made in 1826–29 with d'Urville on the ''Astrolabe'', during which he circumnavigated the globe. For that voyage, Jacquinot was awarded the Cross of Honor.

He was commander of the expedition [[corvette]] ''Zelee'' during Durond d'Urville's second expedition from 1837-1840. The ships departed from [[Toulon]] in September 1837. The mission of the expedition was to survey the [[Straits of Magellan]], then head to the [[Weddell Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Stonehouse|Stonehouse, Bernard]]. ''Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans'', John Wiley and Sons, 2002. {{ISBN|0-471-98665-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dumont d'Urvilles death, he personally edited the five of the 24 volume "Voyage au Pole Sud et dans Oceane" official account of the expedition.&lt;ref name=Quanchi/&gt; but the real writer of the 7 "Histoire du voyage" last volumes was {{Interlanguage link multi|Clément Adrien Vincendon-Dumoulin|fr}}.

[[Mount Jacquinot]] was named for him by d'Urville, who was said to have been his best friend.

Jacquinot eventually was appointed Vice Admiral. He was commander at [[Piraeus, Greece]], during the [[Crimean War]]. He served from 1854 to 1855. He was awarded the Greek [[Order of the Redeemer]].

He died soon after retiring from the Naval General Staff in 1879. He was said to have been modest, no doubt a result of his request to be buried without military honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipy.org/index.php?/ipy/detail/french_polar_explorer_durville/ IPY 2007-2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the brother of [[Honoré Jacquinot]], a surgeon who served as a naturalist on that same voyage and who traveled on that same ship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Elliott Fogg]]. ''A History of Antarctic Science'', Cambridge University

'''Cueva del Milodón Natural Monument''' is a [[Natural Monument]] located in the [[Chile]]an [[Patagonia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chileaustral.com/pnatales/milodon.htm Ciudad de Puerto Natales: Cueva del Milodon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018070905/http://www.chileaustral.com/pnatales/milodon.htm |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Puerto Natales]] and {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Punta Arenas]].

The monument is situated along the flanks of [[Cerro Benitez]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, ''Cueva del Milodon'', Megalithic Portal, 13 April 2008 [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18820]&lt;/ref&gt;  It comprises several [[cave]]s and a rock formation called ''Silla del Diablo'' (Devil's Chair). The monument includes a cave which is notable for the discovery in 1895 of skin, bones and other parts of a giant [[ground sloth]] called ''[[Mylodon|Mylodon darwini]]''.

== Milodón Cave ==
The largest cave in the monument is the {{convert|200|m|ft}} long Milodón Cave. It was discovered in 1895 by [[Hermann Eberhard]], German explorer of Patagonia. He found a large, seemingly fresh piece of skin of an unidentified animal. In 1896 the cave was explored by [[Otto Nordenskjöld]] and later it was recognized that the skin belonged to Mylodon – an extinct animal which died 10,200–13,560 years ago.

In the cave and other caves of the monument have been found remnants of other extinct animals and human remnants.

At the entrance of the monument is a life size replica of the prehistoric ''Mylodon'', which  was a very large herbivore, somewhat resembling a large bear. It became extinct at the end of the [[Pleistocene Epoch]].

== Mylodon remains ==
Investigations determined the survival of the Milodon until about 5,000 years ago and confirmed the existence of other animals, such as the "Dwarf Horse" [[Hippidion]], the [[saber-toothed cat]] [[Smilodon]] and the [[Litopterna|litoptern]] [[Macrauchenia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgochile.com/locations/patagonial/magallanes-xii/milodon-cave Milodón's Cave] in Letsgochile.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human remains ==
Diverse elements of human habitation are found&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18820]&lt;/ref&gt; at Cueva del Milodón including fire-fractured rock, lithic tools and human remains. Human habitation at Cueva del Milodón is dated as early as 6000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Calvin J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8626">The '''Dobson unit''' (DU) is a unit of measurement of the amount of a trace gas in a vertical column through the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It originated, and continues to be primarily used in respect to, atmospheric [[ozone]], whose total column amount, usually termed "total ozone", and sometimes "column abundance", is dominated by the high concentrations of ozone in the [[stratospheric]] [[ozone layer]]. 

The Dobson Unit is defined as the thickness (in units of 10&amp;nbsp;µm) of that layer of pure gas which would be formed by the total column amount at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/dobson.html|title=Ozone Hole Watch: Facts About Dobson Units}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Dobson unit ''in atmospheric chemistry''|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/D01827.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes referred to as a 'milli-atmo-centimeter.' A typical column amount of 300&amp;nbsp;DU of atmospheric ozone therefore would form a 3&amp;nbsp;mm layer of pure gas at the surface of the Earth if its temperature and pressure conformed to STP. 

The Dobson unit is named after [[Gordon Dobson]], a researcher at the [[University of Oxford]] who in the 1920s built the first instrument to measure total ozone from the ground, making use of a double prism [[monochromator]] to measure the differential absorption of different bands of solar ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer. This instrument, called the [[Dobson ozone spectrophotometer]], has formed the backbone of the global network for monitoring atmospheric ozone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Staehelin |first1=Johannes |title=Global atmospheric ozone monitoring |journal=WMO Bulletin |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=1 |url=https://public.wmo.int/en/bulletin/global-atmospheric-ozone-monitoring}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the source of the discovery in 1984 of the Antarctic ozone hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farman |first1=J. C. |last2=Gardiner |first2=B. G. |last3=Shankin |first3=J. D. |year=1985 |title=Large losses of total ozone in Antarctica reveal seasonal ClO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interaction |journal=Nature |volume=315 |issue=16 May 1985 |pages=207–210 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v315/n6016/abs/315207a0.html |doi=10.1038/315207a0|bibcode=1985Natur.315..207F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to SI units==
The Dobson Unit is not part of the SI [[International System of Units]]. To address this shortcoming, a brief study in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reid E. Basher|year= 1982| title=Units For Column Amounts of Ozone and Other Atmospheric Gases |journal= Quart. J. Royal Met. Soc.|volume= 108|issue=456|pages= 460–462|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.49710845611/full|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined a number of alternative SI-based units suitable for column amounts of not only ozone but any gas in any planetary atmosphere and proposed the use of the unit of mole per square metre for all cases. Examples range from Earth’s trace gases at levels of micro moles per square meter to Venus’ carbon dioxide at mega moles per square meter:

* One mmol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; is approximately equivalent to 2,241 DU.
* One DU is equivalent to 0.4462&amp;nbsp;mmol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* One DU is also equivalent to 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per [[square metre]].

Typical values of total ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere are conveniently represented in [[millimole]]s per square metre (mmol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).

A later examination in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S. E. Schwartz |author2=P. Warneck |year=1995 |title=Units for use in atmospheric chemistry |journal=Pure Appl. Chem. |volume=67 |issue=8-9 |pages=1377–1406 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/67/8/1377/ |doi=10.1351/pac199567081377}}&lt;/ref&gt; of units for use in atmospheric chemistry by the Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry, a part of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC), discouraged the use of special names and symbols for units that are not part of the SI and are not products of powers of SI base units. Although it overlooked the 1982 article it concurred with the view that the Dobson unit should eventually be replaced by an appropriate SI unit and that the unit mmol m-2 was the most convenient and least cumbersome option. It expressed the hope that this unit would eventually supplant the Dobson Unit. However, as of March 2017, there is little evidence that this has occurred; for example the Dobson unit is still used by NASA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov|website=Ozone Hole Watch|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://woudc.org/home.php |website=WOUDC |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their reporting of total ozone amount.

==Ozone==
NASA uses a baseline value of 220 DU for ozone. This was chosen as the starting point for observations of the Antarctic [[ozone hole]], since values of less than 220 Dobson units were not found before 1979. Also, from direct measurements over Antarctica, a column ozone level of less than 220 Dobson units is a result of the ozone loss from [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ozone Hole Watch |url=http://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sulfur dioxide==
In addition, Dobson units are often used to describe total column densities of [[sulfur dioxide]], which occurs in the atmosphere in small amounts due to the combustion of fossil fuels, from biological processes releasing [[dimethyl sulfide]], or by natural combustion such as forest fires.  Large amounts of sulfur dioxide may be released into the atmosphere as well by volcanic eruptions. The Dobson unit is used to describe total column amounts of sulfur dioxide because it appeared in the early days of ozone remote sensing on ultraviolet satellite instruments (such as [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer|TOMS]]).

==Derivation==

The Dobson Unit arises from the ideal gas law. From the real gas law:

&lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;

where P and V are pressure and volume, respectively, and n, R and T are the number of moles of gas, the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), and T is temperature in Kelvin (K).

The number density of air is the number of molecules or atoms per unit volume:

&lt;math&gt;n_{\mathrm{air}} = \frac{A_{av} n}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

and when plugged into the real gas law, the number density of air is found by using pressure, temperature and the real gas constant.

&lt;math&gt;n_{\mathrm{air}} = \frac{A_{av} P}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;

The number density (molecules/volume) of air at standard temperature and pressure (T = 273K and P = 101325 Pa) is, by using this equation:

&lt;math&gt;n_{\mathrm{air}} = \frac{A_{av} P}{RT} = \frac{(6.02\times 10^{23}\,\frac {\mathrm{molecules}}{\mathrm{mol}}) \cdot (101325\, \mathrm{Pa})}{8.314 \frac{J}{\mathrm{mol} \,\mathrm{K}}\cdot 273\,\mathrm{K}}&lt;/math&gt;

With some unit conversions of Joules to Pascals, the equation for molecules/volume is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{(6.02\times 10^{23}\,  \frac{\mathrm{molecules}}{\mathrm{mol}}) \cdot (101325\,\mathrm{Pa})}{8.314\, \frac{\mathrm{Pa} \, \mathrm{m}^{3}}{\mathrm{mol} \, \mathrm{K}}\cdot 273 K} = 2.69 \times 10^{25} \mathrm{molecules} \, \mathrm{m}^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;

A Dobson Unit is the total amount of a trace gas per unit area. In atmospheric sciences, this is referred to as a column density. How, though, do we go from units of molecules per '''cubic''' meter, a volume, to molecules per '''square centimeter''', an area? This must be done by integration. To get a column density, we must integrate the total column over a height. Per the definition of Dobson Units, we see that 1 DU = 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm of trace gas when compressed down to sea level at standard temperature and pressure. So if we integrate our number density of air from 0 to 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm, we find the number density which is equal to 1&amp;nbsp;DU:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{0\, \mathrm{mm}}^{0.01\, \mathrm{mm}} (2.69 \times 10^{25}\,\text{molecules} \, \mathrm{m}^{-3}) \,\mathrm{d}x = 2.69 \times 10^{25} \,\text{molecules} \, \mathrm{m}^{-3} \cdot 0.01\,\mathrm{mm} - 2.69 \times 10^{25} \,\text{molecules} \, \mathrm{m}^{-3} \cdot 0\,\mathrm{mm} &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;= 2.69 \times 10^{25} \,\text{molecules} \, \mathrm{m}^{-3} \cdot 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{m} = 2.69 \times 10^{20}\, \text{molecules} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

And thus we come up with the value of 1 DU, which is 2.69×10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per meter squared.

In [[astronomy]] and [[atomic physics]], '''doubly ionized oxygen''' is the [[ion]] [[oxygen|O]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (also known as '''O III''' in [[spectroscopic notation]]). Its emission [[forbidden line]]s in the [[visible spectrum]], primarily at the wavelength 500.7&amp;nbsp;nm, and secondarily at 495.9&amp;nbsp;nm, are known in [[astronomical spectroscopy]] as '''[O III]'''. Before spectra of oxygen ions became known, these lines once led to a spurious identification of the substance as a new [[chemical element]]. Concentrated levels of O III are found in [[diffuse nebula|diffuse]] and [[planetary nebula|planetary]] nebulae.  Consequently, narrow [[Dichroic filter|band-pass filter]]s that isolate the 501&amp;nbsp;nm and 496&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths of light, that correspond to [[green]]-[[turquoise (color)|turquoise]]-[[cyan]] [[spectral colors]], are useful in observing these objects, causing them to appear at higher contrast against the filtered and consequently blacker background of space (and possibly [[light pollution|light-polluted]] terrestrial atmosphere) where the frequencies of [O III] are much less pronounced.

These [[emission line]]s were first discovered in the spectra of planetary nebulae in the 1860s.  At that time, they were thought to be due to a new element which was named ''[[nebulium]]''.  In 1927, [[Ira Sprague Bowen]] came up with the current explanation of them being due to doubly ionized oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/120473a0 | title = The Origin of the Nebulium Spectrum | year = 1927 | author = Bowen, I.

Permitted lines of O III lie in the Middle [[Ultraviolet]] band and are hence inaccessible to terrestrial astronomy.

{{Weather}}

The '''dry season''' is a yearly period of low rainfall, especially in the [[tropics]]. The weather in the tropics is dominated by the [[tropical rain belt]], which moves from the northern to the southern tropics and back over the course of the year. The tropical rain belt lies in the southern hemisphere roughly from October to March; during that time the northern tropics have a dry season with sparser [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and days are typically sunny throughout. From April to September, the rain belt lies in the northern hemisphere, and the southern tropics have their dry season. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], for [[tropical climate]]s, a dry season month is defined as a month when average precipitation is below {{convert|60|mm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf | title=Updated world Köppen-Geiger climate classification map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dry season has low humidity, and some watering holes and rivers dry up. This lack of water (and hence of food) may force many grazing animals to migrate to more fertile spots. Examples of such animals are [[zebra]]s, [[elephant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=465016&amp;in_page_id=1811 | title=It's dry season and elephants are desperately seeking water - but poachers lie in wait | author=TONY RENNELL | publisher=Daily Mail | location=London | date=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wildebeest]]. Because of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://burarra.questacon.edu.au/pages/seasons.html | title=Wet &amp; Dry Seasons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data shows that in Africa the start of the dry season coincides with a rise in the cases of [[measles]]—which researchers believe might be attributed to the higher concentration of people in the dry season, as agricultural operations are all but impossible without irrigation. During this time, some farmers move into cities, creating hubs of higher population density, and allowing the disease to spread more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080206131643.htm | title=Dry Season Brings On Measles In Sub-Saharan Africa | publisher=ScienceDaily | date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rain belt reaches roughly as far north as the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and as far south as the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. Near these latitudes, there is one wet season and one dry season annually. At the [[equator]] there are two wet and two dry seasons, as the rain belt passes over twice a year, once moving north and once moving south. Between the tropics and the equator, locations may experience a short wet and a long wet season; and a short dry and a long dry season. Local geography may substantially modify these climate patterns, however.

New data shows that in the seasonal parts of the [[South America]]n [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon forest]], foliage growth and coverage varies between the dry and wet seasons—with about 25% more leaves and faster growth in the dry season. Researchers believe that the Amazon itself has an effect in bringing{{clarify|date=August 2015}} the onset of the wet season: by growing more foliage, it evaporates more water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0312-amazon.html | title=Amazon rainforest does have rainy and dry seasons | publisher=mongabay.com | date=March 12, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604094546/http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0312-amazon.html | archivedate=June 4, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this growth appears only in the undisturbed parts of the Amazon basin, where researchers believe roots can reach deeper and gather more rainwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/uoa-arg031506.php | title=Amazon rainforest greens up in the dry season}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that [[ozone]] levels are much higher in the dry than in the wet season in the Amazon basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1990/89JD02892.shtml | title=Ozone measurements in Amazonia: Dry season versus wet season | author=V.

'''Edna Margaret Walling''' (4 December 1896 – 8 August 1973) was one of Australia's most influential [[Landscape architecture|landscape designers]].

==Biography==
Walling was born in [[Yorkshire]] and grew up in the village of [[Bickleigh,Mid Devon|Bickleigh]] in Devon, England. When she was fourteen years old she emigrated to New Zealand and three years later moved with her family to [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], Australia.

Walling studied horticulture at [[Burnley College (Australia)|Burnley College]] and after some years as a jobbing gardener she commenced her own landscape design practice in the 1920s,&lt;ref name=gardaus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s2355524.htm |title=Fact Sheet: Bickleigh Vale |accessdate=7 September 2008 |work=Gardening Australia |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "went on to design some significant [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] gardens".&lt;ref name=Vale&gt;{{cite web|last=Vale|first=Anne|title=Walling, Edna|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0038b.htm|publisher=Australian Women's Archives Project 2014|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Walling began to develop a village at [[Mooroolbark, Victoria|Mooroolbark]] on the outskirts of Melbourne called Bickleigh Vale. With its unique collection of charming houses and gardens Bickleigh Vale is one of her most acclaimed achievements.&lt;ref name="gardaus" /&gt; It was designed to be 'the nucleus of an English village'&lt;ref name="ArgusJun35"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12251183 |title=OLD HOME BURNT. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=22 June 1935 |accessdate=30 August 2013 |page=26 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she built the first cottage, named after the village of [[Sonning]] on the [[River Thames]] in England, as her own home. She sold subdivisions of the land only to people who were prepared to accept designs for cottage and garden prepared by her. 

In 1935 [[Ellis Stones]] built a wall for her.  Recognizing his ability—which she called 'a rare thing this gift for placing stones' – she suggested that he work for her. She gave him a free hand to create walls, outcrops, pools and paths in her gardens at some of Melbourne's finest homes which assisted in establishing a local garden tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Australian Architecture Since 1960|last = Taylor|first = Jennifer|publisher = Australian Institute of Architects|year = 1990|isbn = 0455203512|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their best collaboration was seen in a free-form swimming pool and outcrop, built in 1939-40 for Edith Hughes-Jones at [[Olinda, Victoria]]

In 1926, Walling began contributing regularly to ''[[Australian Home Beautiful]]''. Her design practice grew and she worked across Australia, in Perth, Hobart, Sydney, and [[Buderim]] in Queensland. Her Victorian commissions included designing the lily pond for Coombe Cottage, [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba's]] residence in [[Coldstream, Victoria|Coldstream]], in the [[Yarra Valley]] Ranges; Durrol for Mrs Stanley Allen at [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Mount Macedon]]; Rock Lodge garden for Mrs PF O'Collins in Frankston; Cruden Farm garden for Mrs Keith Murdoch (later [[Elisabeth Murdoch (senior)|Dame Elisabeth]]), [[Langwarrin, Victoria|Langwarrin]] (Gardening Australia website: Cruden Farm). One of her most intact NSW commissions is Markdale, Binda ([http://www.markdale.com]). Her plans from the 1920s and 1930s show a strong architectural framework with 'low stone walls, wide pergolas and paths – always softened with a mantle of greenery'.&lt;ref name="Dixon, T. 2002, pp. 625-26"&gt;Dixon, T., 'Walling, Edna Margaret', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), ''Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens'', South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 625–26.&lt;/ref&gt; She later drew inspiration from the Australian bush, creating a more naturalistic style with boulders, rocky outcrops and indigenous plants.&lt;ref name="Dixon, T. 2002, pp. 625-26"/&gt; In small suburban gardens, Walling created garden 'rooms' to make the garden appear far larger than it actually was.&lt;ref name="Dixon, T. 2002, pp. 625-26"/&gt;

Her designs were heavily influenced by her experience of the Devon countryside as a child and designers such as [[Gertrude Jekyll]]. The houses of American architect [[Royal Barry Wills]] (renowned for his [[Cape Cod]] designs) and [[Lewis Mumford]]’s books, ''The Culture of Cities'' and ''The Image of the City'', also provided early inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watts |first1=Peter |title=Edna Walling and her gardens (2nd edn) |date=1991 |publisher=Florilegium |isbn=0646044664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the author of several books on landscape design:
*''Gardens in Australia'' 1943,
*''Cottage and Garden in Australia'' 1947 and
*''A Gardener's Log 1948''

In the 1950s, Walling became interested in the conservation of roadside vegetation and was a prolific writer in the press on the subject as well as her 1952 book ''The Australian Roadside''. According to Trisha Dixon, Walling was an important influence on Australian gardening, steering tastes away from an Anglo-centric heritage towards a respect for the Australian climate and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, T., 'Still on the trail of Edna Walling', ''Australian Garden History'', 22 (1), 2010, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, she moved from Melbourne to Bendles at [[Buderim]] in Queensland, where she had hoped to further develop the village concept but it did not progress.&lt;ref name="Dixon, T. 2002, pp. 625-26"/&gt; Despite her ill-health during her last years at Bendle, Walling continued to write prolifically, rewriting manuscripts, corresponding to newspapers on environmental issues, and trying to republish her books.&lt;ref name="Dixon, T. 2002, pp. 625-26"/&gt; About a quarter of Walling's designs survive and these are held in the State Library of Victoria and in private collections in Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria.&lt;ref name="Dixon, T. 2002, pp. 625-26"/&gt;

In [[electrical engineering]], '''ground''' or '''earth''' is the reference point in an [[electrical circuit]] from which voltages are measured, a common return path for [[electric current]], or a direct physical connection to the [[Soil|earth]].

Electrical circuits may be connected to ground (earth) for several reasons.  In [[mains (electric power)|mains]] powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground so that if, due to any fault conditions, a "line" supply voltage connection occurs to any such conductive parts, the current flow will then be such that any protective equipment installed for either overload or "leakage" protection will operate and disconnect the line voltage.  This is done to prevent harm resulting to the user from coming in contact with any such dangerous voltage in a situation where the user may, at the same time, also come in contact with an object at ground/earth potential.  In electric power distribution systems, a protective earth (PE) conductor is an essential part of the safety provided by the [[earthing system]].

Connection to ground also limits the build-up of [[static electricity]] when handling flammable products or [[electrostatic-sensitive device]]s. In some [[telegraph]] and [[power transmission]] circuits, the earth itself can be used as one [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see [[single-wire earth return]]).

For measurement purposes, the Earth serves as a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured. An electrical ground system should have an appropriate current-carrying capability to serve as an adequate zero-voltage reference level. In [[electronic circuit]] theory, a "ground" is usually idealized as an infinite [[Current sources and sinks|source or sink]] for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real ground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. [[Stray voltage]]s or [[earth potential rise]] effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric shock hazard.

The use of the term ground (or earth) is so common in electrical and electronics applications that circuits in [[Portable electronics|portable electronic devices]] such as [[cell phone]]s and [[Portable media player|media player]]s as well as circuits in [[vehicles]] may be spoken of as having a "ground" connection without any actual connection to the Earth, despite "common" being a more appropriate term for such a connection. This is usually a large conductor attached to one side of the [[power supply]] (such as the "[[ground plane]]" on a [[printed circuit board]]) which serves as the common return path for current from many different components in the circuit.

== History ==
Long-distance electromagnetic [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] systems from 1820 onwards&lt;ref name="Harvard1"&gt;
An 'electrochemical telegraph' created by  physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von Sömmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by [[Països Catalans|Catalan]] [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]], both employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message. —Jones, R. Victor [http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/images/history/von_Soem.html Samuel Thomas von Sömmering's "Space Multiplexed" Electrochemical Telegraph (1808-10)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011042334/http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jones/cscie129/images/history/von_Soem.html |date=2012-10-11 }}, Harvard University website.

Retrieved 2009-05-01&lt;/ref&gt; used two or more wires to carry the signal and return currents. It was then discovered, probably by the German scientist [[Carl August Steinheil]] in 1836–1837,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm|title=The Electromagnetic Telegraph|author=|date=|website=du.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804113714/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tel/morse/morse.htm|archivedate=2007-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the ground could be used as the return path to complete the circuit, making the return wire unnecessary. However, there were problems with this system, exemplified by the transcontinental telegraph line constructed in 1861 by the Western Union Company between [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], and [[Sacramento, California]]. During dry weather, the ground connection often developed a high resistance, requiring water to be poured on the [[ground rod]] to enable the telegraph to work or phones to ring.

Later, when telephony began to replace telegraphy, it was found that the currents in the earth induced by power systems, electrical railways, other telephone and telegraph circuits, and natural sources including lightning caused unacceptable interference to the audio signals, and the two-wire or 'metallic circuit' system was reintroduced around 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, Herbert N., ''The History of the Telephone'', public domain copy at manybooks.net: '"At last", said the delighted manager [J. J. Carty, Boston, Mass.], "we have a perfectly quiet line."'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio communications ==

An [[electrical connection]] to earth can be used as a reference potential for [[radio frequency]] signals for certain kinds of [[Monopole antenna|antennas]]. The part directly in contact with the earth - the "earth electrode" - can be as simple as a metal rod or stake driven into the earth, or a connection to buried metal water piping (the pipe must be conductive). Because high frequency signals can flow to earth due to capacitative effects, [[capacitance]] to ground is an important factor in effectiveness of signal grounds. Because of this, a complex system of buried rods and wires can be effective. An ideal signal ground maintains a fixed potential (zero) regardless of how much [[electric current]] flows into ground or out of ground. Low [[electrical impedance|impedance]] at the signal frequency of the electrode-to-earth connection determines its quality, and that quality is improved by increasing the surface area of the electrode in contact with the earth, increasing the depth to which it is driven, using several connected ground rods, increasing the moisture content of the soil, improving the conductive mineral content of the soil, and increasing the land area covered by the ground system.

Some types of transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] systems in the VLF, LF, MF and lower SW range must have a good ground to operate efficiently. For example, a vertical [[monopole antenna]] requires a [[ground plane]] that often consists of an interconnected network of wires running radially away from the base of the antenna for a distance about equal to the height of the antenna. Sometimes a [[Counterpoise (ground system)|counterpoise]] is used as a ground plane, supported above the ground.

== Building wiring installations ==
{{see also|Earthing system}}
Electrical power distribution systems are often connected to ground to limit the voltage that can appear on distribution circuits. A distribution system insulated from ground may attain a high potential due to transient voltages caused by arcing, static electricity, or accidental contact with higher potential circuits. A ground connection of the system dissipates such potentials and limits the rise in voltage of the grounded system.

In a [[mains electricity]] (AC power) wiring installation, the term ''[[Ground and neutral|ground]] conductor'' typically refers to three different conductors or conductor systems as listed below.

''Equipment earthing conductors'' provide an electrical connection between the physical ground (earth) and the grounding/bonding system, which connects (bonds) the normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment. According to the U.S. [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC), the reason for doing this is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning, line surges, and contact with higher voltage lines. 

''Equipment bonding conductors'' provide a low impedance path between normally non-current-carrying metallic parts of equipment and one of the conductors of that electrical system's source. If any exposed metal part should become energized (fault), such as by a frayed or damaged conductor, it creates a short circuit, causing the overprotection device (circuit breaker or fuse) to open, clearing (disconnecting) the fault. It is important to note this action occurs regardless of whether there is a connection to the physical ground (earth); the earth itself has no role in this fault-clearing process&lt;ref name=Whitlock&gt;[http://www.jensen-transformers.com/an/generic%20seminar.pdf Jensen Transformers. Bill Whitlock, 2005. ''Understanding, Finding, &amp; Eliminating Ground Loops In Audio &amp; Video Systems''.] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nhOeXhRQ?url=http://www.jensen-transformers.com/an/generic%20seminar.pdf |date=2010-02-21 }} Retrieved February 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; since current must return to its source; however, the sources are very frequently connected to the physical ground (earth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/details.aspx?ProductID=365692 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205002034/http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/details.aspx?ProductID=365692 |archivedate=2014-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]]). By bonding (interconnecting) all exposed non-current carrying metal objects together and to other metallic objects such as pipes or structural steel, they should remain near the same voltage potential, thus reducing the chance of a shock. This is especially important in bathrooms where one may be in contact with several different metallic systems such as supply and drain pipes and appliance frames. When a system needs to be connected to the physical ground (earth), the equipment bonding conductor also becomes the equipment earthing conductor (see above).

[[File:Metal water pipe as grounding electrode.jpg|thumb|upright|Metal water pipe used as grounding electrode]]
A '''{{visible anchor|grounding electrode conductor}}''' ('''GEC''') is used to connect the system grounded ("neutral") conductor, or the equipment to a grounding electrode, or a point on the grounding electrode system. This is called "system grounding" and most electrical systems are required to be grounded. The U.S. NEC and the UK's [[BS 7671]] list systems that are required to be grounded. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mikeholt.com/mojonewsarchive/GB-HTML/HTML/NECArticle250Sections250.20-250.34~20020124.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226194025/http://www.mikeholt.com/mojonewsarchive/GB-HTML/HTML/NECArticle250Sections250.20-250.34~20020124.htm |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }} Retrieved December 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NEC, the purpose of connecting an electrical system to the physical ground (earth) is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning events and contact with higher voltage lines, and also for voltage stabilization. In the past, [[water supply]] pipes were used as grounding electrodes, but due to the increased use of plastic pipes, which are poor conductors, the use of an actual grounding electrode is required. This type of ground applies to radio antennas and to lightning protection systems.

Permanently installed electrical equipment, unless not required to, has permanently connected grounding conductors. Portable electrical devices with metal cases may have them connected to earth ground by a pin on the attachment plug (see [[Domestic AC power plugs and sockets]]). The size of power grounding conductors is usually regulated by local or national wiring regulations.

=== Earthing systems ===
{{main|Earthing system}}
In electricity supply systems, an earthing (grounding) system defines the electrical potential of the conductors relative to that of the Earth's conductive surface. The choice of earthing system has implications for the safety and electromagnetic compatibility of the power supply. Regulations for earthing systems vary considerably between different countries.

A functional earth connection serves more than protecting against electrical shock, as such a connection may carry current during the normal operation of a device. Such devices include surge suppression, electromagnetic-compatibility filters, some types of antennas, and various measurement instruments. Generally the protective earth system is also used as a functional earth, though this requires care.

=== Impedance grounding ===

Distribution power systems may be solidly grounded, with one circuit conductor directly connected to an earth grounding electrode system. Alternatively, some amount of [[electrical impedance]] may be connected between the distribution system and ground, to limit the current that can flow to earth. The impedance may be a resistor, or an inductor (coil). In a high-impedance grounded system, the fault current is limited to a few amperes (exact values depend on the voltage class of the system); a low-impedance grounded system will permit several hundred amperes to flow on a fault. A large solidly grounded distribution system may have thousands of amperes of ground fault current.

In a polyphase AC system, an artificial neutral grounding system may be used. Although no phase conductor is directly connected to ground, a specially constructed transformer (a [[Zigzag transformer|"zig zag" transformer]]) blocks the power frequency current from flowing to earth, but allows any leakage or transient current to flow to ground.

Low-resistance grounding systems use a neutral grounding resistor (NGR) to limit the fault current to 25&amp;nbsp;A or greater. Low resistance grounding systems will have a time rating (say, 10 seconds) that indicates how long the resistor can carry the fault current before overheating. A ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit before overheating of the resistor occurs.

High-resistance grounding (HRG) systems use an NGR to limit the fault current to 25&amp;nbsp;A or less. They have a continuous rating, and are designed to operate with a single-ground fault. This means that the system will not immediately trip on the first ground fault. If a second ground fault occurs, a ground fault protection relay must trip the breaker to protect the circuit. On an HRG system, a sensing resistor is used to continuously monitor system continuity. If an open-circuit is detected (e.g., due to a broken weld on the NGR), the monitoring device will sense voltage through the sensing resistor and trip the breaker. Without a sensing resistor, the system could continue to operate without ground protection (since an open circuit condition would mask the ground fault) and transient overvoltages could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Beltz, R.; Cutler-Hammer, Atlanta, Georgia; Peacock, I.; Vilcheck, W. (2000). "Application Considerations for High Resistance Ground Retrofits in Pulp and Paper Mills". Pulp and Paper Industry Technical Conference, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ungrounded systems===
Where the danger of electric shock is high, special ungrounded power systems may be used to minimize possible leakage current to ground. Examples of such installations include patient care areas in hospitals, where medical equipment is directly connected to a patient and must not permit any power-line current to pass into the patient's body. Medical systems include monitoring devices to warn of any increase of leakage current. On wet construction sites or in shipyards, isolation transformers may be provided so that a fault in a power tool or its cable does not expose users to shock hazard.

Circuits used to feed sensitive audio/video production equipment or measurement instruments may be fed from an isolated ungrounded [[Split-phase electric power#Technical power (balanced power)|technical power]] system to limit the injection of noise from the power system.

== Power transmission ==
In [[single-wire earth return]] (SWER) AC electrical distribution systems, costs are saved by using just a single high voltage conductor for the [[electrical power grid|power grid]], while routing the AC return current through the earth. This system is mostly used in rural areas where large earth currents will not otherwise cause hazards.

Some [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) power transmission systems use the ground as second conductor. This is especially common in schemes with submarine cables, as sea water is a good conductor. Buried grounding electrodes are used to make the connection to the earth. The site of these electrodes must be chosen carefully to prevent electrochemical corrosion on underground structures.

A particular concern in design of [[electrical substation]]s is [[earth potential rise]]. When very large fault currents are injected into the earth, the area around the point of injection may rise to a high potential with respect to distant points. This is due to the limited finite conductivity of the layers of soil in the earth. The gradient of the voltage (changing voltage within a distance) may be so high that two points on the ground may be at significantly different potentials, creating a hazard to anyone standing on the ground in the area. Pipes, rails, or communication wires entering a substation may see different ground potentials inside and outside the substation, creating a dangerous touch voltage.

{{float end|caption=Ground symbols&lt;ref&gt;Electrical and electronics diagrams, IEEE Std 315-1975, Section 3.9: Circuit return.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Signal grounds serve as return paths for signals and power (at [[extra low voltage]]s, less than about 50 V) within equipment, and on the signal interconnections between equipment. Many electronic designs feature a single return that acts as a reference for all signals. Power and signal grounds often get connected, usually through the metal case of the equipment. Designers of [[printed circuit board]]s must take care in the layout of electronic systems so that high-power or rapidly switching currents in one part of a system do not inject noise into low-level sensitive parts of a system due to some common impedance in the grounding traces of the layout.

=== Circuit ground versus earth ===
[[Voltage]] is measured on an [[Level of measurement#Interval scale|interval scale]], which means that only differences can be measured. To measure the voltage of a single point, a reference point must be selected to measure against. This common reference point is called "ground" and considered to have zero voltage. This [[Single-ended signaling|signal ground]] may or may not be connected to a [[Ground (power)|power ground]]. A system where the system ground is not connected to another circuit or to earth (though there may still be AC coupling) is often referred to as a [[floating ground]] or [[double-insulated]].

=== Functional grounds ===
Some devices require a connection to the mass of earth to function correctly, as distinct from any purely protective role. Such a connection is known as a functional earth- for example some long wavelength antenna structures require a functional earth connection, which generally should not be indiscriminately connected to the supply protective earth, as the introduction of transmitted radio frequencies into the electrical distribution network is both illegal and potentially dangerous. Because of this separation, a purely functional ground should not normally be relied upon to perform a protective function.
To avoid accidents, such functional grounds are normally wired in white or cream cable, and not green or green/yellow.

=== Separating low signal ground from a noisy ground ===

In [[television]] stations, [[recording studios]], and other installations where signal quality is critical, a special signal ground known as a "technical ground" (or "technical earth", "special earth", and "audio earth") is often installed, to prevent [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]]s. This is basically the same thing as an AC power ground, but no general appliance ground wires are allowed any connection to it, as they may carry electrical interference. For example, only audio equipment is connected to the technical ground in a recording studio.&lt;ref&gt;Swallow D 2011, Live Audio, The Art of Mixing, Chap 4. Power and Electricity, pp. 35-39&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the studio's metal equipment racks are all joined together with heavy copper cables (or flattened copper tubing or [[busbar]]s) and similar connections are made to the technical ground. Great care is taken that no general chassis grounded appliances are placed on the racks, as a single AC ground connection to the technical ground will destroy its effectiveness. For particularly demanding applications, the main technical ground may consist of a heavy copper pipe, if necessary fitted by drilling through several concrete floors, such that all technical grounds may be connected by the shortest possible path to a grounding rod in the basement.

== Lightning protection systems ==
[[Image:Busbars.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Busbar]]s are used for ground conductors in high-current circuits.]]
[[Lightning rod|Lightning protection systems]] are designed to mitigate the effects of lightning through connection to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess heat. Since lightning strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for lightning protection tend to use short straight runs of conductors to reduce the self-[[inductance]] and [[skin effect]].

== Bonding ==
{{Main|Electrical bonding}}

Strictly speaking, the terms ''grounding'' or ''earthing'' are meant to refer to an electrical connection to ground/earth. [[Electrical bonding|Bonding]] is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting metallic items not designed to carry electricity. This brings all the bonded items to the same electrical potential as a protection from electrical shock. The bonded items can then be connected to ground to bring them to earth potential.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 1100-1992, ''IEEE Recommended Practice for Powering and Grounding Sensitive Electronic Equipment'', Chapter 2: Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ground (earth) mat ==
{{Main|Ground mat}}

In an [[electrical substation]] a ground (earth) mat is a mesh of conductive material installed at places where a person would stand to operate a switch or other apparatus; it is bonded to the local supporting metal structure and to the handle of the switchgear, so that the operator will not be exposed to a high differential voltage due to a fault in the substation.

In the vicinity of electrostatic sensitive devices, a ground (earth) mat or grounding (earthing) mat is used to ground static electricity generated by people and moving equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bennettnbennett.com/showResource.cfm?id=22| title=ESD Prevention Measures Part 2: Using Anti Static Mats by Doug Wagner| publisher=Bennett &amp; Bennett| accessdate=May 15, 2014| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603162559/http://www.bennettnbennett.com/showResource.cfm?id=22| archivedate=June 3, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types used in static control: Static Dissipative Mats, and Conductive Mats.

A static dissipative mat that rests on a conductive surface (commonly the case in military facilities) are typically made of 3 layers (3-ply) with static dissipative vinyl layers surrounding a conductive substrate which is electrically attached to ground (earth). For commercial uses, static dissipative rubber mats are traditionally used that are made of 2 layers (2-ply) with a tough solder resistant top static dissipative layer that makes them last longer than the vinyl mats, and a [[conductive rubber]] bottom. Conductive mats are made of carbon and used only on floors for the purpose of drawing static electricity to ground as quickly as possible. Normally conductive mats are made with cushioning for standing and are referred to as "anti-fatigue" mats.

[[File:3 ply Diagram.jpg|thumb|3 ply static dissipative vinyl grounding mat shown at macro scale]]

For a static dissipative mat to be reliably grounded it must be attached to a path to ground. Normally, both the mat and the wrist strap are connected to ground by using a common point ground system (CPGS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bennettnbennett.com/productdetail.cfm?prod=18&amp;cat=24| title=Wrist Strap Shown with mat and Common Point Ground System (CPGS)| publisher=Bennett &amp; Bennett| accessdate=April 23, 2014| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424211506/http://www.bennettnbennett.com/productdetail.cfm?prod=18&amp;cat=24| archivedate=April 24, 2014| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In computer repair shops and electronics manufacturing workers must be grounded before working on devices sensitive to voltages capable of being generated by humans. For that reason static dissipative mats can be and are also used on production assembly floors as "floor runner" along the assembly line to draw static generated by people walking up and down.

== Isolation ==
{{See also|Galvanic isolation}}

Isolation is a mechanism that defeats grounding. It is frequently used with low-power consumer devices, and when electronics engineers, hobbyists, or repairmen are working on circuits that would normally be operated using the power line voltage. Isolation can be accomplished by simply placing a "1:1 wire ratio" transformer with an equal number of turns between the device and the regular power service, but applies to any type of transformer using two or more coils electrically insulated from each other.

For an isolated device, touching a single powered conductor does not cause a severe shock, because there is no path back to the other conductor through the ground. However, shocks and electrocution may still occur if both poles of the transformer are contacted by bare skin. Previously it was suggested that repairmen "work with one hand behind their back" to avoid touching two parts of the device under test at the same time, thereby preventing a circuit from crossing through the chest and interrupting cardiac rhythms/ causing [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mathematrix.xyz/qna/?qa=405/what-actually-happens-during-earthing-of-charge&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally every AC power line transformer acts as an isolation transformer, and every step up or down has the potential to form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from blowing fuses when shorted to their ground conductor. The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, on both sides of the input and output transformer coils. Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.

In the past, grounded appliances have been designed with internal isolation to a degree that allowed the simple disconnection of ground by [[cheater plug]]s without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since the safety of the resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its power transformer). Modern appliances however often include [[power entry module]]s which are designed with deliberate capacitive coupling between the AC power lines and chassis, to suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power lines to ground. If the ground is disconnected by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9852716-1.html|title=Dell laptops in electric-shock shocker|author=|date=17 January 2008|website=cnet.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208184052/http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9852716-1.html|archivedate=8 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slpower.com/reference/An113%20Leakage%20Current.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501203234/http://www.slpower.com/reference/An113%20Leakage%20Current.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Appliance classes|Class II]] appliances and power supplies (such as cell phone chargers) do not provide any ground connection, and are designed to isolate the output from input. Safety is ensured by double-insulation, so that two failures of insulation are required to cause a shock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1766">'''Hack's law''' is an [[empirical relationship]] between the length of [[streams]] and the area of their [[Drainage basin|basins]]. If ''L'' is the length of the longest stream in a basin, and ''A'' is the area of the basin, then Hack's law may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;L = C A^h\ &lt;/math&gt;

for some constant ''C'' where the [[exponent]] ''h'' is slightly less than 0.6 in most basins. ''h'' varies slightly from region to region and slightly decreases for larger basins (&gt;8,000&amp;nbsp;mi², or 20,720&amp;nbsp;km²). A theoretical value ''h'' = 4/7 ≈ 0.571 for the exponent has been derived (Birnir, 2008). In addition to the catchment-scales, Hack's law was observed on unchanneled small-scale surfaces when the morphology measured at high resolutions (Cheraghi et al., 2018).

The law is named after American geomorphologist [[John Tilton Hack]].

'''High-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions''' are regions of the ocean where the abundance of [[phytoplankton]] is low and fairly constant despite the availability of [[Macronutrient (ecology)|macronutrients]]. Phytoplankton rely on a suite of nutrients for cellular function. Macronutrients (e.g., [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]], [[silicic acid]]) are generally available in higher quantities in surface ocean waters, and are the typical components of common garden fertilizers. [[Micronutrient]]s (e.g., [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[cobalt]]) are generally available in lower quantities and include [[trace metal]]s. Macronutrients are typically available in [[Molar concentration|millimolar concentrations,]] while micronutrients are generally available in micro- to nanomolar concentrations. In general, nitrogen tends to be a [[Limiting factor|limiting ocean nutrient]], but in HNLC regions it is never significantly depleted.&lt;ref name="lalli2"&gt;Lalli, C.M.;  Parsons, T.R.

The discovery of HNLC regions has fostered scientific debate about the ethics and efficacy of iron fertilization experiments which attempt to draw down atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] by stimulating surface-level photosynthesis. It has also led to the development of hypotheses such as grazing control which poses that HNLC regions are formed, in part, from the grazing of phytoplankton (e.g. [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[ciliate]]s) by smaller organisms (e.g. [[protist]]s).

Photosynthesis can be limited by deficiencies of certain macronutrients. However, in the North Pacific, the Equatorial Pacific, and the Southern Ocean macronutrients are found in sufficient ratios, quantities and bioavailable forms to support greater levels of primary production than found. Macronutrient availability in HNLC regions in tandem with low [[Biomass (ecology)|standing stock]]s of phytoplankton suggests that some other biogeochemical process limits phytoplankton growth.&lt;ref name=":272"/&gt;

Since primary production and phytoplankton biomass cannot currently be measured over entire ocean basins, scientists use [[Chlorophyll a|chlorophyll α]] as a proxy for primary production. Modern satellite observations monitor and track global chlorophyll α abundances in the ocean via [[remote sensing]]. Higher chlorophyll concentrations generally indicate areas of enhanced primary production, and conversely lower chlorophyll levels indicate low primary production. This co-occurrence of low chlorophyll and high macronutrient availability is why these regions are deemed "high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll."

In addition to the macronutrients needed for organic matter synthesis, phytoplankton need micronutrients such as [[trace metal]]s for cellular functions.&lt;ref name=":272"/&gt; Micronutrient availability can constrain primary production because trace metals are sometimes limiting nutrients. Iron has been determined to be a primary limiting micronutrient in HNLC provinces.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Recent studies have indicated that zinc and cobalt may be secondary and/or co-limiting micronutrients.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250217285|title=Iron and zinc effects on silicic acid and nitrate uptake kinetics in three high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":262"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=M.

=== Common characteristics ===
HNLC regions cover 20% of the world’s oceans and are characterized by varying physical, chemical, and biological patterns. These surface waters have annually varying, yet relatively abundant macronutrient concentrations compared to other oceanic provinces.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; While HNLC broadly describes the biogeochemical trends of these large ocean regions, all three zones experience seasonal phytoplankton blooms in response to global atmospheric patterns. On average, HNLC regions tend to be growth-limited by iron and variably, zinc.&lt;ref name=":262"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De La Rocha|first=Christina L.|last2=Hutchins|first2=David A.|last3=Brzezinski|first3=Mark A.|last4=Zhang|first4=Yaohong|date=2000|title=Effects of iron and zinc deficiency on elemental composition and silica production by diatoms|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=195|pages=71–79|doi=10.3354/meps195071|jstor=24855011|bibcode=2000MEPS..195...71D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trace metal limitation leads to communities of smaller sized phytoplankton.

The distribution of trace metals and relative abundance of macronutrients are reflected in the plankton community structure. For example, the selection of phytoplankton with a high surface area to volume ratio results in HNLC regions being dominated by nano- and picoplankton. This ratio allows for optimal utilization of available dissolved nutrients. Larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms, cannot energetically sustain themselves in these regions. Common picoplankton within these regions include genera such as [[prochlorococcus]] (not generally found in the North Pacific), [[synechococcus]], and various [[eukaryote]]s. Grazing protists likely control the abundance and distribution of these small phytoplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullen|first=John J.|last2=Lewis|first2=Marlon R.|last3=Davis|first3=Curtiss O.|last4=Barber|first4=Richard T.|date=1992-01-15|title=Photosynthetic characteristics and estimated growth rates indicate grazing is the proximate control of primary production in the equatorial Pacific|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=97|issue=C1|pages=639–654|doi=10.1029/91JC01320|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=1992JGR....97..639C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landry|first=M.

The discovery and naming of the first HNLC region, the North Pacific, was formalized in a seminal paper published in 1988.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; The study concluded that surface waters of the eastern North Pacific are generally dominated by picoplankton despite the relative abundance of macronutrients.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; In other words, larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms which thrive in nutrient-rich waters, were not found. Instead, the surface waters were replete with smaller pico- and nanoplankton.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; Based on laboratory nutrient experiments, iron was hypothesized to be a key limiting micronutrient.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

The Pacific Ocean is the largest and oldest body of water on Earth. The North Pacific is characterized by the general clockwise rotation of the [[North Pacific Gyre|North Pacific gyre]], which is driven by [[trade winds]]. Spatial variations in tradewinds result in cooler air temperatures in the western North Pacific and milder air temperatures in the eastern North Pacific (i.e., Subartic Pacific).&lt;ref name=":212"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002684.html|title=Wiley: Biological Oceanography, 2nd edition - Charles B.

Concentrations of iron however vary throughout the year. Ocean currents are driven by seasonal atmospheric patterns which transport iron from the [[Kuril–Kamchatka Trench|Kuril-Kamchatka]] margin into the western Subarctic Pacific.

===  Equatorial Pacific ===
The Equatorial Pacific is an oceanic province characterized by nearly year-round upwelling due to the [[Convergence zone|convergence]] of trade winds from the northeast and southeast at the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The Equatorial Pacific spans nearly half of Earth’s circumference and plays a major role in global marine [[new production|new primary production]].&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, F P., and J R Toggweiler, 1995: '''Physical estimates of global new production: The upwelling contribution''' In ''Dahlem Workshop on Upwelling in the Ocean: Modern Processes and Ancient Records'', Chichester, UK, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 313-320.&lt;/ref&gt; New production is a term used in [[biological oceanography]] to describe the way in which nitrogen is recycled within the ocean.&lt;ref name=":212"/&gt; In regions of enhanced new production, [[nitrate]] from the [[aphotic zone]] makes its way into surface waters, replenishing surface nitrate supply. Despite nitrogen availability in Equatorial Pacific waters, primary production and observed surface ocean biomass is considerably lower compared to other major upwelling regions of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eppley|first=R. W.|last2=Renger|first2=E.

Like other major HNLC provinces, the Equatorial Pacific is considered nutrient-limited due to lack of trace metals such as iron. The Equatorial Pacific receives approximately 7-10 times more iron from [[Cromwell current|Equatorial Undercurrent]] (EUC) upwelling than from inputs due to settling atmospheric dust.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winckler|first=Gisela|last2=Anderson|first2=Robert F.|last3=Jaccard|first3=Samuel L.|last4=Marcantonio|first4=Franco|date=2016-05-31|title=Ocean dynamics, not dust, have controlled equatorial Pacific productivity over the past 500,000 years|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/22/6119|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=22|pages=6119–6124|doi=10.1073/pnas.1600616113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27185933|pmc=4896667|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.6119W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate reconstructions of [[glacial periods]] using [[Proxy (climate)#lake and ocean sediments|sediment proxy records]] have revealed that the Equatorial Pacific may have been 2.5 times more productive than the modern equatorial ocean.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During these glacial periods the Equatorial Pacific increased its export of marine new production,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; thus providing a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The science of [[paleoceanography]] attempts to understand the interplay of glacial cycles with ocean dynamics. Paleo-oceanographers currently challenge the Aeolian Dust hypothesis which suggests that the transport of atmospheric iron-rich off Central and South America controls the intensity of primary production in the Equatorial Pacific.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One study suggests that because EUC upwelling provides most of the bioavailable iron to the equatorial surface waters, the only method to reverse HNLC conditions is by enhancing upwelling.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landry|first=Michael R.|last2=Selph|first2=Karen E.|last3=Taylor|first3=Andrew G.|last4=Décima|first4=Moira|last5=Balch|first5=William M.|last6=Bidigare|first6=Robert R.|date=2011-02-01|title=Phytoplankton growth, grazing and production balances in the HNLC equatorial Pacific|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064510002286|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|series=Plankton Dynamics and Carbon Cycling in the Equatorial Pacific|volume=58|issue=3|pages=524–535|doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.08.011|bibcode=2011DSRII..58..524L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other words, enhanced regional upwelling, rather than iron-rich atmospheric dust deposition, may explain why this region experiences higher primary productivity during glacial periods.

Compared to the North Pacific and Southern Ocean, Equatorial Pacific waters have relatively low levels of [[biogenic silica]] and thus don't support significant standing stocks of diatoms&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Picoplankton are the most abundant marine primary producers in these regions due mainly to their ability to [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilate]] low concentrations of trace metals.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Various phytoplankton communities within the Equatorial Pacific are grazed at the same rate as their growth rate, which further limits primary production.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

There is no current consensus regarding which of the two main hypotheses (grazing or micronutrients) controls production in these equatorial waters. It is likely that trace metal limitations select for smaller-celled organisms, which thereby increases the grazing pressure of protists.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; While the Equatorial Pacific maintains HNLC characteristics, productivity can be high at times. Productivity leads to an abundance of seabirds such as [[storm petrel]]s near the convergence of subtropical water and the equatorial "cold tongue." The Equatorial Pacific contains the world's largest yellowfin tuna fisheries&lt;ref name=":212" /&gt; and is home to the [[spotted dolphin]].

Grazing by herbivores such as krill, [[copepod]]s and [[salp]]s is believed to suppress phytoplankton standing stock.

== Hypotheses ==
Given the remote location of HNLC areas, scientists have combined modeling and observational data in order to study limits on primary production. Combining these two data sources allows for comparison between the North Pacific, Equatorial Pacific, and Southern Ocean. Two current explanations for global HNLC regions are growth limitations due to iron availability and phytoplankton grazing controls.

=== Iron hypothesis ===
{{Main article|Iron fertilization|Ocean fertilization}}In 1988, John Martin confirmed the hypothesis that iron limits [[phytoplankton]] blooms and growth rates in the North Pacific. His work was extrapolated to other HNLC regions through evidence which linked low surface iron concentration with low chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; In response to [[iron fertilization]] experiments (IronEx, SOIREE, SEEDS, etc.) in HNLC areas, large phytoplankton responses such as decreased surface nutrient concentration and increased [[Primary production|biological activity]] were observed.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=J.H.|last2=Coale|first2=K.H.|last3=Johnson|first3=K.S.|last4=Fitzwater|first4=S.E.|last5=Gordon|first5=R.M.|last6=Tanner|first6=S.J.|last7=Hunter|first7=C.N.|last8=Elrod|first8=V.A.|last9=Nowicki|first9=J.L.|date=September 1994|title=Testing the iron hypothesis in ecosystem of the equatorial Pacific Ocean|url=|journal=Nature|volume=371|issue=6493|pages=123–129|via=|bibcode=1994Natur.371..123M|doi=10.1038/371123a0|hdl=10945/43402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fujii|first=Masahiko|last2=Yoshie|first2=Naoki|last3=Yamanaka|first3=Yasuhiro|last4=Chai|first4=Fei|title=Simulated biogeochemical responses to iron enrichments in three high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079661105000364|journal=Progress in Oceanography|volume=64|issue=2–4|pages=307–324|doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2005.02.017|year=2005|bibcode=2005PrOce..64..307F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Andrew M.|last2=Platt|first2=Trevor|last3=Sathyendranath|first3=Shubha|title=The high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regime of the ocean: limits on biomass and nitrate before and after iron enrichment|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0304380003003028|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=171|issue=1–2|pages=103–125|doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.06.001|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrenfeld|first=Michael J.|date=10 October 1996|title=Confirmation of iron limitation of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the equatorial Pacific Ocean|url=|journal=Nature|volume=383|issue=6600|pages=508–511|via=|doi=10.1038/383508a0|bibcode=1996Natur.383..508B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=John H.|last2=Fitzwater|first2=Steve E.|last3=Gordon|first3=R.

Formulated by John Walsh in 1976, the grazing hypothesis states that grazing by [[heterotroph]]s suppresses primary productivity in areas of high nutrient concentrations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=John J.|date=1976-01-01|title=Herbivory as a factor in patterns of nutrient utilization in the sea1|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.4319/lo.1976.21.1.0001|issn=1939-5590|bibcode=1976LimOc..21....1W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predation by [[Zooplankton|microzooplankton]] primarily accounts for phytoplankton loss in HNLC regions.

Without this [[grazing pressure]], some scientists believe small phytoplankton would produce blooms despite micronutrient depletion because smaller phytoplankton typically have lower iron requirements and can absorb nutrients at a slower rate.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Contemporary view ===
Current scientific consensus agrees that HNLC areas lack high productivity because of a combination of iron and physiological limitations, grazing pressure, and physical forcings.&lt;ref name="pitchford3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frost|first=B.W.|date=July 27, 1987|title=Grazing control of phytoplankton stock in the open subarctic Pacific Ocean: a model assessing the role of mesozooplankton, particularly the large calanoid copepods Neocalanus spp.|url=|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=39|pages=49–68|via=|doi=10.3354/meps039049|bibcode=1987MEPS...39...49F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which each factor contributes to low production may differ in each HNLC region. Iron limitation allows for smaller, more iron-frugal phytoplankton to grow at rapid rates, while grazing by microzooplankton maintains stable stocks of these smaller phytoplankton.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Once micronutrients become available, grazing may then limit bloom sizes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Additional micronutrient limitations from trace metals like zinc or cobalt may suppress phytoplankton blooms.&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt; Turbulent mixing at higher-latitude HNLC regions (North Pacific and Southern Ocean) may mix phytoplankton below the [[Critical Depth|critical depth]] needed to have community growth.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Theory ===
[[File:CO2_pump_hg.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CO2_pump_hg.svg|thumb|382x382px|The marine carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide is taken up by phytoplankton for photosynthesis and incorporated into the marine food web. When plankton or predator dies, sedimentation of organic matter reaches the seafloor, where carbon can be buried and sequestered. Stimulating phytoplankton blooms is thought to increase sedimentation of particulate organic carbon after the blooms die off, leading to increased carbon sequestration.]]
Since past iron fertilization experiments have resulted in large phytoplankton blooms, some have suggested that large-scale ocean fertilization experiments should be conducted to draw down inorganic anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the form of [[Total organic carbon|particulate organic carbon]]. Fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, leading to a decrease in the amount of inorganic surface carbon dioxide within a fertilized patch. The bloom would then die off and presumably sink to the deep ocean, taking much of the absorbed carbon dixoide to the seafloor and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] it from the short-term [[carbon cycle]] in the deep ocean or ocean sediments.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrenfeld|first=Michael J.|last2=Bale|first2=Anthony J.|last3=Kolber|first3=Zbigniew S.|last4=Aiken|first4=James|last5=Falkowski|first5=Paul G.|date=October 1996|title=Confirmation of iron limitation of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the equatorial Pacific Ocean|url=|journal=Nature|volume=383|issue=6600|pages=508–511|via=|doi=10.1038/383508a0|bibcode=1996Natur.383..508B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeebe|first=R.

=== Efficiency and efficacy ===
To effectively remove anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere, iron fertilization would need to result in significant removal of particulate carbon from the surface ocean and transport it to the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Various studies estimated that less than 7-10% of carbon taken up during a bloom would be sequestered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Philip W.|last2=Law|first2=Cliff S.|last3=Wong|first3=C.S.|last4=Nojiri|first4=Yukihiro|last5=Tsuda|first5=Atsushi|last6=Levasseur|first6=Maurice|last7=Takeda|first7=Shigenobu|last8=Rivkin|first8=Richard|last9=Harrison|first9=Paul J.|date=2004-03-17|title=The decline and fate of an iron-induced subarctic phytoplankton bloom|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=428|issue=6982|pages=549–553|doi=10.1038/nature02437|pmid=15058302|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=2004Natur.428..549B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only a 15-25 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]] decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide would result with sustained global iron fertilization.&lt;ref name=":272"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The amount of carbon dioxide removed may be offset by the fuel cost of acquiring, transporting, and releasing significant amounts of iron into remote HNLC regions.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Many environmental concerns exist for large-scale iron fertilization.

In [[physics]], a '''high contrast grating''' is a single layer near-[[wavelength]] [[grating]] physical structure where the grating material has a large contrast in [[index of refraction]] with its surroundings. The term near-wavelength refers to the grating [[Period (frequency)|period]], which has a value between one optical wavelength in the grating material and that in its surrounding materials. 
 
The high contrast gratings have many distinct attributes that are not found in conventional gratings. These features include broadband ultra-high [[reflectivity]], broadband ultra-high [[transmission (wave propagation)|transmission]], and very high [[quality factor]] [[resonance]], for optical beam surface-normal or in oblique incidence to the grating surface. The high reflectivity grating can be ultrathin, only &lt;0.15 optical wavelength. The reflection and transmission phase of the optical beam through the high contrast grating can be engineered to cover a full 2π range while maintaining a high reflection or transmission coefficient.

The concept of high contrast grating took off with a report on a broadband high reflectivity reflector for surface-normal incident light (the ratio between the wavelength bandwidth with a reflectivity larger than 0.99 and the central wavelength is greater than 30%) in 2004 by [[Constance J. Chang-Hasnain]] et al.,&lt;ref&gt;C. F. R. Mateus, M. C. Y. Huang, Y. Deng, A. R. Neureuther, and C. J. Chang-Hasnain, “Ultra-broadband mirror using low index cladded subwavelength grating”, IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett. 16, 518-520 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Chang-Hasnain, C. F. R. Mateus, and M. C. Y. Huang, “Ultra broadband mirror using subwavelength grating,” U.S. Patent 7,304,781 (Dec. 4, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; which was demonstrated experimentally in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. R. Mateus, M. C. Y. Huang, L. Chen, and C. J. Chang-Hasnain and Y. Suzuki, “Broadband mirror (1.12-1.62 um) using single-layer sub-wavelength grating”, IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett. 16, 1676-1678 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The key idea is to have the high-refractive-index material all surrounded by low-refractive-index material. They are subsequently applied as a highly reflective mirror in [[vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser]]s,&lt;ref name=NP2007&gt;M. C. Y. Huang, Y. Zhou, and C. J. Chang-Hasnain, “A surface-emitting laser incorporating a high index-contrast subwavelength grating,” Nat.Photonics 1(2), 119–122 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as monolithic, continuously wavelength tunable vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.&lt;ref name=NP2008&gt;M. C. Y. Huang, Y. Zhou, and C. J. Chang-Hasnain, “A nanoelectromechanical tunable laser,” Nat. Photonics 2, 180–184 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The properties of high contrast grating are rapidly explored since then. The following lists some relevant examples:

In 2008, a single layer of high contrast grating was demonstrated as a high quality factor cavity.&lt;ref name=OE2008&gt;Y. Zhou, M. Moewe, J. Kern, M. C. Y. Huang, and C. J. Chang-Hasnain,“Surface-normal emission of a high-Q resonator using a subwavelength high-contrast grating,” Opt. Express 16(22), 17282–17287 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, hollow-core [[waveguides]] using high contrast grating were proposed,&lt;ref name=OE2009&gt;Y. Zhou, V. Karagodsky, B. Pesala, F. G. Sedgwick, and C. J. ChangHasnain, “A novel ultra-low loss hollow-core waveguide using subwavelength high-contrast gratings,” Opt. Express 17(3), 1508–1517 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; followed by experimentally demonstration in 2012.&lt;ref name=NANOP2012&gt;W. Yang, J. Ferrara, K. Grutter, A. Yeh, C. Chase, Y. Yue, A. E. Willner, M. C. Wu, and C. J. Chang-Hasnain, ”Low loss hollow-core waveguide on a silicon substrate,” Nanophotonics 1(1), 23–29 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment is the first demonstration to show a high contrast grating reflecting optical beam propagating in the direction parallel to the gratings, which is a major distinction from [[photonic crystal]] or [[distributed Bragg reflector]].

In 2010, planar, single-layer [[Lens (optics)|lens]]es and focusing reflectors with high focusing power using a high contrast grating with spatially varying grating dimensions were proposed and demonstrated.&lt;ref name=OE2010_1&gt;F. Lu, F. G. Sedgwick, V. Karagodsky, C. Chase, and C. J. Chang-Hasnain,“Planar high-numerical-aperture low-loss focusing reflectors and lenses using subwavelength high contrast gratings,” Opt. Express 18, 12606–12614 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NP2010&gt;D. Fattal, J. Li, Z. Peng, M. Fiorentino, and R. G. Beausolei, “Flat dielectric grating reflectors with focusing abilities,” Nat. Photonics 4(7), 466–470 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
Some literatures quote the high contrast gratings as photonic crystal slabs or photonic crystal membranes.&lt;ref&gt;X. Letartre, J. Mouette, J. L. Leclercq, P. R. Romeo, C. Seassal, and P. Viktorovitch, “Switching devices with spatial and spectral resolution combining photonic crystal and MOEMS structures,” IEEE J. Lightwave Technol. 21, 1691-1699 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PTL2012&gt;C.  Sciancalepore, B.B.  Bakir, X. Letartre, J.  Harduin, N.  Olivier, C.  Seassal, J.  Fedeli, P.  Viktorovitch, “CMOS-compatible ultra-compact 1.55- μ m emitting VCSELs using double photonic crystal mirrors”, IEEE Photon. Technol. Lett. 24, 455-457 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of operation ==

Fully rigorous electromagnetic solutions exist for gratings, which tends to involve heavy mathematical formulism. A simple analytical formulism to explain the various properties of high contrast grating has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;P. Lalanne, J.P. Hugonin and P. Chavel, “Optical properties of deep lamellar gratings: a coupled Bloch-mode insight”, IEEE J. of Lightwave Technol. 24, 2442 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Karagodsky, F.G. Sedgwick and C.J. Chang-Hasnain, “Theoretical analysis of subwavelength high contrast Grating Reflectors”, Optics Express 18, 16973 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Chang-Hasnain and W. Yang, "High-contrast gratings for integrated optoelectronics," Adv. Opt. Photon. 4, 379-440 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; A computational program based on this analytical solution has also been developed to solve the electromagnetic properties of high contrast grating, named High Contrast Grating Solver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://light.eecs.berkeley.edu/cch/hcgsolver.html "High Contrast Grating Solver"]&lt;/ref&gt; The following provides a brief overview of the operation principle of high contrast grating.

The grating bars can be considered as merely a periodic array of waveguides with wave being guided along the grating thickness direction. Upon plane wave incidence, depending on wavelength and grating dimensions, only a few waveguide-array modes are excited. Due to a large index contrast and near-wavelength dimensions, there exists a wide wavelength range where only two waveguide-array modes have real propagation constants in the z direction and, hence, carry energy. The two waveguide-array modes then depart from the grating input plane and propagate downward to the grating exiting plane, and then reflect back up. After propagating through the grating thickness, each propagating mode accumulates a different phase. At the exiting plane, owing to a strong mismatch with the exiting plane wave, the waveguide modes not only reflect back to themselves but also couple into each other. As the modes propagate and return to the input plane, similar mode coupling occurs. Following the modes through one round trip, the reflectivity solution can be attained. The two modes interfere at the input and exiting plane of the high contrast grating, leading to various distinct properties.

== Applications ==

High contrast gratings have been employed in many optoelectronic devices. It has been incorporated as the mirrors for vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.&lt;ref name=NP2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NP2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PTL2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OE2010_2&gt;V. Karagodsky, B. Pesala, C. Chase, W. Hofmann, F. Koyama and C.J. Chang-Hasnain, “Monolithically integrated multi-wavelength VCSEL arrays using high-contrast gratings”, Optics Express 18, 694 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The light-weight of high contrast grating enables fast microelectromechanical structure actuation for wavelength tuning.&lt;ref name=NP2008 /&gt; The reflection phase of the high contrast grating is engineered to control the emission wavelength of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.&lt;ref name=OE2010_2 /&gt; By locally changing each grating dimension while keeping its thickness the same, planar, single-layer lenses and focusing reflectors with high focusing power have been obtained.&lt;ref name=OE2010_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NP2010 /&gt; Besides its high reflectivity, the high contrast grating has been designed as a high quality factor resonator.&lt;ref name=OE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.-T. Wu, S.-H. Wu, T.-C. Lu, and S.-C. Wang, “GaN-based high contrast grating surface-emitting lasers,” Appl. Phys. Lett. 102, 081111 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Low-loss hollow-core waveguide are made with high contrast gratings with high reflectivity at oblique incident angle.&lt;ref name=OE2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NANOP2012 /&gt; Applications such as slow light &lt;ref&gt;T. Sun, W. Yang, V. Karagodsky, W. Zhou, and C. Chang-Hasnain, “Low-loss slow light inside high contrast grating waveguide,” Proc. SPIE 8270, 82700A (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; and optical switch &lt;ref&gt;W. Yang and C. J. Chang-Hasnain, “Ultra-compact optical switch using high contrast grating hollow-core waveguide,” Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics, OSA Technical Digest (CD) (Optical Society of America, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; can be built on the hollow-core waveguide by using the special phase response and resonance property of high contrast grating. High contrast grating can effectively manipulate the light propagation – directing light from surface-normal to in-plane index-guided waveguide and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;L. Zhu, V. Karagodsky, and C. Chang-Hasnain, “Novel high efficiency vertical to in-plane optical coupler,” Proc. SPIE 8270, 82700L (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydrometeorology''' is a branch of [[meteorology]] and [[hydrology]] that studies the transfer of [[water]] and [[energy]] between the land surface and the lower [[atmosphere]]. [[Hydrology|Hydrologists]] often utilize [[meteorologists]] and products produced by meteorologists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Eugene L.|date=1978|title=Hydrometeorology|url=https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477-59.5.609|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|volume=59(5)|pages=609-612|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a meteorologist would forecast 2-3 inches of rain is a specific area, and a hydrologist would then forecast what the specific impact of that rain would be on the terrain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hydrometeorology: Forecasting and Applications|last=Sene|first=Kevin|publisher=Springer International Publishing Switzerland|year=2015|isbn=978-3-319-23546-2|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has several programmes and activities in place that deal with the study of [[natural hazards]] of hydrometeorological origin and the mitigation of their effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/special-themes/disaster-risk-reduction/natural-hazards/hydro-meteorological-hazards/|title=Hydro-meteorological hazards &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|date=|publisher=Unesco.org|accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these hazards are the results of natural processes or [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]], [[Hydrology|hydrological]], or [[oceanographic]] phenomena such as [[flood]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[drought]] and [[desertification]]. Many countries have established an operational hydrometeorological capability to assist with [[weather forecasting|forecasting]], warning, and informing the public of these developing hazards.

== Hydrometeorological Forecasting ==
One of the more significant aspects of hydrometeorology has to do with the prediction and attempt to mitigate the effects of high precipitation events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dale|first=Murray|last2=Davies|first2=Paul|last3=Harrison|first3=Tim|date=2012|title=Review of recent advances in UK operational hydrometeorology|url=https://doi.org/10.1680/wama.2012.165.2.55|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers : Water management|volume=165|pages=55-64|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the prediction, there are three primary ways to to model when coming to forecasting. These are now-casting, numerical weather prediction, and statistical techniques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Nowcasting (meteorology)|Now-casting]] is good for predicting events for a few hours out, utilizing observations and live radar data to combine with the numerical weather prediction models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Numerical weather prediction]], which is the primary technique used to forecast weather, uses models to take account of the atmosphere, ocean models, and accounts for many other variables when it produces forecasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These forecasts are generally used for predictions days or weeks out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, statistical techniques utilize regressions and other statistical methods to create long-term projections that go out weeks and months at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These models allow scientists to view how a multitude of different variables interact with one another, and they illustrate one picture in how earth's climate interacts with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betts|first=Alan|date=2004|title=Understanding Hydrometeorology Using Global Models|url=https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-85-11-1673|journal=American Meteorological Society|volume=|pages=1673-1688|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk Assessment ==
A major component of hydrometeorology is mitigating the risk associated with flooding and other hydrological threats. First, there has to be knowledge of the possible hydrological threats that are expected within a specific region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After analyzing the possible threats, warning systems are put in place to quickly alert people and communicate to them the identity and magnitude of the threat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many nations have their own specific regional hydrometeorological centers that communicate threats to the public. Finally, there has to be proper response protocols in place to protect the public during a dangerous event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12412">The '''interplanetary dust cloud''', or '''zodiacal cloud''', consists of [[cosmic dust]] (small particles floating in [[outer space]]) that pervades the space between [[planet]]s within [[planetary system]]s such as the [[Solar System]]. This system of particles has been studied for many years in order to understand its nature, origin, and relationship to larger bodies.

In our [[Solar System]], the interplanetary dust particles have a role in [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] [[sunlight]] and in emitting [[thermal radiation]], which is the most prominent feature of the [[night sky]]'s radiation with wavelengths ranging 5–50 [[micrometer|μm]].&lt;ref&gt;Levasseur-Regourd, A.C., 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The [[particle size]]s of grains characterizing the [[infrared]] emission near [[Earth's orbit]] typically range 10–100 μm.&lt;ref&gt;Backman, D., 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The total mass of the interplanetary dust cloud is approximately the mass of an [[asteroid]] of radius 15 km (with density of about 2.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pavlov |first=Alexander A. |date= |title=Irradiated interplanetary dust particles as a possible solution for the deuterium/hydrogen paradox of Earth's oceans |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999JE001120/full#references |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |volume=104 |pages=30725-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straddling the [[zodiac]] along the [[ecliptic]], this dust cloud is visible as the [[zodiacal light]] in a moonless and naturally dark  sky and is best seen toward the Sun's direction during astronomical [[twilight]].

== Origin ==
The sources of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) include at least: asteroid collisions, [[comet]]ary activity and collisions in the inner Solar System, [[Kuiper belt]] collisions, and [[interstellar medium]] grains (Backman, D., 1997). Indeed, one of the longest-standing controversies debated in the interplanetary dust community revolves around the relative contributions to the interplanetary dust cloud from asteroid collisions and cometary activity.

== Life cycle of a particle ==

The main physical processes "affecting" (destruction or expulsion mechanisms) interplanetary dust particles are: expulsion by [[radiation pressure]], inward [[Poynting-Robertson drag|Poynting-Robertson (PR) radiation drag]], [[solar wind]] pressure (with significant electromagnetic effects), [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], mutual collisions, and the dynamical effects of planets (Backman, D., 1997).

The lifetimes of these dust particles are very short compared to the lifetime of the Solar System. If one finds grains around a star that is older than about 10,000,000 years, then the grains must have been from recently released fragments of larger objects, i.e. they cannot be leftover grains from the [[protoplanetary disk]] (Backman, private communication).{{cn|reason=We can't use private communications.  Technically I ought to remove this claim.  But I don't want to, because it's very interesting and seems likely to be supported &amp;mdash; just someone needs to find an RS.|date=March 2018}} Therefore, the grains would be "later-generation" dust. The zodiacal dust in the Solar System is 99.9% later-generation dust and 0.1% intruding [[interstellar medium]] dust. All primordial grains from the Solar System's formation were removed long ago.

Particles which are affected primarily by radiation pressure are known as "beta meteoroids". They are generally less than 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g and are pushed outward from the Sun into interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/genesis/DocumentN.html#BeMe |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826132615/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/genesis/DocumentN.html |archivedate=August 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cloud structures ==

The interplanetary dust cloud has a complex structure (Reach, W., 1997). Apart from a background density, this includes:
* At least 8 [[dust trail]]s—their source is thought to be [[short-period comet]]s.
* A number of dust bands, the sources of which are thought to be [[asteroid families]] in the [[main asteroid belt]]. The three strongest bands arise from the [[Themis family]], the [[Koronis family]], and the [[Eos family]]. Other source families include the [[Maria family|Maria]], [[Eunomia family|Eunomia]], and possibly the [[Vesta family|Vesta]] and/or [[Hygiea family|Hygiea]] families (Reach et al. 1996).
* At least 2 resonant dust rings are known (for example, the Earth-resonant dust ring, although every planet in the Solar System is thought to have a resonant ring with a "wake") (Jackson and Zook, 1988, 1992) (Dermott, S.F. et al., 1994, 1997)

== Dust collection on Earth==

In 1951, [[Fred Whipple]] predicted that micrometeorites smaller than 100 micrometers in diameter might be decelerated on impact with the Earth's upper atmosphere without melting.&lt;ref name="Whipple-1950" /&gt; The modern era of laboratory study of these particles began with the stratospheric collection flights of D. E. Brownlee and collaborators in the 1970s using balloons and then [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aircraft.&lt;ref name="Brownlee-1977" /&gt;

Although some of the particles found were similar to the material in present-day meteorite collections, the [[nanoporous]] nature and unequilibrated cosmic-average composition of other particles suggested that they began as fine-grained aggregates of nonvolatile building blocks and cometary ice.&lt;ref&gt;P. Fraundorf, D. E. Brownlee, and R. M. Walker (1982) Laboratory studies of interplanetary dust, in ''Comets'' (ed. L. Wilkening, U. Arizona Press, Tucson) pp. 383-409.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker-1986" /&gt; The interplanetary nature of these particles was later verified by [[noble gas]]&lt;ref name="Hudson-1981" /&gt; and [[solar flare]] track&lt;ref name="Bradley-1984" /&gt; observations.

In that context a program for atmospheric collection and curation of these particles was developed at [[Johnson Space Center]] in Texas.&lt;ref name="Cosmic-Dust-Sample-Collection" /&gt; This stratospheric micrometeorite collection, along with [[presolar grains]] from meteorites, are unique sources of [[extraterrestrial material]] (not to mention being small astronomical objects in their own right) available for study in laboratories today.

'''J Harlen Bretz'''&lt;ref&gt;Bretz's daughter explains how he got his name. "He invented the Harlen thing, just as he had invented the J in front of his name--made the whole thing up. 'Harley Bretz' was his given name, but it just didn't ring a bell for him; maybe he didn't think it sounded professional enough." Says Bretz's daughter Rhoda Bretz Riley in the book ''Bretz's Flood'' page 12. ''Bretz's Flood'', by John Soennichsen, published by Sasquatch Books Seattle, Copyright 2008 .&lt;/ref&gt; (September 2, 1882 – February 3, 1981) was an American [[geology|geologist]], best known for his research that led to the acceptance of the [[Missoula Floods]] and for his work on caves. He was born to Oliver Joseph Bretz and Rhoda Maria Howlett, farmers in [[Saranac, Michigan|Saranac]], [[Michigan]], the oldest of five children. He earned a degree in [[biology]] from [[Albion College]] in 1905, where he also met his wife Fanny Chalis. Thereafter, he became interested in the geology of Eastern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state.

==Early career==
Bretz was of [[German American|German heritage]].&lt;ref name=historylink&gt;{{historylink|id=8382|title=Bretz, J Harlen (1882-1981), Geologist|author=Cassandra Tate|date=November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bretz graduated with his [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] from [[Albion College]] in 1905. He then started his career as a [[high school]] [[biology]] [[teacher]] in [[Seattle]]. During this time he began studying the [[glacier|glacial]] geology of the [[Puget Sound]] area. He continued his studies at the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned his [[Ph.D.]] in geology in 1913. He became an assistant professor of geology, first at the [[University of Washington]] and then the University of Chicago.

He made important discoveries regarding the origin of the [[Channeled Scablands]].

==The Spokane floods: an outrageous hypothesis==
In the summer of 1922, and for the next seven years, Bretz conducted field research of the [[Columbia River Plateau]]. Since 1910 he had been interested in unusual [[erosion]] features in the area after seeing a newly published [[topographic]] map of the [[Potholes Cataract]]. Bretz coined the term Channeled Scablands in 1923 to describe the area near the [[Grand Coulee]], where massive erosion had cut through [[basalt]] deposits.&lt;ref name=bretz23&gt;Bretz, J Harlen (1923). "The Channeled Scabland of the Columbia Plateau". Journal of Geology 31: 617–649.&lt;/ref&gt; The area was a [[desert]], but Bretz's theories required cataclysmic water flows to form the landscape, for which Bretz coined the term [[Spokane Floods]] in a 1925 publication.&lt;ref name=bretz25&gt;Bretz, J Harlen (1925). "The Spokane flood beyond the Channeled Scablands". Journal of Geology 33: 97–115, 236–259. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F623179 DOI:10.1086/623179]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bretz published a paper in 1923, arguing that the [[channeled scablands]] in [[Eastern Washington]] were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This was seen as arguing for a [[Catastrophism|catastrophic]] explanation of the geology, against the prevailing view of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], and Bretz's views were initially discredited. However, as the nature of the [[Ice Age]] was better understood, Bretz's original research was vindicated, and by the 1950s his conclusions were also vindicated.

Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day. The geology establishment was resistant to such a sweeping theory for the origin of a broad landscape for a variety of reasons, including lack of familiarity with the remote areas of the interior Pacific Northwest where the research was based, and the lack of status and reputation of Bretz in the eyes of the largely Ivy League-based geology elites. Furthermore, his theory implied the potential possibilities of a Biblical flood, which the scientific community strongly rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3211_megafloo.html PBS documentary]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geological Society of America|Geological Society of Washington, D.C]] invited the young Bretz to present his previously published research at a 12&amp;nbsp;January 1927 meeting where several other geologists presented competing theories. Bretz saw this as an ambush, and referred to the group as six "challenging elders". Their intention was to defeat him in a public debate, and thereby end the challenge his theories posed to their conservative interpretation of uniformitarianism.

Another geologist at the meeting, [[Joseph Pardee|J.T. Pardee]], had worked with Bretz and had evidence of an ancient [[Proglacial lake|glacial lake]] that lent credence to Bretz's theories. Pardee, however, lacked the academic freedom of Bretz (he worked for the [[US Geological Survey]]) and did not enter the fray.

Bretz defended his theories, kicking off an acrimonious 40&amp;nbsp;year debate over the origin of the Scablands. As he wrote in 1928, "Ideas without precedent are generally looked upon with disfavour and men are shocked if their conceptions of an orderly world are challenged."&lt;ref&gt;Quote engraved on monument outside the Dry Falls Museum in Coulee City WA&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Pardee and Bretz continued their research over the next 30&amp;nbsp;years, collecting and analyzing evidence that eventually identified [[Lake Missoula]] as the source of the [[Missoula Floods|Spokane Floods]] and creator of the Channeled Scablands. Research on open channel hydraulics in the 1970s further vindicated Bretz's and Pardee's theories.

==Caves and karst==
Bretz wrote an extremely influential paper on the morphology and origin of [[limestone]] [[caves]] (1942) together with detailed studies of the caves of [[Missouri]] (1956) and [[Illinois]] (with Stanley Harris, 1961).

==Awards and honours==
The National Speleological Society made Bretz an honorary member in 1954.

Bretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award, in 1979, at the age of 96.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]&lt;/ref&gt; After this award, he told his son: "All my enemies are dead, so I have no one to gloat over."

Each year at [[Albion College]], the J Harlen Bretz Award is given to the most outstanding senior in the geology department.

Bretz Drive in [[Homewood, Illinois]] was named in his honor.

A [http://glaciers.us/sites/default/files/states/washington/JH_Bretz/harlen20.jpg plaque] was dedicated to Bretz in 1994 outside the [http://parks.state.wa.us/251/Dry-Falls Visitor Center at Dry Falls State Park] in [[Coulee City, Washington]] that reads "Dedicated to J Harlen Bretz who patiently taught us that catastrophic floods may sometimes play a role in nature's unfolding drama"

==Personal life==
Bretz and his wife Fanny had two children, Rudolf Challis Bretz and Rhoda Bretz Riley. The Bretz family settled in [[Homewood, Illinois]] where they bought property and constructed a [[Sears Catalog Home]] on it. Bretz nicknamed the property "Boulderstrewn" because of all the rocks and minerals he collected and was given that were placed around the property. He donated a portion of this collection to [[Albion College]] in the 1970s [http://campus.albion.edu/bretz/2011/02/01/albion-trips-to-boulder-strewn-homewood-il/]. Boulderstrewn was renowned for being an active place where Bretz hosted many parties with students and faculty from the [[University of Chicago]].

The '''Kwazulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic''' is a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|subtropical moist broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of [[South Africa]]. It covers an area of {{convert|17,800|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal]] provinces.&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Africa: Eastern shore of South Africa|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at0116|publisher=WWF|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits==
The Kwazulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic occupies the humid coastal strip between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the foothills of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains. It is part of a strip of moist [[Coastal forests of eastern Africa|coastal forests]] that extend along Africa's Indian Ocean coast from southern [[Somalia]] to South Africa. The northern limit of the ecoregion is at [[St Lucia, KwaZulu-Natal|Cape St. Lucia]]&lt;!--not exact match--&gt; in [[KwaZulu Natal]], where the forests transition to the [[Maputaland coastal forest mosaic]]. The southern limit is at [[Cape St. Francis]], east of [[Port Elizabeth]] in the [[Eastern Cape Province]], where the KwaZulu-Cape forests transition to the [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests]].&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;&lt;ref name=KZN&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting to know KwaZulu-Natal (KZN)|url=http://www.kzndae.gov.za/en-za/cop17home/gettingtoknowkzn.aspx|publisher=Province of Kwazulu-Natal|accessdate=3 June 2015 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006223321/http://www.kzndae.gov.za/en-za/cop17home/gettingtoknowkzn.aspx|archivedate=6 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
[[image:Forest outside of Durban.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Umkomaas]] Forest south of [[Durban]]]]
The ecoregion has a seasonally moist subtropical climate. Rainfall ranges from 1500&amp;nbsp;mm to 900&amp;nbsp;mm per year. The northern portion is generally receives more rainfall, typically in the summer months, while the southern portion receives most of its rainfall in the winter months, which is typical of the [[Mediterranean climate]] region to the west. Rainfall diminishes away from the coast, and the coastal forest mosaic yields to the drier [[Maputaland-Pondoland bushland and thickets]] in the Drakensberg foothills, above 300 to 450 meters elevation.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Flora==
The ecoregion comprises a mosaic of different plant communities, including coastal belt forest, sand forest, dune forest, short, dry forests known as Alexandria forest, grasslands, palm woodlands, and thorn scrublands. Forests are typically made up of evergreen trees, interspersed with dry-season semi-deciduous and deciduous trees.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

}}'''Lee Carlson''' (born February 21, 1958) is an American writer best known for his memoir, ''[[Passage to Nirvana]]'', about surviving [[traumatic brain injury]]. Prior to publishing ''Passage to Nirvana'' he was a magazine and newspaper journalist specializing in writing about outdoor adventure sports such as [[skiing]] and [[scuba diving]]. He was senior travel editor for [[Skiing (magazine)|''Skiing'' magazine]], and has worked for media outlets such as ''Outside'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Lee (2000-11-00). [http://outsideonline.com/outside/magazine/200011/200011dest1.html "Sailing the Big Wide Open." ''Outside''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828064628/http://www.outsideonline.com/outside/magazine/200011/200011dest1.html |date=August 28, 2008 }}. Retrieved March 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Newsday'', NBC Sports, ESPN and many others.

==Background==
Carlson grew up in [[Buffalo, New York]], where he attended the [[Nichols School]].&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Charity (November 9, 2010). [http://www.buffalonews.com/life/health-parenting/article245999.ece "Finding 'Nirvana' in a haze of traumatic brain injury." ''The Buffalo News'']. Retrieved March 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his memoir, he had an upper middle class upbringing, and was an athletic child, participating in sports that included skiing, sailing,&lt;ref&gt;(2010-11-12) [http://www.sailinganarchy.com/article.php?get=6495 "Now And Zen" ''Sailing Anarchy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014804/http://www.sailinganarchy.com/article.php?get=6495 |date=July 19, 2011 }} Retrieved March 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[lacrosse]], and others, which led to his career as an outdoor travel/sportswriter.

He attended [[Skidmore College]], where he was a student of [[Clark Blaise]], the writing teacher and short-story writer who was [[Bernard Malamud]]'s main pupil, and also{{clarify|date=June 2013}} roommates and good friends with [[Raymond Carver]] at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. Blaise was the director of the [[International Writing Program]] there. Carlson was a painting major and heavily involved in theater at Skidmore, but credits Blaise with his becoming a professional writer. His other major influence and mentor is [[Peter Matthiessen]], with whom Carlson has studied for many years as a [[Zen Buddhism]] student.

After college, Carlson worked briefly as a private yacht captain, and then moved to New York to pursue his writing career. He held a number of writer/editor positions at small trade magazines, including editor-in-chief of a low-temperature physics magazine.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Eventually he secured a job covering two of his main interests, skiing and travel, when he became senior travel editor at ''Skiing'' magazine.

In 2002, several months after working for [[NBC]] at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], Carlson was hit by a car and suffered a [[traumatic brain injury]], leading to a year of full-time rehab and several years of recovery. After the accident, Carlson, being a lifelong sailor, decided to once again pursue one of his loves and work as a private yacht captain. He then, with his fiancée Meg, purchased and rebuilt a 25-year-old, 60-foot sailboat they renamed "Nirvana". The accident, aftermath and boat form the metaphorical journey to recovery detailed in his book.

Carlson lives in [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport, New York]], aboard "Nirvana".&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Julie (October 20, 2010) [http://suffolktimes.timesreview.com/2010/10/644/local-authors-go-the-self-publish-route/ "Local authors." ''The Suffolk Times''].  Retrieved March 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson holds a 100-ton [[US Coast Guard]] captain's license&lt;ref&gt;(2011-01).

[[Sites of Special Scientific Interest|SSSIs]] in the UK are [[SSSI notification|notified]] using the concept of an [[Area of Search]] (AOS), an area of between {{convert|400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.11, p. 17. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] (NCC), based on regions created by the [[Local Government Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.5, pp. 14–15. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 [[Districts of Wales|districts]]. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties ([[Dyfed]], [[Powys]] and [[Gwynedd]]) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. [[Mid Glamorgan|Mid]] and [[South Glamorgan]] were merged into a single AOS, whilst [[Llanelli (district)|Llanelli district]] was included in the [[West Glamorgan]] AOS.

Due to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the [[Countryside Council for Wales]] (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the [[Local government in Wales|subdivisions of Wales]] formed in April 1996 by the [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]], resulting in 22 [[Principal areas#Wales|principal areas]].

Radnor AOS lies within the county of Powys.

For SSSIs elsewhere in the UK, see [[List of SSSIs by Area of Search]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7128">Lying in one of the most seismically active regions of the world, [[Nepal]] has a long history of earthquakes. The first documented earthquake event in the country dates back to 7 June 1255, during the reign of King [[Abhaya Malla]]. The quake, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, took the life of the king and wiped out a third of [[Kathmandu]]'s then population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nepalitimes.com/blogs/kundadixit/2016/01/13/stirred-not-shaken/|title=Stirred, not shaken|last=Dixit|first=Kunda|date=13 January 2016|work=[[Nepali Times]]|quote=The last one in 1255 killed one-third of the Valley’s population, including King Abhaya Malla.|access-date=26 October 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal has witnessed at least one major earthquake per century ever since.  

The following is a '''list of earthquakes in Nepal'''. It includes only ''major'' seismic events with their [[epicenter|epicentre]] in the country, and those that occurred outside the country, that resulted in a significant loss of life and property in the country.

Most of the 35 streams are small and impermanent. Melting snow supplies water to a number of these until late April. Others are merely winter torrents which go dry during the summer.

[[File:Ipomoea batatas 006.JPG|thumb|200px|alt=Close-up view of a pile of golden sweet potato roots|Edible sweet potato roots photographed in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]].]]

This '''list of sweet potato cultivars''' provides some information about [[Plant variety (law)|varieties]] and [[cultivar]]s of [[sweet potato]] (''Ipomoea batatas''). Sweet potato was first domesticated in the [[Americas]] more than 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="ipc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cipotato.org/sweetpotato |title=Sweetpotato |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=[[International Potato Center]] |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, there are approximately 7,000 sweet potato cultivars. People grow sweet potato in many parts of the world, including New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, Hawaii, China, and North America. However, sweet potato is not widely cultivated in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/108860/Sweet-potatoes-a-growing-niche-in-Europe |title=Sweet potatoes a growing niche in Europe |last=Núñez |first=Carlos |date=7 May 2013 |website=FreshPlaza |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People [[Plant breeding|breed]] sweet potatoes mainly either for food (their nutritious [[storage root]]s) or for their attractive [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[vine]]s. (The variety 'Vardaman' is grown for both.) The first table below lists sweet potato cultivars grown for their edible roots; the second table lists cultivars bred as [[Ornamental plant|ornamental vines]]. In the first table, the Parentage column briefly explains how the sweet potato cultivar was bred. Sweet potato plants with desirable traits are [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] to produce new cultivars.

Sweet potato cultivars differ in many ways. One way people compare them is by the size, shape, and color of the roots. The more orange the [[Pith|flesh]] of a sweet potato root is, the more nutritious [[carotene]] it has. (Humans metabolize carotene into [[vitamin A]].) The skin of a sweet potato root is a different color than the flesh. The biological word for the outer skin is ''[[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]''; the flesh is called the ''[[pith]]'' or ''medulla''. The first table below has a general description of the color of the root's flesh and skin.

In the mid-20th century, sweet potato growers in the [[Southern United States]] began marketing orange-fleshed sweet potatoes as "yams", in an attempt to differentiate them from pale-fleshed sweet potatoes.&lt;ref name="Schultheis"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/what-is-the-difference-between-a-sweetpotato-and-a-yam |title=What is the Difference Between a Sweetpotato and a Yam? |date=30 January 1998 |last=Schultheis |first=Jonathan |website=NC Cooperative Extension |access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though these growers called their products yams, true yams are significantly different. All sweet potatoes are variations of one species: ''I. batatas''. Yams are any of various tropical species of the genus ''[[Dioscorea]]''. A yam [[tuber]] is starchier, dryer, and often larger than the storage root of a sweet potato, and the skin is more coarse.&lt;ref name="Schultheis"/&gt; This list does not include yams.

==Cultivars bred for edible roots==
{{Expand list |date=December 2011}}

Many of the sweet potato cultivars below were bred at [[agricultural experiment station]]s. An agricultural experiment station (AES) is a [[research center]] where scientists work to increase the quality and quantity of [[food production]]. Agricultural experiment stations are usually operated by a government agency and/or a university.

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10095">'''Near vertical incidence skywave''', or '''NVIS''', is a [[skywave]] radio-wave propagation path that provides usable signals in the range between [[groundwave]] and conventional [[skywave]] distances—usually 30–400&amp;nbsp;miles (50–650&amp;nbsp;km). It is used for military and [[paramilitary]] communications, broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;Broadcasting in Band&amp;nbsp;7 (HF) in the Tropical Zone, International Radio Consultative Committee, International Telecommunications Union, Geneva, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the tropics, and by [[radio amateurs]] for nearby contacts circumventing line-of-sight barriers. The radio waves travel near-vertically upwards into the [[ionosphere]], where they are [[refracted]] back down and can be received within a circular region up to 650&amp;nbsp;km from the transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;The Emergency Communications Antenna, By Stephen C. Finch, AIØW http://www.w8ne.com/Files/NVIS%20nvis_AI0W.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If the frequency is too high (that is, above the critical frequency of the ionospheric [[F layer]]), refraction fails to occur and if it is too low, absorption in the ionospheric [[D layer]] may reduce the signal strength.

There is no fundamental difference between NVIS and conventional skywave propagation; the practical distinction arises solely from different desirable radiation patterns of the antennas (near vertical for NVIS, near horizontal for conventional long-range skywave propagation).

== Frequencies and propagation ==
[[File:NVIS Radiation Pattern.svg|thumb|NVIS radiation pattern &lt;br/&gt; While the groundwave (blue) cannot propagate, the refracted skywaves (red) achieve HF coverage within the common first hop (~500km).]]
The most reliable frequencies for NVIS communications are between 1.8&amp;nbsp;MHz and 8&amp;nbsp;MHz. Above 8&amp;nbsp;MHz, the  probability of success begins to decrease, dropping to near zero at 30&amp;nbsp;MHz. Usable frequencies are dictated by local ionospheric conditions, which have a strong systematic dependence on geographical location. Common bands used in amateur radio at mid-latitudes are 3.5&amp;nbsp;MHz at night and 7&amp;nbsp;MHz during daylight, with experimental use of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[60-meter band|60&amp;nbsp;meters]]) frequencies. During winter nights at the bottom of the sunspot cycle, the 1.8 MHz band may be required. &lt;ref&gt;http://hamwaves.com/nvis/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Broadcasting uses the [[Shortwave bands|tropical broadcast bands]] between 2.3 and 5.06&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the [[Shortwave bands|international broadcast bands]] between 3.9 and 6.2&amp;nbsp;MHz. Military NVIS communications mostly take place on 2–4&amp;nbsp;MHz at night and on 5–7&amp;nbsp;MHz during daylight.

Optimum NVIS frequencies tend to be higher towards the tropics and lower towards the arctic regions. They are also higher during high sunspot activity years. The usable frequencies change from day to night, because sunlight causes the lowest layer of the ionosphere, called the [[D layer]], to increase, causing attenuation of low frequencies during the day &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An analytical study of HF communications between provincial PREOC-s and the North Shore Emergency Management office at VE7NSR |url=http://www.nsarc.ca/tech_archive/HF%20PREOC%20Study/Report/Report_9%20Mar10.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the maximum usable frequency (MUF) which is the critical frequency of the [[F layer]] rises with greater sunlight. Real time maps of the critical frequency are available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Images/HF%20Systems/Global%20HF/Ionospheric%20Map/WorldIMap0.gif |title=World Ionospheric Map |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia Bureau of Meteorology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a frequency about 15% below the critical frequency should provide reliable NVIS service. This is sometimes referred to as the [[Frequency of optimum transmission | optimum working frequency or FOT]]. 

NVIS is most useful in mountainous areas where [[line-of-sight propagation]] is ineffective, or when the communication distance is beyond the 50&amp;nbsp;mile (80&amp;nbsp;km) range of [[groundwave propagation|groundwave]] (or the terrain is so rugged and barren that groundwave is not effective), and less than the 300–1500&amp;nbsp;mile (500–2500&amp;nbsp;km) range of lower-angle [[skywave|sky-wave propagation]]. Another interesting aspect of NVIS communication is, that direction finding of the sender is more difficult than for ground-wave communication (i.e. VHF or UHF). For broadcasters, NVIS allows coverage of an entire medium-sized country at much lower cost than with VHF (FM), and daytime coverage, similar to [[mediumwave|mediumwave (AM broadcast)]] nighttime coverage at lower cost and often with less interference.

== Antennas ==
An NVIS antenna configuration is a horizontally polarized (parallel with the surface of the earth) radiating element that is from 1/20th [[wavelength]] ([[λ]]) to 1/4 wavelength above the ground. Optimum height is about 1/4 wavelength, and high angle radiation declines only slightly for heights up to about 3/8 wavelength. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Jim|title=Planning Antennas|url=http://k9yc.com/AntennaPlanning.pdf|website=k9yc.com/publish.htm|publisher=Jim Brown, K9YC|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That proximity to the ground forces the majority of the radiation to go straight up. Overall efficiency of the antenna can be increased by placing a [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] wire slightly longer than the antenna parallel to and directly underneath the antenna. One source says that a single ground wire can provide antenna [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] in the 3–6&amp;nbsp;dB range.&lt;ref&gt;Hawker (2005), pp. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Another source indicates 2&amp;nbsp;dB for a single wire and nearly 4&amp;nbsp;dB for multiple ground wires.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w8ji.com/nvis_n_v_i_s_antenna.htm NVIS Antennas&lt;/ref&gt;  Ground wires are more necessary when using lower dipoles over poor soils as without them considerable energy goes into heating the ground.

Depending on the specific requirements, various antennas (i.e. Sloper, [[T2FD]], [[Dipole Antenna|Dipole]]) can be used for NVIS communication, with horizontal dipoles or inverted V dipoles at about 0.2 wavelengths above ground giving the best results on transmit and at about 0.16 wavelengths on receive, according to military sources and an extensive study by Dutch researchers. &lt;ref&gt; G. E. Barker, J. Taylor, and G. H. Hagn, “Summary of measurements and modeling of the radiation patterns of simple field antennas in open (level) terrain, mountains and forests,” U.S. Army Electronic Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, USA, Spec. Tech. Rep. 45, December 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.agentschaptelecom.nl/sites/default/files/2015_-_witvliet_-_nvis_elev_angles_and_ant_height_-_ieee_apm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Very low antennas are much inferior on transmit, less so on receive, where both noise and signal are attenuated.

Significant increases in communication will obviously be realized when both the transmitting station and the receiving station use NVIS configuration for their antennas. In particular for low profile operations NVIS antennas are a good option.&lt;ref&gt;Space Challenged NVIS Antenna http://harriscountyares.org/training/KNW/KNW-119.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For broadcasting, typical antennas consist of a dipole about 1/4 wavelength above ground, or arrays of such dipoles.&lt;ref&gt;Broadcasting in Band 7, page 39&lt;/ref&gt;   Up to 16 dipoles can be used, allowing strong signals with relatively low power by concentrating the signal in a smaller area. Limiting the coverage may be dictated by licensing, language or political considerations.  Arrays of dipoles can be used to "slew" the pattern, so that the transmitter need not be in the center of the coverage footprint.  Broadcast NVIS antennas usually use an extensive ground screen to increase gain and stabilize the pattern and feed impedance with changing ground moisture.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to geophysics:

'''[[Geophysics]]''' &amp;ndash; the physics of the [[Earth]] and its environment in space; also the study of the Earth using quantitative physical methods. The term ''geophysics'' sometimes refers only to the [[geology|geological]] applications: Earth's [[figure of the Earth|shape]]; its [[gravitational]] and [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic fields]]; its [[structure of the Earth|internal structure]] and [[Earth#Composition|composition]]; its [[geodynamics|dynamics]] and their surface expression in [[plate tectonics]],  the generation of [[magmas]], [[volcanism]] and rock formation. However, modern geophysics organizations have a broader definition that includes the [[hydrological cycle]] including [[snow]] and [[ice]]; [[geophysical fluid dynamics|fluid dynamics]] of the [[oceans]] and the [[atmosphere]]; [[atmospheric electricity|electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] and solar-terrestrial relations; and analogous problems associated with the [[Moon]] and other [[planets]].

== Nature of geophysics ==

Geophysics can be described as all of the following:

* An [[academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; branch of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* A scientific field (a branch of [[science]]) &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are several geophysics-related scientific journals.
** A [[natural science]] &amp;ndash; one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world using [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]]s.
*** A [[physical science]] &amp;ndash; one that studies non-living systems.
**** An [[earth science]] &amp;ndash; one that studies the planet [[Earth]] and its surroundings.
** A [[biological science]] &amp;ndash; one that studies the effect of organisms on their physical environment.
* An [[interdisciplinary field]] &amp;ndash; one that overlaps [[atmospheric sciences]], [[geology]], [[glaciology]], [[hydrology]], [[oceanography]] and [[physics]].

The '''"Pernambuco" interior forests''' (in reality Paraiba and Pernambuco forest/states and not only "Pernambuco") is an [[ecoregion]] of the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] [[Biome]], and the South American [[Atlantic Forest]] biome. It lies in eastern [[Brazil]] between the coastal [[Pernambuco coastal forests]] and the dry [[Caatinga]] shrublands of Brazil's interior.

==Setting==
The Pernambuco interior forests cover an area of {{convert|22,700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending across portions of [[Paraíba]], [[Pernambuco]], and [[Alagoas]] states. They extend from the [[Curimataú River]] in the north to the [[São Francisco River]] in the south.

The Pernambuco interior forests lie inland from the [[Pernambuco coastal forests]], extending from sedimentary plateaus near the coast up the eastern slopes of the [[Borborema Plateau]]. In the northern portion of the ecoregion, the interior forests lie close to the coast, just behind the coastal [[Rio Piranhas mangroves]] and [[Atlantic coast restingas]].

===Climate===
The climate is tropical. Annual rainfall ranges from 1,250 to 1,750&amp;nbsp;mm, with a dry season from October to March.

==Flora==
The predominant forest type is the four-tiered (emergent, canopy, understory, and forest floor) Atlantic semi-deciduous forest, with emergent trees reaching up to {{convert|35|m|ft}}. Many trees shed their leaves during the October to March dry season.

Characteristic emergent and canopy trees include ''[[Astronium fraxinifolium]]'' (family [[Anacardiaceae]]), ''[[Enterolobium contortisiliquum]]'' ([[Leguminosae]]), ''[[Cordia trichotoma]]'' ([[Boraginaceae]]), and ''[[Tabebuia chrysotricha]]'' ([[Bignoniaceae]]). The Pernambuco interior forests are home to the largest remaining populations of [[Brazilwood]] or Pau-Brasil, ''(Caesalphinia echinata)''

==Fauna==
Many species are endemic to the Pernambuco interior and coastal forests. Bird species include the [[buff-breasted tody-tyrant]] ''(Hemitriccus mirandae)'', [[white-winged cotinga]] ''(Xipholena atropurpurea)'', [[seven-colored tanager]] ''(Tangara fastuosa)'', and [[yellow-faced siskin]] ''(Carduelis yarrellii)''.

==Conservation and threats==
Only 5% of the original forest remains; the rest has been cleared for timber and fuel wood, agriculture, or cattle ranching. Most of the remaining forest remnants are small (1-10 hectares) and species-impoverished.

As of 1997, only three protected areas covered portions of the ecoregion, protecting an area of 90 square kilometers of forest. The [[Pedra Talhada Biological Reserve]], in [[Quebrangulo]], Alagoas, is an important refuge for the endangered and threatened birds of the ecoregion.

The '''Primakov Readings''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Примаковские чтения) is an international summit aimed at promoting dialogue on trends in global politics and economics among high-ranking experts, diplomats and decision-makers. The summit is named in honor of the academician and statesman [[Yevgeny Primakov]]. The Readings are intended both to commemorate Primakov and to continue to develop his ideas through international dialogue.

The summit is organized by the [[Institute of World Economy and International Relations|Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO)]] and is held in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. Approximately 50 leaders from think tanks, universities and the diplomatic community from more than 30 countries participate in the Readings each year.

== General information ==
The conference focuses on scenarios of the development of [[international relations]], challenges in the sphere of [[international security]] and new models of interaction between States, corporations and other entities.

The purpose of the event is to create in [[Russia]] a regularly operating international platform aimed at discussion of problems of [[world economy]], politics and international security with the participation of leading representatives of Russian and foreign research and expert-analytical centers.

Primakov Readings are designed to:

* intensify the dialogue between leading experts from different countries and regions;
* promote discussion of the approaches to address global and regional problems;
* encourage the interaction on the "[[Track II diplomacy|Track II]]".

== Summits ==

=== Primakov Readings 2015 ===
The first Primakov Readings were held On October 29, 2015 at the [[:ru:Центр международной торговли (Москва)|World Trade Center]] (Moscow). The event was created to commemorate one of the most outstanding politician and scientist [[Yevgeny Primakov|Yevgeny Maximovich Primakov]], who had died in June of that year, and was timed to the day of his birth.

His friends and colleagues met in order to reminisce the joint work. They appreciated the contribution of Yevgeny Primakov to Russian politics, journalism and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/Primakov_Readings_2015|title=Примаковские чтения 2015|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:А.А. Дынкин на открытии Примаковских чтений 2018.jpg|left|thumb|[[Alexander Dynkin|A.A. Dynkin]] at the Primakov Readings 2018]]
At the opening ceremony prominent personalities such as Aide to the [[President of Russia|President of the Russian Federation]] '''Y.V. Ushakov''', Chairman of the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation]] '''[[Valentina Matviyenko|V.I.

[[File:Панельная сессия «Новая биполярность» – миф или реальность?» на Примаковских чтениях 2018.jpg|thumb|The first session "New Bipolarity” – Myth or Reality?”]]
'''The first session - "New Bipolarity” – Myth or Reality?”''' – touched upon the problems of crisis of supranational and international institutions, as well as the appropriateness of the very concept of "bipolarity" in contemporary international relations. The expert from [[Austria]] said that [[Russia]] and [[China]] are moving towards establishing a new world order; however, it is too early to talk about the formation of a "new bipolarity". The expert from the [[United States]] disagreed, stressing that "competing bipolarity" is developing in the world, which will lead to a "new multipolarity". The representative from the PRC noted that China is in isolation, which Russia helps to overcome to some extent. In his opinion, the role of the new institutions, in the formation of which China is involved, is important, and that is whyChina’s tactics might be somehow offensive. The representative of China did not rule out the possibility of conflicts between Washington and Beijing. From the Chinese point of view, the new bipolarity is unacceptable and it is preferable to strive for the formation of blocks.

According to the [[India]]n expert, the state of world politics can be defined as "multiple multipolarity". The Russian participant of the session, in his turn, drew attention to the fact that the forming system is not only a polycentric and hierarchical, but also unstable: on the one hand, there is a growing interdependence, on the other – increasing competitiveness. This trend shows the inconsistency of the dual logic of bipolarity and encourages the need to develop a new language of diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/en/Primakov_Readings_2018_1Session|title=The First Session|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The second session, called "Infrastructure Rivalry in the [[Indo-Pacific|Indo-Pacific Region]]: on Land and at Sea",''' raised questions related to the fierce competition for world trade routes, ports, and natural resources in the Indo-Pacific region. In addition the presence of a number of nuclear and threshold states in the region was mentioned during the discussion. Аs well as the complexity of the existence of "small" states, forced to maneuver between the political and economic interests of bigger players. The [[Vietnam]]ese side raised the issue of political trust. The representative from India emphasized the need for economic infusions in the region's infrastructural projects, and especially the problem of competition among those projects. The expert from China stressed that Beijing's infrastructural projects are not imperialistic. He also criticized the idea of the Indian and Pacific oceans’ connection.

The US side highlighted the main obstacles to cooperation in the region: the lack of security framework between the US and China, coupled with a clash of values on which the US and Chinese foreign policy doctrines are based, the prevalence of bilateral infrastructural projects in the region and the difficulty of harmonizing interests in multilateral projects, as well as the problem of territorial issues in the South China Sea.

According to the participants, one of the key and most problematic tasks is to find common grounds and to establish an institutional framework for the trade regime in the region under the conditions of a clash of interests of key players. The representative of [[Japan]] paid attention to the [[North Korea]]n issue and noted that if Trump and Kim Jong-un reached an agreement, Russia and Japan could play a crucial role in the fundamental changes in the region. According to the Russian expert, a new format, combining bilateral and multilateral cooperation with an unlimited number of participants, would be the most promising scenario. From the point of view of Russian interests, according to the speaker, Chinese [[One Belt One Road Initiative|Belt and Road Initiative]] is the most perspective and realistic. Depending on what kind of the development of interaction formats prevails, the situation will lead either to an aggravation of competition or to the development of cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/en/Primakov_Readings_2018_2Session|title=The Second Session|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Панельная сессия «Новая «Большая игра» на Ближнем Востоке» на Примаковских чтениях 2018.jpg|left|thumb|The third session "New ‘Great Game’ in the Middle East"]]
'''The third session, "New ‘Great Game’ in the [[Middle East]]",''' highlighted the following issues: increasing number of actors in the region (both state and non-state), abandonment of the "bipolar" logic concerning the division of spheres of influence in the economy, development of terrorism as a form of business, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and politicization of religion.

According to the expert from [[Uzbekistan]], there are several insurmountable factors hampering the achievement of stability in the Middle East: a crisis of confidence, a paralysis of the institutions of international security, an attempt by different actors to impose their own rules of the game in the conditions of chaos. Import of alien models and values leads to opposition from the local population and its turn towards Islamic fundamentalism. Political will of the United States and Russia is capable of bringing stability to the region and there are several points of convergence, such as common interests in the fight against extremism, as well as counteraction to radicalization of youth. The representative of India shared this view, stating that it is necessary to work out joint approaches to fighting hotbeds of tension in the region in those areas, where interests of major actors do not conflict. The US side also stressed the presence of numerous actors and the complexity of relationships between them, especially mentioning Russia's ability to find common ground between irreconcilable antagonists. The expert predicted gradual withdrawal of the US from the region.

The representative from Israel noted that the weakening of state and its subjectivity occurred in the region, which has been related to dynamics of the [[Arab Spring|"Arab Spring"]]. In a number of cases, authoritarian regimes were reinforced. The weakening of the state created a vacuum, which brought an opportunity for various regional forces to intervene in conflicts.

Russian participant in the session questioned the existence of the [[The Great Game|«Great Game»]] in the Middle East. In his opinion, there is no opposition between two "superpowers", but there are three levels of conflict: local, regional and global. A distinguished feature of Russia's foreign policy – an attempt to build mutually beneficial relations with different parties, while Moscow does not try to oust anybody from the region. However, the US has recently become the main producer of hydrocarbons and pursuing new interests.

During the discussion of '''the fourth session - "Exit Strategy for the [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukraine Crisis]]"''', most participants agreed with the non-alternative nature of the Minsk agreements, as well as with Moscow's declared need to overcome alienation that is artificially fueled in relations between Russia and [[Ukraine]]. Representatives of the US and EU at the session noted the need to consider the Ukrainian crisis in context of changes in the post-Soviet space and the determination to fit it into the architecture of European security. Both Russian and Western experts agreed on the need for a peacekeeping operation, primarily with a view to ending violence in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/en/Primakov_Readings_2018_4Session|title=The Fourth Session|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The second day''' of Primakov Readings was opened by speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, '''[[Sergey Lavrov|S.V. Lavrov]]''', who touched upon the aggravation of international contradictions and the narrowing of space for constructive cooperation between countries, and consequently the risks of uncontrolled escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/en/Primakov_Readings_2018_Lavrov|title=Lavrov's Speech|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The fifth session - "''' '''Is there a Future for Arms Control? "''' - expanded traditional understanding of the subject, highlighting also the challenges of cyberspace and the emergence of hypersonic and smart weapons, touching on the philosophical question of whether there could be a regime of arms control in a multipolar world in general.

The American expert confirmed that Russian issue is being used today in the US domestic politics. Representatives of the Russian side noted, that the nuclear arms race in the 21st century will no longer be a bilateral but multilateral. They also pointed out that a new arms control system cannot be built if the previously created mechanisms are destroyed. The representative from the [[European Union]] said that the control system no longer corresponds to the new realities, since it is a product of the bipolar world, and the question is how to organize a multilateral arms control negotiation process in a multipolar uncontrolled system. The expert stressed the need to counteract the US in its desire to extend legal norms of its national legislation to other countries. Indian expert called for a focus on reducing the risks of using nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/en/Primakov_Readings_2018_5Session|title=Fifth Session|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The sixth session - "''' '''Russia and the EU – Interdependence or Confrontation "''' – revealed the unfavorable aspects of the deteriorating relations of partner countries, noted by all experts. The representative from [[France]] said that the international system will depend, first of all, on relations between the US and China. He noted the possibility of increasing confrontation in cyberspace, in the economy (related to the Chinese [[One Belt One Road Initiative|Belt and Road Initiative]]), if Russia continues its course toward strategic loneliness. The [[Italy|Italian]] expert pointed out the interdependence in relations between Russia and the EU, describing it as "hybrid cooperation". The participant noted the special complexity of the Ukrainian issue, as well as of the Serbian and Balkan problems. Representatives of the Russian point of view made in their speech an emphasis on the fall of investment activity between the Russian Federation and the EU. Experts noted an unprecedented crisis of confidence and, in connection with this, Russia's pivot to the East. Nevertheless, they also expressed hope for a more pragmatic approach of European business circles, which will allow separating economic benefits from political processes. The US representative at the session stated that Russia consciously chooses the path of the "rogue state": the country does not want to play by international rules and refuses to take responsibility for certain events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/en/Primakov_Readings_2018_6Session|title=Sixth Session|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The seventh session - "''' '''Society changing Tech: Its Expanses and Limits"''' - conducted by '''A.A. Fursenko''', the Aide to the [[President of Russia|President of the Russian Federation]], highlighted the role of the state and the market in modern developed societies. Panel discussion touched upon the problems of: resource catastrophe, communication gap, growing interdependence of countries in the field of modern technologies, and state guarantees to cover risks of developing field-specific technologies.

The specialists discussed possibilities of [[Blockchain|"blockchain"]] as a possible solution for a number of technological challenges. They agreed on the need to educate specialists aiming at invention and creative thinking, within the framework of solving special tasks for applied purposes. The Minister of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation '''M.M. Kotyukov''', stressed that scientific community, business circles and system of education – all participate in the technological development of the country. The Academy of Sciences once took upon itself the role of a major acquirer of R&amp;D. Today the role of the state in the sphere is paramount. The speaker pointed up that in international cooperation, the emphasis should be made both on the development of infrastructure and on the development of those competencies that are necessary for Russia to enter the market of leading projects.

The American expert noted that under the conditions of "new normality" technologies can help to overcome a number of resource constraints. At the same time, technologies are developing at such a speed that governments often do not understand the whole picture, so the task of the academic community is to develop a set of rules and regulations in the field of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imemo.ru/en/Primakov_Readings_2018_7Session|title=Seventh Session|website=www.imemo.ru|language=ru-ru|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quotes from the Readings ===

* [[Vladimir Putin|V. Putin]]: "Primakov has always been confident that Russia needs normal, constructive, good relations with Western countries. To the question "Is it possible to be friends with all in our world?" He replied: "It is impossible, but it is possible and necessary to work with them. The world is very complicated"
* [[Lee Jae-yong (businessman)|Lee Jae-Yong]]: "Since the beginning of the 21st century Russia has actively pushed forward its Eastern policy based on the growing global political and economic status of the Eurasia continent. Russia has aimed to build an economic bridge connecting Europe and Asia Pacific by promoting cooperation with countries in the Asia Pacific region".
* [[Wolfgang Ischinger|W. Ishinger]] "We live in a moment that symbolizes, that represents the end of the post-Cold-War period and we are obviously moving into a more chaotic, more polycentic world which is going to be far more difficult to run, to operate, to keep stable than was the case previously".
* [[Richard Sakwa|R. Sakwa]]: "In my view, the international system is becoming, I would argue, far healthier by the emergence of these counter-hegemonic alliances; not anti-Western, but simply non-Western, and a different vision of the international system. Rather than talking about the chaos and so on, I’d rather say that I think the world has become more balances and, perhaps, will actually achieve, if this counter-hegemonic system can influence international society and temper the ambitions of the hegemonic system, a far more stable and enduring peaceful order".
* [[File:Ю. В. Ушаков и А.А. Дынкин на Примаковских чтениях – 2017.jpg|left|thumb|[[Yuri Ushakov|Y. Ushakov]] and [[Alexander Dynkin|A. Dynkin]] at the Primakov Readings 2017]][[Alexander Dynkin|A. Dynkin]]: "A polycentric world is much more complicated than a bipolar or unipolar construct in world architecture. We now see a multi-dimensional network, a fabric of international relations; at this point, of course, the role of analytical centers and professional expert organizations in undoubtedly increasing".
* [[Henry Kissinger|H. Kissinger]]: "Tensions between the United States and Russia are not a rare event, they have happened before and they have been overcome often before. Problems between the United States and Russia are needed to be solved by negotiation and by a common vision of the two".
* G. Aragona: "Let’s not delude ourselves. The disappearance of the territorial base of Daish is not going to eliminate this form of threat. It will morph into other forms, and could even lead to an export of activities because if they cannot operate in the region, they might try to operate outside, in different ways. But unless we handle the political, social, economic, religious – whatever, there are several reasons – until we tackle these root causes, I am afraid that we shall make progress, but will not solve the problem".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30118">'''Project Space Track''' was a research and development project of the [[US Air Force]], to create a system for tracking all artificial earth satellites and space probes, domestic and foreign.

Project Space Track was started at the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Center]] at Laurence G. Hanscom Field, now [[Hanscom Air Force Base]], in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]] shortly after the launch of [[Sputnik I]].  Observations were obtained from some 150 sensors worldwide by 1960 and regular orbital predictions were issued to the sensors and interested parties.

Space Track was the only organization that used observations from all types of sources: radar, optical, radio, and visual. All unclassified observations were shared with the  [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]]. In 1961, the system was declared operational and assigned to the new [[1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron]] as part of [[NORAD]]'s [[Space Detection and Tracking System]] (SPADATS).

==Establishment==
On 29 November 1957, shortly after the launch of [[Sputnik I]] on 4 October, two German expatriates, Dr. G. R. Miczaika (from Prussia) and Dr. Eberhart W. Wahl (from Berlin) formed Project Space Track (originally called Project Harvest Moon).&lt;ref name="Cotter 1"&gt;Cotter, L[awrence] R.: Sputniks and Space, The National Space Surveillance Control Center.

Boston: 19 January 1961&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name= "Press b"&gt;Air Force Cambridge Research Center. Background of National Space Surveillance Control Center. Press release 60-P7. Bedford, MA: February 1960?&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} It was established in Building 1535 of the Geophysics Research Directorate (GRD), Air Force Cambridge Research Center, [[Laurence G. Hanscom Field]], Massachusetts. Both scientists had backgrounds in astronomy, although Dr. Wahl’s Ph.D. was in meteorology.

The mission of Space Track was to track and compute orbits for all artificial earth satellites, including both US and Soviet payloads, booster rockets, and debris.  With the Soviet launch of [[Luna 1]] on 2 January 1959, Space Track also started tracking space probes. The first major tracking effort was [[Sputnik II]], containing the dog Laika, launched 3 November 1957.

An Electronic Support System Program Office, 496L, had been established in February 1959, with the program office at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] under the direction of Col Victor A. Cherbak, Jr.  By late 1959, the SPO had received additional responsibilities under the DoD [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) to develop techniques and equipment for military surveillance of satellites [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/au-18/au18003c.htm]. Continuing development of Space Track was an integral part of this effort.

Since December 1958, Space Track had been the interim National Space Surveillance Control Center.&lt;ref name="Cotter 1"/&gt;{{rp|5}}  In December 1959, Space Track was moved to a new building, the National Space Surveillance Control Center (NSSCC), which was formally dedicated on 9 February 1960.&lt;ref name= "Press a"&gt;Air Force Cambridge Research Center. Press release 60-P6. Bedford, MA: [February 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; The NSSCC was part of the Air Force Command and Control Development Division (known informally as C²D²), Air Research and Development Command. Dr. Harold O. Curtis of [[Lincoln Laboratory]] was the Director of the NSSCC. The name Space Track continued in use.

By 1960, there were about 70 people in the NSSCC involved in operations.&lt;ref name= "Wahl b"&gt;Wahl, E[berhart]. W..  Program Development in Orbital Computation at the U.S. National Space Surveillance Control Center. [Proceedings of the Second Symposium (International) on Rockets and Astronautics]. [Tokyo: May 1960.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}}

Space Track continued tracking satellites and space probes until 1961. In late 1960, USAF Vice Chief of Staff General [[Curtis E. LeMay]] decided that the research and development system was ready to become operational.&lt;ref name="Cotter b"&gt;Cotter, Lawrence R.: Reminiscences About Space Track History. Privately published. [Berkeley CA]: 20 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

Eleven officers and one Senior Master Sergeant were selected to be the initial cadre of what became the 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron. The initial cadre came to Space Track for training that started 7 November 1960. (The cadre was assigned to the new squadron on 6 March 1961.)

On 1 July 1961 the new squadron became operational&lt;ref name = "ops"&gt;Miller, [Robert]. Signed draft AF Form 77a.  [Ent AFB CO]: 31 August 1961&lt;/ref&gt; under the USAF Air Defense Command at [[Ent AFB]], Colorado Springs, part of NORAD's [[Space Detection and Tracking System]] (SPADATS). The first Squadron Commander was Colonel Robert Miller. The Space Track organization at Hanscom Field assumed a backup role for squadron operations.

In cavalier disregard of the Air Force Regulation on the subject, which specified clearly that unclassified nicknames, such as Space Track, should be two words (while codewords, such as [http://www.nro.gov/ CORONA], which were then themselves classified, should be only one word), ADC immediately decided to rename Space Track as SPACETRACK&lt;ref name ="SPACETRACK"&gt;Headquarters USAF. The History of Air Defense Command, Jan - Jun 1964. Showing the official usage as all caps SPACETRACK. Washington DC: 19665?&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} and the name has stuck since – although the web site of the 614th Air &amp; Space Operations Center, which currently performs the mission, has returned to two words.&lt;ref name="VAFB1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space-track.org/perl/login.pl |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905085020/http://www.space-track.org/perl/login.pl |archivedate=5 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 614th is part of the [[Joint Space Operations Center]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]], California.

==Sensors==
[[File:Smithsonian Institution Archives - 2002-32252.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Baker-Nunn camera|Baker-Nunn satellite tracking camera]].]]
The Department of Defense had decided that the US Air Force should develop a command and control system for tracking satellites and that the US Army and US Navy should develop sensors for the purpose.  US Navy development was at [[Dahlgren, Virginia]] and the US Army's program was at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], Maryland.

Drs. Miczaika and Wahl had assembled a list of facilities that could track satellites, either by monitoring telemetry or by using radar.  The latter were mostly astronomical radio telescopes equipped with radars used in studying the moon (e.g., [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] in England directed by [[Sir Bernard Lovell]], Millstone Hill of [[Lincoln Laboratory]] in Massachusetts directed by Dr. [[Gordon Pettingill]], and a radar at the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] in California, directed by [[Walter Jaye]]).  Two USAF radars, one on [[Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians and the other at [[Diyarbakır, Turkey]], had been built to observe Soviet missile launches and became valuable for satellite tracking as well.  [[BMEWS]] prototype radars on Trinidad also participated.  Normally, the first radar reports of a new satellite launch from Tyuratam (Baikonur) came from Shemya and the first of a new launch from Kapustin Yar came from Diyarbakır. A USAF radar at the Laredo Test Site in Texas and [[USS Rancocas|one at Moorestown, New Jersey]] also participated later.  Observations were received from the Royal Canadian Air Force research radar at [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]], Canada.  The [[Goldstone Tracking Station|Goldstone]] facility of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] was exceptionally helpful with radio observations of Soviet space probes.

In general, observations were in the form of time, azimuth and elevation (and range, from radars) as measured at the site or, in some cases, such as at Goldstone, in astronomical form (Right Ascension and Declination)&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"&gt;Fitzpatrick, F.M. And Findley, G.B.:  The Tracking Operation at the National Space Surveillance Control Center (NSSCC), [[Eglin AFB]], FL: 2 September 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5-4}}&lt;ref name="Goldstone units"&gt;Teletype message, Space Track Control Center, 5 June 1960 1630Z.&lt;/ref&gt; Some early observations were very primitive, such as a report that a satellite passed near a star that could be identified.&lt;ref name= "M&amp;W"&gt;Miczaika, G.R. and Wahl, E[berhart].W..  The Orbital Motion of the Earth Satellite 1957 β from 1 April 1958 to Its Decay 14 April 1958.  Bedford, MA: 5 June 1958.   AFCRC-TN-58-445.  The report includes observations made in the United States, England, Finland, Netherlands, Japan, Canada, and Germany, illustrating the widespread international efforts to observe satellites in the early days of the space age.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

On rare occasions, the observations were purely verbal.  For example, individuals on ships, planes, and islands in the Caribbean reported sightings of the decay of satellite 1957 β,&lt;ref name="M&amp;W"/&gt; although one aircraft was able to provide a detailed observation because the navigator happened to be completing a celestial fix at the exact time &lt;ref name="M&amp;W"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Some sites could record the [[Doppler shift]] of satellite transmission or, in a few cases, the Doppler shift from their own transmissions reflected from the orbiting object.  One doppler site was the Space Track Doppler Field Site at [[Billerica, Massachusetts]].  The observations obtained by this technique were the time of closest approach to the station.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The Navy program was operated as
[http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/track/spasur_at.htm  NAVSPASUR] and is now operated by the US Air Force.  The Army program, although achieving accurate tracking results with doppler techniques and furnishing observations to Space Track, did not achieve funding for deployment.

One of SPASUR’s contributions to satellite tracking was the invention of a map of the earth that showed both poles, so that the position of all satellites, including those in polar orbits, could be shown.  This was not possible with [[Mercator projection|Mercator]] or other projections, which do not show the entire earth.  The map was, of course, very distorted at the poles (the [[North pole]] was the entire top line of the long map) but the concept proved very useful.

Optical sensors included the twelve Baker-Nunn satellite tracking cameras operated for NASA by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO), three Baker-Nunn cameras operated by the USAF, and the Boston University camera at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] operated by Walter Manning.

SAO cameras were at [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera]], Australia; [[Jupiter, Florida]]; Organ Pass, New Mexico; Olifantsfontein, Union of South Africa; [[Cadiz, Spain]]; Mitaka, Japan; Nani Tal, India;  [[Arequipa, Peru]]; [[Shiraz, Iran]]; Curaҫao, Netherlands West Indies; Villa Dolores, Argentina; and Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii.   USAF cameras were at [[Oslo, Norway]]; [[Edwards AFB]], California, and [[Santiago, Chile]].[https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2602&amp;context=space-congress-proceedings] Two additional cameras were later added to the USAF inventory – one of the USAF cameras was transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force at [[Cold Lake, Alberta]], Canada in 1961.

Volunteer amateur astronomers as part of the SAO [[Operation Moonwatch|Moonwatch]] Team also contributed observations. Among these many volunteers was Arthur S. Leonard of Davis, California, leader of the Sacramento, California team.

By 1960, Space Track had about 150 cooperating sensors.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;{{rp|6}}  Space Track was the only US organization that used all methods of observation to track satellites.&lt;ref name="Cotter 1"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

The observations were recorded on IBM punched cards for computer processing.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;{{rp|23}}  All unclassified observations were exchanged daily with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="M&amp;W"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="W&amp;D"&gt;Wahl, E[berhart] W. and Delaney, W[illiam] A. The Orbital Motion of the Earth Satellite 1958-Delta One During the Last Days of its Existence.  Bedford, MA: 2 January 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

Space track maintained close contact with the US [[National Security Agency]], the CIA Foreign Missile and Space Analysis Center (FMSAC), and Headquarters USAF Intelligence, Major Harry Holeman.

It was helpful that the USSR press service, [[TASS]], always announced new Soviet satellite or space probe launches promptly, so Space Track was free to discuss the new objects without worrying about compromising sources.  Translations of the Russian announcements were provided by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS).

==Orbital computations==
Dr. Wahl had been computing all the satellite ephemerides by hand using a Friden Square Root Calculator, the most advanced mechanical calculator then available.

The method for computing ephemerides (documented in detail in a 1960 report by P.M. Fitzpatrick and G.B. Findley&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;) was originally developed by Dr. Wahl, based on historic astronomical methods.

In late August 1958, Space Track obtained its first computer, an [[IBM 610]], used in conjunction with the Cambridge Research Center [[IBM 650]].  The IBM 610 was a very primitive machine, the programing of which was done with a plug board (similar to the ones used for IBM accounting machines in the early 1950s) and a punched paper tape.

The new NSSCC building was equipped with an [[IBM 709]] and, a few months later, with an [[IBM 7090]]. Major programming of the new computers was done by the Aeronutronic Division of the Ford Motor Company, Newport Beach CA.  The Wolf Corporation also supported the NSSCC.

The ephemeris computations were issued in what was called a bulletin.  The bulletin listed each equatorial crossing of the satellite and described the path between crossings.  Space track also furnished “look angles,” altitude and azimuth directions so that specific sensors could point in the correct direction to acquire the satellite.  Special versions of the look angles were tailored for specific sites, such as the Army and Navy sensor development projects.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;{{rp|17}}  At the NSSCC, these computations were transmitted by the Duty Controller.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Space Track also issued public catalogues listing all the satellites, including ones no longer in orbit, called Satellite Situation Reports, which gave basic orbital elements for each piece.  At first, this took less than a page of type.  The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory also issued a similar document but, in 1961, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center assumed responsibility for both reports, combining them into one document..

In October 1960 George Westrum presented a short college-level course in Celestial Mechanics for those NSSCC personnel who wished to participate&lt;ref name= "Westrum"&gt;Westrum, George.  Outline of Celestial Mechanics Courses. [Bedford, MA: NSSCC], 6 October 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
By international agreement under the International Astronomical Union, the satellites and space probes were initially named with Greek letters, following the system for naming stars in constellations. The year of launch was included in the launch names, so Sputnik I was 1957 Alpha. The payload was called Alpha I, when known – in the case of Sputnik I, it wasn’t clear initially which was the payload, so the payload became Alpha II.  Other pieces were also numbered, so the carrier rocket was usually Alpha II.  The 24 Greek letters were soon used, so the next sequence started Alpha Alpha and so forth.  By 1962  Beta Psi had been launched and it was clear that the Greek alphabet system would no longer work.  Thereafter, launches were numbered, starting with 1963-1 with the payload normally being 1963-1A, etc..

As soon as a new satellite or space probe was launched, Space Track alerted the primary sensors and processed observations as they came in, issuing a preliminary tracking bulletin promptly and updating it after about 24 hours, when additional observations from around the world had been obtained. Routine bulletins continued to be issued regularly as needed to keep up with the changing orbits, some of which decayed fairly rapidly in the atmosphere. There was another flurry of activity when the last revolutions occurred, as it was difficult to forecast the exact reentry path.

The NSSCC had a room dedicated as a filter center for monitoring communications and obtaining observations.  The filter center had displays listing the orbiting and decayed satellites and a projector system that could show the motion of one satellite over the earth.  The displays were devised by A/3C Peter P. Kamrowski.&lt;ref name="Pete"&gt;Letter, Subject: Recommendation for Award of AF Commendation Medal to A3C Peter P. Kamrowski, AF 17538381.  Bedford MA: Headquarters Electronic Systems Division, 19 June 1961&lt;/ref&gt; The center was manned by a Duty Controller and his assistants.  The center was designed by Senior Controller 1st Lt Cotter, based on his earlier experience as a volunteer member of the USAF Ground Observer Corps (the Ground Observer Corps filter centers were in turn based on United Kingdom aircraft tracking centers developed during World War II to track Nazi aircraft).

By 1960, the position of Duty Analyst was established. Once observations had been reduced, the duty analyst reviewed them and decided which orbits needed to be recomputed to bring them up to date.  In the case of new launches or decaying satellites, one analyst was dedicated to processing observations for that satellite.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

As with many other activities in the dawning space age, Space Track operations often involved doing things for which no precedent existed.

===Unusual Space Track operations===
On 2 January 1959, the Soviets launched Luna I (aka Mechta (Dream)), their first lunar probe.  Tracking data was obtained for Space Track by the Goldstone site of the California Institute of Technology, which verified that the probe had headed for the moon.  Dr. Curtis used a plot of this data in a presentation to a committee of the US House of Representatives.  His presentation helped influence President Kennedy to establish the [[Apollo Program]].  Kenneth E. Kissell later published a Project Space Track analysis of the trajectory.&lt;ref name= "K"&gt;Kissell, Kenneth E..  Analysis of the Announced Trajectory of the Russian Extra-terrestrial Vehicle, Mechta I.  Bedford, MA: September 1959.  AFCRC-TN-59-605.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this period, the 6594th Aerospace Test Wing was valiantly trying to achieve a successful launch in the Discoverer satellite program. The satellites, launched from Vandenberg AFB, were all in polar orbits.  They were controlled by the 6594th at Palo Alto (later the Air Force Satellite Control Facility at Sunnyvale CA).  Lt Cotter was the liaison officer between Space Track and the 6594th.  The first 12 launch attempts were failures; the first success was Discoverer I (1959 Beta).  Lockheed Corporation, the development contractor, won their bonus payment because the telemetry showed the satellite achieved orbit, but it was never seen again, despite massive Space Track and other efforts to find it.

By this time Space Track had contacts with many sensors around the world.  One of them was at the [[South Pole]], associated with the [[International Geophysical Year]].  One of their ninety observations of Discoverer II (1959 Gamma) was sent from Byrd Station saying that the satellite had passed to the left of the zenith at 2.25 degrees, implying an orbital inclination of 89.9 degrees.&lt;ref name= "Beat"&gt;Wackernagel, H[ans] B[eat]..  The Satellite 1959 Gamma (Discoverer II).  A Preliminary Analysis.  Pages 3, 11. Bedford, MA: August 1959.  AFCRC-TN-59-457.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3,11}}&lt;ref name= "South Pole"&gt;Typescript list of observations of Discoverer II received at Project Space Track, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;  This report is probably the only direct observation of the inclination of a satellite’s orbit that has ever been made.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Because the Discoverer satellites carried payloads that were deorbited and recovered from parachutes by aircraft of the 6594th Aerospace Test Wing based in Hawaii, the timing of deorbit was critical. (The deorbit attempt of Discoverer II's payload went seriously wrong: the payload landed on [[Spitsbergen]], instead of coming down over the Pacific ocean.  It was recovered by Russian miners, likely very helpful to Russian intelligence and the Russian space program in general &lt;ref name = "New York Times"&gt;“Air Force Hunts Capsule in Arctic; Reports Hint the Discoverer Instruments Fell Near Spitsbergen Island.”  New York Times: 17 April 1959, page 12. Not held at USAF Museum&lt;/ref&gt;).  Later, to improve the accuracy of the deorbit commands, orbital analysts Lt Algimantas Šimoliūnas, Lawrence Cuthbert, or Ed Casey would update the Space Track ephemeris for each Discoverer at the last minute and send the update to the 6594th.  The 6594th had a global network of tracking stations (including Alaska, Hawaii, Seychelles, Guam, and the UK), used for command and on-orbit control of the satellites.  However, the tracking data was derived from telemetry monitoring and was not as precise as the Space Track data, which was based in major part on radar and optical tracking.

Lockheed decided to put a small light on Discoverer XI (1960 Delta).  Space Track acted as liaison between the 6594th and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, to use their Baker-Nunn camera at Cadiz, Spain, to photograph the light.  This would give Lockheed valuable information about the accuracy of their orbit computations.  The experiment worked very well and was not repeated.&lt;ref name="Cotter b"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Discoverer XIX (1960 Tau) had a payload called MIDAS, the developmental version of what later became the Defense Support Program.  The Air Force decided that the MIDAS orbit should be classified, which meant that Space Track sensor observations had to be classified also.  This led to a surreptitious midnight data transfer in central Concord, Massachusetts between Dr. Gordon Pettingill of Millstone Hill and Lt Cotter, as there was no secure teletypewriter or telephone available.&lt;ref name="Cotter b"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Perhaps causing inadvertent fireworks in celebration of the activation of the 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron, the Ablestar stage for the Navy's Transit 4A satellite, 1961 Omicron, which was launched on 29 June 1961, exploded about 77 minutes after attaining orbit, at 0608Z.  The NORAD Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) made early radar observations and Mr. Leonard of the Sacramento, California Moonwatch team alerted Space Track when he saw many fragments where only a few satellites were expected from the launch.  In the next few days, this gave Project Space Track its first major effort as a backup for the new squadron.  Lawrence W. Cuthbert, 1st Lt Algimantas Šimoliūnas, and Ed Casey achieved a landmark in satellite tracking, plotting observations by hand and identifying orbits for 296 of the fragments.&lt;ref name="Teledyne"&gt;Nauer, David J. ed..  History of On-Orbit Satellite Fragmentations.  Sixth edition, pp. 22-23. Teledyne Brown Engineering: Colorado Springs CO July 1992.  Not held at USAF Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Orbital Analysts at 1st Aero were also heavily involved in the achievement.  Observations from the SPASUR fence were very helpful in tracking the fragments (SPASUR had initially refused to send Space Track individual observations, sending instead only orbital parameters, but this policy had fortunately been changed by 1961).

The technique used to identify multiple objects orbiting in the same orbital plane was refined by Lawrence Cuthbert and published as an automated program by the Wolf Corporation&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;Cuthbert, Lawrence W.. Space Sweep. Computer program. Wolf R&amp;D Corporation: Concord MA, 1966.  Not held at USAF Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  [Later, Larry worked with Bob Morris, Chief Orbital Analyst at Colorado Springs, to develop a program to derive orbital elements for all unknown radar tracks; the methodology worked and it became known as the Cuthbert-Morris Algorithm. The resulting program was called "Breakup, Lost and Decay" and, along with subsequent improvements, it has found thousands of the objects in the Space Satellite Catalog. It is still the Air Force Astrodynamic Standard for Uncorrelated Target (UCT) processing.&lt;ref name = Miller&gt;Miller, James G.. Special Perturbations Uncorrelated Track Processing.

==Communications==
Most Space Track communication was by teletypewriter or, in some cases, by telephone, mail, or messenger.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The bulletins and look angles were initially typed by hand by airmen in the communications office and sent by teletypewriter to all the participating sensors.  The teletypewriter machines used punched paper tape, before the invention of chadless tape.

Eventually, Roy Norris and Lt Cotter inveigled the IBM 610 into cutting paper tapes for the satellite bulletins, so that the airmen in the communication department would not have to type all the data by hand.  This was not part of the IBM 610 design and was a surprise to IBM personnel.&lt;ref name="Cotter b"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  Later computers would also prepare the bulletin and look angle data tapes automatically.&lt;ref name="Wahl b"/&gt;{{rp|193}}

There was some limited secure communication:  One method valid for sending classified information was a pair of [[one-time pad]]s.  These pads were each made of twin sets of pages, the top one of which had all letters and numbers on a line, perhaps 40 lines to a page.  The top sheet was carbonless paper.  To use the sheets, one circled each letter or number row-by-row on the top sheet.  This marked the second sheet, which had all the letters and numbers scrambled.  The scrambled version could then be transmitted by teletypewriter or telephone to the recipient who, using his matching set of one-time pads, could reverse the process and read the secure message.

Another method Space Track later had was a secure teletypewriter machine that had a pre-punched paper tape attached.  The tape served to garble each letter typed, which could then be decrypted by a reverse procedure at the other end of the teletypewriter line.  This system was used to communicate with Air Force Intelligence at the Pentagon. More sophisticated cryptographic equipment was available later.

In addition to data communications, Space Track published a series of technical reports. (e.g. see References,&lt;ref name="M&amp;W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W&amp;D"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Beat"/&gt;).

Dr. Wahl presented detailed descriptions of Space Track activity at the first two

[Cited in Fitzpatrick and Findley, not held at National  Museum of the United States Air Force.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Dr. Curtis and Lt Cotter made a similar presentation in 1960.&lt;ref name = "Curtis"&gt;Curtis, Harold O. and Cotter, Lawrence R.:  "The Operation of the National Space Surveillance Control Center."

===Contractors===
In 1960, [[Aeronutronic]], a division, of the Ford Motor Company, had a contract with Space Track to develop improved methods of predicting the orbits of decaying satellites, a computer program called Spiral Decay, and for other software for new computers in the new building. (Aeronutronic had been hired to do a system analysis of the control center on 1 October 1959.&lt;ref name="Press b"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  Detailed reports of this and other Aeronutronic support of Project Space Track are on file at the offices of Lockheed Martin (formerly Loral Corporation) in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  An index of the reports is at the National Museum of the Air Force.&lt;ref name = "Loral"&gt;[Mansfield, Roger L. et al.]. Index/History for the Aeronutronic Astrodynamics Collection.   Loral Corporation.  Colorado Springs CO: September 1993&lt;/ref&gt;)

Another very important group was the employees of Wolf R&amp;D Corporation (Concord, Massachusetts), which did programming and had the contract for operating computers at the NSSCC, including the IBM 7090 mainframe.

The '''Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite''' ('''SWAS''') is a [[NASA]] [[submillimeter astronomy]] satellite, and is the third spacecraft in the [[Small Explorer program]]. It was launched on December 6, 1998 (UTC), from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] aboard a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus XL]] rocket.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt; The telescope was designed by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] and integrated by [[Ball Aerospace]], while the spacecraft was built by NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name="Melnick2000"/&gt; The mission's [[principal investigator]] is Gary J. Melnick.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

== Mission ==
SWAS was designed to study the composition and structure of [[interstellar cloud]]s and investigate the processes of [[nebular hypothesis|stellar and planetary formation]].&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt; Its sole instrument is a telescope operating in the submillimeter wavelengths of [[far infrared]] and [[microwave]] radiation. The telescope is composed of three main components: a {{convert|55|xx|71|cm|abbr=on}} elliptical off-axis [[Cassegrain reflector]],&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harv-inst"/&gt; two [[Schottky diode]] receivers, and an [[acousto-optical spectrometer]].&lt;ref name="Melnick2000"/&gt; The system is sensitive to frequencies between 487–557 [[Gigahertz|GHz]] (538–616 [[micrometre|μm]]), which allows it to focus on the [[spectral line]]s of molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at 487.249 GHz; neutral [[carbon]] ({{Smallcaps|C i}}) at 492.161 GHz; isotopic [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) at 548.676 GHz; isotopic [[carbon monoxide]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO) at 550.927 GHz; and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) at 556.936 GHz.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melnick2000"/&gt;

== History ==
The Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite mission was approved on April 1, 1989. The project began with the Mission Definition Phase, officially starting on September 29, 1989, and running through January 31, 1992. During this time, the mission underwent a [[System lifecycle#Conceptual design|conceptual design]] [[design review|review]] on June 8, 1990, and a demonstration of the Schottky receivers and acousto-optical spectrometer concept was performed on November 8, 1991.&lt;ref name="Tolls2004"/&gt;

The mission's Development Phase ran from February 1992, through May 1996. The Submillimeter Wave Telescope underwent a [[preliminary design review]] on May 13, 1992, and a [[critical design review]] on February 23, 1993. [[Ball Aerospace]] was responsible for the construction of and integration of components into the telescope. The [[University of Cologne]] delivered the acousto-optical spectrometer to Ball for integration into the telescope on December 2, 1993, while [[Millitech Corporation]] delivered the Schottky receivers to Ball on June 20, 1994. Ball delivered the finished telescope to [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] on December 20, 1994. Goddard, which was responsible for construction of the spacecraft bus, conducted integration of spacecraft and instrument from January through March 1995. Spacecraft qualification and testing took place between April 1, 1995, and December 15, 1995. After this, SWAS was placed into storage until September 1, 1998, when launch preparation was begun.&lt;ref name="Tolls2004"/&gt;

The spacecraft was delivered to [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] at Vandenberg Air Force Base on November 2, 1998, for integration onto their [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus XL]] rocket.&lt;ref name="Tolls2004"/&gt; Launch occurred on December 6, 1998, at 00:57&amp;nbsp;UTC, from Orbital Sciences' ''[[Stargazer (aircraft)|Stargazer]]'' [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|L-1011 TriStar]] mothership.&lt;ref name="nssdc-launch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harv-launch"/&gt; Its initial orbit was a near-circular {{convert|638|xx|651|km|mi|abbr=on}} with an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 69.9 degrees.&lt;ref name="nssdc-launch"/&gt;

SWAS was originally scheduled to launch in June 1995, but was delayed due to back-to-back launch failures of the Pegasus XL rocket in June 1994 and June 1995. A launch opportunity in January 1997 was again canceled due to a Pegasus XL launch failure in November 1996.&lt;ref name="Cowen1997"/&gt;

The commissioning phase of the mission lasted until December 19, 1998, when the telescope began producing useful science data.&lt;ref name="lambda-prod"/&gt; The SWAS mission had a planned duration of two years and a cost estimate of {{US$|60 million}},&lt;ref name="Cowen1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smd-swas"/&gt; but mission extensions allowed for five and a half years of continuous science operations. During this time, data was taken on more than 200 astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="Tolls2004"/&gt; The decision was made to end science and spacecraft operations on July 21, 2004, at which time the spacecraft was placed into hibernation.&lt;ref name="Rumerman2009"/&gt;

To support the ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' mission at comet [[9P/Tempel]], SWAS was brought out of hibernation on June 1, 2005. Vehicle check-out was completed on June 5 with no discernible degradation of equipment found. SWAS observations of the comet focused on isotopic water output both before and after the ''Deep Impact'' impactor struck the comet's nucleus on July 4. While water output was found to naturally vary by more than a factor of three during the observation campaign, SWAS data showed that there was no excessive release of water due to the impact event. After three months of observation, SWAS was once again placed into hibernation on September 1, 2005.&lt;ref name="Bensch2006"/&gt;

{{As of|2015}}, SWAS remains in Earth orbit on stand-by.

The formation is located in [[Magallanes Region]] in southern [[Patagonia]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. The bulk of the formation originates from [[felsic|silicic]] [[pyroclast|pyroclastic material]] during a period of [[bimodal volcanism]] in [[Magallanes Basin|Rocas Verdes Basin]], a [[rift]] [[sedimentary basin|basin]].&lt;ref name=Fild&gt;Fildani, Andrea, Romans, B.W., Fosdick, J.C., Crane, W.H., and Hubbard, S.M.

[[file:Greek - Procession of Twelve Gods and Goddesses - Walters 2340.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Fragment of a [[Hellenistic]] [[relief sculpture|relief]] (1st century BC{{endash}}1st century AD) depicting the twelve Olympians carrying their attributes in procession; from left to right, Hestia (scepter), Hermes (winged cap and staff), Aphrodite (veiled), Ares (helmet and spear), Demeter (scepter and wheat sheaf), Hephaestus (staff), Hera (scepter), Poseidon (trident), Athena (owl and helmet), Zeus (thunderbolt and staff), Artemis (bow and quiver), Apollo (lyre), from the [[Walters Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walters Art Museum]], [http://art.thewalters.org/detail/38764 accession number 23.40].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], the '''twelve Olympians''' are the major deities of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], commonly considered to be [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Athena]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Ares]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], and either [[Hestia]] or [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;pg=PA250 p. 250]; Burkert, pp. 125 ff.; Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]; Chadwick, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;pg=PA85 p. 85]; Müller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qoIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA419 pp. 419 ff.]; Pache, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lNV6-HsUppsC&amp;pg=RA2-PA308 pp. 308 ff.]; Thomas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9CUxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35 p. 12]; Shapiro, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7q1LDrb9btkC&amp;pg=PT362 p. 362]; Long, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA140 pp. 140&amp;ndash;141]; Morford, p. 113; Hard [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA80 p. 80].&lt;/ref&gt; They were called 'Olympians' because, according to tradition, they resided on [[Mount Olympus]].

Although [[Hades]] was a major ancient Greek god, and was the brother of the first generation of Olympians (Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia), he resided in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], far from Olympus, and thus was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians.

Besides the twelve Olympians, there were many other cultic groupings of twelve gods.

==Olympians==
The Olympians were a race of [[deity|deities]], primarily consisting of a third and fourth generation of immortal beings, worshipped as the principal gods of the Greek [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and so named because of their residency atop [[Mount Olympus]]. They gained their supremacy in a ten-year-long [[Titanomachy|war of gods]], in which Zeus led his siblings to victory over the previous generation of ruling gods, the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]. They were a family of gods, the most important consisting of the first generation of Olympians, offspring of the Titans [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]: [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hera]], [[Demeter]] and [[Hestia]], along with the principal offspring of Zeus: [[Athena]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Ares]], [[Aphrodite]],&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Homer]], Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.374 3.374], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:20.105 20.105]; ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.308 8.308], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.320 320]) and Dione (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.370 5.370&amp;ndash;71]), see Gantz, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100. However, According to [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+183 183&amp;ndash;200], Aphrodite was born from Uranus' severed genitals, see Gantz, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], and [[Dionysus]]. Although [[Hades]] was a major deity in the Greek [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]], and was the brother of Zeus and the other first generation of Olympians, his realm was far away from Olympus in the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], and thus he was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;pg=PA250 p. 250]; Morford, p. 113; Hard [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA80 p. 80].&lt;/ref&gt; Olympic gods can be contrasted to [[chthonic]] gods&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RMj7M_tGaNMC&amp;pg=PA85 p. 85].&lt;/ref&gt; including Hades, by mode of sacrifice, the latter receiving sacrifices in a ''[[bothros]]'' (βόθρος, "pit") or ''[[megaron]]'' (μέγαρον, "sunken chamber")&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A4YyVL0sygAC&amp;pg=PA114 p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt; rather than at an altar.

The canonical number of Olympian gods was twelve, but besides the (thirteen) principal Olympians listed above, there were many other residents of Olympus, who thus might be called Olympians.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA2, pp. 2&amp;ndash;3]; Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]; Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;pg=PA250 p. 250]; Burkert, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heracles]] became a resident of Olympus after his [[apotheosis]] and married another Olympian resident [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D43 2.43–44].&lt;/ref&gt; Some others who might be considered Olympians, include: the [[Muses]], the [[Graces]], [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]], [[Eileithyia]], the [[Horae]], and [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]].&lt;ref&gt;Just who might be called an Olympian is not entirely clear. For example Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43], describes Heracles, Hebe, the Muses, and the Graces as Olympians, and on [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA45 p. 45], lists Iris, Dione, and Eileithyia among the Homeric Olympians, while Hansen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;pg=PA250 p. 250], describes Heracles, Hebe, the Horae, and Ganymede as notable residents of Olympus, but says they "are not ordinarily classified as Olympians".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twelve gods==
Besides the twelve Olympians, there were many other various cultic groupings of twelve gods throughout ancient Greece. The earliest evidence of Greek religious practice involving twelve gods ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: δωδεκάθεον, ''dodekatheon'', from δώδεκα ''dōdeka'', "twelve" and θεοί ''theoi'', "gods") comes no earlier than the late sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]; Rutherford, p. 43;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thucydides]], an [[Altar of the Twelve Gods|altar of the twelve gods]] was established in the [[agora]] of [[Ancient Athens|Athens]] by the [[archon]] Pisistratus (son of [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], and the grandson of the tyrant [[Pisistratus]]), in  c. 522 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, pp. 43&amp;ndash;44; [[Thucydides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0105%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D54 6.54.6-7].&lt;/ref&gt; The altar became the central point from which distances from Athens were measured and a place of supplication and refuge.&lt;ref&gt;Gadbery, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] apparently also had an early tradition of twelve gods.&lt;ref&gt;Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]; Rutherford, p. 44; Long, pp. 58&amp;ndash;62 (T 13), 154&amp;ndash;157.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Hermes]]'' (c. 500 BC) has the god [[Hermes]] divide a sacrifice of two cows he has stolen from Apollo, into twelve parts, on the banks of the river [[Alfeios|Alpheius]] (presumably at Olympia):
:"Next glad-hearted Hermes dragged the rich meats he had prepared and put them on a smooth, flat stone, and divided them into twelve portions distributed by lot, making each portion wholly honorable."&lt;ref&gt;Long, pp. 61–62 (T 13 G), 156–157; ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Hermes]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=D804873CE4D29E774667567AC3A6A3E0?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D4%3Acard%3D94 128&amp;ndash;129].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pindar, in an ode written to be sung at Olympia c. 480 BC, has [[Heracles]] sacrificing, alongside the Alpheius, to the "twelve ruling gods":&lt;ref&gt;Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]; Rutherford, p. 44; Long, pp. 59&amp;ndash;60 (T 13 C), 154&amp;ndash;155.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He [Heracles] enclosed the [[Altis]] all around and marked it off in the open, and he made the encircling area a resting-place for feasting, honoring the stream of the Alpheus along with the twelve ruling gods."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D10 10.49].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Pindar's Olympian odes mentions "six double altars".&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, p. 44; Long, pp. 58 (T 13 A), 154; [[Pindar]], ''Olympian''   [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0033.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5 5.5].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodorus of Heraclea]] (c. 400 BC) also has Heracles founding a shrine at Olympia, with six pairs of gods, each pair sharing a single altar.&lt;ref&gt;Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]; Rutherford, p. 47; Long, pp. 58&amp;ndash;59 (T 13 B), 154; ''FGrH'' 31 F34a-b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other places had cults of the twelve gods, including [[Delos]], [[Chalcedon]], [[Magnesia on the Maeander]], and [[Leontinoi]] in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, p. 45; Delos: Long, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 11], [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 87&amp;ndash;90] (T 26), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA182 182]; Chaledon: Long, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56 56]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57] (T 11 D), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 217]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218 218]; Magnesia on the Maeander: Long, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA53 pp. 53&amp;ndash;54] (T 7), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA221 221]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 223]; Leontinoi: Long, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 95]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA96 96] (T 32), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA157 p. 157].&lt;/ref&gt; As with the twelve Olympians, although the number of gods was fixed at twelve, the membership varied.&lt;ref&gt;Long, pp. 360&amp;ndash;361, lists 54 Greek (and Roman) gods, including the thirteen Olympians mentioed above, who have been identified as members of one or more cultic groupings of twelve gods.&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of the gods included as members of these other cults of twelve gods were Olympians, non-Olympians were also sometimes included. For example, Herodorus of Heraclea identified the six pairs of gods at Olympia as: Zeus and Poseidon, Hera and Athena, Hermes and Apollo, the Graces and Dionysus, Artemis and [[Alpheus (deity)|Alpheus]], and [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]].&lt;ref&gt;Dowden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]; Rutherford, p. 47; Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81]; Long, pp. 58&amp;ndash;59 (T 13 B), 141, 154; ''FGrH'' 31 F34a-b.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus while this list includes the eight Olympians: Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Athena, Hermes, Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysus, it also contains three clear non-Olympians: the Titan parents of the first generation of Olympians, Cronus and Rhea, and the river god Alpheius, with the status of the Graces (here apparently counted as one god) being unclear.

[[Plato]] connected "twelve gods" with the twelve months, and implies that he considered [[Pluto (mythology)#In Greek literature and philosophy|Pluto]] one of the twelve in proposing that the final month be devoted to him and the spirits of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, pp. 45&amp;ndash;46; [[Plato]], ''[[Laws (Plato)|The Laws]]'' 828 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166%3Abook%3D8%3Asection%3D828b b-d]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman poet [[Ennius]] gives the [[interpretatio graeca|Roman equivalents]] (the ''[[Dii Consentes]]'') as six male-female complements,&lt;ref name="PapAm"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greek mythology|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Americana|year=1993|volume=13|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; preserving the place of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] (Greek Hestia), who played a crucial role in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] as a state goddess maintained by the [[Vestals]].

==List==
There is no single canonical list of the twelve Olympian gods. The thirteen gods and goddesses most commonly considered to be one of the twelve Olympians are listed below.

Most listings include either one or the other of the following deities as one of the twelve Olympians.

;Notes
&lt;li&gt;{{note label|apoll|B|^}} Romans also associated Phoebus with [[Helios]] and the [[sun]] itself,&lt;ref&gt;North John A., Beard Mary, Price Simon R.F. "The Religions of Imperial Rome". ''Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology''. (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p.259. {{ISBN|0-521-31682-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hacklin, Joseph. "The Mythology of Persia". ''Asiatic Mythology'' (Asian Educational Services, 1994), p.38. {{ISBN|81-206-0920-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, they also used the Greek name ''Apollon'' in a Latinized form ''Apollo''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses|Met.]]'' I 441, 473, II 454, 543, 598, 612, 641, XII 585, XVIII 174, 715, 631, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{note label|gen|A|^}} According to an alternate version of her birth, Aphrodite was born of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], Zeus' grandfather, after [[Cronus]] threw his castrated genitals into the sea. This supports the etymology of her name, "foam-born". As such, Aphrodite would belong to the same generation as Cronus, Zeus' father, and would be Zeus' aunt. ''See [[Aphrodite#Birth|the birth of Aphrodite]]''

'''USS ''Flying Fish''''' (1838), a [[schooner]], was formerly the [[New York City]] [[pilot boat]] ''Independence''. Purchased by the [[United States Navy]] at New York City on 3 August 1838 and upon joining her squadron in [[Hampton Roads]] 12 August 1838 was placed under command of Passed [[Midshipman]] S. R. Knox.

Assigned as a [[Ship's tender|tender]] in the [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842|U.S. Exploring Expedition]] of 1838&amp;ndash;42 commanded by Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]], ''Flying Fish'' sailed with her squadron 19 August 1838 to visit [[Madeira]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] while bound for [[Tierra del Fuego]], where the squadron arrived early in 1839. From this point, the squadron made its first cruises toward the [[Antarctica|Antarctic Continent]], which it was to discover later the same year after surveys among Pacific islands and a visit to [[Australia]].

After the second penetration of the Antarctic, the squadron rendezvoused in [[New Zealand]] in April 1840 to survey Pacific islands northward toward the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiians]], where the ships were repaired late in the year. ''Flying Fish'' sailed with {{USS|Peacock|1828|6}} to resurvey some of the [[Samoan Islands|Samoan]], [[Ellice Islands|Ellice]], [[Gilbert Islands|Kingsmill]], and [[Pescadore Islands]] before joining the main body of the squadron on the northwest coast of America in July 1841. ''Flying Fish'' made surveys in the [[Columbia River]] and around [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], then proceeded to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], from which the squadron sailed 1 November for the south Pacific. Arriving in the [[Philippines]] in mid-January 1842 ''Flying Fish'' and the other ships separated to cruise the [[Sulu Sea]]s, then make a planned rendezvous at [[Singapore]] in February. 

Found unfit for further service, ''Flying Fish'' was sold there before the squadron sailed for home 26 February.&lt;ref name=Stanton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=William|title=The Great United States Exploring Expedition|date=1975|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520025571|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46150">'''Viral marketing''' or '''viral advertising''' is a business strategy that uses existing social networks to promote a product. Its name refers to how consumers spread information about a product with other people in their [[social network]]s, much in the same way that a virus spreads from one person to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketing-schools.org/types-of-marketing/viral-marketing.html|title=Viral Marketing {{!}} What is Viral Marketing?|website=www.marketing-schools.org|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be delivered by [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word of mouth]] or enhanced by the network effects of the [[Internet]] and [[mobile network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2005-06-22-viral-usat_x.htm | title=USAToday: Viral advertising spreads through marketing plans | work=USA Today | first1=Theresa | last1=Howard | date=2005-06-23 | accessdate=2010-05-27}} June 23, 2005, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often misused or misunderstood,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpromote.com/blog/the-truth-about-viral-marketing-part-1/|title=The Truth About Viral Marketing, Part 1|work=Wpromote|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/time-rethink-viral-marketing/147753/|title=Why It's Time to Rethink Viral Marketing|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as people apply it to any successful enough story without taking into account the word "viral".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F. Wilson|first=R|date=2000-01-01|title=The Six Simple Principles of Viral Marketing|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248011965_The_Six_Simple_Principles_of_Viral_Marketing|journal=Web Marketing Today|volume=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viral advertising is personal and, while coming from an identified sponsor, it does not mean businesses pay for its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Viral Marketing. The Science of Sharing. Karen Nelson-Field. OUP University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the well-known viral ads circulating online are ads paid by a sponsor company, launched either on their own platform (company webpage or [[social media]] profile) or on social media websites such as YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;Viral Marketing and Social Networks. Maria Petrescu. Business Expert Press&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers receive the page link from a social media network or copy the entire ad from a website and pass it along through e-mail or posting it on a blog, webpage or social media profile. Viral marketing may take the form of [[video clip]]s, interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] games, [[advergame]]s, [[ebook]]s, [[brandable software]], [[image]]s, [[SMS marketing|text messages]], [[email]] messages, or [[web page]]s. The most commonly utilized transmission vehicles for viral messages include: pass-along based, incentive based, trendy based, and undercover based. However, the creative nature of viral marketing enables an "endless amount of potential forms and vehicles the messages can utilize for transmission", including mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ndgraphic.com/viral-marketing/|title=Viral Marketing|date=30 July 2012|publisher=Night &amp; Day Graphics|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate goal of marketers interested in creating successful viral marketing programs is to create [[viral messages]] that appeal to individuals with high [[social networking potential]] (SNP) and that have a high probability of being presented and spread by these individuals and their competitors in their communications with others in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://videomarketingbot.com/blog/viral-marketing-understanding-the-latest-catchword/|title=Viral Marketing – Understanding the Latest Catchword|date=11 September 2012|publisher=Video Marketing Bot Pro|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "viral marketing" has also been used [[pejorative]]ly to refer to [[stealth marketing]] campaigns—marketing strategies that advertise a product to people without  them knowing they are being marketed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.marketing-schools.org/types-of-marketing/stealth-marketing.html | title=Stealth Marketing |date=2012|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The emergence of "viral marketing", as an approach to advertisement, has been tied to the popularization of the notion that ideas spread like viruses. The field that developed around this notion, memetics, peaked in popularity in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="memes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2012 | title = The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999 | url = | journal = [[Perspectives on Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 75–104 | doi = 10.1162/POSC_a_00057 }} (This is an [[open access]] article, made freely available courtesy of [[MIT Press]].)&lt;/ref&gt; As this then began to influence marketing [[guru]]s, it took on a life of its own in that new context.

The term viral strategy was first used in marketing in 1995, in a pre-digital marketing era, by a strategy team at Chiat/Day advertising in LA (now TBWA LA) for the launch of the first PlayStation for Sony Computer Entertainment.  Born from a need to combat huge target cynicism the insight was that people reject things pushed at them but seek out things that elude them. Chiat/Day created a 'stealth' campaign to go after influencers/opinion leaders, using street teams for the first time in brand marketing and layered an intricate omni-channel web of info and intrigue.  Insiders picked up on it and spread the word. Within 6 months PlayStation was number one in its category—Sony's most successful launch in history.

There is debate on the origination and  the popularization of the specific term ''viral marketing'', though some of the earliest uses of the current term are attributed to the [[Harvard Business School]] graduate [[Tim Draper]] and faculty member [[Jeffrey Rayport]]. The term was later popularized by Rayport in the 1996 [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']] article "The Virus of Marketing",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/27701/virus-marketing|title=The Virus of Marketing|last=Rayport|first=Jeffrey|date=31 December 1996|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim Draper and [[Steve Jurvetson]] of the venture capital firm [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]] in 1997 to describe [[Hotmail]]'s practice of appending advertising to outgoing mail from their users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Among the first to write about viral marketing on the Internet was the [[media critic]] [[Doug Rushkoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Media Virus! Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture|publisher=Ballantine Books|date=6 February 1996|isbn=0345397746|url=https://www.amazon.com/Media-Hidden-Agendas-Popular-Culture/dp/0345397746}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that if such an advertisement reaches a "susceptible" user, that user becomes "infected" (i.e., accepts the idea) and shares the idea with others "infecting them", in the viral analogy's terms. As long as each infected user shares the idea with more than one susceptible user on average (i.e., the [[basic reproductive rate]] is greater than one—the standard in [[epidemiology]] for qualifying something as an [[epidemic]]), the number of infected users grows according to an [[exponential function|exponential curve]]. Of course, the marketing campaign may be successful even if the message spreads more slowly, if this user-to-user sharing is sustained by other forms of marketing communications, such as public relations or advertising.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Bob Gerstley was among the first to write about [[algorithm]]s designed to identify people with high "social networking potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerstley|first=Bob|title=Advertising Research is Changing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerstley employed SNP algorithms in quantitative marketing research. In 2004, the concept of the ''[[Social marketing intelligence#Alpha users|alpha user]]'' was coined to indicate that it had now become possible to identify the focal members of any viral campaign, the "hubs" who were most influential. Alpha users could be targeted for advertising purposes most accurately in [[mobile phone]] networks, due to their personal nature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In early 2013 the first ever Viral Summit was held in Las Vegas. It attempted to identify similar trends in viral marketing methods for various media.

== Why viral ==
This exponential growth is not infinite, because customers, people, are finite. This ceiling is called carrying capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://20bits.com/article/three-myths-of-viral-growth|title=Three Myths of Viral Growth|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What makes things go viral==
According to the book ''Contagious: Why Things Catch On'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Contagious-Why-Things-Catch-On/dp/1451686579/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0|title=Contagious: Why Things Catch On|first=search|last=results|date=5 March 2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are six key factors that drive virality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3006693/fifty-percent-of-the-tipping-point-is-wrong-jonah-berger-shows-you-which-half|title="Fifty Percent Of ‘The Tipping Point’ Is Wrong." Jonah Berger Shows You Which Half|date=18 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are organized in an acronym called STEPPS which stands for:
* '''Social Currency''' – the better something makes people look, the more likely they will be to share it
* '''Triggers''' – things that are top of mind are more likely to be tip of tongue
* '''Emotion''' – when we care, we share
* '''Public''' – the easier something is to see, the more likely people are to imitate it
* '''Practical Value''' – people share useful information to help others
* '''Stories''' – Trojan Horse stories carry messages and ideas along for the ride

==Methods and metrics==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=January 2013}}
According to marketing professors [[Andreas Kaplan]] and Michael Haenlein, to make viral marketing work, three basic criteria must be met, i.e., giving the right message to the right messengers in the right environment:&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan Andreas M., Haenlein Michael (2011) Two hearts in three-quarter time: How to waltz the Social Media/viral marketing dance, Business Horizons, 54(3), 253–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Messenger:''' Three specific types of messengers are required to ensure the transformation of an ordinary message into a viral one: market [[maven]]s, social hubs, and salespeople. Market mavens are individuals who are continuously 'on the pulse' of things (information specialists); they are usually among the first to get exposed to the message and who transmit it to their immediate social network. Social hubs are people with an exceptionally large number of social connections; they often know hundreds of different people and have the ability to serve as connectors or bridges between different subcultures. Salespeople might be needed who receive the message from the market maven, amplify it by making it more relevant and persuasive, and then transmit it to the social hub for further distribution. Market mavens may not be particularly convincing in transmitting the information.
#'''Message:''' Only messages that are both memorable and sufficiently interesting to be passed on to others have the potential to spur a viral marketing phenomenon. Making a message more memorable and interesting or simply more infectious, is often not a matter of major changes but minor adjustments. It should be unique and engaging with a main idea that motivates the recipient to share it widely with friends – a "must-see" element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Media Museum|url=http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/~/media/Files/NMeM/PDF/Collections/NewMedia/WhatIsViralMarketing.pdf|website=National Media Museum|accessdate=25 May 2015|title=What is Viral Marketing? }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Environment:''' The environment is crucial in the rise of successful viral marketing – small changes in the environment lead to huge results, and people are much more sensitive to environment. The timing and context of the campaign launch must be right.

Whereas Kaplan, Haenlein and others reduce the role of marketers to crafting the initial viral message and seeding it, futurist and sales and marketing analyst Marc Feldman, who conducted IMT Strategies' viral marketing study in 2001,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} carves a different role for marketers which pushes the 'art' of viral marketing much closer to 'science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2001-03-18/viral-marketing-alert|title=Viral Marketing Alert!|last=Neuborne|first=Ellen|date=18 March 2001|publisher=BusinessWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metrics===
To clarify and organize the information related to potential measures of viral campaigns, the key measurement possibilities should be considered in relation to the objectives formulated for the viral campaign. In this sense, some of the key cognitive outcomes of viral marketing activities can include measures such as the number of views, clicks, and hits for specific content, as well as the number of shares in [[social media]], such as likes on Facebook or retweets on Twitter, which demonstrate that consumers processed the information received through the marketing message. Measures such as the number of reviews for a product or the number of members for a campaign webpage quantify the number of individuals who have acknowledged the information provided by marketers. Besides statistics that are related to online traffic, surveys can assess the degree of product or brand knowledge, though this type of measurement is more complicated and requires more resources.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, M. 2014. Viral marketing and social networks. Business Expert Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, I. (ed.). 2014. Integrating Social Media into Business Practice, Applications, Management, and Models, Advances in E-Business Research (AEBR) Book Series&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to consumers' attitudes toward a brand or even toward the marketing communication, different online and social media statistics, including the number of likes and shares within a social network, can be used. The number of reviews for a certain brand or product and the quality assessed by users are indicators of attitudes. Classical measures of consumer attitude toward the brand can be gathered through surveys of consumers.
Behavioral measures are very important because changes in consumers' behavior and buying decisions are what marketers hope to see through viral campaigns. There are numerous indicators that can be used in this context as a function of marketers' objectives. Some of them include the most known online and social media statistics such as number and quality of shares, views, product reviews, and comments. Consumers' brand engagement can be measured through the K-factor, the number of followers, friends, registered users, and time spent on the website. Indicators that are more bottom-line oriented focus on consumers' actions after acknowledging the marketing content, including the number of requests for information, samples, or test-drives. Nevertheless, responses to actual call-to-action messages are important, including the conversion rate.
Consumers' behavior is expected to lead to contributions to the bottom line of the company, meaning increase in sales, both in quantity and financial amount. However, when quantifying changes in sales, managers need to consider other factors that could potentially affect sales besides the viral marketing activities. Besides positive effects on sales, the use of viral marketing is expected to bring significant reductions in marketing costs and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson-Field, K. 2013. Viral Marketing The Science of Sharing. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, M. 2014. Viral marketing and social networks. Business Expert Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
Viral marketing often involves and utilizes: 
* Customer participation and polling services
* Industry-specific organization contributions
* [[Web search engine]]s and [[blog]]s
* Mobile [[smartphone]] integration
* Multiple forms of print and [[direct marketing]]
* Target marketing [[web services]]
* [[Search engine optimization]] (SEO)
* [[Social media optimization]] (SMO)
* [[Television]] and [[radio]]
* [[Influencer marketing]]

Viral target marketing is based on three important principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xing.com/net/contentmanagement/online-marketing-und-web-analysis-19503/spread-the-words-through-viral-marketing-36573140|title=Spread the Words through Viral Marketing|last=Pariñas|first=Jerico|date=28 April 2011|publisher=XING|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Social profile gathering
# Proximity market analysis
# Real-time key word density analysis

By applying these three important disciplines to an advertising model, a VMS company is able to match a client with their targeted customers at a cost effective advantage.

The Internet makes it possible for a campaign to go viral very fast; it can, so to speak, make a brand famous overnight. However, the Internet and social media technologies themselves do not make a brand viral; they just enable people to share content to other people faster. Therefore, it is generally agreed that a campaign must typically follow a certain set of guidelines in order to potentially be successful:
* It must be appealing to most of the audience.  
* It must be worth sharing with friends and family. 
* A large platform, e.g. YouTube or Facebook must be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://growmap.com/youtube-viral-marketing/|title=How YouTube Can Be Used for Viral Marketing|last=Maqsood|first=Umair|date=28 October 2012|publisher=GrowMap|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An initial boost to gain attention is used, e.g. [[Seeding agency|seeding]], buying views, or sharing to Facebook fans.
* The content is of good quality.

== Social networking==
The growth of [[social networking service|social network]]s significantly contributed to the effectiveness of viral marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Grifoni Patrizia, Ferri Fernando, D'Andrea Alessia (2013). An integrated framework for on-line viral marketing campaign planning in International journal of business research (Toronto); Canadian Center of Science and Education, Toronto (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2009, two thirds of the world's Internet population visits a [[social networking service]] or [[blog]] site at least every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/global/social-networking-new-global-footprint/|title=Social Networking's New Global Footprint|date=9 March 2009|publisher=Nielsen Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] alone has over 1 billion active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.fb.com/content/default.aspx?NewsAreaId=22|title=Key Facts|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=6 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919193027/http://newsroom.fb.com/content/default.aspx?NewsAreaId=22|archive-date=19 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, time spent visiting [[social media]] sites began to exceed time spent emailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/nielsen-social-nets-overtake-e-mail-98620|title=Nielsen: Social Nets Overtake E-mail|last=Morrissey|first=Brian|date=9 March 2009|publisher=Adweek|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study found that 52% of people who view news online forward it on through social networks, email, or posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/03/01/social-networks-source-news/|title=Social Networks Play a Major Part in How We Get News|last=Schroeder|first=Stan|date=1 March 2010|publisher=Mashable.com|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social media ===
The introduction of social media has caused a change how viral marketing is used and the speed at which information is spread and users interact.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Botha|first=Elsamari|last2=Reyneke|first2=Mignon|date=2013|title=To share or not to share: the role of content and emotion in viral marketing|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pa.1471|journal=Journal of Public Affairs|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=160–171|doi=10.1002/pa.1471|issn=1472-3891|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has prompted many companies to use social media as a way to market themselves and their products, with Elsamari Botha and Mignon Reyneke stating that viral messages are "playing an increasingly important role in influencing and shifting public opinion on corporate reputations, brands, and products as well as political parties and public personalities to name but a few."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Influencers ==
'The influencers in order to communicate marketing messages to the audiences you seek to reach'.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin, P. 2007. The new influencers: A marketer's guide to the new social media. California: Quill Driver Books/Word Dancer Press, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; In business, it is indicated that people prefer interaction with humans to a logo.&lt;ref&gt;Ehlers, K. 2017. 2017: The Year of the Influencer.

Finally, the mass reached influencers are those who have a huge range of followers on the social network. Recent trend in businesses activity is to offer incentives to individual users for re-posting the advertisement messages to their own profiles. A common type of an incentive puts all the re-posting users into a random draw for a valuable gift &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semenov|first=Alexander|author2=Alexander Nikolaev|author3=Alexander Veremyev|author4=Vladimir Boginski|author5=Eduardo Pasiliao|title=Analysis of Viral Advertisement Re-Posting Activity in Social Media |journal= Computational Social Networks.

Marketers and agencies commonly consider celebrities as a good influencer with endorsement work. This conception is similar to celebrity marketing. Based on a survey, 69% of company marketing department and 74% of agencies are currently working with celebrities in the UK. The celebrity types come along with their working environment. Traditional celebrities are considered as singles, dancers, actors or models. These types of public characters are continuing to be the most commonly used by company marketers. The survey found that 4 in 10 company having worked with these traditional celebrities in the prior year. However, people these years are spending more time on social media rather than traditional media such as TV. The researchers also claim that customers are not firmly believed celebrities are effectively influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/movie-stars-matter-but-social-908042|title=Movie Stars Matter Most, but Social Media Stars Gain Traction Among Marketers|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/social-media-stars-becoming-more-influential-in-celebrity-marketing-68938/|title=Social Media Stars Becoming More Influential in Celebrity Marketing|date=2016-07-13|work=MarketingCharts|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media stars among a kind of influencer on viral marketing since consumers are spending more time on the Internet than before. And companies and agencies start to consider collaborating with social media stars as their product endorser.

Social media stars such as YouTuber [[Zoella]] or Instagrammer [[Aimee Song]] are followed by millions of people online. These online celebrities are having more connection and influence with their followers because they have more frequent and realistic conversation and interaction on the Internet in terms of comments or likes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketplace.org/2016/03/31/business/consumers-trust-social-media-stars-more-celebrities-or-ads|title=Consumers trust social media stars more than celebrities or ads|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend captured by marketers who are used to explore new potential customers. Agencies are placing social media stars alongside singers and musicians at the top of the heap of celebrity types they had worked with. And there are more than 28% of company marketers having worked with one social media celebrity in the previous year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Risks of using the wrong influencer ===

==== Risks for the company ====
The main risk coming from the company is for it to target the wrong influencer or segment. Once the content is online, the sender won't be able to control it anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwiatkowska|first=Joanna|date=2009|title=Viral marketing in the internet, characteristics of an effective virus.|url=http://oeconomica.uab.ro/upload/lucrari/1120092/51.pdf|journal=Annales Universitatis Apulensis Series Oeconomica 11(2).|volume=|pages=1047–1054}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore vital to aim at a particular segment when releasing the message. This is what happened to the company BlendTech which released videos showing the blender could blend anything, and encouraged users to share videos. This mainly caught the attention of teenage boys who thought it funny to blend and destroy anything they could;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dembosky|first=April|date=March 2012|title=Viral campaigns: lights, camera, blender ! How to create a hit.|url=https://www.ft.com/content/24d3a6f8-6228-11e1-820b-00144feabdc0|journal=Financial Times|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the videos went viral, they did not target potential buyers of the product. This is considered to be one of the major factors that affects the success of the online promotion. It is critical and inevitable for the organisations to target the right audience. Another risk with internet is that a company's video could end up going viral on the other side of the planet where their products are not even for sale.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Ian|date=August 2006|title=Viral advertisers are playing with fire.|url=https://www.ft.com/content/86b7c214-36b9-11db-89d6-0000779e2340|journal=Financial Times|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Risks emanating from the influencers ====
According to a paper by Duncan Watts and colleagues entitled: "Everyone's an influencer",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watt|first=Duncan|last2=Bakshy|first2=Eytan|last3=Hofman|first3=Jake|last4=Winter|first4=Mason|date=2011|title=Everyone's an influencer: Quantifying influence on Twitter.|url=http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/bakshy11influencers.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on web search and data mining.|volume=|pages=65–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most common risk in viral marketing is that of the influencer not passing on the message, which can lead to the failure of the viral marketing campaign. A second risk is that the influencer modifies the content of the message. A third risk is that influencers pass on the wrong message. This can result from a misunderstanding or as a deliberate move.

Between 1996–1997, [[Hotmail]] was one of the first internet businesses to become extremely successful utilizing viral marketing techniques by inserting the tagline "Get your free e-mail at Hotmail" at the bottom of every e-mail sent out by its users. Hotmail was able to sign up 12 million users in 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/viralmark.htm|title=Are You Using The Dynamic Power of Viral Marketing?|last=Lloyd|first=Tony|publisher=Business Know-How}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this was historically the fastest growth of any user based media company.&lt;ref name="Subramani, R. 2003 p.300-307"&gt;Subramani, R., &amp; Rajagopalan, B.

In 2000, [[Slate.com]] described [[TiVo]]'s unpublicized gambit of giving free systems to web-savvy enthusiasts to create "viral" word of mouth, pointing out that a viral campaign differs from a [[publicity stunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/id/1006264/ | title=TiVo's Stealth Giveaway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Burger King]] has used several marketing campaigns. Its [[The Subservient Chicken]] campaign, running from 2004 until 2007, was an example of viral or word-of-mouth marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/03/66960 | title=Marketers Feverish Over Viral Ads | work=Wired | date=2005-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blendtec]] [[viral video]] series ''[[Will It Blend?]]'' debuted in 2006. In the show, Tom Dickson, Blendtec founder and CEO, attempts to blend various unusual items in order to show off the power of his blender. ''Will it Blend?'' has been nominated for the 2007 YouTube award for Best Series, winner of .Net Magazine's 2007 Viral Video campaign of the year and winner of the Bronze level [[Clio Award]] for Viral Video in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=2008 Clio Award Winners|url=http://www.clioawards.com/downloads/2008_Clio_Awards_Winners.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Blendtec claimed the top spot on the AdAge list of "Top 10 Viral Ads of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Top 10 Viral Ads of All Time|url=http://adage.com/article/the-viral-video-chart/digital-marketing-top-10-viral-ads-time/145673/|publisher=AdAge|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Will It Blend page on YouTube currently shows over 200 million video views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Will It Blend|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Blendtec/videos|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Big Word Project]], launched in 2008, aimed to redefine the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' by allowing people to submit their website as the definition of their chosen word.  The project, created to fund two Masters students' educations, attracted the attention of bloggers worldwide, and was featured on [[Daring Fireball]] and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha | title=Grad Students Redefine Easy Money With $1-a-Letter Web Site | work=Wired | date=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies may also be able to use a viral video that they did not create for marketing purposes.  A notable example is the viral video "The Extreme Diet Coke &amp; Mentos Experiments" created by Fritz Grobe and Stephen Voltz of [[Stephen Voltz|EepyBird]].  After the initial success of the video, Mentos was quick to offer its support.  They shipped EepyBird thousands of mints for their experiments.  Coke was slower to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-01-16/the-diet-coke-and-mentos-explosionbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=The Diet Coke and Mentos Explosion|first=Rachael|last=King|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2012, [[Dollar Shave Club]] launched their online video campaign. In the first 48 hours of their video debuting on YouTube they had over 12,000 people signing up for the service. The video cost just $4500 to make and as of November 2015 has had more than 21 million views. The video was considered as one of the best viral marketing campaigns of 2012 and won "Best Out-of-Nowhere Video Campaign" at the 2012 AdAge Viral Video Awards.

In 2014, A.L.S. [[Ice Bucket Challenge]] was among the best viral marketing challenges examples in the social network. Millions of people on the social media started filming themselves, pouring a bucket of ice water over their heads and sharing the video with their friends. The challenge was created to give support for fighting [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig's disease. People finished the challenge and then nominated the next person they knew on the social media to take the same challenge. By following this trend, Ice Bucket Challenge became a 'fab' on social media with many online celebrities such as [[Tyler Oakley]], [[Zoe Sugg]] and huge celebrities and entrepreneurs like [[Justin Bieber]], [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and [[Bill Gates]] participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/als-ice-bucket-challenge-why-it-worked-and-what-social-media-marketers-can-learn/|title=ALS Ice Bucket Challenge: Why it worked and what social media marketers can learn – TechRepublic|work=TechRepublic|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until September 2014, over 2.4 million ice bucket-related videos had been posted on Facebook, and 28 million people had uploaded, commented on or liked ice bucket-related posts. And about 3.7 million videos had been uploaded on Instagram with the hashtags #ALSicebucketchallenge and #icebucketchallenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29013707|title=How much has the ice bucket challenge achieved?|last=Townsend|first=Lucy|date=2014-09-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ALS association didn’t invent the ice bucket challenge, but they sure received a huge amount of donation from this activity.

[[Image:North america craton nps.gif|thumb|300 px|The North American Craton, also called [[Laurentia]]]]

The '''Wyoming Craton''' is a [[craton]] in the west-central United States and western Canada – more specifically, in [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], southern [[Alberta]], southern [[Saskatchewan]], and parts of northern [[Utah]]. Also called the '''Wyoming Province''', it is the initial core of the [[continental crust]] of North America.

The Wyoming Craton was [[Suture (geology)|sutured]] together with the [[Superior Craton|Superior]] and [[Hearne Craton|Hearne]]-[[Rae Craton|Rae]] cratons in the [[Orogeny|mountain-building episode]] that created the [[Trans-Hudson Suture Zone]] to form the core of North America ([[Laurentia]]). It was incorporated into southwest Laurentia approximately 1.86 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;

Local preservation of 3.6–3.0 Ga [[gneiss]]es and widespread [[isotope|isotopic]] evidence for crust of this age incorporated into younger [[plutons]] indicates that the Wyoming Craton originated as a 100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; middle [[Archean]] craton that was modified by late Archean volcanic magmatism and plate movements and [[Proterozoic]] extension and [[rift]]ing.&lt;ref name=Chanmberlain&gt;

The Wyoming, Superior and Hearne-Ray cratons were once sections of separate continents, but today they are all welded together. The collisions of these cratons began before ca. 1.77 [[Gigaannum|Ga]], with post-[[tectonic]] [[magmatism]] at ca. 1.715 Ga (the [[Harney Peak]] [[granite]]). This tectonic-magmatic interval is 50–60 million years younger than that reported for the Hearne-Superior collision of the [[Trans-Hudson orogeny]] in Canada.

Younger [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] dates (1.81–1.71 Ga) also typify the eastern and northern Wyoming province peripheries in the western [[The Dakotas|Dakotas]] and southeastern [[Montana]]. The final assembly of the eastern Wyoming Craton as part of the continent [[Laurentia]] began during the ca. 1.78–1.74 Ga interval of [[Volcanic arc|island-arc]] [[accretion (geology)|accretion]] along the southern margin of the growing craton.&lt;ref name=Dahl&gt;

==Geologic summary==
The [[Precambrian]] basement of Wyoming consists mainly of three major geologic [[terrane]]s, the [[Archean]] Wyoming Craton or Province, the [[Paleoproterozoic]] Trans-Hudson orogen, and the Paleoproterozoic [[Colorado orogeny]]. The Colorado orogen collided with the Wyoming Craton at 1.78–1.75 Ga. Collision of the Colorado orogen and the Trans-Hudson orogen with the Archean craton produced strong structural overprinting along the southern and eastern margins of the Wyoming craton.

The Wyoming Craton consists mainly of two gross&lt;!--is "gross" useful? does it signify "in large part" or "broadly speaking"?--&gt; rock units—granitoid [[pluton]]s (2.8–2.55 Ga) and [[gneiss]] and [[migmatite]]—together with subordinate (&lt;10 percent) supracrustal metavolcanic-metasedimentary rocks. The granitoid rocks are mainly potassic granite and were derived principally from reworked older (3.1–2.8 Ga) gneiss. Magnetic contrast between the granitoid rocks and gneiss provides a means to map these gross rock units in covered areas. The overall structural pattern of the Archean units shown by magnetic data is crudely semi-circular and open to the north.&lt;ref name=Sims&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sims, P. K., C. A.

==Wyoming province subdivisions==
The present-day lithospheric architecture of the Wyoming Province is the result of cumulative processes of crustal growth, tectonic modification, and lithospheric contrasts that have apparently persisted for billions of years.

The Wyoming [[Geologic province|province]] can be subdivided into three subprovinces, namely, from oldest to youngest, the Montana metasedimentary province, the Beartooth–Bighorn magmatic zone, and the Southern accreted terranes. Archean rocks of the Montana metasedimentary province and the Beartooth-Bighorn magmatic zone are characterized by (1) their antiquity (rock ages to 3.5 Ga, [[detrital]] [[zircon]] ages up to 4.0 Ga, and [[Nd model ages]] exceeding 4.0 Ga); (2) a distinctly enriched [[lead-207|&lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]]/[[lead-204|&lt;sup&gt;204&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]] [[isotope|isotopic]] signature, which suggests that this part of the province was not produced by the amalgamation of already-formed exotic terranes; and (3) a distinctively thick (15–20&amp;nbsp;km), [[mafic]] lower crust. The Montana metasedimentary province and Beartooth–Bighorn magmatic zone were established as cratons by about 3.0–2.8 Ga. Crustal growth occurred through a combination of [[Volcanic arc|continental-arc]] magmatism resulting from oceanic crust subducted beneath continental crust on an adjacent plate, creating an arc-shaped mountain belt, together with [[terrane accretion]] in the Southern accreted terranes along the southern margin of the province at 2.68–2.50 Ga. By the end of the Archean, the three subprovinces were joined as part of what is now the Wyoming craton. Subsequent to amalgamation of the Wyoming crust to Laurentia at ca. 1.8–1.9 Ga, Paleoproterozoic crust (1.7–2.4 Ga) was juxtaposed along the southern and western boundaries of the province. Subsequent tectonism and magmatism in the Wyoming region&lt;!--a new term: not province? not craton?--&gt; are concentrated in the areas underlain by these Proterozoic mobile belts.&lt;ref name=Mueller&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mueller, P. A.  |author2=C. D. Frost |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 2006 | title = The Wyoming Province: a distinctive Archean craton in Laurentian North America | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1391–1397 | url = http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/toc/cjes/43/10 | doi = 10.1139/E06-075|bibcode = 2006CaJES..43.1391M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by Kevin Chamberlain ''et al.'' (2003), on the basis of differences in late Archean histories, subdivides the Wyoming Province into five subprovinces: three in the Archean core, (1) the Montana metasedimentary province, (2) the Bighorn subprovince, and (3) the Sweetwater subprovince, and two Archean terrains that may have originated elsewhere (that is, allochthonous to the 3.0 Ga craton), (4) the Sierra Madre – Medicine Bow block, and (5) the Black Hills – Hartville block. Based on imaging by the "Deep Probe" analysis, a thick lower crustal layer corresponds geographically with the Bighorn subprovince and may be an underplate&lt;!--what is an "underplate"?--&gt; associated with ca. 2.70 Ga mafic magmatism. The Sweetwater subprovince is characterized by an east–west-tending tectonic grain that was established by three or more roughly contemporaneous late Archean, pulses of basin development, shortening, and arc magmatism. This tectonic grain, including the 2.62 Ga Oregon Trail structure, controlled the locations and orientations of Proterozoic rifting and uplifts related to the [[Laramide orogeny]]. If there has been any net crustal growth of the Wyoming Province since 3.0 Ga, it has involved a combination of mafic underplating and arc magmatism.&lt;ref name="Chanmberlain"/&gt;

==Accretion events==
During the [[Paleoproterozoic]], island-arc terrane associated with the [[Colorado orogeny]] accreted to the Wyoming Craton along the [[Cheyenne belt]], a 500-km-wide belt of Proterozoic rocks named for [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. As a result of the collision, older, Archean rocks of the Wyoming province were intensely deformed and metamorphosed for at least 75&amp;nbsp;km inboard from the suture, which is marked today by the Laramie Mountains. Along the east margin of the craton, collision with the Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson orogen intensely deformed Archean cratonic rocks in the Hartville uplift. &lt;!--already just mentioned but in a different context: "and the Laramie Mountains"--&gt;

Mesoproterozoic (~1.4 Ga) [[anorthosite]] and [[syenite]]s of the Laramie Anorthosite Complex and granite ([[ilmenite]]-bearing Sherman Granite) intrude into rocks of the Colorado orogen in the Laramie and adjacent [[Medicine Bow Mountains]]. Both the anorthosite and granite transect the Cheyenne belt in the Laramide Mountains, and intrude crystalline rocks of the Wyoming province. These intrusions comprise the northernmost segment of a wide belt of 1.4 Ga granitic intrusions that occur throughout the Colorado orogen.&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;

Long after its assembly, the Wyoming Craton owes its spectacular mountainous terranes mainly to a regional episode of compressional deformation during the [[Laramide orogeny]] (ca.60 Ma). The basement blocks composed of Precambrian rocks were uplifted locally to high levels in the crust during the deformation, and subsequent erosion has molded the uplifted rocks into the rugged present-day topography. Vertical displacement of the basement surface was as much as 30,000&amp;nbsp;ft. (9250 m). By contrast, in western Wyoming [[thrust fault]]ing, associated with the [[Sevier orogeny]] of approximately the same age, was thin-skinned, and the lack of disruption of magnetic anomalies in the region indicates that the basement rocks were little disturbed and not significantly uplifted during the thrusting. Even younger high-angle faulting of [[Pliocene]]–[[Pleistocene]] age has formed the [[Teton Range]]. Vertical relief on the east face of the mountains is about 25,000&amp;nbsp;ft. (7800 m).&lt;ref name="Sims"/&gt;
