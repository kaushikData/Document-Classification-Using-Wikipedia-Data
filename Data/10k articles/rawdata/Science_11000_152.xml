'''''An Inconvenient Book: Real Solutions to the World's Biggest Problems''''' is a  [[2007 in literature|2007]] political narrative written and edited by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[pundit (expert)|commentator]] [[Glenn Beck]]&lt;ref name = Beck&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = G | authorlink = Glenn Beck | title = An Inconvenient Book: Real Solutions to the World's Biggest Problems | location = New York | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-4165-5219-7 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The book's title page credits Beck and Kevin Balfe with writing and editing; credits additional writing to [[Steve Burguiere|Steve "Stu" Burguiere]], John Bobey, Dan Andros and Paul Starke; credits "contributions" to Carol Lynne, Virginia Leahy, Evan Cutler and Patricia Balfe; and credits illustrations to Paul Nunn.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation of the book's title==
The title of ''An Inconvenient Book'' is a parody of the title of [[Al Gore]]'s [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. One section of the book provides a critical response to Gore's views on [[global warming]].

==Issues discussed==
Beck discusses his political views on a number of subjects.  Issues include Beck’s claims that the free market provides the best way to fight [[global warming]], [[Divorce demography|divorce rates]], Beck's perceptions of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] bias on school campuses, the income gap, perceived [[anti-Americanism]] of the [[United Nations]], and [[illegal immigration]].

==Reception==
[[Publishers Weekly]] described ''An Inconvenient Book'' as "a good read for conservatives," referring to Beck's often lighthearted tone, "at his best when most absurd, and funniest when he's his own target."  On the content, the reviewer says "While often informative, as in his chapter on global warming, Beck is sometimes tedious, particularly when dealing with Islam and education (France is literally teetering on the edge, and our biggest ally, England, is about to be turned inside out as well)."&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000WJVLLG/mahalo-20/ An Inconvenient Book, Editorial Reviews], [[Amazon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Inconvenient Book'' entered [[The New York Times Best Seller List]] at Number 1 under the category Hardcover Nonfiction, and stayed in the list for 17 weeks.&lt;ref name="nytbs1209"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/bestseller/1209besthardnonfiction.html Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytbs0330"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/books/bestseller/0330besthardnonfiction.html Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1574">The '''Aquarius Stream''' is a [[Stellar_kinematics#Stellar_streams|stellar stream]] located in the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]]. It is so named because most of the stars in the stream lie in the direction of the [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius constellation]]. At its nearest point it is about 2000 light years from Earth; At its farthest it is about 30,000 light years away. It is the closest stellar stream to Earth yet found, and the youngest having formed about 700 million years ago. The stream was discovered in late 2010 by a team of astronomers involved in the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey led by [[New Zealand]]er Mary Williams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/02/110207-milky-way-galaxy-aquarius-stream-snack-space-science/ Galaxy "Crumbs" Found in Milky Way—Proof of Recent Feeding] National Geographic, Feb 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4661795"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4661795/Kiwi-astronomer-in-orbit-over-find |title=Kiwi astronomer 'in orbit' over find |author=Chug, Kiran |date=16 February 2011 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Synthesized attributes */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7440">An '''attribute grammar''' is a formal way to define [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] for the productions of a [[formal grammar]], associating these attributes with values. The evaluation occurs in the nodes of the [[abstract syntax tree]], when the language is processed by some [[parser]] or [[compiler]].

The attributes are divided into two groups: ''synthesized'' attributes and ''inherited'' attributes. The synthesized attributes are the result of the attribute evaluation rules, and may also use the values of the inherited attributes. The inherited attributes are passed down from parent nodes.

In some approaches, synthesized attributes are used to pass semantic information up the parse tree, while inherited attributes help pass semantic information down and across it. For instance, when constructing a language translation tool, such as a compiler, it may be used to assign semantic values to syntax constructions. Also, it is possible to validate semantic checks associated with a grammar, representing the rules of a language not explicitly imparted by the syntax definition.

Attribute grammars can also be used to translate the syntax tree directly into code for some specific machine, or into some [[intermediate language]].

One strength of attribute grammars is that they can transport information from anywhere in the abstract syntax tree to anywhere else, in a controlled and formal way.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==History==
Attribute grammars were invented by [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Peter Wegner]].&lt;ref name="genesis"&gt;D. E. Knuth: [http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/odelia/teaching/csc419_spring17/syllabus/Knuth_AttributeHistory.pdf The genesis of attribute grammars]. ''Proceedings of the international conference on Attribute grammars and their applications'' (1990), LNCS, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/w35h4669q16j/ vol. 461], 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; While Donald Knuth is credited for the overall concept, Peter Wegner invented inherited attributes during a conversation with Knuth. Some embryonic ideas trace back&lt;ref name="genesis"/&gt; to the work of Edgar T. "Ned" Irons&lt;ref&gt;http://zzcad.com/ned.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, the author of [[IMP (programming language)|IMP]].

==Example==
The following is a simple [[context-free grammar]] which can describe a language made up of multiplication and addition of integers.

  '''Expr''' &amp;rarr; '''Expr''' + '''Term'''
  '''Expr''' &amp;rarr; '''Term'''
  '''Term''' &amp;rarr; '''Term''' * '''Factor'''
  '''Term''' &amp;rarr; '''Factor'''
  '''Factor''' &amp;rarr; "(" '''Expr''' ")"
  '''Factor''' &amp;rarr; ''integer''

The following attribute grammar can be used to calculate the result of an expression written in the grammar. Note that this grammar only uses synthesized values, and is therefore an [[S-attributed grammar]].
  '''Expr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;rarr; '''Expr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' + '''Term''' [ '''Expr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.value = '''Expr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.value + '''Term'''.value ]
  '''Expr''' &amp;rarr; '''Term''' [ '''Expr'''.value = '''Term'''.value ]
  '''Term&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' &amp;rarr; '''Term&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' * '''Factor''' [ '''Term&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.value = '''Term&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.value * '''Factor'''.value ]
  '''Term''' &amp;rarr; '''Factor''' [ '''Term'''.value = '''Factor'''.value ]
  '''Factor''' &amp;rarr; "(" '''Expr''' ")" [ '''Factor'''.value =  '''Expr'''.value ]
  '''Factor''' &amp;rarr; ''integer'' [ '''Factor'''.value = strToInt(''integer''.str) ]

==Synthesized attributes==
A synthesized attribute is computed from the values of attributes of the children. Since the values of the children must be computed first, this is an example of bottom-up propagation. To formally define a synthesized attribute, let &lt;math&gt;G= \langle V_n,V_t,P,S \rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a formal grammar, where

* &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; is the set of non terminal symbols
* &lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt; is the set of terminal symbols
* &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|productions]]
* &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the distinguished, or start, symbol

Then, given a string of nonterminal symbols &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and an attribute name &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A.a&lt;/math&gt; is a synthesized attribute if all four of these conditions are met:

* &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \alpha \in P&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is one of the rules in the grammar)
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \alpha_1 \ldots \alpha_n, \forall_{i, 1 \leq i \leq n}: \alpha_i \in (V_n \cup V_t)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. every symbol in the body of the rule is either nonterminal or terminal)
* &lt;math&gt;A.a = f(\alpha_{j1}.a_1, \ldots ,\alpha_{jm}.a_m)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{\alpha_{j1}, \ldots ,\alpha_{jm}\} \subseteq \{\alpha_1, \ldots ,\alpha_n\}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the value of the attribute is a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; applied to some values from the symbols in the body of the rule)

==Inherited attributes==
An ''inherited attribute'' at a node in parse tree is defined using the attribute values at the parent or siblings. Inherited attributes are convenient for expressing the dependence of a programming language construct on the context in which it appears. For example, we can use an inherited attribute to keep track of whether an identifier appears on the left or the right side of an assignment in order to decide whether the address or the value of the identifier is needed. In contrast to synthesized attributes, inherited attributes can take values from parent and/or siblings. As in the following production,

: S → ABC

where A can get values from S, B, and C. B can take values from S, A, and C. Likewise, C can take values from S, A, and B.

==Special types of attribute grammars==
* [[L-attributed grammar]]: ''inherited attributes'' can be evaluated in one left-to-right traversal of the abstract syntax tree
* [[LR-attributed grammar]]: an L-attributed grammar whose ''inherited attributes'' can also be evaluated in [[bottom-up parsing]].
* [[ECLR-attributed grammar]]: a subset of LR-attributed grammars where equivalence classes can be used to optimize the evaluation of inherited attributes.
* [[S-attributed grammar]]: a simple type of attribute grammar, using only ''synthesized attributes'', but no ''inherited attributes''

The Gospel of Mark was written using Matthew as a source. Then the Gospel of Luke was written using both Mark and Matthew.]]
{{Augustine}}

The '''Augustinian hypothesis''' is a solution to the [[synoptic problem]], which concerns the origin of the [[Gospels]] of the [[New Testament]]. The hypothesis holds that [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] was written first, by [[Matthew the Evangelist]] (see the [[Gospel According to the Hebrews]] and the [[Jewish-Christian Gospels]]). [[Mark the Evangelist]] wrote the [[Gospel of Mark]] second and used Matthew and the preaching of Peter as sources. [[Luke the Evangelist]] wrote the [[Gospel of Luke]] and was aware of the two Gospels that preceded him. Unlike some competing hypotheses, this hypothesis does not rely on, nor does it argue for, the existence of any document that is not explicitly mentioned in historical testimony. Instead, the hypothesis draws primarily upon historical testimony, rather than [[textual criticism]], as the central line of evidence. The foundation of evidence for the hypothesis is the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]: historical sources dating back to as early as the first half of the 2nd century, which have been held as authoritative by most [[Christians]] for nearly two millennia. Adherents to the Augustinian hypothesis view it as a simple, coherent solution to the [[synoptic problem]].

The Augustinian hypothesis addresses certain fundamental points of contention surrounding the [[synoptic problem]], such as how reliable the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] tradition is, which gospel was written first, whether there were other unknown sources behind the gospels, to what extent, if any, the gospels were [[Redaction|redacted]], and to what extent the gospels were altered between the time they were originally written and the time the first surviving manuscripts appear. These and other matters are raised and alternate resolutions proposed by proponents of competing hypotheses, such as the [[Two-source hypothesis]], its related [[Q document|Q hypothesis]], the [[Farrer hypothesis]], and others.

The main two areas of contention within the Augustinian community are whether Matthew was originally written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] using [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew script]] (see [[Aramaic primacy]]), or if the Greek text is the original, and whether it was Mark or Luke who wrote second. A modified version of the Augustinian hypothesis, known as the [[Griesbach hypothesis]], agrees that Matthew wrote first and that Mark depended on Matthew, and does not dispute that the original text was in Hebrew thereafter translated into Greek, but argues that Mark also depended on Luke and therefore that Luke’s gospel precedes Mark's. Because of the similarity on primary points of contention, this hypothesis is also treated as a possible amendment to the Augustinian hypothesis. Another modified version of the Augustinian hypothesis is the hypothesis of [[Eta Linnemann]] and [[F. David Farnell]] that two Gospels for diaspora Jewish audiences are required by the Mosaic rule of "two witnesses".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Thomas ''Three views on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels 2002 p255, and p322 "Farnell 's third axiom notes, quoting Linnemann, that the reason for four independent Gospels stems from the legal principle of Deuteronomy 19:15b: "[O]n the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed.""&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Michael Pacher St. Augustine Freeing A Prisoner.jpg|thumb|left|St. Augustine of Hippo Freeing A Prisoner, by Michael Pacher (1430–1498).]]
The hypothesis takes its name from [[Augustine of Hippo]], an early 5th century bishop and church father, who wrote: "Now, those four evangelists whose names have gained the most remarkable circulation over the whole world, and whose number has been fixed as four, ...are believed to have written in the order which follows: first Matthew, then Mark, thirdly Luke, lastly John." And: "Of these four, it is true, only Matthew is reckoned to have written in the Hebrew language; the others in Greek. And however they may appear to have kept each of them a certain order of narration proper to himself, this certainly is not to be taken as if each individual writer chose to write in ignorance of what his predecessor had done..."&lt;ref name="Aug c2"&gt;St. Augustine, ''The Harmony of the Gospels'', Book 1 chapter 2 paragraph 4. from [http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/10/external-evidence-augustine.html hypothesis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark was famously dubbed by Augustine as "pedissequus et breviator Matthaei", the attendant and abbreviator of Matthew,&lt;ref name="Aug c2" /&gt; in direct contrast to the view most commonly held in academia today, that [[Marcan priority|Mark's gospel was the earliest]]. Augustine also discussed the commonalities between the Synoptic Gospels, including the identical language found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Augustine was not the first to articulate this view, as [[Irenaeus]] and [[Origen]], among others, shared this ordering. However, Augustine was the first author to give a detailed scholarly textual analysis of the three texts' interdependence, and to articulate a theory for the express purpose of explaining this fact.

==Ancient tradition==
[[Image:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|thumb|left|The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel, by Rembrandt (1606–1669)]]
The Church Fathers who wrote about the order and authorship of the canonical gospels all supported some basic ideas of the Augustinian hypothesis. The fathers whose writings survive and who wrote about authorship are almost unanimous in agreement that Matthew the apostle was the author, wrote first, and did so for the Hebrews in their language.&lt;ref&gt;John Wenham, ''Redating Matthew, Mark, and Luke'', (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1991) p116.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of sources in antiquity asserted that Mark wrote his Gospel after Matthew based on the preaching of Peter. Various elements of this tradition are found in the writings of [[Irenaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, "Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, also himself handed on to us in writing what was preached by Peter." ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', 3.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen]],&lt;ref&gt;Origen, "As to the four Gospels, which alone are indisputable in the Church of God under heaven, I learned from tradition that the first to have been written was that of Matthew," cited in: Eusebius, ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', 6.25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]],&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, "So brightly shone the light of the true religion on the minds of Peter’s hearers that, not satisfied with a single hearing or with the oral teaching of the divine message, they resorted to appeals of every kind to induce Mark (whose Gospel we have), as he was a follower of Peter, to leave them in writing a summary of the instruction they had received by word of mouth, nor did they let him go until they had persuaded him , and thus became responsible for the writing of what is known as the Gospel according to Mark. It is said that, on learning by revelation of the spirit what had happened, the apostle [Peter] was delighted at their enthusiasm and authorized the reading of the book in the churches." ''History of the Church''&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The text of the Gospel itself circulated with a title "According to Matthew", a tradition indisputably acknowledged before the close of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' (Leicester: Apollos, 1961) p43.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the title "According to Matthew" is found in the earliest manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Nestle-Aland. ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]''. 27th ed. Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Druck: 1996. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of scholars have argued that the title must be dated no later than 125.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. J.H. Ropes, ''The Synoptic Gospels'' (1934) p103; N.B. Stonehouse, ''Origins of the Synoptic Gospels'' (1963) p16; et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary scholars, however, believe it was originally anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings |year=2003 |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-515462-2 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving references to the gospel tradition are quoted by Eusebius (lived c. 263–339 CE), and different but related traditions appear in the works of [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] (wrote during the first half of 2nd century CE) and the works of [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]]. A third ancient source, [[Irenaeus]], also provides further information about the traditions, especially that of Papias, and possibly adds a third related tradition to the sources. These related traditions generally agree on the primary points of contention within the Augustinian hypothesis, though not without discrepancies. Rather than seen as a refutation to the hypothesis, instead these discrepancies are often cited in defense of the hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;e.g. see this article on [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09674b.htm The Gospel of Mark]&lt;/ref&gt; because they counter the argument that the entire tradition is merely a repetition of Papias's original assertion (therefore, if he were wrong, the great many historical sources supporting the theory would be inconsequential). Instead, slight disagreement is actually in favor of multiple, near identical traditions.

===Papias===
According to [[Irenaeus]], Papias was "a hearer of John and a companion of [[Polycarp]], a man of primitive times," who wrote a volume in "five books."&lt;ref&gt;Against Heresies 5.33.4; quoted by Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 3.39.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of historical immediacy, as argued by [[David Hackett Fischer|D. H. Fischer]] is one of the key determinants of historicity, and the church father Papias is a very early source in regard to testimony that the Matthew wrote his gospel first. Papias wrote that: "Matthew compiled the sayings in the Hebrew language, and everyone translated them as well he could."&lt;ref&gt;cited in: Eusebius, ''History of the Church'', 3.39.15.&lt;/ref&gt; (The 'Hebrew language' referred to by Papias has often been interpreted as Aramaic.)

It has been argued, because Papias does not cite an authority for his assertions concerning Matthew but does concerning Mark, that Matthew was already fully accepted at the time of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;for this and a full discussion of other arguments, see R.P. Martin, ''New Testament Foundations'' vol. 1 (1975) pp238-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clement===
Eusebius also recorded an important tradition from Clement of Alexandria (died c. 213):
{{Quote|text=In the same volumes Clement has found room for a tradition of the primitive authorities of the Church regarding the order of the gospels. It is this. He used to say that the earliest gospels were those containing the genealogies [Matthew, Luke], while Mark's originated as follows: When, at Rome, Peter had openly preached the word and by the Spirit had proclaimed the gospel, the large audience urged Mark, who had followed him for a long time and remembered what had been said, to write it all down. This he did, making his gospel available to all who wanted it. When Peter heard about this, he made no objection and gave no special encouragement. Last of all, aware that the physical facts had been recorded in the gospels, encouraged by his pupils and irresistibly moved by the Spirit, John wrote a spiritual gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius on Clement, ''History of the Church''. 6.14.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This source claims multiple authorities of antiquity, not merely Papias; this is taken as evidence against the view that the testimony of the Fathers is based solely upon the witness of Papias. Furthermore the tradition of Clement concurs with the significant point of contention: Matthean priority. However, Clement conflicts with the Augustinian hypothesis concerning the order of Mark and Luke. The [[Griesbach hypothesis]] attempts to resolve the difficulty concerning this secondary point of contention by stating Luke wrote before Mark.

===Irenaeus===
{{further|Aramaic primacy}}

Irenaeus, who was familiar with the work of Papias and who knew [[Polycarp]] and possibly even [[John the Apostle|the apostle John]], wrote: "Now Matthew published also a book of the Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching the gospel in Rome and founding the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', cited also in Eusebius; trans. D. Theron.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus gives here another tradition in accord with Papias, though containing more information. This has been taken as evidence of a third, yet harmonious tradition.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. J. Munck in ''Neotestamentica at Patristica'' (ed. W.C. van Unnik, 1962) p257.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Irenaeus places the composition of Mark after Peter's death, while Clement (and others, such as Origen and Eusebius) claimed Peter was alive and approved the work. Nonetheless, because the Augustinian hypothesis does not address whether Peter was alive at the time of the composition of Mark or not, this discrepancy is not a basis for objection to the theory.

An original Aramaic version of Matthew does not exist in the sense that no copy survives in the original language today. Many proponents of the Augustinian hypothesis hold that the current [[Koine Greek|Greek]] Matthew is a complete translation of the original Aramaic Matthew. This theory has strong support in a number of Church Fathers. Papias, Irenaeus, Origen, Eusebius, [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] and [[Jerome]] all agree that the original Matthew was written in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;For Papias, see Eusebius, ''History of the Church'', 3.39.15. For Irenaeus, see ''Against Heresies'', 3.1. For Origen, see Eusebius, ''History of the Church'', 6.25. For Eusebius and Epiphanisu, see below.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerome even claimed to have seen the original Aramaic Matthew in the library of Pamphilus the Martyr.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''On Illustrious Men''&lt;/ref&gt;  Eusebius wrote in c. 325 that Pantaerus found a copy of the Gospel of Matthew written in Hebrew in India, and that it had been left there by Bartholomew.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. ''History of the Church'', 5.10.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In c. 376, Epiphanius wrote there was "no doubt" that a sect in Palestine still used the original Hebrew text "just as it was originally written."&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius. ''Panarion'', 29.9.4.&lt;/ref&gt; And, of course, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] also repeated this tradition. To these authors should be added [[Pantaenus]], [[Athanasius]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and others in agreement.

==Augustinian Revival==
The Augustinian position, and the similar Griesbach hypothesis, has drawn recent interest, especially from [[Christopher Butler|B. C. Butler]], [[John Wenham]], W.R. Farmer, and others as an alternative solution to the [[synoptic problem]], and has been employed as a scholarly refutation of [[Marcan priority]], the [[Q document|Q hypothesis]], and the [[two-source hypothesis]]. Butler argued that accepting the priority of Matthew rendered it possible to dispense with the hypothetical Q document altogether, a position he supported by arguments concerning the inadmissibility of appealing to Q as a sound explanation of the cases where Matthew appears to be more original than Mark. Farmer argued that a modification of the Augustinian hypothesis, ordering Matthew-Luke-Mark, eliminated all reasons for the existence of Q, a position whose credibility was conceded by W.C. Allen and others.&lt;ref&gt;W.C. Allen ''St. Matthew'' pp. xlvii; see Donald Guthrie, ''New Testament Introduction'' pp171 n6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise it has been pointed out that differences between the Synoptic Gospels are as easily explained by differing purposes of the authors than by forced redactions or omissions due to ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. A. Wikenhauser, ''New Testament Introduction'' (English translation 1958) p251&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, against certain arguments that the “primitiveness” of the ideas within the Gospels is the determining factor in their literary interdependence,&lt;ref&gt;for example, J. Schniewind advanced such an argument in his ''Das Evangelium nach Matthaus'', p5.&lt;/ref&gt; it is observed that defining "primitiveness" carries obvious difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, p173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern position in detail===
Recently, modern scholars accepting some form of the Augustinian hypothesis have attempted to develop a detailed argument explaining the theoretical origin of the gospels. There was a perceived need for this in response to recent competing theories, expressed by [[Bernard Orchard]]: “the two-document hypothesis and the priority of Mark are still only hypotheses, not infallible dogmas, and they have stood secure for so long chiefly because no one has been able to offer any satisfactory alternative."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Orchard, ''Matthew, Luke &amp; Mark'' (Manchester: Koinonia Press, 1976) vii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Central to this process is the assumption that the gospel's development should be understood as a reaction to various developing needs of the early church.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Orchard and Harold Riley, ''The Order of the Synoptics: Why Three Synoptic Gospels? '' (Macon: Mercer University Press, 1987), p275&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wenham argued that, in the early Jerusalem Church, there would have been an early need for the production of a written record to augment the "atmosphere of spontaneity" within which the apostles, disciples, and eyewitnesses would have given instruction. The reasons for this, he asserted, were: the need for instruction when no qualified teacher was available, the need for consistency and accuracy in what was taught as it spread throughout the first scattered Christian communities, and for the basic need of evangelization.&lt;ref&gt;John Wenham, ''Redating Matthew, Mark, and Luke'' (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1991) p200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wenham also argued that Matthew was a natural choice since, as a tax collector,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 10:3&lt;/ref&gt; he would have had the requisite literacy, as well as his first hand memories, and perhaps even notes.&lt;ref&gt;John Wenham, ''Redating Matthew, Mark, and Luke'' (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1991) p201&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have observed that persecutions in Palestine, threatening dispersion of the Christians, would have been a motivating factor for a text of the life of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelius a Lapide]], ''The Great Commentary on the Scriptures'', trans. Thomas W. Mossman, (London: John Hodges, 1893), p 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority Hebrew makeup of the primitive Church has been seen as support of Aramaic primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cathcart, Martin McNamara and Michael Maher, eds, ''The Aramaic Bible: the Targums'', vol. 1A, trans. Martin McNamara, (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical, 1992), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the traditional material (see above), other support for an Aramaic Matthew advanced in recent years includes the theory that the Medieval Hebrew gospel of Matthew in [[Even Bohan]] could be a corrupted version of the original.

Bernard Orchard identified the above period as a "first phase" of the development of the Gospels, distinguished from the subsequent phase by the events of the year 42:

:A savage persecution of the Church, begun by Herod Agrippa I in AD 42, was the signal for the dispersion of the apostles now possessing in the Gospel of Matthew the necessary tool to support and confirm their preaching, while at the same time preserving their theological unity. The first phase was completed, and the second phase of the Church's expansion was about to begin with the mission of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Orchard, in [http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1994/9403fea1.asp This Article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630080953/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1994/9403fea1.asp |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Orchard's characterization of this new second phase is the distinction between a primarily Hebrew orientation and a primarily Greek orientation, focusing not only on the Jewish converts to Christianity, but to the gentile converts as well. This, he argues, resulted in three key events: the translation of the original Matthew into Greek, the production of the Gospel of Mark within the context of Peter's preaching to Greek speaking converts in Rome, and Luke's authorship of his Gospel under the instruction of Paul. Cited in support of this are the comments of Clement,&lt;ref&gt;Clement, cited in: Eusebius, History of the Church, 3.39.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus,&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, cited in: Eusebius, History of the Church, 5.8.2&lt;/ref&gt; and others who state that the Gospel of Mark was written by Mark, a follower of the apostle Peter,&lt;ref&gt;1 Pet. 5:12–13&lt;/ref&gt; based on his speeches. Orchard countered the claim that the Gospel of Mark must have been written first, since it contains less information than Matthew and Luke, by positing that Peter elected not to speak on certain subjects, such as the birth and resurrection narratives, since he had not been a direct witness of those events. The notion that Peter employed Matthew in his preaching was supported by B.C. Butler, but not by John Wenham, who instead explained the similar structure by arguing simply that Mark used both his recollection of his instruction from the Gospel of Matthew and his memory of the preaching of Peter to pen his own synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Wenham p208&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of the Gospel of Luke with [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul the apostle]], which is witnessed by tradition, has led some to argue that Luke was with Paul during his imprisonment in Rome, or to at least place the date of composition prior to 70 and the fall of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Harnack, ''The Date of Acts and the Synoptic Gospels'' (1911) p90; J.A.T. Robinson, ''Redating the New Testament'' pp86-92; et al.&lt;/ref&gt;  The author of Luke also wrote in his prologue that he employed various sources in composing his work.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 1:1–5&lt;/ref&gt; Wenham argued that an excess of such material, along with the constraints of scroll length, was one cause of his noticeable omission of material found in Matthew and Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Wenham, p209.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual modern scholar who supported the notion that the Synoptic Gospels were of an early date, specifically before 70, was [[John Robinson (1919-1983)|John Robinson]]. Though generally considered a liberal theologian, his views in respect to the development of the Gospels were consistent with the Augustinian hypothesis. He wrote in his work ''Redating the New Testament'' that past scholarship was based on a "tyranny of unexamined assumptions" and an "almost wilful blindness," concluding that New Testament was written before 64, and that there is no compelling evidence and little evidence of any kind that anything in the New Testament reflects knowledge of the Temple's destruction. Furthermore, in relation to the four gospels, according to [[Norman Geisler]]:

:"Robinson places Matthew at 40 to after 60, Mark at about 45 to 60, Luke at before 57 to after 60, and John at from 40 to after 65."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethinking.org/resource.php?ID=233 bethinking.org | Resource: The Dating of the New Testament&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">{{citations|date=January 2018}}'''Business mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] used by [[Commerce|commercial]] enterprises to record and manage [[business operations]]. Commercial organizations use mathematics in [[accounting]], [[inventory management]], [[marketing]], sales [[forecasting]], and [[financial analysis]].  

Mathematics typically used in commerce includes [[elementary arithmetic]], elementary [[algebra]], [[statistics]] and [[probability]].  Business management can be done more effectively in some cases by use of more advanced mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[Matrix_(mathematics)#Basic_operations|matrix algebra]] and [[linear programming]].

==High school==
''Business mathematics, '' sometimes called ''commercial math''  or ''consumer math'', is a group of practical subjects used in [[commerce]] and everyday life. In schools, these subjects are often taught to students who are not planning a university education.  In the United States, they are typically offered in [[high schools]] and in schools that grant [[associate's degrees]]; elsewhere they may be included under [[Business studies]].  The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practical application being predominant. 

A (U.S.) business math course might include a review of [[elementary arithmetic]], including [[fractions]], [[decimals]], and [[percentages]]. Elementary [[algebra]] is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include [[checking accounts]], [[discounts and allowances|price discounts]], [[markup (business)|markups and Markup]], [[payroll]] calculations, [[interest|simple and compound interest]], [[credit (finance)|consumer and business credit]], and [[mortgages]] and [[revenues]].

==University level==
===Undergraduate===
"Business Mathematics" comprises mathematics courses taken at an [[undergraduate]] level by [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business students]]. The two most common here are ''Business Calculus'' and ''[[Business Statistics]]''.  Programs often also cover matrix operations as above, and may include a separate module on [[time value of money|interest calculations]].

These courses are usually focused on problems from the business world, and the syllabus is adjusted correspondingly. Thus for example, whereas in a regular calculus course students would study [[trigonometric functions]], courses here would not typically cover this area. Correspondingly, these courses typically do not go into the same depth as standard courses in the mathematics or science fields.  (Although see [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] and [[Bachelor of Business Science]].) 

Note that [[Bachelor of Economics|economics majors]], especially those planning to pursue  [[Master of Economics|graduate study in the field]], are encouraged to instead take regular calculus, as well as [[linear algebra]] and other advanced math courses, especially [[real analysis]]. Some programs (instead) include a module in "mathematics for economists", providing a bridge between the above "Business Mathematics" courses and [[mathematical economics]] and [[econometrics]].
[[Operations management]] (and [[management accounting]]) may similarly include supplementary coursework in relevant quantitative techniques, generally linear programming as above, as well as other optimization methods.

===Postgraduate===
[[Business_education#Postgraduate_education|At the postgraduate level]], ''generalist'' management and finance programs include quantitative topics which are foundational for the study in question - often exempting students with an appropriate background. These are usually "interest mathematics" and statistics, both at the above level. [[MBA]] programs often also include basic [[operations research]] (linear programming, as above) with the emphasis on practice, and may combine the topics as "quantitative analysis"; [[master of science in finance|MSF programs]] may similarly cover applied [[econometrics]].

More technical [[masters degree|Masters]] in these areas, such as those in [[management science]] and [[Master of Quantitative Finance|quantitative finance]], will entail a deeper, more theoretical study of operations research and econometrics, and extend to further advanced topics such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[stochastic calculus]]. These programs do not include "Business mathematics" ''per se''.

Where [[mathematical economics]] is not required, [[Master of Economics|graduate economics programs]] often include "quantitative techniques", which covers (applied) [[linear algebra]] and [[multivariate calculus]], and may include the above topics; regardless, econometrics is usually a separate course, and is dealt with in depth.

[[File:Dohrn carl.PNG|thumb|Carl August Dohrn]]
'''Carl August Dohrn''' (27 June 1806 – 10 May 1892) was a German [[entomology|entomologist]].

==Biography==
Born at Stettin ([[Szczecin]], now [[Poland]]) Carl August was the son of Heinrich Dohrn, who was a wine and spice merchant, and had made the family fortune by trading in sugar. This wealth allowed Carl August to devote himself to his various hobbies; travelling, folk music and entomology.

Although interested in all orders of insects Dohrn specialised in [[Coleoptera]]. His first published paper was in the ''Entomologische Zeitung'' for 1845 but he was an active entomologist long before this, since he had acted as Secretary to the [[Stettin Entomological Society]] from its foundation in 1839 and edited its journal. He was elected president of the society in 1843 retiring from the post in 1887.During this time he held together the rather fractious German entomologists and the society flourished. Dohrn had many contacts including [[Alexander Henry Haliday]], with whom he wrote a paper on the [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaean]] [[Diptera]] (See [[Talk:Carl August Dohrn]]) and the London entomologists. He was a personal friend of [[Henry Tibbats Stainton]] with whom he stayed in England.

A frequent visitor to London he was accompanied by the [[Lepidoptera|Lepidopterist]], [[Philipp Christoph Zeller]] in 1852, by [[Carl Henrik Boheman]] in 1854 and by [[Hermann August Hagen]] in 1857. He spent many summers in Italy, in [[Lucca]] with Haliday and in [[Turin]] with [[Maximilian Spinola]]. Dohrn was elected a fellow of the [[Entomological Society of London]] in 1855 and an honorary member in 1855. A [[classics|classicist]] he was fluent in many European languages. His [[Coleoptera]] collection was very extensive and just prior to his death, at 86, he had received upwards of 1,000 [[beetles]] from [[Sumatra]].

==Family==
Dohrn's son [[Anton Dohrn]], an ardent supporter of [[Charles Darwin]], became a famous [[marine zoologist]]. A second son [[Heinrich Wolfgang Ludwig Dohrn]] was also an entomologist.

The '''Chinese dormouse''' or '''Sichuan dormouse''' (''Chaetocauda sichuanensis'') is a species of [[dormouse]] found in subalpine mixed forests in northern [[Sichuan]], [[China]], where it is known from [[Jiuzhaigou]] and Wanglang Nature Reserves. It is known only from two captured female specimens taken in the [[Wanglang Natural Reserve]], and was first described by Wang Youzhi in 1985 and relisted by Corbet and Hill (1991, 1992) under a new [[genus]] as ''Chaetocauda sichuanensis''. It is currently the only member of the genus ''Chaetocauda''.  The two specimens had head and body lengths of 90mm and 91mm and tail lengths of 92mm and 102mm, respectively. They weighed 24.5 and 36.0 g. It is nocturnal and arboreal, nesting in trees around 3 metres above the ground, and was found above an altitude of 2500m above sea level. It is classified as endangered by the [[IUCN]] as of the 2004 Red List due to its small, isolated habitat. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php?species=6860]

'''''De Phenomenis in Orbe Lunae''''' is a 1612 [[book]] by Collegio Romano [[philosophy]] professor [[Giulio Cesare de Galla]] that describes emission of light by a stone. De Galla's inspiration came from [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s debate with Vincenzo Casciarolo regarding a "lapis solaris," a stone that emitted light seemingly on its own.  In ''De Phenomenis'' de Galla asserts that the stone was only able to emit light after the stone itself had calcified.  It released "a certain quantity of [[fire]] and [[light]]" that it had absorbed just as [[water]] would be absorbed by a [[sponge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq_QDcADZxEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12 | title=Chemiluminescence and Bioluminescence: Past, Present and Future | publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] | author=Roda, Aldo | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
A '''''de facto'' monopoly''' is a [[monopoly]] that was not created by government. It is most often used in contrast to [[de jure monopoly|''de jure'' monopoly]], which is one that is protected from competition by government action.

In a free market without government intervention this kind of monopoly is theoretically unobtainable for any extended amount of time.{{fact|date=March 2012}} A ''de facto'' monopoly is only able to be achieved by providing a far demanded product at all times compared to the competition, and even then there would not be a 100% market share.

[[File:Modern document hypothesis.svg|thumb|Diagram of the generally-accepted [[documentary hypothesis]].&lt;br/&gt;J: [[Jahwist]] source (7th century BCE or later)&lt;br/&gt;E: [[Elohist]] source (late 9th century BCE)&lt;br/&gt;Dtr1: early (7th century BCE) [[Deuteronomist]] historian&lt;br/&gt;Dtr2: later (6th century BCE) [[Deuteronomist]] historian&lt;br/&gt;P*: [[Priestly source]] (6th/5th century BCE; includes most of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]])&lt;br/&gt;D†: [[Deuteronomist]] source (includes most of [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]])&lt;br/&gt;R: redactor&lt;br/&gt;DH: [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic history|Deuteronomistic history]] (books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], [[Books of Kings|Kings]])]]

The '''documentary hypothesis''' ('''DH''') is one of four models used to explain the origins and composition of the first five books of the Bible, as well as the most widespread and commonly agreed upon of the various hypotheses.&lt;ref group="Note" name="books"&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The first five books of the Bible are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]], called collectively the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch. Two other theories are the [[supplementary hypothesis]] and the fragmentary hypothesis.  The fourth model would be some variation of the traditional ideas of authorship (see [[Mosaic authorship]]).{{sfn|Viviano|1999|pp=38-39}}{{sfn|Patzia|Petrotta|2010|p=37}}

All three agree that the Torah is not a unified work from a single author (traditionally Moses) but is made up of sources combined over many centuries by many hands. They differ on the nature of these sources and how they were combined. According to the documentary hypothesis there were four sources, each originally a separate and independent book (a "document"), joined together at various points in time by a series of editors ("redactors").{{sfn|Van Seters|2015|p=viii}} Fragmentary hypotheses see the Torah as a collection of small fragments, and supplementary hypotheses as a single core document supplemented by fragments taken from many sources.{{sfn|Viviano|1999|p=38}}

A version of the documentary hypothesis, frequently identified with the German scholar [[Julius Wellhausen]], was almost universally accepted for most of the 20th century, but the consensus has now collapsed.{{sfn|Carr|2014|p=434}} As a result, there has been a revival of interest in fragmentary and supplementary approaches, frequently in combination with each other and with a documentary model, making it difficult to classify contemporary theories as strictly one or another.{{sfn|Van Seters|2015|p=12}}

Modern scholars increasingly see the completed Torah as a product of the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (probably 450–350 BCE), although some would place its production in the [[Hellenistic period]] (333–164 BCE) or even the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] (140–37 BCE).{{sfn|Greifenhagen|2003|pp=206-207, 224 fn.49}} Of its constituent sources, Deuteronomy is generally dated between the 7th and 5th centuries;{{sfn|Bos|2013|p=133}} there is much discussion of the unity, extent, nature, and date of the [[Priestly source|Priestly]] material.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=273}} Deuteronomy continues to be seen as having had a history separate from the first four books, and there is a growing recognition that Genesis developed apart from the Exodus stories until joined to it by the Priestly writer.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=viii}}

== Basic approaches: documentary, fragmentary and supplementary hypotheses ==
[[File:Targum.jpg|left|thumb|265px|11th-century manuscript of the [[Hebrew Bible]].]]

The [[Torah]] (or Pentateuch) is the collective name for the first five books of the Bible: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]].{{sfn|McDermott|2002|p=1}} According to tradition they were dictated by God to Moses,{{sfn|Kugel|2008|p=6}} but when modern critical scholarship began to be applied to the Bible it was discovered that the Pentateuch was not the unified text one would expect from a single author.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|1993|p=1}} As a result, the [[Mosaic authorship]] of the Torah had been largely rejected by leading scholars by the 17th century, and the modern consensus is that it is the product of a long evolutionary process.{{sfn|Berlin|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Baden|2012|p=13}}&lt;ref group="Note" name="Moses"&gt;The reasons behind the rejection are covered in more detail in the article on [[Mosaic authorship]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-18th century, some scholars started a critical study of doublets (parallel accounts of the same incidents), inconsistencies, and changes in style and vocabulary in the Torah.{{sfn|Berlin|1994|p=113}} In 1780 [[Johann Eichhorn]], building on the work of the French doctor and [[exegete]] [[Jean Astruc]]'s "Conjectures" and others, formulated the "older documentary hypothesis": the idea that Genesis was composed by combining two identifiable sources, the [[Jahwist|Jehovist]] ("J"; also called the Yahwist) and the [[Elohist]] ("E").{{sfn|Ruddick|1990|p=246}} These sources were subsequently found to run through the first four books of the Torah, and the number was later expanded to three when [[Wilhelm de Wette]] identified the [[Deuteronomist]] as an additional source found only in Deuteronomy ("D").{{sfn|Patrick|2013|p=31}} Later still the Elohist was split into Elohist and [[Priestly source|Priestly]] ("P") sources, increasing the number to four.{{sfn|Barton|Muddiman|2010|p=19}}

These documentary approaches were in competition with two other models, the fragmentary and the supplementary.{{sfn|Viviano|1999|p=38–39}} The fragmentary hypothesis argued that fragments of varying lengths, rather than continuous documents, lay behind the Torah; this approach accounted for the Torah's diversity but could not account for its structural consistency, particularly regarding chronology.{{sfn|Viviano|1999|p=38}} The supplementary hypothesis was better able to explain this unity: it maintained that the Torah was made up of a central core document, the Elohist, supplemented by fragments taken from many sources.{{sfn|Viviano|1999|p=38}} The supplementary approach was dominant by the early 1860s, but it was challenged by an important book published by [[Hermann Hupfeld]] in 1853, who argued that the Pentateuch was made up of four documentary sources, the Priestly, Yahwist, and Elohist intertwined in Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers, and the stand-alone source of Deuteronomy.{{sfn|Barton|Muddiman|2010|p=18–19}} At around the same period [[Karl Heinrich Graf]] argued that the Yahwist and Elohist were the earliest sources and the Priestly source the latest, while [[Wilhelm Vatke]] linked the four to an evolutionary framework, the Yahwist and Elohist to a time of primitive nature and fertility cults, the Deuteronomist to the ethical religion of the Hebrew prophets, and the Priestly source to a form of religion dominated by ritual, sacrifice and law.{{sfn|Friedman|1997|p=24–25}}

== Julius Wellhausen and the new documentary hypothesis ==
[[File:Julius Wellhausen 02.jpg|right|thumb|265px|Julius Wellhausen]]
In 1878 [[Julius Wellhausen]] published ''Geschichte Israels, Bd 1'' ("History of Israel, Vol 1"); the second edition he printed as ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' ("Prolegomena to the History of Israel"), in 1883, and the work is better known under that name.{{sfn|Kugel|2008|p=41}} (The second volume, a synthetic history titled ''Israelitische und jüdische Geschichte'' ["Israelite and Jewish History"], did not appear until 1894 and remains untranslated.) Crucially, this historical portrait was based upon two earlier works of his technical analysis: "Die Composition des Hexateuchs" ("The Composition of the Hexateuch") of 1876/77 and sections on the "historical books" (Judges–Kings) in his 1878 edition of [[Friedrich Bleek]]'s ''Einleitung in das Alte Testament'' ("Introduction to the Old Testament").

Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis owed little to Wellhausen himself but was mainly the work of Hupfeld, [[Édouard Guillaume Eugène Reuss|Eduard Eugène Reuss]], Graf, and others, who in turn had built on earlier scholarship.{{sfn|Barton|Muddiman|2010|p=20}} He accepted Hupfeld's four sources and, in agreement with Graf, placed the Priestly work last.{{sfn|Barton|Muddiman|2010|p=19}} J was the earliest document, a product of the 900s and the court of [[Solomon]]; E was from the 8th century BCE in the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], and had been combined by a redactor (editor) with J to form a document JE; D, the third source, was a product of the 7th century BC, by 620 BCE, during the reign of [[King Josiah]]; P (what Wellhausen first named "Q") was a product of the priest-and-temple dominated world of the 6th century; and the final redaction, when P was combined with JED to produce the Torah as we now know it.{{sfn|Viviano|1999|p=40–41}}{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=260}}

Wellhausen's explanation of the formation of the Torah was also an explanation of the religious history of Israel.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=260}} The Yahwist and Elohist described a primitive, spontaneous and personal world, in keeping with the earliest stage of Israel's history; in Deuteronomy he saw the influence of the prophets and the development of an ethical outlook, which he felt represented the pinnacle of Jewish religion; and the Priestly source reflected the rigid, ritualistic world of the priest-dominated post-exilic period.{{sfn|Viviano|1999|p=51}} His work, notable for its detailed and wide-ranging scholarship and close argument, entrenched the "new documentary hypothesis" as the dominant explanation of Pentateuchal origins from the late 19th to the late 20th centuries.{{sfn|Barton|Muddiman|2010|p=19}}&lt;ref group="Note" name="newer"&gt;The two-source hypothesis of Eichorn was the "older" documentary hypothesis, and the four-source hypothesis adopted by Wellhausen was the "newer".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collapse of the documentary consensus ==
The consensus around the documentary hypothesis collapsed in the last decades of the 20th century.{{sfn|Carr|2014|p=434}} The groundwork was laid with the investigation of the origins of the written sources in oral compositions, implying that the creators of J and E were collectors and editors and not authors and historians.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=8}} [[Rolf Rendtorff]] (1925–2014), building on this insight, argued that the basis of the Pentateuch lay in short, independent narratives, gradually formed into larger units and brought together in two editorial phases, the first Deuteronomic, the second Priestly.{{sfn|Ska|2015|pp=133-135}} This led to the current position which sees only two major sources in the Pentateuch, the Deuteronomist (confined to the Book of Deuteronomy) and the Priestly (confined to the books Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers).{{sfn|Otto|2014|p=609}}

The majority of scholars today continue to recognise Deuteronomy as a source, with its origin in the law-code produced at the court of [[Josiah]] as described by De Wette, subsequently given a frame during the exile (the speeches and descriptions at the front and back of the code) to identify it as the words of Moses.{{sfn|Otto|2015|p=605}} Most scholars also agree that some form of Priestly source existed, although its extent, especially its end-point, is uncertain.{{sfn|Carr|2015|p=457}} The remainder is called collectively non-Priestly, a grouping which includes both pre-Priestly and post-Priestly material.{{sfn|Otto|2014|p=609}} The final Torah is increasingly seen as a product of the Persian period (539–333 BCE, probably 450–350 BCE), although some would place it somewhat later, in the Hellenistic (333–164 BCE) or even [[Hasmonean Kingdom|Hasmonean]] (140–37 BCE) periods{{sfn|Greifenhagen|2003|p=206–207, 224 fn.49}} – the latter remains a minority view, but the [[Elephantine papyri]], the records of a Jewish colony in Egypt dating from the last quarter of the 5th century BCE, show no knowledge of a Torah or of an exodus.{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=32}} There is also a growing recognition that Genesis developed separately from Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers, and was joined to the story of Moses by the Priestly writer.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=viii}}

A revised neo-documentary hypothesis still has adherents, especially in North America and Israel.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=271}} This distinguishes sources by means of plot and continuity rather than stylistic and linguistic concerns, and does not tie them to stages in the evolution of Israel's religious history.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=271}} Its resurrection of an E source is probably the element most often criticised by other scholars, as it is rarely distinguishable from the classical J source and European scholars have largely rejected it as fragmentary or non-existent.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=272}}

== The Torah and the history of Israel's religion ==
Wellhausen used the sources of the Torah as evidence of changes in the history of Israelite religion as it moved (in his opinion) from free, simple and natural to fixed, formal and institutional.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=182}} Modern scholars of Israel's religion have become much more circumspect in how they use the Old Testament, not least because many have concluded that the Bible is not a reliable witness to the religion of ancient Israel and Judah, representing instead the beliefs of only a small segment of the ancient Israelite community centred in [[Jerusalem#Ancient period|Jerusalem]] and devoted to the exclusive worship of the god [[Yahweh]].{{sfn|Stackert|2014|p=24}}{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=52}}

'''Electron paramagnetic resonance''' ('''EPR''') or '''electron spin resonance''' ('''ESR''') [[spectroscopy]]
is a method for studying materials with [[unpaired electron]]s. The basic concepts of EPR are analogous to those of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), but it is electron spins that are excited instead of the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. EPR spectroscopy is particularly useful for studying metal complexes or organic radicals.
EPR was first observed in [[Kazan State University]] by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] physicist [[Yevgeny Zavoisky]] in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zavoisky E | year=1945 | title=Spin-magnetic resonance in paramagnetics | journal=Fizicheskiĭ Zhurnal | volume=9 | issue= | pages=211–245 | bibcode= | doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Zavoisky E | year=1944 | title=Paramagnetic Absorption in Perpendicular and Parallel Fields for Salts, Solutions and Metals | degree = PhD }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed independently at the same time by [[Brebis Bleaney]] at [[the University of Oxford]].

== Theory ==

=== Origin of an EPR signal ===
Every electron has a [[magnetic moment]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] [[quantum number]] &lt;math&gt; s = \tfrac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;, with magnetic components &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{s} = + \tfrac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{s} = - \tfrac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;. In the presence of an external magnetic field with strength &lt;math&gt; B_\mathrm{0} &lt;/math&gt;, the electron's magnetic moment aligns itself either parallel (&lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{s} = - \tfrac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;) or antiparallel (&lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{s} = + \tfrac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;) to the field, each alignment having a specific energy due to the [[Zeeman effect]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E = m_s g_e \mu_\text{B} B_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; g_e &lt;/math&gt; is the electron's so-called [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] (see also the [[Landé g-factor|Landé ''g''-factor]]), &lt;math&gt; g_\mathrm{e} = 2.0023&lt;/math&gt; for the free electron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Odom B, Hanneke D, D'Urso B, Gabrielse G | title = New measurement of the electron magnetic moment using a one-electron quantum cyclotron | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 030801 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16907490 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.030801 | bibcode = 2006PhRvL..97c0801O }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \mu_\text{B} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr magneton]].

Therefore, the separation between the lower and the upper state is &lt;math&gt; \Delta E = g_e \mu_\text{B} B_0 &lt;/math&gt; for unpaired free electrons. This equation implies (since both &lt;math&gt; g_e &lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt; \mu_\text{B} &lt;/math&gt; are constant) that the splitting of the energy levels is directly proportional to the [[magnetic field]]'s strength, as shown in the diagram below.
[[File:EPR splitting.svg|300px|centre|Splitting of electron spin states]]

An unpaired electron can move between the two energy levels by either absorbing or emitting a [[photon]] of energy &lt;math&gt; h \nu &lt;/math&gt; such that the resonance condition, &lt;math&gt; h \nu = \Delta E &lt;/math&gt;, is obeyed. This leads to the fundamental equation of EPR spectroscopy: &lt;math&gt; h \nu = g_e \mu_\text{B} B_0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Experimentally, this equation permits a large combination of frequency and magnetic field values, but the great majority of EPR measurements are made with microwaves in the 9000–10000&amp;nbsp;MHz (9–10&amp;nbsp;GHz) region, with fields corresponding to about 3500 [[gauss (unit)|G]] (0.35 [[tesla (unit)|T]]). Furthermore, EPR spectra can be generated by either varying the photon frequency incident on a sample while holding the magnetic field constant or doing the reverse. In practice, it is usually the frequency that is kept fixed. A collection of [[paramagnetic]] centers, such as free radicals, is exposed to microwaves at a fixed frequency. By increasing an external magnetic field, the gap between the &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{s} = + \tfrac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m_\mathrm{s} = - \tfrac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; energy states is widened until it matches the energy of the microwaves, as represented by the double arrow in the diagram above. At this point the unpaired electrons can move between their two spin states. Since there typically are more electrons in the lower state, due to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (see below), there is a net absorption of energy, and it is this absorption that is monitored and converted into a spectrum. The upper spectrum below is the simulated absorption for a system of free electrons in a varying magnetic field. The lower spectrum is the first derivative of the absorption spectrum. The latter is the most common way to record and publish continuous wave EPR spectra.

[[File:EPR lines.png|300px|center]]

For the microwave frequency of 9388.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, the predicted resonance occurs at a magnetic field of about &lt;math&gt; B_0 = h \nu / g_e \mu_\text{B} &lt;/math&gt; = 0.3350 teslas = 3350 gausses.

Because of electron-nuclear mass differences, the [[magnetic moment]] of an electron is substantially larger than the corresponding quantity for any nucleus, so that a much higher electromagnetic frequency is needed to bring about a spin resonance with an electron than with a nucleus, at identical magnetic field strengths. For example, for the field of 3350 G shown at the right, spin resonance occurs near 9388.2&amp;nbsp;MHz for an electron compared to only about 14.3&amp;nbsp;MHz for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei. (For NMR spectroscopy, the corresponding resonance equation is &lt;math&gt; h\nu = g_\mathrm{N} \mu_\mathrm{N} B_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu_\mathrm{N} &lt;/math&gt; depend on the nucleus under study.)

=== Field modulation ===
[[File:Field modulation diagram.jpg|thumb|The field oscillates between B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the superimposed modulation field at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. This causes the absorption intensity to oscillate between I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The larger the difference the larger the intensity detected by the detector tuned to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz (note this can be negative or even 0). As the difference between the two intensities is detected the first derivative of the absorption is detected.]]
As previously mentioned an EPR spectrum is usually directly measured as the first derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field is applied to the external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Electron-Paramagnetic-Resonance-Chemistry-Primers/0198727607/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492443665&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=electron+paramagnetic+resonance|title=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|last=Chechik|first=Victor|last2=Carter|first2=Emma|last3=Murphy|first3=Damien | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-07-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-872760-6|location=New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; By detecting the peak to peak amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100&amp;nbsp;kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.

=== Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution ===
In practice, EPR samples consist of collections of many paramagnetic species, and not single isolated paramagnetic centers. If the population of radicals is in thermodynamic equilibrium, its statistical distribution is described by the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell–Boltzmann equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ n_\text{upper} }{ n_\text{lower} } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ E_\text{upper}-E_\text{lower} }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ \Delta E }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ \epsilon }{ kT } \right) } = \exp{ \left( -\frac{ h\nu }{ kT }\right) }, \qquad \text{(Eq. 1)} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_\text{upper}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of paramagnetic centers occupying the upper energy state, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic temperature]]. At 298 K, X-band microwave frequencies (&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 9.75&amp;nbsp;GHz) give &lt;math&gt;n_\text{upper} / n_\text{lower}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 0.998, meaning that the upper energy level has a slightly smaller population than the lower one. Therefore, transitions from the lower to the higher level are more probable than the reverse, which is why there is a net absorption of energy.

The sensitivity of the EPR method (i.e., the minimal number of detectable spins &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt;) depends on the photon frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;N_\text{min} = \frac{k_1V}{Q_0k_f \nu^2 P^{1/2}}, \qquad \text{(Eq. 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the sample's volume, &lt;math&gt;Q_0&lt;/math&gt; is the unloaded [[Q factor|quality factor]] of the microwave cavity (sample chamber), &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; is the cavity filling coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the microwave power in the spectrometer cavity. With &lt;math&gt;k_f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; being constants, &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt; ~ &lt;math&gt;(Q_0\nu^2)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt; ~ &lt;math&gt;\nu^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.5. In practice, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can change varying from 0.5 to 4.5 depending on spectrometer characteristics, resonance conditions, and sample size.

A great sensitivity is therefore obtained with a low detection limit &lt;math&gt;N_\text{min}&lt;/math&gt; and a large number of spins. Therefore, the required parameters are:
* A high spectrometer frequency to maximize the Eq. 2. Common frequencies are discussed [[Electron paramagnetic resonance#High-field high-frequency measurements|below]]
* A low temperature to decrease the number of spin at the high level of energy as shown in Eq. 1. This condition explains why spectra are often recorded on sample at the [[boiling point]] of [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[liquid helium]].

== Spectral parameters ==
In real systems, electrons are normally not solitary, but are associated with one or more atoms. There are several important consequences of this:
# An unpaired electron can gain or lose angular momentum, which can change the value of its ''g''-factor, causing it to differ from &lt;math&gt; g_e &lt;/math&gt;. This is especially significant for chemical systems with transition-metal ions.
# The magnetic moment of a nucleus with a non-zero nuclear spin will affect any unpaired electrons associated with that atom. This leads to the phenomenon of [[hyperfine coupling]], analogous to [[J-coupling|''J''-coupling]] in NMR, splitting the EPR resonance signal into doublets, triplets and so forth.
# Interactions of an unpaired electron with its environment influence the shape of an EPR spectral line. Line shapes can yield information about, for example,  rates of chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Ira N. | last = Levine | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular Spectroscopy | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-0-471-53128-9 | page = 380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''g''-factor and hyperfine coupling in an atom or molecule may not be the same for all orientations of an unpaired electron in an external magnetic field. This [[anisotropy]] depends upon the electronic structure of the atom or molecule (e.g., free radical) in question, and so can provide information about the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.

=== The ''g'' factor ===
Knowledge of the [[Landé g-factor|''g''-factor]] can give information about a paramagnetic center's electronic structure. An unpaired electron responds not only to a spectrometer's applied magnetic field &lt;math&gt;B_0 &lt;/math&gt; but also to any local magnetic fields of atoms or molecules. The effective field &lt;math&gt; B_\text{eff} &lt;/math&gt; experienced by an electron is thus written

:&lt;math&gt;B_\text{eff} = B_0(1 - \sigma),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; includes the effects of local fields (&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be positive or negative). Therefore, the &lt;math&gt;h \nu = g_e \mu_\text{B} B_\text{eff} &lt;/math&gt; resonance condition (above) is rewritten as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;h\nu = g_e \mu_B B_\text{eff} = g_e \mu_\text{B} B_0 (1 - \sigma).&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt; g_e(1 - \sigma) &lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; and called simply the ''g''-factor, so that the final resonance equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;h \nu = g \mu_\text{B} B_0.&lt;/math&gt;

This last equation is used to determine &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; in an EPR experiment by measuring the field and the frequency at which resonance occurs. If &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; does not equal &lt;math&gt; g_e &lt;/math&gt;, the implication is that the ratio of the unpaired electron's spin magnetic moment to its angular momentum differs from the free-electron value. Since an electron's spin magnetic moment is constant (approximately the Bohr magneton), then the electron must have gained or lost angular momentum through [[spin–orbit coupling]]. Because the mechanisms of spin–orbit coupling are well understood, the magnitude of the change gives information about the nature of the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.

In general, the ''g'' factor is not a [[Scalar (mathematics)|number]] but a second-rank [[tensor]] represented by 9 numbers arranged in a 3×3 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The [[Crystal structure|principal axes]] of this tensor are determined by the local fields, for example, by the local atomic arrangement around the unpaired spin in a solid or in a molecule. Choosing an appropriate coordinate system (say, ''x'',''y'',''z'') allows one to "diagonalize" this tensor, thereby reducing the maximal number of its components from 9 to 3: ''g&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;yy&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''g&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;''. For a single spin experiencing only Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field, the position of the EPR resonance is given by the expression ''g&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''g&lt;sub&gt;yy&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''g&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''. Here ''B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the components of the magnetic field vector in the coordinate system (''x'',''y'',''z''); their magnitudes change as the field is rotated, so does the frequency of the resonance. For a large ensemble of randomly oriented spins, the EPR spectrum consists of three peaks of characteristic shape at frequencies ''g&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g&lt;sub&gt;yy&lt;/sub&gt;B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: the low-frequency peak is positive in first-derivative spectra, the high-frequency peak is negative, and the central peak is bipolar. Such situations are commonly observed in powders, and the spectra are therefore called "powder-pattern spectra". In crystals, the number of EPR lines is determined by the number of crystallographically equivalent orientations of the EPR spin (called "EPR center").

=== Hyperfine coupling ===
Since the source of an EPR spectrum is a change in an electron's spin state, the EPR spectrum for a radical (S = 1/2 system) would consist of one line. Greater complexity arises because the spin couples with nearby nuclear spins.  The magnitude of the coupling is proportional to the magnetic moment of the coupled nuclei and depends on the mechanism of the coupling.  Coupling is mediated by two processes, dipolar (through space) and isotropic (through bond).

This coupling introduces additional energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The [[hyperfine coupling]] constant of a nucleus is directly related to the spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself. {{citation needed | reason = no citation provided for last two paragraphs | date = January 2018 }}

Two common mechanisms by which electrons and nuclei interact are the [[Fermi contact interaction]] and by dipolar interaction. The former applies largely to the case of isotropic interactions (independent of sample orientation in a magnetic field) and the latter to the case of anisotropic interactions (spectra dependent on sample orientation in a magnetic field). Spin polarization is a third mechanism for interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin, being especially important for &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-electron organic radicals, such as the benzene radical anion. The symbols "''a''" or "''A''" are used for isotropic hyperfine coupling constants, while "''B''" is usually employed for anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, "''a''" refers to the hyperfine splitting constant, a line spacing measured in magnetic field units, while ''A'' and ''B'' refer to hyperfine coupling constants measured in frequency units. Splitting and coupling constants are proportional, but not identical. The book by Wertz and Bolton has more information (pp. 46 and 442). {{cite book | vauthors = Wertz JE, Bolton JR | date = 1972 | title = Electron spin resonance: Elementary theory and practical applications. | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the isotropic hyperfine splitting pattern for a radical freely tumbling in a solution (isotropic system) can be predicted.

====Multiplicity====
* For a radical having ''M'' equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I'', the number of EPR lines expected is 2''MI''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. As an example, the methyl radical, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei, each with ''I''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2, and so the number of lines expected is 2''MI''&amp;nbsp;+ 1&amp;nbsp;= 2(3)(1/2)&amp;nbsp;+ 1&amp;nbsp;= 4, which is as observed.
* For a radical having ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and a group of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent nuclei, each with a spin of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of lines expected is (2''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 1) (2''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 1). As an example, the methoxymethyl radical, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), has two equivalent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei, each with ''I''&amp;nbsp;= 1/2 and three equivalent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei each with ''I''&amp;nbsp;= 1/2, and so the number of lines expected is (2''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 1) (2''M''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 1) = [2(2)(1/2) + 1] [2(3)(1/2) + 1] = 3×4 = 12, again as observed.
[[File:EPR methyl.png|thumb|right|300px|Simulated EPR spectrum of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical]]
* The above can be extended to predict the number of lines for any number of nuclei.

While it is easy to predict the number of lines, the reverse problem, unraveling a complex multi-line EPR spectrum and assigning the various spacings to specific nuclei, is more difficult.

In the often encountered case of ''I''&amp;nbsp;= 1/2 nuclei (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P), the line intensities produced by a population of radicals, each possessing ''M'' equivalent nuclei, will follow [[Pascal's triangle]]. For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei of the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radical give rise to 2''MI''&amp;nbsp;+ 1&amp;nbsp;= 2(3)(1/2)&amp;nbsp;+ 1&amp;nbsp;= 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio. The line spacing gives a hyperfine coupling constant of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; = 23 ''G'' for each of the three &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nuclei. Note again that the lines in this spectrum are ''first derivatives'' of absorptions.

[[File:EPR methoxymethyl.png|thumb|right|300px|Simulated EPR spectrum of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) radical]]
As a second example, the methoxymethyl radical, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt; the OC''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; center will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component of which is further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3×4&amp;nbsp;= 12 lines, a triplet of quartets. A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities. Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller line spacing) is due to the three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron. It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's unpaired electron, but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Resonance linewidth definition ===
Resonance linewidths are defined in terms of the magnetic induction ''B'' and its corresponding units, and are measured along the ''x'' axis of an EPR spectrum, from a line's center to a chosen reference point of the line. These defined widths are called [[spectroscopic line shape|halfwidths]] and possess some advantages: for asymmetric lines, values of left and right halfwidth can be given. The halfwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_h&lt;/math&gt; is the distance measured from the line's center to the point in which [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] value has half of maximal absorption value in the center of [[resonance]] line. First inclination width &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; is a distance from center of the line to the point of maximal absorption curve inclination. In practice, a full definition of linewidth is used. For symmetric lines, halfwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_{1/2} = 2\Delta B_h&lt;/math&gt;, and full inclination width &lt;math&gt;\Delta B_\text{max} = 2\Delta B_{1s}&lt;/math&gt;.


== Applications ==
EPR/ESR spectroscopy is used in various branches of science, such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], for the detection and identification of [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] and paramagnetic centers such as [[F-center]]s. EPR is a sensitive, specific method for studying both radicals formed in chemical reactions and the reactions themselves. For example, when ice (solid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is decomposed by exposure to high-energy radiation, radicals such as H, OH, and HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are produced. Such radicals can be identified and studied by EPR. Organic and inorganic radicals can be detected in electrochemical systems and in materials exposed to [[UV]] light. In many cases, the reactions to make the radicals and the subsequent reactions of the radicals are of interest, while in other cases EPR is used to provide information on a radical's geometry and the orbital of the unpaired electron. EPR/ESR spectroscopy is also used in geology and archaeology as a dating tool. It can be applied to a wide range of materials such as carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, silica or other silicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/1854|title=New Applications of Electron Spin Resonance|last=Ikeya|first=Motoji | name-list-format = vanc |doi=10.1142/1854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[medicine|Medical]] and [[biology|biological]] applications of EPR also exist.  Although radicals are very reactive, and so do not normally occur in high concentrations in biology, special reagents have been developed to spin-label molecules of interest. These reagents are particularly useful in biological systems. Specially-designed nonreactive radical molecules can attach to specific sites in a [[cell (biology)|biological cell]], and EPR spectra can then give information on the environment of these so-called [[spin label]]s or [[spin probe]]s. Spin-labeled fatty acids have been extensively used to study dynamic organisation of lipids in biological membranes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02702669| title = Magnetic resonance studies of dynamic organisation of lipids in chloroplast membranes| journal = Journal of Biosciences| volume = 15| issue = 4| pages = 281| year = 1990| vauthors = Yashroy RC }}&lt;/ref&gt; lipid-protein interactions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = YashRoy RC | title = Protein heat denaturation and study of membrane lipid-protein interactions by spin label ESR | journal = Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–9 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 1848569 | doi = 10.1016/0165-022X(91)90081-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and temperature of transition of gel to liquid crystalline phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = YashRoy RC | title = Determination of membrane lipid phase transition temperature from 13C-NMR intensities | journal = Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 353–6 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2365951 | doi = 10.1016/0165-022X(90)90097-V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A type of [[dosimetry]] system has been designed for reference standards and routine use in medicine, based on EPR signals of radicals from irradiated polycrystalline α-[[alanine]] (the alanine deamination radical, the hydrogen abstraction radical, and the (CO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;(OH))=C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; radical) . This method is suitable for measuring [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[x-ray]]s, electrons, protons, and high-[[linear energy transfer]] (LET) radiation of [[absorbed dose|doses]] in the 1 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]] to 100 kGy range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  Chu RD, McLaughlin WL, Miller A, Sharpe PH | title = 5.

EPR/ESR spectroscopy can be applied only to systems in which the balance between radical decay and radical formation keeps the free radicals concentration above the detection limit of the spectrometer used. This can be a particularly severe problem in studying reactions in liquids. An alternative approach is to slow down reactions by studying samples held at [[cryogenic]] temperatures, such as 77 K ([[liquid nitrogen]]) or 4.2 K ([[liquid helium]]). An example of this work is the study of radical reactions in single crystals of amino acids exposed to x-rays, work that sometimes leads to [[activation energy|activation energies]] and rate constants for radical reactions.

The study of radiation-induced free radicals in biological substances (for cancer research) poses the additional problem that tissue contains water, and water (due to its [[electric dipole moment]]) has a strong absorption band in the [[microwave]] region used in EPR spectrometers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

EPR/ESR also has been used by archaeologists for the dating of teeth. Radiation damage over long periods of time creates free radicals in tooth enamel, which can then be examined by EPR and, after proper calibration, dated. Alternatively, material extracted from the teeth of people during dental procedures can be used to quantify their cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation. People exposed to radiation from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] have been examined by this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gualtieri G, Colacicchi S, Sgattoni R, Giannoni M | title = The Chernobyl accident: EPR dosimetry on dental enamel of children | journal = Applied Radiation and Isotopes | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–9 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11339534 | doi = 10.1016/S0969-8043(00)00351-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Chumak V, Sholom S, Pasalskaya L |title = Application of High Precision EPR Dosimetry with Teeth for Reconstruction of Doses to Chernobyl Populations|journal = Radiation Protection Dosimetry|year = 1999|volume = 84|issue =|pages = 515–520|url = http://rpd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/1-4/515|doi =10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a032790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiation-sterilized foods have been examined with EPR spectroscopy, the aim being to develop methods to determine whether a particular food sample has been irradiated and to what dose. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

EPR/ESR spectroscopy has been used to measure properties of [[crude oil]], in particular [[asphaltene]] and [[vanadium]] content. EPR measurement of asphaltene content is a function of spin density and solvent polarity. Prior work dating to the 1960s has demonstrated the ability to measure vanadium content to sub-ppm levels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== High-field high-frequency measurements ==
High-field high-frequency EPR measurements are sometimes needed to detect subtle spectroscopic details. However, for many years the use of electromagnets to produce the needed fields above 1.5 T was impossible, due principally to limitations of traditional magnet materials. The first multifunctional millimeter EPR spectrometer with a superconducting solenoid was described in the early 1970s by Prof. Y. S. Lebedev's group (Russian [[Institute of Chemical Physics]], Moscow) in collaboration with L. G. Oranski's group (Ukrainian Physics and Technics Institute, Donetsk), which began working in the [[Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics]], [[Chernogolovka]] around 1975.&lt;ref name=lowd&gt;[http://hf-epr.awardspace.us/index.htm EPR of low-dimensional systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, a W-band EPR spectrometer was produced as a small commercial line by the German [[Bruker]] Company, initiating the expansion of W-band EPR techniques into medium-sized academic laboratories.

The EPR waveband is stipulated by the frequency or wavelength of a spectrometer's microwave source (see Table).

EPR experiments often are conducted at [[X band|X]] and, less commonly, Q bands, mainly due to the ready availability of the necessary microwave components (which originally were developed for [[radar]] applications). A second reason for widespread X and Q band measurements is that electromagnets can reliably generate fields up to about 1 tesla. However, the low spectral resolution over ''g''-factor at these wavebands limits the study of paramagnetic centers with comparatively low anisotropic magnetic parameters. Measurements at &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 40&amp;nbsp;GHz, in the millimeter wavelength region, offer the following advantages:

[[File:EPR multifrequency spectra.png|thumb|400px|EPR spectra of TEMPO, a nitroxide radical, as a function of frequency. Note the improvement in resolution from left to right.&lt;ref name=lowd /&gt;]]
# EPR spectra are simplified due to the reduction of second-order effects at high fields.
# Increase in orientation selectivity and sensitivity in the investigation of disordered systems.
# The informativity and precision of [[Pulse EPR|pulse methods]], e.g., [[ENDOR]] also increase at high magnetic fields.
# Accessibility of spin systems with larger zero-field splitting due to the larger microwave quantum energy ''h''&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.
# The higher spectral resolution over ''g''-factor, which increases with irradiation frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and external magnetic field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This is used to investigate the structure, polarity, and dynamics of radical microenvironments in spin-modified organic and biological systems through the [[spin label]] and probe method. The figure shows how spectral resolution improves with increasing frequency.
# Saturation of paramagnetic centers occurs at a comparatively low microwave polarizing field ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, due to the exponential dependence of the number of excited spins on the radiation frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;. This effect can be successfully used to study the relaxation and dynamics of paramagnetic centers as well as of superslow motion in the systems under study.
# The cross-relaxation of paramagnetic centers decreases dramatically at high magnetic fields, making it easier to obtain more-precise and more-complete information about the system under study.&lt;ref name=lowd /&gt;

This was demonstrated experimentally in the study of various biological, polymeric and model systems at D-band EPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Krinichnyi VI | date = 1995 | title = 2-mm Wave Band EPR Spectroscopy of Condensed Systems | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton, Fl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware components ==
=== The microwave bridge ===
The microwave bridge contains both the microwave source and the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sayWdlbWGfwC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=microwave+bridge+epr#v=onepage&amp;q=microwave%20bridge%20epr&amp;f=false|title=Quantitative EPR|last=Eaton|first=Gareth R.|last2=Eaton|first2=Sandra S.|last3=Barr|first3=David P.|last4=Weber|first4=Ralph T. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010-04-10|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-211-92948-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a [[klystron]] to generate microwaves, but modern spectrometers use a [[Gunn diode]]. Immediately after the microwave source there is an isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Electron-Paramagnetic-Resonance-Chemistry-Primers/0198727607/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499418567&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=electron+paramagnetic+resonance|title=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|last=Chechik|first=Victor|last2=Carter|first2=Emma|last3=Murphy|first3=Damien | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-07-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-872760-6|edition=UK|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control of the flow of microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.

Most EPR machines are reflection spectrometers, meaning that the detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation coming back from the cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the [[circulator]] which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.

==== The need for the reference arm ====

At low energies (less than 1 μW) the diode current is proportional to the microwave power and the detector is referred to as a square law detector. At higher power levels (greater than 1&amp;nbsp;mW) the diode current is proportional to the square root of the microwave power and the detector is called a linear detector. In order to obtain optimal sensitivity as well as quantitative information the diode should be operating within the linear region. To ensure the detector is operating at that level the reference arm serves to provide a "bias".

=== The magnet ===
In an EPR machine the magnetic assembly includes the magnetic with a dedicated power supply as well as a field sensor or regulator such as a [[Hall effect sensor|Hall probe]]. EPR machines use one of two types of magnet which is determined by the operating microwave frequency (which determine the range of magnetic field strengths required). The first is an electromagnet which are generally capable of generating field strengths of up to 1.5 T making them suitable for measurements using the Q-band frequency. In order to generate field strengths appropriate for W-band and higher frequency operation superconducting magnets are employed. The magnetic field is homogeneous across the sample volume and has a high stability at static field.

=== The microwave resonator (cavity) ===
The microwave resonator is designed to enhance the microwave magnetic field at the sample in order to induce EPR transitions.  It is a metal box with a rectangular or cylindrical shape that resonates with microwaves (like an organ pipe with sound waves). At the resonance frequency of the cavity microwaves remain inside the cavity and are not reflected back. Resonance means the cavity stores microwave energy and its ability to do this is given by the quality factor (''Q''), defined by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac {2\pi(energy\  stored)}{(energy\ dissipated)}&lt;/math&gt;

The higher the value of Q the higher the sensitivity of the spectrometer. The energy dissipated is the energy lost in one microwave period. Energy may be lost to the side walls of the cavity as microwaves may generate currents which in turn generate heat. A consequence of resonance is the creation of a standing wave inside the cavity.  Electromagnetic standing waves have their electric and magnetic field components exactly out of phase. This provides an advantage as the electric field provides nonresonant absorption of the microwaves, which in turn increases the dissipated energy and reduces Q. To achieve the largest signals and hence sensitivity the sample is positioned such that it lies within the magnetic field maximum and the electric field minimum. When the magnetic field strength is such that an absorption event occurs, the value of Q will be reduced due to the extra energy loss. This results in a change of impedance which serves to stop the cavity from being critically coupled. This means microwaves will now be reflected back to the detector (in the microwave bridge) where an EPR signal is detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=Gareth R.|last2=Eaton|first2= Sandra S.|last3=Barr|first3= David P.|last4=Weber|first4= Ralph T. |name-list-format = vanc |title=Basics of Continuous Wave EPR|journal=Quantitative EPR|date=2010|pages=1–14|doi=10.1007/978-3-211-92948-3_1 | isbn=978-3-211-92947-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance ==
{{details|Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance}}

The dynamics of electron spins are best studied with pulsed measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Arthur | last1 = Schweiger | first2 = Gunnar | last2 = Jeschke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-19-850634-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microwave pulses typically 10–100 ns long are used to control the spins in the [[Bloch sphere]]. The [[spin–lattice relaxation time]] can be measured with an [[inversion recovery]] experiment.

As with pulsed [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]], the [[Hahn echo]] is central to many pulsed EPR experiments. A [[Spin echo|Hahn echo]] decay experiment can be used to measure the dephasing time, as shown in the animation below. The size of the echo is recorded for different spacings of the two pulses. This reveals the decoherence, which is not refocused by the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; pulse. In simple cases, an [[exponential decay]] is measured, which is described by the &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; time.

[[File:GWM HahnEchoDecay.gif]]

Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance could be advanced into [[electron nuclear double resonance]] spectroscopy (ENDOR), which utilizes waves in the radio frequencies. Since different nuclei with unpaired electrons respond to different wavelengths, radio frequencies are required at times. Since the results of the ENDOR gives the coupling resonance between the nuclei and the unpaired electron, the relationship between them can be determined.

A '''functional beverage''' is a drink typically intended to convey a health benefit. Some include ingredients like herbs, vitamins, minerals, nootropics, [[amino acid]]s, or additional raw fruit or vegetables.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Examples of functional beverages include [[sports drinks|sports]] and performance drinks, [[energy drink]]s, ready to drink (RTD) teas, smart drinks (shine+), enhanced fruit drinks, [[soy beverage]]s, and [[enhanced water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flex-news-food.com/pages/16777/Beverages/Ingredients/USA/us-functional-beverages-market-young-market-growing-popularity.html U.S. Functional Beverages Market: A Young Market with Growing Popularity]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==
Functional beverages have become popular among people who want specific health benefits from their foods and beverages. Both convenience and health have been identified as important factors in consumers' decision-making about food and beverage purchases. Functional drinks are advertised as having various health benefits. For example, some claim to improve heart health, [[immune system|immunity]], [[digestion]], and [[joint]] health, while others promote themselves as [[satiety|satiating]] and energy-boosting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association: Functional Beverages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The functional beverage industry is a subsector of the [[functional food]] and non-alcoholic beverage industry. It is the fastest-growing sector of the industry, partially due to the maturity of the carbonated [[soft drink]] sector and heavy investments by major food and beverage companies.&lt;ref name="scholan"&gt;Scholan, I. "Functional Beverages-- where next? Innovation in functional beverages market is set to continue." ''International Food Ingredients'' December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the industry's growth may be the consumer-oriented market scheme whereby innovative ideas come from consumers. By 2008, in the U.S., the market share of functional beverages accounted for 48.9% of the non-alcoholic industry, which is worth $118.3 billion.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, W. "Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods'' August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, functional beverage consumption [[per capita]]{{where|date=October 2015}} rose to 66.4 gallons, while the carbonated soft drink sector saw a decline{{when|date=October 2015}} in per-capita consumption to 50.4 gallons (decreased from an average per-capita consumption of 192.5 gallons in 2006).&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages" /&gt;

Functional beverage industry players are generally categorized into four types:&lt;ref name="packaged2009"&gt;"Functional Foods and Beverages in US. MaryLand." ''Packaged Facts.'' May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Traditional non-alcoholic beverage companies, like [[PepsiCo]], [[Fuze Beverage]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. 
# Major food companies, such as [[Nestlé]], [[Altria]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[General Mills]], and the [[Campbell Soup Company]].
# Smaller-scaled private companies, like SALOMED GmbH&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salomed.com/functional-beverages&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Austria]], and specialized companies like Traditional Medicinals and [[POM Wonderful]].
# [[Agricultural cooperative]]s, such as [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] and [[Sunsweet Growers]].

== Product trends ==
The functional beverage industry encompasses a wide range of varieties targeting different health-related concerns.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; One trend has been toward hybrid drinks, which are marketed as having benefits like thirst-quenching ability, with daily dosages of vitamins or other nutrients.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; Another trend is the rise of [[probiotics]], exemplified by [[Activia]] yogurt, marketed for intestinal and immune health. Other beverages, like [[Function Drinks#Function: BRAINIAC|Function: BRAINIAC]], a [[carambola]] punch energy drink in the [[Function Drinks]] line, advertise improved memory and mental sharpness. Functional drinks marketed to children have also been developed, and received attention with Nestlé's [[Boost (beverage)|Boost]].

A 2005 trend toward single-serve functional beverages was fueled by consumers' demands for convenience.{{vague|date=October 2015}} According to Campbell's director of single-serve beverages, "People know they will be seen when they are drinking single-serving beverages, so the package is critical." &lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Bob "Sweet Revenge." ''Progressive Grocer'' 2005 84(5): 34-36, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Drinks marketed toward weight loss, health, and beauty (like Nova the Essential Drink) account for a considerable [[market share]]. Lastly, "energy-boosting" functional beverage products, such as [[Red Bull]] and [[5-Hour Energy]], have been rated fastest{{when|date=January 2015}} in growth in the functional beverage market.

== Market ==

The functional beverage industry generally competes using four primary strategies:&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;
# Promote their own products as healthy and unique, by clearly distinguishing their health claims from similar products, and by specifying naturally healthy ingredients.
# Consider extensions of existing brand lines. For example, Nestle extended their Boost product line by adding Kids Essentials to the line, thereby extending the adult-focused Boost line to a new market (children).
# Larger companies compete for market share by [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquiring]] smaller companies that may own a particular market sector.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt; For example, Coca-Cola purchased Glaceau from [[Energy Brands]], and [[Odwalla]] and [[Fuze Beverage]] from their respective founders, in order to increase Coca-Cola's market share.
# Explore new functional brands by identifying new markets and demands.

Market segments of the functional beverage industry are divided mainly into four parts.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Those include hydration; energy/rejuvenation; health and wellness; and weight management.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Each segment has its own [[target market]] and consumers. Overlapping of target consumers does occur—not because of undefined market needs, but due to consumer acceptance of functional beverages.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;

=== Hydration ===
Recently,{{when|date=October 2015}} there has been an increase in the promotion of [[hydrational fluid|hydration]] drinks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fowhich it marketed as an exclusive hydration drink, sold only in [[Neiman Marcus]] stores. Among the drink's ingredient list were [[antioxidant]] vitamins and fruit extracts, which the company claims "hydrate the inner and outer layer of the skin" and protect drinkers from [[free radical]]s.&lt;ref name="Benefiting Beverages"&gt;Benefiting Beverages. ''Prepared Foods'' 2009 178(8): 13-24, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gatorade]] has also created several drinks marketed as hydration beverages with various health benefits. Its "Thirst Quencher" drinks, according to advertisements, each contain an "excellent source" of various vitamins:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* 25% of the [[Reference Daily Intake|RDI]] of B vitamins (including vitamins [[vitamin B3|B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[vitamin B5|B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]);
* 20% of the RDI of the [[antioxidant]] [[vitamin E]]; and,
* 20% of the RDI of [[vitamin C]].

In tandem with these adjustments, a low-calorie version called G2 was also reformulated. According to Gatorade, G2 now also provides:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* an "excellent source" (25% of the RDI) of B vitamins (including vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;); and,
* a "good source" (10% of the RDI) of vitamins [[Vitamin C|C]] and [[vitamin E|E]].

Gatorade's new products are a good example of the first major strategy of competition, listed in the "Market" section above. By reformulating its products, Gatorade's goals were to promote their own new products as healthier, and to emphasize the healthy ingredients in the drinks.

=== Energy and stimulation ===
Highly caffeinated, often highly sweetened "energy drinks" have become popular on the beverage market in the United States, as well as globally, in the past decade. Consumer demand has helped generate a new generation of "energy drink" brands containing similar amounts of caffeine, calories, and sugar.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt;

Various stimulants found in energy drinks include [[taurine]], [[glucoronolactone]], [[caffeine]], [[B vitamins]], [[guarana]], [[ginseng]], [[ginkgo biloba]], [[L-carnitine]], [[sugars]], antioxidants, [[yerba maté]], [[creatine]], and [[milk thistle]].&lt;ref name="sharon"&gt;Sharon Palmer. "Functional Beverages" http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm. Accessed Dec 3 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these ingredients have been approved by the [[FDA]], health experts still recommend that consumers read their energy drinks' labels, as these ingredients may not improve health.&lt;ref name="sharon" /&gt;

=== Health and wellness ===
"Health-conscious" individuals are among the target consumers of many functional beverage companies. To target these individuals, many companies have introduced functional beverages which contain less sugar, and therefore less calories.{{synthesis inline|date=October 2015}} For example, [[VitaminWater]] 10 contains only 10 calories per serving (25 calories for a 351mL bottle, with 7.5&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar). An entire bottle also contains 250% of the RDI of vitamin C,&lt;ref name="rebecca"&gt;Rebecca Wright. "Functional Beverages: Surviving or Thriving?" http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/articles/2009/07/functional-beverages-thriving-or-surviving. Retrieved December 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and 25% of the RDI of vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt; VitaminWater 10 lowered its calorie content by using an all-natural sweetener ([[stevia]]) extracted from the ''[[Stevia rebaudiana]]'' plant. This also makes it possible for the company to advertise VitaminWater 10 as "natural".&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;

=== Weight management ===
With increased worries about [[obesity]] and its implications on health, combined with consumer demand for convenience goods, consumer demand has increased for easy weight loss methods that can be easily integrated into daily lifestyles.&lt;ref name="william" /&gt; Functional beverages are striving to market themselves as such, by adding ingredients that are claimed to promote weight loss.&lt;ref name="william"&gt;"Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods.'' 1 August 2009. Assessed 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Nestlé and The Coca-Cola Company have partnered to produce [[Enviga]], which they describe as a "calorie-burning beverage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/healthy-weight-commitment Coca-Cola – Press Center – New Products – Enviga Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Skinny Water (owned by Skinny Nutritional Corp.) and [[Nutrisoda]]'s Slenderized (owned by PepsiCo) have both used a [[polyphenol]] called [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (EGCG) in their products for their "{{Sic|metabolize boosting}} effect". 
* A tea extract called "Blue California", which has a 95% EGCG content, is now on the market.&lt;ref&gt;Landi, Heather "Tea Revolution." ''Beverage World'' 2009 128(10): 78, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investigators report slimming actions induced by [[chlorogenic acid]]s from [[green coffee]], but further investigations need to be performed.&lt;!-- Need to list the risks here --&gt;

===Sales===
As of 2008, based on dollar sales, the most popular functional beverages, in order, were:&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages"&gt;Functional Beverages. ''Beverage World'' 2008 127(3): 14, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# Health and wellness drinks, with 62.2% of dollar sales
# Hydration drinks (28%)
# Energy/Rejuvenation drinks (8.4%)
# Weight Management drinks (1.2%)

== Consumer demographic ==
According to a 2006 article, the functional beverage market's [[consumer group]] is characterized as well-educated females aged 35–55, belonging to the upper middle, middle, and lower middle classes.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt; This is thought to result from this group's perceptions that functional drinks produce positive health beliefs, as well as their relatively high [[disposable income]].&lt;ref name="bogue 2006"&gt;Bogue, J., Seymour, C. and Sorenson, D. "Market-oriented new product development of meal replacement and meal complement beverages." ''Journal of Food Products Marketing’’, 2006 12(3): 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 article stated that within the energy and stimulant drink sector, young adults aged 18 to 34 are considered to be the main target market, as evidenced by high consumption rates.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C. and Emerton, V. "Food and Drinks through the Lifecycle." ''Surrey:Leatherhead International’’. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to constant changes in attitudes about different types of functional beverages, these target markets could change.&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;Van Trijp, H.C.M. and Van Der Lans, I.A. (2007). "Consumer perceptions of nutrition and health claims." ''Appetite’’. 2007 48(3):305–324&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health concerns ==
Health experts are concerned about the increased consumption and popularity of functional beverages. Although these beverages may serve to hydrate the individual, they may not mitigate or even address today's major health issues, such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], and [[cancer]]. Most functional beverages are sweetened, and consumption of sweetened beverages is associated with higher levels of obesity and heart disease.&lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks"&gt;http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association – Functional Beverages Accessed 2 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these drinks contain significant amounts of [[sugars]] and hence calories, which would add to discretionary and total [[caloric]] intake. As such, these ingredients pose health risks because of what they contain (sugar and caffeine) or what they replace in the diet (vitamin and mineral-rich foods).

Another set of concerns is that some functional beverages contain ingredients that have not been sufficiently studied for health benefits, safety, and dosage. At the same time, many functional beverages have higher levels of a certain ingredient, like caffeine—which, when consumed in large amounts, is associated with heart disease and cancer.&lt;!-- need citation --&gt; &lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks" /&gt;

=== Sugar content ===
Many functional drinks have high levels of sugar, even if they have other "healthy" ingredients. For example, a 20oz bottle of [[Glacéau]]'s [[VitaminWater]] has been reported to contain approximately 33 g of sugar, which is similar to the sugar content of a can of [[Coca-Cola]]. This prompted [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to be sued for claiming that VitaminWater was a healthy beverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/200901151.html  [[Coca-Cola]] was sued for Fraudulent Claims on Obesity-Promoting "Vitaminwater" Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their sugar content, many functional beverages may not be as healthy an alternative as other commonly consumed beverages. In addition, the sugar content of such beverages promotes dental cavities amongst frequent users.

=== Energy drinks ===
{{Main article|Energy drink}}
In some functional beverages, particularly energy drinks, the caffeine content can be up to 141 milligrams per serving, more than an average 8-ounce cup of coffee containing 133&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine. There have been reports to Health Canada of adverse reactions involving energy drinks.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/prod/energy-energie-eng.php#he It's Your Health – Safe Use of Energy Drinks. Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Farkas Gyula''', or '''Julius Farkas''' (March 28, 1847 – December 27, 1930) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]].

He attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at [[Győr]] (Raab), and studied law and [[physics]] at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. After teaching in a secondary school at [[Székesfehérvár]] (Stuhlweissenburg), Farkas became in succession [[Principal (school)|principal]] of the normal school at [[Pápa]], [[privat-docent]] (1881) of mathematics at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]], and [[professor]] of physics (1888) at [[Franz Joseph University]] of [[Kolozsvár]] (Klausenburg). He worked here up to 1915, when he retired and moved to Budapest.

The Hungarian Academy of Science elected him corresponding member May 6, 1898. He made a contribution to linear algebra with [[Farkas' lemma]], which is named after him for his derivation of it.

== Literary works ==
His principal writings are embodied in the reports of the Academy of Science of Paris (1878–1884)
* the "''Archiv der Mathematik und Physik''"
* the "''Journal des Mathematiques''"

His separately published works are:
* "''Die diatonische Dur-Scale wissenschaftlich begründet''", Pest, 1870
* "''Természettan elemei''" (Elements of Physics), Székesfehérvár, 1872

'''H6N2''' is an [[avian influenza]] [[virus]] with two forms: one has a low and the other a high [[pathogen]]icity. Avian derived from the [[Latin]] word ''avis'' for "[[bird]]." It can cause a serious problem for [[poultry]], and also infects ducks as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackwood|first1=MW|last2=Suarez|first2=DL|last3=Pantin-Jackwood|first3=MJ|last4=Spackman|first4=E|last5=Woolcock|first5=P|last6=Cardona|first6=C.|title=Biologic characterization of chicken-derived H6N2 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in chickens and ducks|journal=Avian Dis.|date=2010|volume=54|issue=1|pages=120–125|pmid=20408410|doi=10.1637/8987-070909-resnote.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; H6N2 subtype is considered to be a non-pathogenic chicken virus, the host still unknown, but could strain from feral animals, and/or aquatic bird reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webby|first1=Richard J.|last2=Woolcock|first2=Peter R.|last3=Krauss|first3=Scott L.|last4=Webster|first4=Robert G.|title=Reassortment and Interspecies Transmission of North American H6N2 Influenza Viruses|journal=Virology|date=2002|volume=295|pages=44–53|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0042682201913418/1-s2.0-S0042682201913418-main.pdf?_tid=9ac8914e-0c0a-11e6-89f0-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1461715216_5c6d4bad7173976558cc90e4a712a4a2|doi=10.1006/viro.2001.1341|pmid=12033764}}&lt;/ref&gt; H6N2 along with H6N6 are viruses that are found to replicate in mice without preadaptation, and some have acquired the ability to bind to human-like receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang|first1=Guojun|last2=Deng|first2=Guohua|last3=Shi|first3=Jianzhong|last4=Luo|first4=Weiyu|last5=Zhang|first5=Guoquan|last6=Zhang|first6=Qianyi|last7=Liu|first7=Liling|last8=Jiang|first8=Yongping|last9=Li|first9=Chengjun|last10=Sriwilaijaroen|first10=Nongluk|last11=Hiramatsu|first11=Hiroaki|last12=Suzuki|first12=Yasuo|last13=Kawaoka|first13=Yoshihiro|last14=Chen|first14=Hualan|authorlink14=Chen Hualan |title=H6 Influenza Viruses Pose a Potential Threat to Human Health|journal=Journal of Virology|date=15 April 2014|volume=88|issue=8|pages=3953–3964|doi=10.1128/JVI.03292-13|doi-access=free|issn=0022-538X|pmid=24501418|pmc=3993743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic markers for H6N2 include 22-amino acid stalk deletion in [[neuraminidase]] (NA) protein gene, increased [[N-glycosylation]], and a D144 mutation of the [[Haemagglutinin]] (HA) protein gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abolnik|first1=C.|last2=Bisschop|first2=S.|last3=Gerdes|first3=T.|last4=Olivier|first4=A.|last5=Horner|first5=R.|title=Outbreaks of avian influenza H6N2 viruses in chickens arose by a reassortment of H6N8 and H9N2 ostrich viruses.|journal=Virus Genes|date=2007|volume=34|issue=1|pages=37–45|pmid=16927114|doi=10.1007/s11262-006-0007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission of avian influenza viruses from wild aquatic birds to domestic birds usually cause subclinical infections, and occasionally, respiratory disease and drops in egg production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackwood|first1=MW|last2=Suarez|first2=DL|last3=Pantin-Jackwood|first3=MJ|last4=Spackman|first4=E|last5=Woolcock|first5=P|last6=Cardona|first6=C.|title=Biologic characterization of chicken-derived H6N2 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in chickens and ducks|journal=Avian Dis.|date=2010|volume=54|issue=1|pages=120–125|pmid=20408410|doi=10.1637/8987-070909-resnote.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some histological features presented in chicken infected with H6N2 are fibrinous yolk peritonitis, salpingitis, oophoritis, nephritis, along with swollen kidneys as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinde|first1=Hailu|last2=Read|first2=Deryck H.|last3=Daft|first3=Barbara M.|last4=Hammarlund|first4=Marion|last5=Moore|first5=Janet|last6=Uzal|first6=Francisco|last7=Mukai|first7=Janee|last8=Woolcock|first8=Peter|title=he Occurrence of Avian Influenza A Subtype H6N2 in Commercial Layer Flocks in Southern California (2000–02): Clinicopathologic Findings|journal=Avian Diseases|date=September 2003|volume=47|issue=3|pages=1214–1218|doi=10.1637/0005-2086-47.s3.1214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subject area of [[control theory]], an '''internal model''' is a process that simulates the response of the system in order to estimate the outcome of a system disturbance.  The '''internal model principle''' was first articulated in 1976 by B. A. Francis and W. M. Wonham&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Francis and W. M. Wonham, "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walter_Wonham/publication/223996193_The_internal_model_principle_of_control_theory/links/5488b5610cf289302e30b828.pdf The internal model principle of control theory]", ''Automatica'' '''12''' (1976) 457–465.&lt;/ref&gt; as an explicit formulation of the Conant and Ashby [[good regulator]] theorem.
&lt;ref&gt;Roger C. Conant and W. Ross Ashby, "[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Books/Conant_Ashby.pdf Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system]", ''International Journal of Systems Science'' vol '''1''' (1970), 89–97.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in contrast to classical control, in that the classical [[feedback loop]] fails to explicitly model the controlled system (although the classical controller may contain an implicit model).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Swevers, "[https://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~jswevers/h04x3a/lecture_c9_c10.pdf Internal model control (IMC)]", 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry Y. Li, "[http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me8281/notes/Old%20S06/Chapter%208%20IMP-repetitive.pdf Internal Model Principle and Repetitive Control]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The  internal model theory of motor control argues that the motor system is controlled by the constant interactions of the “[[Plant (control theory)|plant]]” and the “[[Controller (control theory)|controller]].” The plant is the body part being controlled, while the internal model itself is considered part of the controller. Information from the controller, such as information from the [[Central nervous system|central nervous system (CNS)]], feedback information, and the [[efference copy]], is sent to the plant which moves accordingly.

Internal models can be controlled through either [[Feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] or [[feedback]] control. Feed-forward control computes its input into a system using only the current state and its model of the system.  It does not use feedback, so it cannot correct for errors in its control. In feedback control, some of the output of the system can be fed back into the system’s input, and the system is then able to make adjustments or compensate for errors from its desired output. Two primary types of internal models have been proposed:  forward models and inverse models. In simulations, models can be combined together to solve more complex movement tasks.

==Forward models==
[[Image:Basic Internal Model.png|thumb|725px|Figure 1. The desired position of the body is the reference input to the hypothetical controller, which generates the necessary motor command. This motor command is sent to the plant to move the body and an efference copy of the motor command is sent to a forward model. The output from the forward model (predicted body position) is compared with the output from the plant (body position). Noise from the system or the environment may cause differences between the actual and predicted body positions. The error (difference) between the actual and predicted positions can provide feedback to improve the movement for the next iteration of the internal model.]]

In their simplest form, forward models take the input of a motor command to the “plant” and output a predicted position of the body.

The motor command input to the forward model can be an efference copy, as seen in Figure 1. The output from that forward model, the predicted position of the body, is then compared with the actual position of the body. The actual and predicted position of the body may differ due to noise introduced into the system by either internal (e.g. body sensors are not perfect, sensory noise) or external (e.g. unpredictable forces from outside the body) sources. If the actual and predicted body positions differ, the difference can be fed back as an input into the entire system again so that an adjusted set of motor commands can be formed to create a more accurate movement.

==Inverse models==

[[Image:Inverse Model.png|thumb|700px|Figure 2. Inverse model of a reaching task. The arm’s desired trajectory, Xref(t), is input into the model, which generates the necessary motor commands, ũ(t), to control the arm.]]

Inverse models  use the desired and actual position of the body as inputs to estimate the necessary motor commands which would transform the current position into the desired one. For example, in an arm reaching task, the desired position (or a trajectory of consecutive positions) of the arm is input into the postulated inverse model, and the inverse model generates the motor commands needed to control the arm and bring it into this desired configuration (Figure 2). Inverse internal models are also in close connection with [[Motor coordination#Uncontrolled manifold hypothesis|the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM)]], see also [[Degrees of freedom problem#Uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis|here]].

==Combined forward and inverse models==

Theoretical work has shown that in models of motor control, when inverse models are used in combination with a forward model, the efference copy of the motor command output from the inverse model can be used as an input to a forward model for further predictions. For example, if, in addition to reaching with the arm, the hand must be controlled to grab an object, an efference copy of the arm motor command can be input into a forward model to estimate the arm's predicted trajectory. With this information, the controller can then generate the appropriate motor command telling the hand to grab the object. It has been proposed that if they exist, this combination of inverse and forward models would allow the CNS to take a desired action (reach with the arm), accurately control the reach and then accurately control the hand to grip an object.&lt;ref name="Kawato"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Kawato| first=M |year=1999 |title=Internal models for motor control and trajectory planning |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=9 |pages=718–727 | doi= 10.1016/S0959-4388(99)00028-8| pmid= 10607637| issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptive Control theory==

With the assumption that new models can be acquired and pre-existing models can be updated, the efference copy is important for the adaptive control of a movement task. Throughout the duration of a motor task, an efference copy is fed into a forward model known as a dynamics predictor whose output allows prediction of the motor output. When applying [[adaptive control|adaptive control theory]] techniques to motor control, efference copy is used in indirect control schemes as the input to the reference model.

==Scientists ==
A wide range of scientists contribute to progress on the internal model hypothesis. [[Michael I. Jordan]], [[Emmanuel Todorov]] and 
[[Daniel Mark Wolpert|Daniel Wolpert]] contributed significantly to the mathematical formalization. [[Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi]], [[Mitsuo Kawato]], [[Claude Ghez]],  [[Reza Shadmehr]], [[Randy Flanagan]] and [[Konrad Kording]] contributed with numerous behavioral experiments. The [[Neurocomputational speech processing#DIVA model|DIVA model]] of speech production developed by [[Frank H. Guenther]] and colleagues uses combined forward and inverse models to produce auditory trajectories with simulated speech articulators. Two interesting inverse internal models for the control of speech production&lt;ref&gt;Also with simulated speech articulators, such as biomechanical tongue models (BTM).&lt;/ref&gt; were developed by Iaroslav Blagouchine &amp; Eric Moreau.&lt;ref name="iaroslav_02"&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iaroslav_Blagouchine/publication/224080014_Control_of_a_Speech_Robot_via_an_Optimum_Neural-Network-Based_Internal_Model_With_Constraints Iaroslav Blagouchine and Eric Moreau. ''Control of a Speech Robot via an Optimum Neural-Network-Based Internal Model with Constraints.'' IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 142—159, February 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Both models combine the optimum principles and the [[Degrees of freedom problem#Equilibrium point hypothesis and threshold control|equilibrium-point hypothesis]] (motor commands λ are taken as coordinates of the internal space). The input motor command λ is found by minimizing the length of the path traveled in the internal space, either under the acoustical constraint (the first model), or under the both acoustical and mechanical constraints (the second model). The acoustical constraint is related to the quality of the produced speech (measured in terms of [[formants]]), while the mechanical one is related to the [[stiffness]] of the tongue's body. The first model, in which the stiffness remains uncontrolled, is in agreement with [[Degrees of freedom problem#Uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis|the standard UCM hypothesis]]. In contrast, the second optimum internal model, in which the stiffness is prescribed, displays the good variability of speech (at least, in the reasonable range of stiffness) and is in agreement with [[Motor coordination#Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis|the more recent versions of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM)]]. There is also a rich clinical literature on internal models including work from [[John Krakauer]]&lt;!-- no, NOT [[Jon Krakauer]] --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bLn4MUPq5U4J:www.columbiampl.org/pdf/Papers/Tseng07ErrorsCerebell.pdf+%22John+Krakauer,%22+%22internal+model%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiTHb8WkJbZVoI63GEsv9CyGUEbcwWZ1EVxwMFOtcsrMm5-GKaU_nvdT0Z3OMNuU94rJjE6MfxYqBxCgMa09wKFeewbKaQmhxJn_IL-oFih9zlZaCNJKtuQyYZQnOxa8w0vZ0Zi&amp;sig=AHIEtbSxSGDAskWo_Njt1nHs91MsHbqc4A "Sensory Prediction Errors Drive Cerebellum-Dependent Adaptation of Reaching"], Tseng, Diedrichsen, Krakauer, et al., ''Journal of Neurophysiology, 98:54-62, May 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pietro Mazzoni]], [[Maurice A.

{{Lead too short|date=May 2018}}

[[Gemstone]]s are referenced in multiple books of the [[Bible]], particularly in the [[Old Testament]] and in the [[Book of Revelation]]. We know something about their origins, but since the 4th Century AD there has been considerable confusion about precise identification of all the stones.

==Origins==
{{Primary sources|section|date=May 2018}}
{{Religious text primary|date=May 2018}}

The [[Hebrews]] obtained their gemstones from the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and [[Egypt]]. At the time of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]], [[Ancient Egypt]] was flooded with riches, and the [[Israelites]] on leaving the land possessed themselves of many gemstones, according to the commandment of [[God]] ([[Book of Exodus]], iii, 22; xii, 35-36). Later when they were settled in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] they could easily obtain stones from the merchant [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] travelling from [[Babylonia]] or [[Persia]] to Egypt and those from [[Saba]] and [[Raamah]] to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] ([[Book of Ezekiel]], xxvii, 22). [[KSolomon]] even equipped a fleet which returned from [[Ophir]] laden with gems ([[Books of Kings]], x, 11).

The gemstones of the [[Bible]] are mentioned in connection with the [[breastplate]] of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Book of Exodus]], xxviii, 17-20; xxxix, 10-13), the treasure of the [[King of Tyre]] ([[Book of Ezekiel]], xxviii, 13), and the foundations of the [[New Jerusalem]] ([[Book of Tobit]], xiii, 16-17, in the Greek text, and more fully, [[Book of Revelation]], xxi, 18-21). The twelve stones of the breastplate and the two stones of the shoulder-ornaments were considered by the Jews to be the most
precious. Both [[Book of Ezekiel]], xxviii, 13, and [[Book of Revelation]], xxi, 18-21, are patterned after the model of the rational{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} and further allude to the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]].

The stones' composition were the objects of a considerable amount of literature from the fourth century.{{Examples?}} That such a literature should have arisen is of itself convincing proof that the identification of the stones was no easy problem to solve. At the time of the [[Septuagint]] translation, the stones to which the Hebrew names apply could no longer be identified, and the translators rendered the same Hebrew name by different [[Greek language|Greek]] words. So also did [[Josephus]] who, however, claimed he had seen the actual stones. This, coupled with the fact that the late Biblical lists, although visibly depending on that of Exodus, exhibit here and there notable changes, makes the task of identifying the stones a difficult one.

The ancients did not classify their gemstones by analyzing their composition and crystalline forms: names were given in accordance with their colour, use, or their country of origin. Therefore, stones of the same or nearly the same colour, but of different composition or crystalline form, bear identical names.

Another problem is nomenclature; names having changed in the course of time: thus the ancient chrysolite is our [[topaz]], the [[sapphire]] is our lazuli, etc. However, we know most of the stones were precious in Egypt, [[Assyria]], and Babylonia. Owing to the neighbourhood and to the influence of these countries on [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], it is highly probable that the score of substances referred to in the Bible as "desirable stones" (Is., liv, 12) must be contained in the
fairly long list of the precious and ornamental stones of the Assyro-Babylonians and the Egyptians.

==Alphabetical list==
The list comprises comparative etymological origins and referential locations for each stone within the Bible. Where relevant, additional information concerning individual stones has also been included.

===Agate===
[[Agate]], Heb. ''shbw''; Sept. ''achates''; Vulg. ''achates'' (Ex., xxviii, 19; xxxix, 12, in Heb. and Vulg.; also Ezech., xxviii, 13, in Sept.). - This is the second stone of the third row of the rational, where it very probably represented the tribe of [[Asher]]. The etymological derivation of the Hebrew word is unclear, but the stone has generally been acknowledged to be the agate. The Hebraic derivation derives ''shbw'' from ''shbb'' "to flame"; it may also be related to Saba (''shba''), caravans having brought the stone to Palestine. The Greek and Latin names are taken from the river [[Achates]], the modern [[Dirillo]], in ''Sicily'', where this stone was first found ([[Theophrastus]], "''De lapid''.", 38; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], "Hist. nat.", XXXVII, liv).

The stone belongs to the [[silex]] family ([[chalcedony]] species) and is formed by deposits of
siliceous beds in hollows of rocks. This mode of formation results in the bands of various colours which it contains. Its conchoidal cleavage makes it susceptible to a highly polished state.

Various medicinal powers were attributed until far into the [[Middle Ages]]. Agate was supposed to void the toxicity of all poisons and counteract the infection of contagious diseases; if held in the hand or in the mouth it was believed to alleviate fever. Within mythology the [[eagle]] placed an agate in its nest to guard its young against the bite of venomous animals and the red agate was credited with the power of sharpening vision.

At present agate and [[onyx]] differ only in the manner in which the stone is cut; if it is  cut to show the layers of colour, it is called agate; if cut parallel to the lines, onyx. Formerly an agate that was banded with well-defined colours was the onyx. The banded agate is used for the manufacture of [[cameo (carving)|cameos]].

===Amethyst===
[[Amethyst]], Heb. ''ahlmh''; Sept. ''amethystos'', also Apoc., xxi, 20, where it is the twelfth and last stone of the foundation of the New Jerusalem. It is the third stone in the third row of the rational, representing the tribe of [[Issachar]] (Ex., xxviii, 19; xxxix, 12); the Septuagint enumerates it among the riches of the King of Tyre (Ezech., xxviii, 13). The Greek name alludes to the popular belief that amethyst prevented intoxication; hence drinking vessels were made of amethyst for festivities, and carousers wore amulets made of it to counteract the action of wine. Abenesra and [[Kimchi]] explain the Hebrew ''ahlmh'' in an analogous manner, deriving it from ''hlm'', to dream; ''hlm'' in its first meaning signifies "to be hard". A consensus exists regarding the accuracy of the translation among the various versions; Josephus (Ant. Jud., III, vii, 6) also has "amethyst"; the [[Targum of Onkelos]] and the Syriac Version have "calf's eye", indicating the colour.

The amethyst is a brilliant transparent stone of a purple colour and varying in shade from  violet purple to rose. There are two kinds of amethysts: the oriental amethyst, a species of sapphire which is very hard (cf. Heb.,''hlm''), and when colourless is almost indistinguishable from the [[diamond]]. The occidental amethyst is of the silex family and different in composition from the oriental stone. But the identity of names is accounted for by the identity of colour. The occidental amethyst is easily engraved and is found in a variety of sizes. Its shape is different from the round pebble to the [[hexagonal]], [[pyramid]]-capped [[crystal]].

===Beryl===
[[Beryl]], Heb. ''yhlm''; Sept. ''beryllos''; Vulg. ''beryllus'' occupied the third place of the second row and in the [[breastplate]] and was understood to represent [[Nephtali]] (Ex., xxviii, 19; xxxix, 13). According to the Septuagint it was the second of the fourth row, and third of the fourth according to the Vulgate. Ezech., xxviii, 13, mentions it in the third place and it is also cited in the Greek text of Tob., xiii, 17, but is missing in the Vulgate; Apoc., xxi, 20, gives it as the eighth stone of the foundation of the New Jerusalem.

The etymological debate indicates a difference of opinion regarding the exact Hebrew correlative of this word. The best supported is ''yhlm'', though ''shhm'' is also probable. ''shpht'' has also been suggested, but with little proof. Consequently, the Hebrew ''shpht'' must correspond to jasper, Gr. ''iaspis'' and Lat. ''jaspis''. This mistaken idea probably arose from the supposition that the translated words originally occupied the same position in the original. Comparative analysis of the Greek and Latin translations demonstrates this is not the case; in the Vulgate, jasper is in the same position as ''yshpht'', whereas the Greek ''beryllos'' does not correspond to the Latin ''beryllus''.

The same may have happened regarding the translation of the Hebrew into Greek, especially because the old manner of writing the two words ''yshlm'' and ''shlm'' might be easily confused. Josephus is not reliable in this instance as he most likely quoted from memory; the position of the words being at variance in his two lists (Bell. Jud., V, v, 7; Ant. Jud., III, vii).

Therefore, the ultimate analysis is limited to the two words ''yshlm'' and ''shlm''. By comparing various texts of the Vulgate - the Greek is very inconsistent - we find that ''shlm''
always translated to onyx. This alone seems sufficient to support the opinion that beryl corresponds to the Heb. ''yhlm''. That beryl was among the stones of the rational appears beyond doubt because all translations mention it and with the etymology giving us no special help, by elimination; we come to the generally accepted conclusion that beryl and ''yhlm'' stand for each other.

Beryl is a stone composed of [[silica]], [[alumina]], and [[glucina]] with beryl and [[emerald]] being of the same species. The difference between beryl, [[Beryl|aquamarine]], and  emerald is determined by the colouring and the peculiar shade of each. Beryl, though sometimes white, is usually of a light blue bordering on a yellowish green; emerald is more transparent and of a finer hue than beryl. As a gem, it is considered more beautiful, and therefore more expensive - aqua marine is a beautiful sea-green variety.

Emerald derives its colour from a small quantity of [[Chromium(III) oxide|chromium oxide]]; beryl and aqua marine from a small quantity of [[iron oxide]]. Beryl occurs in the shape of either a pebble or of an hexagonal [[prism (geometry)|prism]]. It is found in metamorphic [[limestone]], [[slate]], mica schist, [[gneiss]] and [[granite]]. In ancient times it was mined in Upper Egypt and is still found in the mica slate of Mt. Zaborah. The largest beryls known have been found in [[Acworth, New Hampshire|Acworth]] and [[Grafton, New Hampshire|Grafton]], [[New Hampshire]], and in [[Royalston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States of America]]; one weighs 2900&amp;nbsp;lb. and measures 51&amp;nbsp;inches in length by 32&amp;nbsp;inches by 22.

According to [[John Aubrey]] in "Miscellanies" beryl has also been employed for mystical and [[Kaballah|cabalistic]] practices.

===Carbuncle===
[[Carbuncle (gemstone)|Carbuncle]], Heb., ''gphr''; Sept. ''anthrax'' (Ex., xxviii, 18;
xxxix, 11; Ezech., xxviii, 13; omitted in Ezech., xxvii, 16); Vulg., ''carbunculus'' (Ex., xxviii, 18; xxxix, 11; Ezech., xxviii, 13), ''gemma'' (Ezech., xxvii, 16). The carbuncle was the first stone of the second row of the rational and it represented [[Judah (Bible)|Juda]], and is also the eighth stone mentioned of the riches of the King of Tyre (Ezech., xxviii, 13). An imported object, not a native product, (Ezech., xxvii, 16); it is perhaps the third stone of the foundation of the celestial city (Apoc., xxi, 19).

The ancient authors are not in accordance on the precise nature of the carbuncle stone. It  probably corresponded to the ''anthrax'' of Theophrastus (De lap., 18), the ''carbunculus'' of Pliny (Hist. nat., XXXVII, xxv), the ''charchedonius'' of Petronius, and the ''ardjouani'' of the Arabs. If so, it is a red glittering stone, probably the Oriental [[ruby]], though the appellation may have been applied to a variety of other red gems. Theophrastus describes it as: "Its colour is red and of such a kind that when it is held against the sun it resembles a burning coal." This description fits well with the Oriental ruby. He also relates that the most perfect carbuncles were brought from [[Carthage]], [[Marseilles]], [[Egypt]], and the neighbourhood of [[Siena]].

Carbuncles were named differently according to their places of origin. Pliny (Hist. nat., XXXVII, xxv) cites the lithizontes, or Indian carbuncles, the amethystizontes, the colour of which resembled amethyst, and sitites. Carbuncle was therefore most probably a generic name which applied to several stones.

===Carnelian===
[[Carnelian]], Heb. ''arm'', to be red, especially "red blooded"; Sept. and Apoc. ''sardion''; Vulg. ''sardius''; the first stone of the breastplate (Ex., xxviii, 17; xxxix, 10) representing [[Reuben (Bible)|Ruben]]; also the first among the stones of the King of Tyre (Ezech., xxviii, 13); the sixth foundation stone of the celestial city (Apoc., xxi, 19). Also found in Noahs story is the unproven that the dove Noah sent down to the ground was actually a garnet used to light the ground.

The word ''sardion'' has sometimes been called ''sardonyx''. This is a mistake, for the same word is equivalent to carnelian in Theophrastus (De lap., 55) and Pliny (Hist. nat., XXXVII, xxxi), who derive the name from that of the city of [[Sardes]] where, they claim, it was first found. The carnelian is a siliceous stone and a species of chalcedony. Its colour is a flesh-hued red, varying from the palest flesh-colour to a deep blood-red. It is of a [[conchoidal]] structure. Normally its colour is without clouds or veins; but sometimes delicate veins of extremely light red or white are found arranged much like the rings of an agate. Carnelian is used for rings and seals. The finest carnelians are found in the [[East Indies]].

===Chalcedony===
[[Chalcedony]], Apoc., xxi, 19, ''chalkedon''; Vulg. ''chalcedonius'', the third foundation stone of the celestial Jerusalem. The view that the writing ''chalkedon'' is an error and that it should be ''charkedon'' (the carbuncle) is not without some reason. However, the other eleven stones correspond to a stone in the rational and this is the only exception. The ancients very often confounded the names of these two stones. Chalcedony is a siliceous stone. Its name is supposed to derive from [[Chalcedon]], in [[Bithynia]], where the ancients obtained the stone from. It is a species of agate and bears various names according to its colour. Chalcedony is usually made up of concentric circles of various colours and the most valuable of these stones are found in the East Indies. The gem is used for rings, seals and, in the East; drinking vessels.

===Chodchod===
[[Chodchod]], ''kdkd'' (Is., liv, 12; Ezech., xxvii, 16); Sept.''iaspis'' (Is., liv, 12), ''chorchor'' (Ezech., xxvii, 16); Vulg.''jaspis'' (Is., liv, 12), ''chodchod'' (Ezech., xvii, 16). This word is used only twice in the Bible. Chodchod is generally identified with the
Oriental ruby. The translation of the word in Is. both by the Septuagint and the Vulgate is ''jasper''; in Ezech. the word is merely transliterated; the Greek ''chorchor'' is explained by considering how easy it is to mistake a [[resh]] for a [[daleth]].

"What chodchod signifies", says St. Jerome, "I have until now not been able to find" (Comment. in Ezech., xxvii, 16, in P. L., XXV, 255). In Is. he follows the Septuagint and translates chodchod by ''jaspis''. The word is probably derived from ''phyr'', "to throw fire"; the stone was therefore brilliant and very likely red. This supposition is strengthened by the fact that the Arabic word ''kadzkadzat'', evidently derived from the same stem as chodchod, designates a bright red. It was therefore a kind of ruby, likely the Oriental ruby, perhaps also the carbuncle (see above).

===Chrysolite===
[[Peridot|Chrysolite]], Heb. ''trshysh'' (Ex., xxviii, 20; xxxix, 13; Ezech., i, 16; x, 9; xxviii, 13; Cant., v, 14; Dan., x, 6); Sept., ''chrysolithos'' (Ex., xxviii, 20; xxxix, 13; Ezech., xxviii, 13); ''tharsis'' (Cant., v, 14; Dan., x, 6); ''tharseis'' (Ezech., 1, 16; x, 9); Vulg. ''chrysolithus'' (Ex., xxviii, 20; xxxix, 13; Ezech., x, 9; xxviii, 13; Dan., x, 6),
''hyacinthus'' (Cant., v, 14); ''quasi visio maris'' (Ezech., i, 16); Apoc., xxi, 20, ''chrysolithos''; Vulg. ''chrysolithus''. This is the tenth stone of the rational, representing the tribe of [[Zebulun]]; it stands fourth in the enumeration of Ezech., xxviii, 13, and is given as the seventh foundation stone of the celestial city in Apoc., xxi, 20.

None of the Hebrew texts give any hint as to the nature of this stone. However, since the Septuagint repeatedly translates the Hebrew word by ''chrysolithos'', except where it merely transliterates it, and in Ezech., x, 9, since, moreover, the Vulgate follows this translation with very few exceptions, and [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], [[Josephus]], and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]] agree in their rendering, it can be assumed that the ''chrysolite'' of the ancients equates to our [[topaz]].

The word ''tharsis'' very likely points to the origin of the gem ([[Tarshish]]). The modern chrysolite is a green oblong hexagonal prism of unequal sides terminated by two triangular pyramids. Topaz, or ancient chrysolite, is an octangular prism of an orange-yellow colour; it is composed of alumina, silica, [[hydrofluoric acid]], and [[iron]]. it is found in [[Ceylon]], Arabia, and [[Egypt]]. Several species were reported to exist (Pliny, "Hist. nat.", XXXVII, xlv) and during the [[Middle Ages]] it was believed to possess the power of relieving anxiety at night, driving away devils and to be an excellent cure for eye diseases.

===Chrysophrasus===
[[Chrysophrasus]], Greek ''chrysoprasos'', the tenth foundation stone of the celestial Jerusalem (Apoc., xxi, 20). This is perhaps the agate of Ex., xxviii, 20, and xxxix, 13, since the chrysoprasus was not very well known among the ancients. It is a type of green agate, composed mostly of silica and a small percentage of [[nickel]].

===Coral===
[[Coral]], Heb. ''ramwt'' (Job, xxviii, 18; Prov., xxiv, 7; Ezech., xxvii, 16); Sept. ''meteora'', ''ramoth''; Vulg. ''excelsa'', ''sericum''. The Hebrew word seems to derive  from ''tas'', "to be high", probably pertaining to a tree. Another possibility is that the name originates from a strange country, as did the coral itself. It is apparent that the ancient
versions have been prone to mis-interpretation. In one instance they even went so far as to
simply transliterate the Hebrew word.

In Ezech., xxvii, 16, coral is mentioned as one of the articles brought by the Syrians to Tyre. The [[Phoenicians]] mounted beads of coral on collars and garments. These corals were obtained by Babylonian pearl-flshers in the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The Hebrews apparently made very little use of this substance, and it is seldom mentioned in their writings. This also explains the difficulty experienced in scriptural translation.

[[Gesenius]] (Thesaurus, p.&amp;nbsp;1113) translates ''phnynys'' (Job, xxviii, 18; Prov., iii, 15; viii, 11; xx, 15; xxxi, 10; Lam., iv, 7) as "red coral". However, pearl has also been interpreted to be the meaning in these passages. The coral referred to in the Bible is the precious coral (''corallum rubrum''), the formation of which is well known. It is a calcareous secretion of certain polyps resulting in a tree-like formation. Presently coral is found in the [[Mediterranean]], the northern coast of [[Africa]] furnishing the dark red, [[Sardinia]] the yellow or salmon-coloured, and the coast of [[Italy]] the rose-pink coral. One of the greatest coral-fisheries of the present day is [[Torre del Greco]], near [[Naples]].

===Crystal===
[[Crystal]], Heb. ''ghbsh'' (Job, xxviii, 18), ''qrh'' (Ezech, i, 22): both words signify a glassy substance; Sept. ''gabis''; Vulg. ''eminentia'' (Job, xxviii, 18); ''krystallos'', ''crystallus'' (Ezech., i, 22). Crystal is a transparent mineral resembling glass, most probably a variety of quartz. Job places it in the same category with [[gold]], onyx, sapphire, glass, coral, topaz, etc. The Targum renders the ''qrt'' of
Ezech. as "ice"; the other versions translate it as "crystal". Crystal is again mentioned in Apoc., iv, 6; xxi, 11; xxii, 1. In Ps. cxlvii, 17, and Ecclus., xliii, 22, there can be no question that ice is indicated. The word ''zkwkyh'', Job, xxviii, 17, which can be translated as crystal, means glass.

===Diamond===
[[Diamond]], Heb. ''shmyr''; Sept. ''adamantinos''; Vulg. ''adamas'', ''adamantinus'' (Ezech., iii, 9; Zach., vii, 12; Jer, xvii 1). Whether or not this stone is really diamond cannot be established. Many passages in Holy Scriptures point to the qualities of diamond, in particular its hardness (Ezech., iii, 9; Zach., vii, 12; Jer., xvii, 1). In the last citation
[[Jeremiah]] informs us of a diamond usage which is much the same as its usage today: "The sin of Juda is written with a pen of iron, with the point of a diamond". However, although diamond is used to [[engraving|engrave]] hard substances, other stones can serve the same purpose.

The Septuagint omits the passages of Ezech. and Zach., while the first five verses of Jer., xvii, are missing in the Cod. Vaticanus and Alexandrinus, but are found in the Complutensian edition and in the Syriac and Arabic Versions. Despite the qualities mentioned in the Bible, the stone referred to may be the limpid [[Corundum|corindon]]; which exhibits the same qualities, and is used in India for the same purposes as the diamond.

Diamond was not very well known among the ancients; and if we add to this the etymological similarity between the words ''smiris'', the Egyptian ''asmir'', "emery", a species of [[Corundum|corindon]] used to polish gemstones, and ''shmyr'', the Hebrew word supposed to mean diamond; the conclusion to be drawn is that limpid corindon was intended.

Aben-Esra and [[Abarbanel]] translate ''yhlm'' as "diamond"; but ''yhlm'' was demonstrated above to be beryl. Diamond is made up of pure carbon, mostly of a white transparent colour, but sometimes tinted. White diamond is often regarded as the most precious because of its beauty and rarity.

===Emerald===
[[Emerald]], Heb. ''brqm''; Sept. ''smaragdos''; Vulg. ''smaragdus''; the third stone of the rational (Ex., xxviii, 17; xxxix, 10), representing the tribe of [[Levi]]; it is the ninth stone in Ezech., xxviii,13, and the fourth foundation stone of the celestial Jerusalem (Apoc., xxi, 19). The same stone is also mentioned in Tob., xiii, 16 (Vulg. 21); Jud., x, 21 (Vulg. 19); and in the Greek text of Ecclus., xxxii, 8, but there is no indication of it in the Manuscript B. of the Hebrew text, found in the [[Genizah]] of Cairo in 1896.

Practically all versions, including Josephus (Ant. Jud., III, vii, 5; Bell. Jud., V, v, 7) translate ''brhm'' as "emerald". The Hebrew root ''brq'' (to glitter"), from which it is probably derived, is agreed on by scholastic consensus. The word may also derive from the Sanskrit ''marakata'' which is certainly emerald nor is the Greek form ''smaragdos'' that different either. In Job, xiii, 21; Jud., x, 19; Ecclus., xxxii, 8; and Apoc., xxi, 19, the emerald is certainly the stone referred to. The word ''bphr'' also has sometimes been translated by ''smaragdus'' but this is a mistake as ''bphr'' signifies carbuncle.

Emerald is a green variety of beryl and is composed of silicate of alumina and glucina. Structurally, it is a hexagonal crystal with a brilliant reflecting green colour. The emerald is highly polished and is found in [[metamorphic rock]]s, [[granites]], and [[mica]] schist. Many of the finest specimens have been found in [[Muzo]], [[Bogota]], [[South America]] but the ancients obtained the stone from Egypt and India.

Although claims have been made that the ancients knew nothing of the emerald - Pliny, Theophrastus and others clearly refute this even though the name may have been used possibly for other stones. In the Middle Ages miraculous healing powers were attributed to the emerald, among them; the power to preserve or heal visual problems.

===Jacinth===
[[Zircon|Hyacinth]], Greek ''hyakinthos''; Vulg. ''hyacinthus'' (Apoc., xxi, 20); the eleventh stone of the foundation of the heavenly city. It very probably equates with Heb., the ''ligurius'' of Ex., xxviii, 19; xxxix, 12 (St. Epiphan., "''De duodecim gemmis''" in P. G., XLIII, 300). The stone referred to in Cant., v, 14, and called ''hyacinthus'' in the Vulgate is the Hebrew ''shoham'', which has been shown above to be chrysolite. The exact nature of hyacinth cannot be determined as the name was applied to several stones of similar colours and most probably designated stones reminiscent of the hyacinth flower.
&lt;ref&gt;Exodus xxviii:19, xxxix:12&lt;/ref&gt;
Hyacinth is a [[zircon]] of a crimson, red, or orange colour. It is harder than quartz and its cleavage is undulating and sometimes lamellated. Its form is that of an oblong quadrangular prism terminated on both ends by a quadrangular pyramid. It was allegedly used as a [[Amulet|talisman]] against [[tempests]].

===Jasper===
[[Jasper]] Heb.  יָשְׁפֵ֑ה ''yashpeh''; Sept. ''iaspis''; Vulg. ''jaspis''; the twelfth stone of the breastplate (Ex., xxviii, 18; xxxix, 11), representing [[Benjamin]]. In the Greek and Latin texts it comes sixth, and so also in Ezech., xxviii, 13; in the Apocalypse it is the first (xxi, 19). Despite this difference of position ''jaspis'' is undoubtedly the ''yshphh'' of the Hebrew text. The gem is an [[anhydrate]] quartz composed of silica, alumina, and iron and there are jaspers of nearly every colour. It is a completely opaque stone of a conchoidal cleavage. It seems to have been obtained by the Jews from India and Egypt.

===Ligurus===
[[Ligurus]], Heb. ''lshs''; Sept. ''ligyrion''; Vulg. ''ligurius''; the first stone of the third row of the rational (Ex., xxviii, 19; xxxix, 12), representing [[Gad (Bible prophet)|Gad]]. It is missing in the Hebrew of Ezech., xxviii, 13, but present in the Greek. This stone is probably the same as hyacinth (St. Epiphan., loc. cit.). This traditional identification, is based upon
the remark that the twelve foundation stones of the celestial city in Apoc., xxi, 19-20, correspond to the twelve stones of the rational. This alone is enough to equate ligurus with hyacinth although it has been identified with turmaline; though the latter view is rejected by most scholars.

===Onyx===
[[Onyx]], Lat; Sept. ''onychion''; Vulg. ''lapis onychinus''; the eleventh stone of the breastplate in the Hebrew and the Vulgate (Ex., xxviii, 20; xxxix, 13), representing the tribe of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. In the Sept. it is the twelfth stone and the fifth in Ezech., xxviii, 13, in the Heb., but the twelfth in the Greek; it is called ''sardonyx'' and comes in the fifth place in Apoc., xxi, 20.

The exact nature of this stone is disputed because the Greek word ''beryllos'' occurs instead of the Hebrew ''???'' thereby indicating beryl. However, this is not so (see Beryl above).
The Vulgate equates onyx with the Hebrew ''??? '' and although this alone would be a very weak argument; there are other, stronger testimonies to the fact that the Hebrew word occurs frequently in Holy Scripture: (Gen., ii, 12; Ex., xxv, 7; xxv, 9, 27; I Par., xxxix, 2; etc.) and on each occasion, except Job, xxviii, 16, the gem is translated in the Vulgate by ''lapis onychinus'' (''lapis sardonychus'' in Job, xxviii, 16).

The Greek is very inconsistent in its translation, rendering ''shhs'' differently in various texts; therefore in Gen., ii, 12, it is ''lithos prasinos'', ''sardios'' in Ex. xxv, 7; xxxv, 9;
''smaragdos'' in Ex., xxviii, 9; xxxv, 27; xxxix, 6; ''soam'', a mere transcription of the Hebrew word in I Par., xxix, 2; and onyx in Job, xxviii, 16.

Other Greek translators are more consistent: [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]] has ''sardonyx'' and [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]] and [[Theodotion]] have onyx. The paraphrase of [[Onkelos]] had ''burla'', the Syriac ''berula'', both of which evidently are the Greek ''beryllos''; "beryl". Since the translations do not observe the same order as the Hebrew in enumerating the stones of the rational (see Beryl above), it is not mandatory to accept the Greek ''beryllos'' as the translation of ''shhm''. Therefore, relying on the testimony of the various versions it can safely be assumed that onyx is the stone signified by ''shhm''.

Onyx is a variety of quartz analogous to agate and other crypto-crystalline species. It is composed of different layers of variously coloured carnelian much like banded agate in structure, but the layers are in even or parallel planes. This makes it well adapted for the cutting of cameos and was much used by the ancients for that purpose. The colours of the best are perfectly well defined, and are either white and black, or white, brown, and
black. Some of the best specimens have been brought from India.

===Sardonyx===
[[Sardonyx]] has a structure similar to onyx, but is composed usually of alternate layers of white chalcedony and carnelian, although carnelian may be associated with layers of white, brown, and black chalcedony. The ancients obtained onyx from Arabia, Egypt, and India.

===Pearl===
[[Pearl]]. Although not a gemstone in the strictest sense we can apply the word "stone" in a broader context similar to that of coral. It is comparatively certain that pearl (Greek
''margarite'', Vulg. ''margarita'') was known among the Jews, at least after the time of Solomon, as it was among the Phoenicians. The exact etymology is uncertain but the following have been suggested: ''ghbysh'', which signified "crystal" (see above); ''phnynym'', which Gesenius renders by "red coral"; ''dr'', Esth., i, 6, which is translated in the Vulg. by ''lapis parius'', "[[marble]]"; the Arabic ''dar'' also signifies "pearl", and therefore Furst also renders the Hebrew word.

In the New Testament we find pearl mentioned in Matt., xiii, 45, 46; I Tim., ii, 9; etc. Pearl is a concretion consisting chiefly of lime carbonate found in several [[bivalve]] [[molluscs]], but especially in ''avicula margaritifera''. Generally, it has a whitish blue hue, sometimes showing a tinge of pink; but there are also yellow pearls. This gem was considered the most precious of all among the ancients, and was obtained from the Red Sea,
the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf.

===Ruby===
[[Ruby]]. This stone may have been either the carbuncle or the chodchod (see above). There is, however, a choice between the oriental ruby and the spinel ruby; but the words may have been used indiscriminately for both. The former is extremely hard, almost as hard as the diamond, and is obtained from Ceylon, India, and China. It is considered one of the most precious gems.

===Sapphire===
[[Sapphire]], Heb. ''mghry'' Septuag. ''sappheiron''; Vulg. ''sapphirus''. Sapphire was the fifth stone of the rational (Ex., xxviii, 19; xxxix, 13), and represented the tribe of [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]]. It is the seventh stone in Ezech., xxviii, 14 (in the Hebrew text, for it occurs fifth in the Greek text); it is also the second foundation stone of the celestial Jerusalem (Apoc., xxi, 19).

The genuine sapphire is a beautiful blue hyaline corindon and is composed of nearly pure alumina, its colour resulting from the presence of [[iron oxide]]. The ancients also referred to [[lapis-lazuli]] as sapphire, which is likewise a blue stone, often speckled with shining
[[pyrites]] giving it the appearance of being sprinkled with gold dust. It is composed of silica, alumina, and [[alkali]] and is an opaque substance easily engraved. Debate still continues as to which stone is precisely referred to in the Bible. Both may be meant, but lapis-lazuli seems more probable as its qualities are better suited for the purposes of engraving (Lam., iv, 7; Ex., xxviii, 17; xxxix, 13). Sapphire was obtained from India.

===Sardonyx===
[[Sardonyx]]; SARD. These two words are often confused by interpreters. Sard is carnelian, while sardonyx is a species of onyx.

===Topaz===
[[Topaz]], Heb. ''ghtrh''; Sept. ''topazion''; Vulg. ''topazius'', the second stone of the rational (Ex., xxviii, 17; xxxix, 19), representing [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]]; also the second stone in Ezech., xxviii, 13; the ninth foundation stone of the celestial Jerusalem (Apoc., xxi, 20) and also mentioned in Job, xxviii, 19.

This topaz is generally believed to have been chrysolite rather than the more generally known topaz. Oriental topaz is composed of nearly pure alumina, silica, and [[fluoric acid]]; its shape is an [[orthorhombic]] prism with a cleavage transverse to its long axis. It is extremely hard and has a double [[refraction]]. When rubbed or heated it becomes highly [[electric]].

It varies in colour according to the country of origin. [[Australia]]n topaz is green or yellow; the [[Tasmania]]n clear, bright, and transparent; the [[Saxon]] pale violet; the [[Bohemia]]n sea-green and the [[Brazil]]ian red, varying from a pale red to a deep carmine. The ancients very probably obtained it from the East.

40 of the 118 [[chemical elements]] have names associated with, or specifically named for, places around the world or among astronomical objects.  32 of these have names tied to the Earth and the other 8 have names connected to bodies in the [[Solar System]].  The first tables below list the terrestrial locations (excluding the entire Earth itself, taken as a whole) and the last table lists astronomical objects which the chemical elements are named after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/periodic/hist_names.htm Page of Kevin A.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; - The element mercury was named directly for the deity, with only indirect naming connection to the planet (see [[Mercury (element)#Etymology|etymology of mercury]]).
[[File:Chemical Element Place Names World &amp; Solar System Map.png|900px|40 elements have names connected to places, with 31 found around the world (not counting the planet as a whole), and 9 among bodies in the [[Solar System]].  Countries with elements named for them are colored in, as with US states having this honor.  Other locations are indicated with lines if smaller, or are enclosed if larger.  Inset at the bottom is a diagram of outer space.  The Sun, Moon and half of the planets along with two asteroids and Pluto are the 9 with connections to element names.  The other half of the planets (Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) do not have any connection.  The connection to Mercury is an indirect one.  The connection with beryllium to India is likewise indirect.  (Inset graphic is adapted from the [[Pioneer plaque]].)]]&lt;br&gt;

[[File:LabMachines.jpg|thumb|250px|Clinical laboratory in a Hospital setting showing several [[automated analyser]]s.]]

A '''medical laboratory''' or '''clinical laboratory''' is a [[laboratory]] where [[clinical pathology]] tests are carried out on clinical specimens to obtain information about the [[health]] of a [[patient]] to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Best jobs for the 21st century |last= Farr |first= J. Michael |authorlink= |author2=Laurence Shatkin |year=2004 |publisher= JIST Works|location= |isbn= 1-56370-961-9 |page= 460|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xBRWAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical Medical laboratories are an example of [[applied science]], as opposed to [[research laboratory|research laboratories]] that focus on [[basic science]], such as found in some [[academia|academic]] institutions. 

Medical laboratories vary in size and complexity and so offer a variety of testing services.  More comprehensive services can be found in acute-care hospitals and medical centers, where 70% of clinical decisions are based on laboratory testing.&lt;ref&gt;https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/01/30/hospital-labs-behind-the-scenes&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors offices and clinics, as well as skilled nursing and long-term care facilities, may have laboratories that provide more basic testing services. Commercial medical laboratories operate as independent businesses and provide testing that is otherwise not provided in other settings due to low test volume or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascls.org/what-is-a-medical-laboratory-science-professional|title=What is a Medical Laboratory Science Professional?|website=www.ascls.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments== &lt;!--[[Laboratory medicine]] redirects here--&gt;
In hospitals and other patient-care settings, laboratory medicine is provided by the Department of Pathology, and generally divided into two sections, each of which will be subdivided into multiple specialty areas. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.malse.org/labdepts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;The two sections are:
*[[Anatomic pathology]]: areas included here are [[histopathology]], [[cytopathology]], and [[electron microscopy]].
* [[Clinical pathology]], which typically includes the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/vth/diagnostic-and-support/clinical-pathology/Pages/default.aspx|title=What is Clinical Pathology?|website=csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Medical microbiology|Clinical Microbiology]]: This encompasses several different sciences, including [[bacteriology]], [[virology]], [[parasitology]], [[immunology]], and [[mycology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://jcm.asm.org/content/49/9_Supplement/S25|title=The Role of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory in the Diagnosis of Selected Infectious Processes|first=Ellen Jo|last=Baron|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology|volume=49|issue=9 Supplement|pages=S25–S25|via=jcm.asm.org|doi=10.1128/JCM.00842-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Clinical chemistry|Clinical Chemistry]]: This area typically includes automated analysis of blood specimens, including tests related to [[enzymology]], [[toxicology]] and [[endocrinology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=clinical+chemistry+tests|title=Clinical Chemistry Tests - MeSH - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Hematology]]: This area includes automated and manual analysis of blood cells. It also often includes [[coagulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medicine.yale.edu/labmed/sections/hematology/|title=Hematology &gt; Laboratory Medicine - Yale School of Medicine|website=medicine.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Immunohaematology|Blood Bank]] involves the testing of blood specimens in order to provide blood transfusion and related services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/immunohaematology|title=ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Molecular diagnostics]] DNA testing may be done here, along with a subspecialty known as [[cytogenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737159.1.1.1|title=Molecular diagnostics: a powerful new component of the healthcare value chain|first=George|last=Poste|date=1 May 2001|publisher=|journal=Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1586/14737159.1.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Reproductive biology]] testing is available in some laboratories, including [[Semen analysis]], [[Sperm bank]] and [[assisted reproductive technology]].

Layouts of clinical laboratories in health institutions vary greatly from one facility to another. For instance, some health facilities have a single laboratory for the microbiology section, while others have a separate lab for each specialty area.
[[File:LabEquipment.jpg|thumb|230px|Laboratory equipment for [[hematology]] (black analyser) and [[urinalysis]] (left of the open [[centrifuge]]).]]

The following is an example of a typical breakdown of the responsibilities of each area:
*[[Microbiology]] includes culturing of clinical specimens, including [[feces]], [[urine]], [[blood]], [[sputum]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and [[synovial fluid]], as well as possible infected tissue. The work here is mainly concerned with [[culture (microbiology)|cultures]], to look for suspected pathogens which, if found, are further identified based on biochemical tests. Also, sensitivity testing is carried out to determine whether the pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine. Results are reported with the identified organism(s) and the type and amount of drug(s) that should be prescribed for the patient.
*[[Parasitology]] is where specimens are examined for [[parasites]].  For example, fecal samples may be examined for evidence of intestinal parasites such as tapeworms or hookworms. 
*[[Virology]] is concerned with identification of viruses in specimens such as [[blood]], [[urine]], and [[cerebrospinal fluid]].
*[[Hematology]] analyzes whole blood specimens to perform [[full blood count]]s, and includes the examination of [[Blood film]]s.  Other specialized tests include cell counts on various bodily fluids.
*[[Coagulation]] testing determines various blood clotting times, coagulation factors, and platelet function.
*[[Clinical biochemistry|Clinical Biochemistry]] commonly performs dozens of different tests on [[Blood serum|serum]] or plasma. These tests, mostly automated, includes quantitative testing for a wide array of substances, such as [[lipid]]s, [[blood sugar]], [[enzyme]]s, and [[hormone]]s.
*[[Toxicology]] is mainly focused on testing for pharmaceutical and recreational drugs. [[Urine]] and [[blood]] samples are the common specimens.
*[[Immunology]]/[[Serology]] uses the process of antigen-antibody interaction as a diagnostic tool. Compatibility of transplanted organs may also be determined with these methods.
*[[Immunohaematology]], or [[Blood bank]] determines [[blood groups]], and performs compatibility testing on donor blood and recipients. It also prepares blood components, derivatives, and products for transfusion. This area determines a patient's blood type and Rh status, checks for antibodies to common antigens found on red blood cells, and cross matches units that are negative for the antigen.
*[[Urinalysis]] tests urine for many analytes, including microscopically. If more precise quantification of urine chemicals is required, the specimen is processed in the [[clinical biochemistry]] lab. 
*[[Histopathology]] processes solid tissue removed from the body ([[biopsies]]) for evaluation at the microscopic level.
*[[Cytopathology]] examines smears of cells from all over the body (such as from the [[cervix]]) for evidence of inflammation, cancer, and other conditions.
*[[Molecular diagnostics]] includes specialized tests involving [[DNA]] analysis.
*[[Cytogenetics]] involves using blood and other cells to produce a DNA [[karyotype]]. This can be helpful in cases of prenatal diagnosis (e.g. [[Down's syndrome]]) as well as in some cancers which can be identified by the presence of abnormal [[chromosome]]s.
*[[Surgical pathology]] examines organs, limbs, tumors, fetuses, and other tissues biopsied in surgery such as breast mastectomies.

==Medical laboratory staff==
[[File:Hospital Laboratory.JPG|thumb|230px|Clinical laboratory in a Hospital setting with two technologists shown.]]
The staff of clinical laboratories may include:
* [[Pathologist]]
* [[Clinical chemistry|Clinical Biochemist]]
* [[Pathologists' assistant|Pathologists' Assistant]] (PA)
* [[Biomedical Scientist]] (BMS) in the UK, [[Medical laboratory scientist|Medical Laboratory Scientist]] (MT, MLS or CLS) in the US or [[Medical laboratory scientist|Medical Laboratory Technologist]] in Canada
* Medical Laboratory Technician (MLT in US)
* [[Medical Laboratory Assistant]] (MLA)
* [[Phlebotomist]] (PBT)
* [[Histotechnologist/Histology Technician]]

==Labour shortages==
In the United States, there is a documented shortage of working laboratory professionals.  For example, in 2016 vacancy rates for Medical Laboratory Scientists ranged from 5% to 9% for various departments.  The decline is primarily due to retirements, and at-capacity educational programs that cannot expand and limits the number of new graduates.  Professional organizations and some state educational systems are responding by developing ways to promote the lab professions in an effort to combat this shortage.  The National Center For Workforce Analysis has estimated that by 2025, there will be a 24% increase in demand for lab professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://labtestsonline.org/articles/medical-laboratory-professionals|title=Medical Laboratory Professionals: Who's Who in the Lab - Lab Tests Online|website=labtestsonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laboratory-manager.advanceweb.com/laboratory-personnel-shortages/|title=Laboratory Personnel Shortages - Laboratory Manager|website=laboratory-manager.advanceweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of laboratory==
{{UK-centric|date=May 2016}}
In most developed countries, there are two main types of lab processing the majority of medical specimens. '''Hospital laboratories''' are attached to a [[hospital]], and perform tests on their patients. '''Private''' (or '''community''') '''laboratories''' receive samples from [[general practitioner]]s, insurance companies, [[Contract research organization|clinical research sites]] and other health clinics for analysis. For extremely specialised tests, samples may go to a research laboratory.  Some tests involve specimens sent between different labs for uncommon tests. For example, in some cases it may be more cost effective if a particular laboratory specializes in a less common tests, receiving specimens (and payment) from other labs, while sending other specimens to other labs for those tests they do not perform.

In many countries there are specialized types of Medical Laboratories according to the types of investigations carried out. Organisations that provide blood products for transfusion to hospitals, such as The Red Cross, will provide access to their reference laboratory for their customers. Some laboratories specialize in Molecular diagnostic and cytogenetic testing, in order to provide information regarding diagnosis and treatment of genetic or cancer-related disorders.

==Specimen processing and work flow==

In a hospital setting, sample processing will usually start with a set of samples arriving with a test request, either on a form or electronically via the laboratory information system ([[Laboratory Information System|LIS]]). Inpatient specimens will already be labeled with patient and testing information provided by the LIS.  Entry of test requests onto the LIS system involves typing (or scanning where barcodes are used) in the laboratory number, and entering the patient identification, as well as any tests requested. This allows laboratory analyzers, computers and staff to recognize what tests are pending, and also gives a location (such as a hospital department, doctor or other customer) for results reporting.

Once the specimens are assigned a laboratory number by the LIS, a sticker is typically printed that can be placed on the tubes or specimen containers.  This label has a barcode that can be scanned by automated analyzers and test requests uploaded to the analyzer from the LIS.  

Specimens are prepared for analysis in various ways. For example, chemistry samples are usually centrifuged and the serum or plasma is separated and tested. If the specimen needs to go on more than one analyzer, it can be divided into separate tubes.

Many specimens end up in one or more sophisticated [[automated analyser]]s, that process a fraction of the sample to return one or more test results. Some laboratories use robotic sample handlers ([[Laboratory automation]]) to optimize the workflow and reduce the risk of contamination from sample handling by the staff.

The work flow in a hospital laboratory is usually heaviest from 2:00 am to 10:00 am.  Nurses and doctors generally have their patients tested at least once a day with common tests such as complete blood counts and chemistry profiles.  These orders are typically drawn during a morning run by [[phlebotomist]]s for results to be available in the patient's charts for the attending physicians to consult during their morning rounds.  Another busy time for the lab is after 3:00 pm when private practice physician offices are closing.  Couriers will pick up specimens that have been drawn throughout the day and deliver them to the lab.  Also, couriers will stop at outpatient drawing centers and pick up specimens. These specimens will be processed in the evening and overnight to ensure results will be available the following day.

== Laboratory informatics ==
The large amount if information processed in laboratories is managed by a system of software programs, computers, and [[Medical terminology|terminology standards]] that exchange data about patients, test requests, and test results known as a [[Laboratory information system]] or LIS.  The LIS is often interfaced with the [[hospital information system]], [[Electronic health record|EHR]] and/or [[Laboratory instruments]]. Formats for terminologies for test processing and reporting are being standardized  with systems such as [[LOINC|Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes]] (LOINC) and [[NPU_terminology|Nomenclature for Properties and Units terminology]] (NPU terminology).

These systems enable hospitals and labs to order the correct test requests for each patient, keep track of individual patient and specimen histories, and help guarantee a better quality of results.  Results are made available to care providers electronically or by printed hard copies for patient charts.

==Result analysis, validation and interpretation==
According to various regulations, such as the international ISO 15189 norm, all pathological laboratory results must be verified by a competent professional. In some countries, staffs composed of [[Clinical laboratory scientist|clinical scientists]] do the majority of this work inside the laboratory with certain abnormal results referred to the relevant [[pathology|pathologist]]. Clinical scientists have the responsibility for limited interpretation of testing results in their discipline in many countries. Interpretation of results can be assisted by some software in order to validate normal or non modified results.

In other testing areas, only professional medical staff ([[pathologist]] or [[clinical biologist]]) is involved with interpretation and consulting.  Medical staff are sometimes also required in order to explain pathology results to [[physician]]s. For a simple result given by phone or to explain a technical problem, often a medical technologist or medical lab scientist can provide additional information.

Medical Laboratory Departments in some countries are exclusively directed by a specialized [[pathologist]]. In others, a consultant, medical or non-medical, may be the head the department. In Europe and some other countries, Clinical Scientists with a Masters level education may be qualified to head the department.  Others may have a PhD and can have an exit qualification equivalent to medical staff (e.g., FRCPath in the UK).

In France, only medical staff ([[Pharm.D.]] and [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] specialized in [[anatomical pathology]] or [[Clinical biologist|clinical biology]]) can discuss pathological results.

== Medical laboratory accreditation ==
Credibility of medical laboratories is paramount to the health and safety of the patients relying on the testing services provided by these labs. Credentialing agencies vary by country. The international standard in use today for the accreditation of medical laboratories is [[ISO 15189]] - ''Medical laboratories - Requirements for quality and competence.
''

In the United States, accreditation is performed by the [[Joint Commission]], [[College of American Pathologists]], AAB (American Association of Bioanalysts), and other state and federal agencies.  Legislative guidelines are provided under CLIA 88 ([[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments]]) which regulates Medical Laboratory testing and personnel.

The accrediting body in Australia is NATA, where all laboratories must be NATA accredited to receive payment from Medicare.

In France the accrediting body is [[COFRAC]] ([[:fr:Comité français d'accréditation|COFRAC]]).  In 2010, modification of legislation established ISO 15189 accreditation as an obligation for all clinical laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000021683301&amp;dateTexte=|title=Clinical Biology reform and accreditation obligation in France|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Arab Emirates, the Dubai Accreditation Department ([http://www.dac.dm.ae DAC]) is the accreditation body that is internationally recognised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilac.org/signatory-detail/?id=76|title=International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation - ILAC|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation]] (ILAC) for many facilties and groups, including Medical Laboratories, Testing and Calibration Laboratories, and Inspection Bodies.

In Hong Kong, the accrediting body is Hong Kong Accreditation Service ([http://www.hkas.gov.hk HKAS]).  On 16 February 2004, HKAS launched it's medical testing accreditation programme.

In Canada, laboratory accreditation is not mandatory, but is becoming more and more popular.  Accreditation Canada ([https://accreditation.ca/ AC]) is the national reference. Different provincial oversight bodies mandate laboratories in EQA participations like LSPQ (Quebec), IQMH (Ontario) for example.

== Industry ==
The laboratory industry is a part of the broader healthcare and health technology industry. Companies exist at various levels, including [[Clinical pathology|clinical laboratory services]], suppliers of instrumentation equipment and consumable materials, and suppliers and developers of of diagnostic tests themselves (often by [[biotechnology]] companies).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK447315/|title=Overview of the diagnostics market|last=Morel|first=Chantal|last2=McClure|first2=Lindsay|last3=Edwards|first3=Suzanne|last4=Goodfellow|first4=Victoria|last5=Sandberg|first5=Dale|last6=Thomas|first6=Joseph|last7=Mossialos|first7=Elias|date=2016|publisher=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clinical laboratory services includes large [[Multinational corporation|multinational corporations]] such [[LabCorp]], [[Quest Diagnostics]], and [[Sonic Healthcare]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but a significant portion of revenue, estimated at 60% in the United States, is generated by hospital labs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2018, the total global revenue for these companies was estimated to reach $146 billion by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/clinical-laboratory-services-market-size-is-projected-to-be-around-us-146-billion-by-2024-2018-08-20|title=Clinical Laboratory Services Market Size is Projected to be Around US$ 146 Billion by 2024|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate places the market size at $205 billion, reaching $333 billion by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medgadget.com/2018/04/global-clinical-laboratory-services-market-growing-with-7-1-cagr-by-2023-leading-players-are-spectra-laboratories-sonic-healthcare-ltd-siemens-quest-diagnostics-qiagen-and-more.html|title=Global Clinical Laboratory Services Market Growing With 7.1% CAGR by 2023 – Leading Players are Spectra Laboratories, Sonic Healthcare Ltd., Siemens, Quest Diagnostics, Qiagen and More {{!}}|date=2018-04-12|work=Medgadget|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association for Clinical Chemistry]] (AAAC) represents professionals in the field. 

Clinical laboratories are supplied by other multinational companies which focus on materials and equipment, which can be used for both scientific research and medical testing. The largest of these is [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2016, global life sciences instrumentation sales were around $47 billion, not including consumables, software, and services.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i10/Top-instrument-firms-2016.html|title=Top instrument firms in 2016 {{!}} March 6, 2017 Issue - Vol. 95 Issue 10 {{!}} Chemical &amp; Engineering News|last=Thayer|first=Ann M.|website=cen.acs.org|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, laboratory equipment includes lab centrifuges, transfection solutions, water purification systems, extraction techniques, gas generators, concentrators and evaporators, fume hoods, incubators, biological safety cabinets, bioreactors and fermenters, microwave-assisted chemistry, lab washers, and shakers and stirrers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bioinfoinc.com/2017-market-laboratory-equipment/|title=The 2017 Market for Laboratory Equipment|last=|first=|date=|website=bioinfoinc.com|publisher=Bioinformatics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2016}}, the in vitro diagnostics (IVD) market was estimated at a global value of around $45-50 billion, with six key companies: [[Roche Diagnostics]], [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott Diagnostics]], [[Siemens]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson|Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Devices and Diagnostics]], [[Beckman Coulter]] and [[BioMérieux|BioMerieux]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many of the companies sell capital equipment and supply consumables, and the devices are also used for industrial purposes such as food testing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Molecular diagnostics]] is estimated at 10% of total revenue, and half of that focused on infectious disease testing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Mercury-Redstone 2''' (MR-2) was the penultimate test flight of the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]] prior to the first manned American space mission in [[Project Mercury]].  It was launched at 16:55 UTC on January 31, 1961 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5|LC-5]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. Mercury spacecraft No. 5 carried [[Ham the Chimp]], a chimpanzee, on a suborbital flight, landing in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] 16 minutes and 39 seconds after launch.

==Background==

The previous Mercury-Redstone mission, [[Mercury-Redstone 1A|MR-1A]], flew a trajectory that was too steep with accelerations too high for a human passenger. MR-1A had climbed to its programmed apogee of about 130 miles (209&amp;nbsp;km) and landed 235 miles (378&amp;nbsp;km) downrange. Mercury-Redstone 2 would follow a more flattened trajectory. Its planned flight path was an apogee of 115 miles (185&amp;nbsp;km) and a range of 290 miles (467&amp;nbsp;km).

==Mission==
[[File:Chimpanzee Ham in Biopack Couch - cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Ham before the launch of Mercury-Redstone 2]]
Mercury spacecraft No. 5 contained six new systems that had not been on previous flights: environmental control system, attitude stabilization control system, live retrorockets, voice communications system, "closed loop" abort sensing system, and a pneumatic landing bag.

Six [[chimpanzee]]s (four female and two male) and 20 medical specialists and animal handlers from [[Holloman Air Force Base]], New Mexico, where the chimps lived and were trained, were moved into quarters behind Hangar S at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida on January 2, 1961. The six chimps were trained in Mercury simulators for three weeks. The day before the flight, two chimps were chosen for the mission: one primary, '''Ham''', and one backup, a female chimp named '''Minnie'''. The competition was fierce, but Ham was full of energy and good humor. Ham was named in honor of Holloman Aerospace Medical Center. Ham was from [[Cameroon]], Africa, (original name Chang, Chimp No. 65) and was purchased by the USAF July 9, 1959. He was 3 years 8 months old at launch.

At 12:53 UTC, January 31, 1961, Ham was inserted into the spacecraft. The countdown was then delayed almost four hours because of a hot [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]], and several other minor problems.

At 16:55 UTC the MR-2 lifted off. Computers reported one minute after launch, the flight path angle was at least one degree too high and rising. At two minutes, the computers predicted a 17 ''g'' (167&amp;nbsp;m/s²) acceleration. At 2 minutes 17 seconds into the flight, the liquid oxygen supply was depleted. The closed-loop abort system sensed a change in engine chamber pressure when the LOX supply was depleted and fired the launch escape system. The abort signaled a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] message to the recovery forces.

The high flight angle, and the early abort, caused the maximum velocity of the spacecraft to be 7,540&amp;nbsp;ft/s (2,298&amp;nbsp;m/s) instead of the planned 6,465&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1,970&amp;nbsp;m/s). The retrorockets had been jettisoned during the abort and therefore could not be used to slow down the spacecraft. All of this added up to an overshoot of the planned landing area by 130 miles (209&amp;nbsp;km) and an [[apogee]] of 157 miles (253&amp;nbsp;km) instead of 115 miles (185&amp;nbsp;km).

Another problem occurred at 2 minutes and 18 seconds into the flight, when cabin pressure dropped from 5.5 to 1&amp;nbsp;lb/in² (38 to 7 kPa). This malfunction was traced later to the air inlet snorkel valve. Vibrations had loosened a pin in the snorkel valve and allowed the valve to open. Ham was safe in his own couch spacesuit and did not suffer any ill effects from the loss of cabin pressure. His couch spacesuit pressure remained normal, and suit temperature stayed well within the 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 26 °C) optimum range.

Because of over-acceleration of the launch vehicle and the boost from the escape rocket, a speed of 5,857&amp;nbsp;mph (9,426&amp;nbsp;km/h) was reached instead of the 4,400&amp;nbsp;mph (7,081&amp;nbsp;km/h) planned. At apogee Ham's spacecraft was 48 miles (77&amp;nbsp;km) farther downrange than planned. Ham was weightless for 6.6 minutes instead of the 4.9 minutes that were planned. The spacecraft landed 422 miles (679&amp;nbsp;km) downrange after a 16.5-minute flight. He received 14.7 [[g-force|''g'']] (144&amp;nbsp;m/s²) during reentry, almost 3 ''g'' (29&amp;nbsp;m/s²) greater than planned.

Ham performed his tasks well, pushing levers about 50 times during the flight. Onboard cameras filming Ham's reaction to weightlessness showed a surprising amount of dust and debris floating around inside the capsule during apogee. 
[[File:Ham receives his well deserved apple.jpg|left|thumb|Ham accepts an apple.]]
The spacecraft splashed down about 12:12 p.m. EST, out of sight from recovery forces. About 12 minutes later, the first recovery signal was received from the spacecraft. Tracking showed it was about 60 miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) from the nearest recovery ship. Twenty-seven minutes after landing, a search plane sighted the capsule floating upright in the Atlantic. The search plane requested that the Navy send its rescue helicopters from the closest ship carrying them.

When helicopters arrived they found the spacecraft on its side, taking on water, and submerging. The [[beryllium]] [[heat shield]] upon water impact had bounced against the capsule bottom, punching two holes in the titanium pressure bulkhead. The landing bag had worn badly, and the heatshield was torn free from the spacecraft before recovery. After the craft capsized, the open snorkel valve let still more sea water enter the capsule. When the helicopter crew finally latched onto and picked up Ham's spacecraft at 18:52 UTC., they estimated there was about 800 pounds (360&amp;nbsp;kg) of sea water aboard. The spacecraft was flown to and lowered to the deck of {{USS|Donner|LSD-20|6}}. When the spacecraft was opened Ham appeared to be in good condition and readily accepted an apple and half an orange.

==Post-flight==

With the malfunctions during the flight, the Mercury-Redstone was still not ready for a human passenger planned for [[Mercury-Redstone 3|MR-3]]. It was postponed pending a final booster development flight, [[Mercury-Redstone BD]].

After his spaceflight, Ham was transferred to the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] in Washington, D.C. for 17 years and then in 1981 was moved to a zoo in North Carolina to live with a colony of other chimps. He died on January 19, 1983, at the age 26.  Ham is buried at the [[New Mexico Museum of Space History]] in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]. He was one of many [[animals in space]].

Ham's backup, Minnie, was the only female chimp trained for the Mercury program. After her role in the Mercury program ended, Minnie became part of an Air Force chimp-breeding program, producing nine offspring and helping raise the offspring of several other members of the chimp colony. She was the last surviving ''astro-chimp''. She died at the age of 41 on March 14, 1998.

Mercury spacecraft No. 5, used in the Mercury-Redstone 2 mission, is currently displayed at the [[California Science Center]], [[Los Angeles, California]].

In [[general relativity]], the '''metric tensor''' (in this context often abbreviated to simply the '''metric''') is the fundamental object of study. It may loosely be thought of as a generalization of the [[gravitational potential]] of [[gravity|Newtonian gravitation]].{{clarify|reason=This seems to be pulled out of the air and is difficult to interpret (i.e., is it even a valid analogy, and how is the analogy useful?).|date=August 2017}} The metric captures all the geometric and [[Causal spacetime structure|causal structure]] of [[spacetime]], being used to define notions such as time, distance, volume, curvature, angle, and separating the future and the past.

==Notation and conventions==

Throughout this article we work with a [[metric signature]] that is mostly positive ({{nowrap|− + + +}}); see [[sign convention]]. The [[gravitation constant]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; will be kept explicit. The [[Einstein summation convention]], where repeated indices are automatically summed over, is employed.

==Definition==

Mathematically, spacetime is represented by a four-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the metric tensor is given as a [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]], second-[[Tensor degree|degree]], [[symmetric tensor]] on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, conventionally denoted by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the metric is required to be [[nondegenerate]] with [[Lorentz signature|signature]] {{nowrap|(− + + +)}}. A manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; equipped with such a metric is a type of [[Lorentzian manifold]].

Explicitly, the metric tensor is a [[symmetric bilinear form]] on each [[tangent space]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that varies in a smooth (or differentiable) manner from point to point. Given two tangent vectors &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the metric can be evaluated on &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to give a real number:
:&lt;math&gt;g_x(u,v) = g_x(v,u) \in \mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a generalization of the [[dot product]] of ordinary [[Euclidean space]]. Unlike Euclidean space &amp;ndash; where the dot product is [[positive definite]] &amp;ndash; the metric is indefinite and gives each tangent space the structure of [[Minkowski space]].

==Local coordinates and matrix representations==

Physicists usually work in [[local coordinates]] (i.e. coordinates defined on some [[atlas (topology)|local patch]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;). In local coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is an index that runs from 0 to 3) the metric can be written in the form
:&lt;math&gt;g = g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \otimes dx^\nu .&lt;/math&gt;
The factors &lt;math&gt;dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt; are [[one-form]] [[gradient]]s of the scalar coordinate fields &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt;. The metric is thus a linear combination of [[tensor product]]s of one-form gradients of coordinates.  The coefficients &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are a set of 16 real-valued functions (since the tensor &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a ''[[tensor field]]'', which is defined at all points of a [[spacetime]] manifold). In order for the metric to be symmetric we must have
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu} = g_{\nu\mu} ,&lt;/math&gt;
giving 10 independent coefficients.

If the local coordinates are specified, or understood from context, the metric can be written as a {{nowrap|4 × 4}} [[symmetric matrix]] with entries &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. The nondegeneracy of &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; means that this matrix is [[non-singular matrix|non-singular]] (i.e. has non-vanishing determinant), while the Lorentzian signature of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; implies that the matrix has one negative and three positive [[eigenvalues]]. Note that physicists often refer to this matrix or the coordinates &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; themselves as the metric (see, however, [[abstract index notation]]).

With the quantities &lt;math&gt;dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt; being regarded as the components of an infinitesimal coordinate displacement [[four-vector]] (not to be confused with the one-forms of the same notation above), the metric determines the invariant square of an infinitesimal [[line element]], often referred to as an ''interval''. The interval is often denoted
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu .&lt;/math&gt;

The interval &lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt; imparts information about the [[Causal spacetime structure|causal structure of spacetime]].  When &lt;math&gt;ds^2 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the interval is [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|timelike]] and the square root of the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt; is an incremental [[proper time]].  Only timelike intervals can be physically traversed by a massive object.  When &lt;math&gt;ds^2=0&lt;/math&gt;, the interval is lightlike, and can only be traversed by light.  When &lt;math&gt;ds^2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the interval is spacelike and the square root of &lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt; acts as an incremental [[proper length]].  &lt;!--(In special relativity, the spacelike interval between a pair of events is the square of the distance between the spatial positions of the two events as measured in a Lorentz frame in which the two events are simultaneous.)--&gt;  Spacelike intervals cannot be traversed, since they connect events that are outside each other's [[light cone]]s.  [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|Event]]s can be causally related only if they are within each other's light cones.

The components of the metric depend on the choice of local coordinate system. Under a change of coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu \to x^{\bar \mu}&lt;/math&gt;, the metric components transform as
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\bar \mu \bar \nu} = \frac{\partial x^\rho}{\partial x^{\bar \mu}}\frac{\partial x^\sigma}{\partial x^{\bar \nu}} g_{\rho\sigma} = \Lambda^\rho {}_{\bar \mu} \, \Lambda^\sigma {}_{\bar \nu} \, g_{\rho \sigma} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Flat spacetime===

The simplest example of a Lorentzian manifold{{clarify|why is the focus on Lorentzian manifolds when describing metrics?|date=May 2017}} is [[flat spacetime]], which can be given as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with coordinates{{clarify|is this in Cartesian coordinates?|date=May 2017}} &lt;math&gt;(t,x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and the metric
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 = \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these coordinates actually cover all of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The flat space metric (or [[Minkowski metric]]) is often denoted by the symbol ''η'' and is the metric used in [[special relativity]]. In the above coordinates, the matrix representation of ''η'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \begin{pmatrix}-c^2&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
(An alternative convention replaces coordinate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;ct&lt;/math&gt;, and defines &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; as in {{section link|Minkowski space|Standard basis}}.)

In [[spherical coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(t,r,\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the flat space metric takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;d\Omega^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,d\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;
is the standard metric on the [[2-sphere]]{{clarify|what does standard metric on the 2-sphere mean?|date=May 2017}}.

===Black hole metrics===

The Schwarzschild metric describes an uncharged, non-rotating black hole.  There are also metrics that describe rotating and charged metrics for black holes.

====Schwarzschild metric====

Besides the flat space metric the most important metric in general relativity is the [[Schwarzschild metric]] which can be given in one set of local coordinates by 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^{2} = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right) c^2 dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2&lt;/math&gt;
where, again, &lt;math&gt;d\Omega^2&lt;/math&gt; is the standard metric on the [[2-sphere]]. Here, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitation constant]] and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a constant with the dimensions of [[mass]]. Its derivation can be found [[Deriving the Schwarzschild solution|here]]. The Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric as &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; approaches zero (except at the origin where it is undefined). Similarly, when &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity, the Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric.

With coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\right)=(ct, r, \theta, \varphi) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
we can write the metric as

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix} -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \left(1-\frac{2GM}{r c^2}\right)^{-1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; r^2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; r^2 \sin^2 \theta \end{bmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Several other systems of coordinates have been devised for the Schwarzschild metric: [[Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates]], [[Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates]], [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]], and [[Lemaître coordinates]].

====Rotating and charged black holes====

Rotating and charged black holes are described by the [[Kerr metric]], the [[Kerr–Newman metric]], and the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]].{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}

===Other metrics===

Other notable metrics are:

*[[Alcubierre metric#Alcubierre metric|Alcubierre metric]], 
*[[de Sitter space|de Sitter]]/[[anti-de Sitter space|anti-de Sitter]] metrics,
*[[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], 
*[[Isotropic coordinates]], 
*[[Lemaître–Tolman metric]] (aka [[Lemaître–Tolman metric|Bondi metric]]{{clarify|why is this alias here? wouldn't it make more sense in the linked Lemaitre-Tolman article?|date=May 2017}}),
*[[Peres metric]],
*[[Rindler coordinates]],
*[[Weyl−Lewis−Papapetrou coordinates]],
*[[Gödel metric]].

Some of them are without the [[event horizon]] or can be without the [[gravitational singularity]].

== Volume ==

The metric ''g'' induces a natural [[volume form]] (up to a sign), which can be used to integrate over a [[Region (mathematics)|region]] of a manifold. Given local coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; for the manifold, the volume form can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{vol}_g = \pm\sqrt{|\det [g_{\mu\nu}]|}\,dx^0\wedge dx^1\wedge dx^2\wedge dx^3 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\det[g_{\mu\nu}]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant]] of the matrix of components of the metric tensor for the given coordinate system.

==Curvature==

The metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; completely determines the [[curvature]] of spacetime. According to the [[fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry]], there is a unique [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] ∇ on any [[semi-Riemannian manifold]] that is compatible with the metric and [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]-free. This connection is called the [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The [[Christoffel symbols]] of this connection are given in terms of partial derivatives of the metric in local coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\mu\nu} = {1 \over 2} g^{\lambda\rho} \left( {\partial g_{\rho\mu} \over \partial x^\nu} + {\partial g_{\rho\nu} \over \partial x^\mu} - {\partial g_{\mu\nu} \over \partial x^\rho} \right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The curvature of spacetime is then given by the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] which is defined in terms of the Levi-Civita connection ∇. In local coordinates this tensor is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;{R^\rho}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho {}_{\nu\sigma}
 - \partial_\nu\Gamma^\rho {}_{\mu\sigma}
 + \Gamma^\rho {}_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\nu\sigma}
 - \Gamma^\rho {}_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\mu\sigma}.&lt;/math&gt;

The curvature is then expressible purely in terms of the metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and its derivatives.

==Einstein's equations==

One of the core ideas of general relativity is that the metric (and the associated geometry of spacetime) is determined by the [[matter]] and [[energy]] content of [[spacetime]]. [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]]:
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over 2}R g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \,T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Ricci curvature tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\nu \rho} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ {R^{\mu}}_{\nu\mu \rho} &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[scalar curvature]]
:&lt;math&gt; R \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ g^{\mu \nu}R_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt;
relate the metric (and the associated curvature tensors) to the [[stress–energy tensor]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. This [[tensor]] equation is a complicated set of nonlinear [[partial differential equation]]s for the metric components. [[Exact solutions]] of Einstein's field equations are very difficult to find.

The '''Network of Concerned Anthropologists''' (NCA) is an independent ad hoc network of anthropologists seeking to promote an ethical [[anthropology]].

The network is concerned that the "[[war on terror]]" threatens to militarize anthropology in a way that undermines the integrity of the discipline. Therefore, the network offers the possibility to sign a [[Oath|pledge]] where it is stated what kinds of work anthropologists should not engage in.

The founding members of the Network of Concerned Anthropologists include Catherine Besteman, Andrew Bickford, Greg Feldman, Gustaaf Houtman, Roberto Gonzalez, [[Hugh Gusterson]], Jean Jackson, Kanhong Lin, [[Catherine Lutz]], [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]], and David Vine.&lt;!-- As of September 2011 only two of these people have WP articles. Please do not redlink the other names.--&gt;

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Sunbeam}}

'''Operation Sunbeam'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a series of four nuclear tests conducted at the [[United States of America]]'s [[Nevada Test Site]] in 1962. ''Operation Sunbeam'' tested small, "tactical" nuclear warheads; the most notable was the ''[[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett]]''. ''Operation Sunbeam'' was also known as ''Operation Dominic II''.

The chief milestone of ''Operation Sunbeam'' was that it was the last nuclear test series on the Nevada Test Site conducted in the atmosphere by the United States. Since ''Operation Sunbeam'', specifically the ''[[Little Feller 1]]'' test of the ''Davy Crockett,'' all US nuclear tests on the Test Site have been carried out underground in accordance with the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]].

An '''optical medium''' is material through which [[electromagnetic wave]]s propagate.  It is a form of [[transmission medium]].  The  [[permittivity]] and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the medium define how electromagnetic waves propagate in it.  The medium has an ''[[intrinsic impedance]]'', given by
::&lt;math&gt;\eta = {E_x \over H_y}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]], respectively.
In a region with no [[electrical conductivity]], the expression simplifies to:

::&lt;math&gt;\eta = \sqrt{\mu \over \varepsilon}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

For example, in [[free space]] the intrinsic impedance is called the [[characteristic impedance of vacuum]], denoted ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and

::&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\mu_0 \over \varepsilon_0}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

Waves propagate through a medium with velocity &lt;math&gt;c_w = \nu \lambda &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[frequency]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of the electromagnetic waves. This equation also may be put in the form
:&lt;math&gt; c_w = {\omega \over k}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the wave and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]] of the wave. In [[electrical engineering]], the symbol &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''[[phase constant]]'', is often used instead of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

The propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in [[free space]], an idealized standard reference state (like [[absolute zero]] for temperature), is conventionally denoted by ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;With [[ISO 31-5]], [[NIST]] and the [[BIPM]] have adopted the notation ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;c_0 = {1 \over \sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}}\ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric constant]] and &lt;math&gt;~ \mu_0 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]].

An '''optical telescope''' is a [[telescope]] that gathers and [[Focus (optics)|focuses]] light, mainly from the [[Visible spectrum|visible]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], to create a [[magnification|magnified]] image for direct view, or to make a [[photograph]], or to collect data through electronic [[image sensor]]s.

There are three primary types of optical telescope:
* [[Refracting telescope|refractors]], which use [[lens (optics)|lenses]] ([[dioptrics]])
* [[Reflecting telescope|reflectors]], which use [[mirror]]s ([[catoptrics]])
* [[catadioptric system#Catadioptric telescopes|catadioptric telescopes]], which combine lenses and mirrors

A telescope's light gathering power and ability to resolve small detail is directly related to the diameter (or aperture) of its [[Objective (optics)|objective]] (the primary lens or mirror that collects and focuses the light). The larger the objective, the more light the telescope collects and the finer detail it resolves.

People use telescopes and [[binoculars]] for activities such as [[observational astronomy]], [[ornithology]], [[pilotage]] and [[reconnaissance]], and watching sports or performance arts.

==History==
{{Further information|History of the telescope}}

The telescope is more a discovery of optical craftsmen than an invention of a scientist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden – “the telescope was not the invention of scientists; rather, it was the product of craftsmen.”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LZZginzib4C page 55"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;vq=dutch&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0#PPA55,M1 Fred Watson, '''Stargazer''' (page 55)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and the properties of refracting and reflecting light had been known since [[Ancient history|antiquity]] and theory on how they worked were developed by ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosophers, preserved and expanded on in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], and had reached a significantly advanced state by the time of the telescope's invention in [[early modern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=alhazen+and+the+telescope&amp;ots=0GOT5dCTU8&amp;sig=U-uj1p9TvkAW12XFz8mkfI6TWMg#PPA27,M1 '''The History of the Telescope''' By Henry C. King, Page 25-29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;progression is followed through [[Robert Grosseteste]] [[Witelo]], [[Roger Bacon]], through [[Johannes Kepler]], D. C. Lindberg, Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler, (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 94-99&lt;/ref&gt; But the most significant step cited in the invention of the telescope was the development of lens manufacture for [[Glasses|spectacles]],&lt;ref name="LZZginzib4C page 55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=invention+of+the+telescope&amp;lr=#PPA26,M1 '''Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes''' By Vincent Ilardi], page 210&lt;/ref&gt; first in Venice and Florence in the thirteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden '']&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the spectacle making centers in both the [[Netherlands]] and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=alhazen+and+the+telescope&amp;ots=0GOT5dCTU8&amp;sig=U-uj1p9TvkAW12XFz8mkfI6TWMg#PPA27,M1 '''The History of the Telescope''' By Henry C. King, Page 27 "''(spectacles) invention, an important step in the history of the telescope''"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the Netherlands in 1608 where the first recorded optical telescopes ([[refracting telescope]]s) appeared. The invention is credited to the spectacle makers [[Hans Lippershey]] and [[Zacharias Janssen]] in [[Middelburg]], and the instrument-maker and optician [[Jacob Metius]] of [[Alkmaar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope'''] by Al Van Helden ''"The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg, Sacharias Janssen had a telescope at about the same time but was at the Frankfurt Fair where he tried to sell it"''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] greatly improved {{citation needed|date=August 2014}} on these designs the following year, and is generally credited as the first to use a telescope for astronomy. Galileo's telescope used Hans Lippershey's design of a convex [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] and a concave [[Eyepiece|eye lens]], and this design is now called a [[Galilean telescope]]. [[Johannes Kepler]] proposed an improvement on the design&lt;ref&gt;See his books ''[[Johannes Kepler#Prague (1600–1612)|Astronomiae Pars Optica]]'' and ''[[Johannes Kepler#Prague (1600–1612)|Dioptrice]]''&lt;/ref&gt; that used a convex [[eyepiece]], often called the [[Keplerian Telescope]].

The next big step in the development of refractors was the advent of the [[Achromatic lens]] in the early 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/sphaera/index.htm?issue8/articl5 Sphaera - Peter Dollond answers Jesse Ramsden] - A review of the events of the invention of the achromatic doublet with emphasis on the roles of Hall, Bass, John Dollond and others.&lt;/ref&gt; which corrected the [[chromatic aberration]] in Keplerian telescopes up to that time—allowing for much shorter instruments with much larger objectives.

For [[reflecting telescope]]s, which use a [[curved mirrors|curved mirror]] in place of the objective lens, theory preceded practice. The theoretical basis for [[curved mirrors]] behaving similar to lenses was probably established by [[Alhazen]], whose theories had been widely disseminated in Latin translations of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=BIwrSc6pB4OClQT4zfyxBg#PPA108,M1 Stargazer - By Fred Watson, Inc NetLibrary, Page 108]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the invention of the refracting telescope Galileo, [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]], and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties as lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=BIwrSc6pB4OClQT4zfyxBg#PPA108,M1 Stargazer - By Fred Watson, Inc NetLibrary, Page 109]&lt;/ref&gt; The potential advantages of using [[parabolic reflector|parabolic mirrors]] (primarily a reduction of [[spherical aberration]] with elimination of [[chromatic aberration]]) led to several proposed designs for reflecting telescopes,&lt;ref&gt;works by [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]] and [[Marin Mersenne]] among others have designs for reflecting telescopes&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable of which was published in 1663 by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] and came to be called the [[Gregorian telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;vq=dutch&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0#PPA121,M1 Stargazer - By Fred Watson, Inc NetLibrary, Page 117]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=alhazen+and+the+telescope&amp;ots=0GOT5dCTU8&amp;sig=U-uj1p9TvkAW12XFz8mkfI6TWMg#PPA71,M1 '''The History of the Telescope''' By Henry C. King, Page 71]&lt;/ref&gt; but no working models were built. [[Isaac Newton]] has been generally credited with constructing the first practical reflecting telescopes, the [[Newtonian telescope]], in 1668&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=32IDpTdthm4C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=newton+reflecting+telescope++1668+letter+1669&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PKABaGwPaN&amp;sig=rPS8w23_nAp3kH5YMYGZ7JHhOaI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0QC1Svf7AsWb8Aa3nqGTDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=newton%20reflecting%20telescope%20%201668%20letter%201669&amp;f=false '''Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought''', by Alfred Rupert Hall, page 67]&lt;/ref&gt; although due to their difficulty of construction and the poor performance of the [[speculum metal]] mirrors used it took over 100 years for reflectors to become popular. Many of the advances in reflecting telescopes included the perfection of [[parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] fabrication in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Parabolic mirrors were used much earlier, but [[James Short (mathematician)|James Short]] perfected their construction.

[http://www.cambridge.org/uk/astronomy/features/amateur/files/p28-4.pdf Bakich sample pages Chapter 2, Page 3 ''"John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, was one of the first to coat a mirror with aluminum. He did it by thermal vacuum evaporation. The first mirror he aluminized, in 1932, is the earliest known example of a telescope mirror coated by this technique."'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[segmented mirror]]s to allow larger diameters, and [[active optics]] to compensate for gravitational deformation. A mid-20th century innovation was [[catadioptric system|catadioptric]] telescopes such as the [[Schmidt camera]], which uses both a lens (corrector plate) and mirror as primary optical elements, mainly used for wide field imaging without spherical aberration.

The late 20th century has seen the development of [[adaptive optics]] and [[space telescope]]s to overcome the problems of [[astronomical seeing]].

==Principles==
{{for|specific designs of telescope|Reflecting telescope|Refracting telescope|Catadioptric}}

The basic scheme is that the primary light-gathering element the [[objective (optics)|objective]] (1) (the [[convex lens]] or [[concave mirror]] used to gather the incoming light), focuses that light from the distant object (4) to a focal plane where it forms a [[real image]] (5). This image may be recorded or viewed through an [[eyepiece]] (2), which acts like a [[magnifying glass]]. The eye (3) then sees an inverted [[magnification|magnified]] [[virtual image]] (6) of the object.

[[Image:Kepschem.png|thumb|350px|right|Schematic of a [[Keplerian telescope|Keplerian]] [[refracting telescope]]. The arrow at (4) is a (notional) representation of the original image; the arrow at (5) is the inverted image at the focal plane; the arrow at (6) is the virtual image that forms in the viewer's visual sphere. The red rays produce the midpoint of the arrow; two other sets of rays (each black) produce its head and tail.]]

===Inverted images===
Most telescope designs produce an inverted image at the focal plane; these are referred to as ''inverting telescopes''. In fact, the image is both turned upside down and reversed left to right, so that altogether it is rotated by 180 degrees from the object orientation. In astronomical telescopes the rotated view is normally not corrected, since it does not affect how the telescope is used. However, a mirror diagonal is often used to place the eyepiece in a more convenient viewing location, and in that case the image is erect, but still reversed left to right. In terrestrial telescopes such as [[spotting scope]]s, [[monocular]]s and [[binoculars]], prisms (e.g., [[Porro prism]]s) or a relay lens between objective and eyepiece are used to correct the image orientation. There are telescope designs that do not present an inverted image such as the [[Refracting telescope#Refracting telescope designs|Galilean refractor]] and the [[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian reflector]]. These are referred to as ''erecting telescopes''.

===Design variants===
Many types of telescope fold or divert the optical path with secondary or tertiary mirrors. These may be integral part of the optical design ([[Newtonian telescope]], [[Cassegrain reflector]] or similar types), or may simply be used to place the eyepiece or detector at a more convenient position. Telescope designs may also use specially designed additional lenses or mirrors to improve image quality over a larger field of view. 
&lt;!--no special reason to mention a Maksutov telescope here, it is a rare type; the Cassegrain is the "grandfather" of all these designs. Also, folding the optical path alone, ''e.g.'' by flat mirrors, should not reduce the field of view--&gt;

==Characteristics==
Design specifications relate to the characteristics of the telescope and how it performs optically. Several properties of the specifications may change with the equipment or accessories used with the telescope; such as [[Barlow lens]]es, [[star diagonal]]s and [[eyepiece]]s. These interchangeable accessories don't alter the specifications of the telescope, however they alter the way the telescopes properties function, typically [[magnification]], apparent [[field of view]] and [[field of view|FOV]].

===Surface resolvability===
The smallest resolvable surface area of an object, as seen through an optical telescope, is the limited physical area that can be resolved. It is analogous to [[angular resolution]], but differs in definition: instead of separation ability between point-light sources it refers to the physical area that can be resolved. A familiar way to express the characteristic is the resolvable ability of features such as [[Moon]] craters or [[Sun]] spots. Expression using the formula is given by the sum of twice the resolving power &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; over [[aperture]] diameter &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the objects diameter &lt;math&gt;D_{ob}&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by the constant &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; all divided by the objects [[apparent diameter]] &lt;math&gt;D_{a}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="SaharaSkyObservatory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saharasky.com/saharasky/formula.html|title=Telescope Formulae|date=3 July 2012|publisher=SaharaSky Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RyukyuAstronomyClub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexstarsite.com/_RAC/form.html|title=Optical Formulae|date=2 January 2012|publisher=Ryukyu Astronomy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Resolving power &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is derived from the [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; using the same unit as [[aperture]]; where 550 [[nanometers|nm]] to [[millimeters|mm]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\lambda}{10^6} = \frac{550}{10^6} = 0.00055&lt;/math&gt;.''
&lt;br/&gt;''The constant &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is derived from [[radians]] to the same unit as the objects [[apparent diameter]]; where the [[Moon]]s [[apparent diameter]] of &lt;math&gt;D_{a} = \frac{313\Pi}{10800}&lt;/math&gt; [[radians]] to [[arcseconds|arcsecs]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;D_{a} = \frac{313\Pi}{10800}*206265 = 1878&lt;/math&gt;.''

An example using a telescope with an [[aperture]] of 130 [[millimeters|mm]] observing the [[Moon]] in a 550 [[nanometer|nm]] [[wavelength]], is given by: &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\frac{2R}{D}*D_{ob}*\Phi}{D_{a}} = \frac{\frac{2*0.00055}{130}*3474.2*206265}{1878} \approx 3.22&lt;/math&gt;

The unit used in the object diameter results in the smallest resolvable features at that unit. In the above example they are approximated in [[kilometers]] resulting in the smallest resolvable [[Moon]] craters being 3.22 [[kilometers|km]] in diameter. The [[Hubble|Hubble Space Telescope]] has a primary mirror [[aperture]] of 2400 [[millimeters|mm]] that provides a surface resolvability of [[Moon]] craters being 174.9 [[meters]] in diameter, or [[sunspots]] of 7365.2 [[kilometers|km]] in diameter.

===Angular resolution===
Ignoring blurring of the image by turbulence in the atmosphere ([[astronomical seeing|atmospheric seeing]]) and optical imperfections of the telescope, the [[angular resolution]] of an optical telescope is determined by the diameter of the [[primary mirror]] or lens gathering the light (also termed its "[[aperture]]").

The [[Rayleigh criterion]] for the resolution limit &lt;math&gt;\alpha_R&lt;/math&gt; (in [[radian]]s) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\alpha_R) = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the aperture. For [[visible light]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; = 550&amp;nbsp;nm) in the [[small-angle approximation]], this equation can be rewritten:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_R = \frac{138}{D}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_R&lt;/math&gt; denotes the resolution limit in [[arcsecond]]s and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is in millimeters. 
In the ideal case, the two components of a [[double star]] system can be discerned even if separated by slightly less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha_R&lt;/math&gt;. This is taken into account by the [[Dawes limit]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_D = \frac{116}{D}&lt;/math&gt;
The equation shows that, all else being equal, the larger the aperture, the better the angular resolution. The resolution is not given by the maximum [[magnification]] (or "power") of a telescope. Telescopes marketed by giving high values of the maximum power often deliver poor images.

For large ground-based telescopes, the resolution is limited by [[astronomical seeing|atmospheric seeing]]. This limit can be overcome by placing the telescopes above the atmosphere, e.g., on the summits of high mountains, on balloon and high-flying airplanes, or [[space telescope|in space]]. Resolution limits can also be overcome by [[adaptive optics]], [[speckle imaging]] or [[lucky imaging]] for ground-based telescopes.

Recently, it has become practical to perform [[aperture synthesis]] with arrays of optical telescopes. Very high resolution images can be obtained with groups of widely spaced smaller telescopes, linked together by carefully controlled optical paths, but [[List of astronomical interferometers at visible and infrared wavelengths|these interferometers]] can only be used for imaging bright objects such as stars or measuring the bright cores of [[active galaxies]].

===Focal length and focal ratio===
The [[focal length]] of an [[optics|optical]] system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges [[light]]. For an optical system in air, it is the distance over which initially [[collimated]] rays are brought to a [[focus (optics)|focus]]. A system with a shorter focal length has greater [[optical power]] than one with a long focal length; that is, it bends the [[ray (optics)|ray]]s more strongly, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance. In astronomy, the f-number is commonly referred to as the ''focal ratio'' notated as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. The [[f-number|focal ratio]] of a telescope is defined as the [[focal length]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of an [[Objective (optics)|objective]] divided by its diameter &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; or by the diameter of an [[aperture]] stop in the system. The [[focal length]] controls the [[field of view]] of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an [[eyepiece]], film plate, or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]].

An example of a telescope with a [[focal length]] of 1200 [[millimeters|mm]] and [[aperture|aperture diameter]] of 254 [[millimeters|mm]] is given by:
&lt;math&gt;N = \frac {f}{D} = \frac {1200}{254} \approx 4.7&lt;/math&gt;

Numerically large [[f-number|Focal ratios]] are said to be ''long'' or ''slow''. Small numbers are ''short'' or ''fast''. There are no sharp lines for determining when to use these terms, and an individual may consider their own standards of determination. Among contemporary astronomical telescopes, any telescope with a [[f-number|focal ratio]] slower (bigger number) than f/12 is generally considered slow, and any telescope with a focal ratio faster (smaller number) than f/6, is considered fast. Faster systems often have more [[optical aberrations]] away from the center of the [[field of view]] and are generally more demanding of eyepiece designs than slower ones. A fast system is often desired for practical purposes in [[astrophotography]] with the purpose of gathering more [[photons]] in a given time period than a slower system, allowing time lapsed [[photography]] to process the result faster.

Wide-field telescopes (such as [[astrograph]]s), are used to track [[satellite]]s and [[asteroid]]s, for [[cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]] research, and for [[astronomical survey]]s of the sky. It is more difficult to reduce [[optical aberrations]] in telescopes with low f-ratio than in telescopes with larger f-ratio.

===Light-gathering power===
{{further information|Etendue}}
The light-gathering power of an optical telescope, also referred to as light grasp or aperture gain, is the ability of a telescope to collect a lot more light than the human eye. Its light-gathering power is probably its most important feature. The telescope acts as a ''light bucket'', collecting all of the photons that come down on it from a far away object, where a larger bucket catches more [[photons]] resulting in more received light in a given time period, effectively brightening the image. This is why the pupils of your eyes enlarge at night so that more light reaches the retinas. The gathering power &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; compared against a human eye is the squared result of the division of the [[aperture]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; over the observer's pupil diameter &lt;math&gt;D_{p}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="SaharaSkyObservatory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RyukyuAstronomyClub"/&gt; with an average adult having a [[pupil]] diameter of 7mm. Younger persons host larger diameters, typically said to be 9mm, as the diameter of the pupil decreases with age.

An example gathering power of an [[aperture]] with 254 [[millimeters|mm]] compared to an adult pupil diameter being 7 [[millimeters|mm]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;P = \left(\frac {D}{D_{p}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac {254}{7}\right)^2 \approx 1316.7&lt;/math&gt;

Light-gathering power can be compared between telescopes by comparing the [[area]]s &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of the two different [[aperture]]s.

As an example, the light-gathering power of a 10 [[meter]] [[telescope]] is 25x that of a 2 [[meter]] [[telescope]]: &lt;math&gt;p = \frac {A_{1}}{A_{2}} = \frac {\pi5^2}{\pi1^2} = 25&lt;/math&gt;

For a survey of a given area, the [[field of view]] is just as important as raw light gathering power. Survey telescopes such as the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] try to maximize the product of mirror area and [[field of view]] (or [[etendue]]) rather than raw light gathering ability alone.

===Magnification===
The magnification through a telescope magnifies a viewing object while limiting the [[Field of view|FOV]]. Magnification is often misleading as the optical power of the telescope, its characteristic is the most misunderstood term used to describe the observable world. At higher magnifications the image quality significantly reduces, usage of a [[Barlow lens]]—which increases the effective focal length of an optical system—multiplies image quality reduction.

Similar minor effects may be present when using [[star diagonal]]s, as light travels through a multitude of lenses that increase or decrease effective focal length. The quality of the image generally depends on the quality of the optics (lenses) and viewing conditions—not on magnification.

Magnification itself is limited by optical characteristics. With any telescope or microscope, beyond a practical maximum magnification, the image looks bigger but shows no more detail. It occurs when the finest detail the instrument can resolve is magnified to match the finest detail the eye can see. Magnification beyond this maximum is sometimes called ''empty magnification''.

To get the most detail out of a telescope, it is critical to choose the right magnification for the object being observed. Some objects appear best at low power, some at high power, and many at a moderate magnification. There are two values for magnification, a minimum and maximum. A wider [[field of view]] [[eyepiece]] may be used to keep the same [[focal length|eyepiece focal length]] whilst providing the same magnification through the telescope. For a good quality telescope operating in good atmospheric conditions, the maximum usable magnification is limited by diffraction.

====Visual====
The visual magnification &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of the field of view through a telescope can be determined by the telescopes [[focal length]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; divided by the [[eyepiece]] [[focal length]] &lt;math&gt;f_{e}&lt;/math&gt; (or diameter).&lt;ref name="SaharaSkyObservatory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RyukyuAstronomyClub"/&gt; The maximum is limited by the focal length of the [[eyepiece]].

An example of visual [[magnification]] using a [[telescope]] with a 1200 [[millimeters|mm]] [[focal length]] and 3 [[millimeters|mm]] [[eyepiece]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;M = \frac {f}{f_{e}} = \frac {1200}{3} = 400&lt;/math&gt;

====Minimum====
There is a lowest usable [[magnification]] on a telescope. The increase in brightness with reduced magnification has a limit related to something called the [[exit pupil]]. The [[exit pupil]] is the cylinder of light coming out of the eyepiece, hence the lower the [[magnification]], the larger the [[exit pupil]]. The minimum &lt;math&gt;M_{m}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by dividing the [[telescope]] [[aperture]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; over the exit pupil diameter &lt;math&gt;D_{ep}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="RocketMime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocketmime.com/astronomy/Telescope/telescope_eqn.html|date=17 November 2012|publisher=RocketMime|title=Telescope Equations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the magnification past this limit cannot increase brightness, at this limit there is no benefit for decreased magnification. Likewise calculating the [[exit pupil]] &lt;math&gt;D_{ep}&lt;/math&gt; is a division of the [[aperture]] diameter &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and the visual magnification &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; used. The minimum often may not be reachable with some telescopes, a telescope with a very long [[focal length]] may require a ''longer-focal-length'' eyepiece than is possible.

An example of the lowest usable magnification using a 254 [[millimeters|mm]] [[aperture]] and 7 [[millimeters|mm]] [[exit pupil]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;M_{m} = \frac {D}{D_{ep}} = \frac {254}{7} \approx 36&lt;/math&gt;, whilst the [[exit pupil]] diameter using a 254 [[millimeters|mm]] [[aperture]] and 36x [[magnification]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;D_{ep} = \frac {D}{M} = \frac {254}{36} \approx 7&lt;/math&gt;

====Optimum====
A useful reference is: 
*For small objects with low surface brightness (such as [[galaxies]]), use a moderate magnification.
*For small objects with high surface brightness (such as [[planetary nebulae]]), use a high magnification.
*For large objects regardless of surface brightness (such as [[diffuse nebulae]]), use low magnification, often in the range of minimum magnification. 
Only personal experience determines the best optimum magnifications for objects, relying on observational skills and seeing conditions.

===Field of view===
[[Field of view]] is the extent of the observable world seen at any given moment, through an instrument (e.g., [[telescope]] or [[binoculars]]), or by naked eye. There are various expressions of [[field of view]], being a specification of an [[eyepiece]] or a characteristic determined from and [[eyepiece]] and [[telescope]] combination. A physical limit derives from the combination where the [[field of view|FOV]] cannot be viewed larger than a defined maximum, due to [[diffraction]] of the optics.

====Apparent====
Apparent [[field of view|FOV]] is the observable world observed through an ocular [[eyepiece]] without insertion into a [[telescope]]. It is limited by the barrel size used in a telescope, generally with modern telescopes that being either 1.25 or 2 inches in diameter. A wider [[field of view|FOV]] may be used to achieve a more vast observable world given the same [[magnification]] compared with a smaller [[field of view|FOV]] without compromise to magnification. Note that increasing the [[field of view|FOV]] lowers [[surface brightness]] of an observed object, as the gathered light is spread over more area, in relative terms increasing the observing area proportionally lowers surface brightness dimming the observed object. Wide [[field of view|FOV]] [[eyepiece]]s work best at low magnifications with large [[apertures]], where the relative size of an object is viewed at higher comparative standards with minimal magnification giving an overall brighter image to begin with.

====True====
True [[field of view|FOV]] is the observable world observed though an ocular [[eyepiece]] inserted into a [[telescope]]. Knowing the true [[field of view|FOV]] of [[eyepiece]]s is very useful since it can be used to compare what is seen through the [[eyepiece]] to printed or computerized [[star chart]]s that help identify what is observed. True [[field of view|FOV]] &lt;math&gt;v_{t}&lt;/math&gt; is the division of apparent [[field of view|FOV]] &lt;math&gt;v_{a}&lt;/math&gt; over [[magnification]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="SaharaSkyObservatory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RyukyuAstronomyClub"/&gt;

An example of true [[field of view|FOV]] using an [[eyepiece]] with 52° apparent [[field of view|FOV]] used at 81.25x [[magnification]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;v_{t} = \frac {v_{a}}{M} = \frac {52}{81.25} = 0.64^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

====Maximum====
Max [[field of view|FOV]] is a term used to describe the maximum useful true [[field of view|FOV]] limited by the optics of the [[telescope]], it is a physical limitation where increases beyond the maximum remain at maximum. Max [[field of view|FOV]] &lt;math&gt;v_{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the barrel size &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; over the [[telescope]]s [[focal length]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; converted from [[radian]] to degrees.&lt;ref name="SaharaSkyObservatory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RyukyuAstronomyClub"/&gt;

An example of max [[field of view|FOV]] using a [[telescope]] with a barrel size of 31.75 [[millimeters|mm]] (1.25 [[inches]]) and [[focal length]] of 1200 [[millimeters|mm]] is given by: &lt;math&gt;v_{m} = B*\frac {\frac {180}{\pi}}{f} \approx 31.75*\frac {57.2958}{1200} \approx 1.52^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

==Observing through a telescope==
There are many properties of optical telescopes and the complexity of observation using one can be a daunting task; experience and experimentation are the major contributors to understanding how to maximize one's observations. In practice, only two main properties of a telescope determine how observation differs: the [[focal length]] and [[aperture]]. These relate as to how the optical system views an object or range and how much light is gathered through an ocular [[eyepiece]]. Eyepieces further determine how the [[field of view]] and [[magnification]] of the observable world change.

===Observable world===
''Observable world'' describes what can be seen using a telescope, when viewing an object or range the observer may use many different techniques. Understanding what can be viewed and how to view it depends on the [[field of view]]. Viewing an object at a size that fits entirely in the field of view is measured using the two telescope properties—[[focal length]] and [[aperture]], with the inclusion of an ocular [[eyepiece]] with suitable focal length (or diameter). Comparing the observable world and the [[angular diameter]] of an object shows how much of the object we see. However, the relationship with the optical system may not result in high [[surface brightness]]. Celestial objects are often dim because of their vast distance, and detail may be limited by [[diffraction]] or unsuitable optical properties.

===Field of view and magnification relationship===
Finding what can be seen through the optical system begins with the [[eyepiece]] providing the [[field of view]] and [[magnification]]; the magnification is given by the division of the telescope and eyepiece [[focal length]]s. Using an example of an amateur telescope such as a [[Newtonian telescope]] with an [[aperture]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of 130&amp;nbsp;mm (5") and focal length &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of 650&amp;nbsp;mm (25.5 inches), one uses an eyepiece with a focal length &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of 8&amp;nbsp;mm and [[field of view|apparent field of view]] &lt;math&gt;v_{a}&lt;/math&gt; of 52°. The magnification at which the observable world is viewed is given by: &lt;math&gt;M = \frac {f}{d} = \frac {650}{8} = 81.25&lt;/math&gt;. The [[field of view|true field of view]] &lt;math&gt;v_{t}&lt;/math&gt; requires the magnification, which is formulated by its division over the apparent field of view: &lt;math&gt;v_{t} = \frac {v_{a}}{M} = \frac {52}{81.25} = 0.64&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting true field of view is 0.64°, allowing an object such as the [[Orion nebula]], which appears [[elliptical]] with an [[angular diameter]] of 65 × 60 [[arcminutes]], to be viewable through the telescope in its entirety, where the whole of the [[nebula]] is within the observable world. Using methods such as this can greatly increase one's viewing potential ensuring the observable world can contain the entire object, or whether to increase or decrease magnification viewing the object in a different aspect.

===Brightness factor===
The [[surface brightness]] at such a magnification significantly reduces, resulting in a far dimmer appearance. A dimmer appearance results in less visual detail of the object. Details such as matter, rings, spiral arms, and gases may be completely hidden from the observer, giving a far less ''complete'' view of the object or range. Physics dictates that at the theoretical minimum magnification of the telescope, the surface brightness is at 100%. Practically, however, various factors prevent 100% brightness; these include telescope limitations ([[focal length]], [[eyepiece]] focal length, etc.) and the age of the observer.

Age plays a role in brightness, as a contributing factor is the observer's [[pupil]]. With age the pupil naturally shrinks in diameter; generally accepted a young adult may have a 7&amp;nbsp;mm diameter pupil, an older adult as little as 5&amp;nbsp;mm, and a younger person larger at 9&amp;nbsp;mm. The [[magnification|minimum magnification]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as the division of the [[aperture]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and [[pupil]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; diameter given by: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac {D}{d} = \frac {130}{7} \approx 18.6&lt;/math&gt;. A problematic instance may be apparent, achieving a theoretical surface brightness of 100%, as the required [[focal length|effective focal length]] of the optical system may require an [[eyepiece]] with too large a diameter.

Some telescopes cannot achieve the theoretical surface brightness of 100%, while some telescopes can achieve it using a very small-diameter eyepiece. To find what eyepiece is required to get [[magnification|minimum magnification]] one can rearrange the magnification formula, where it is now the division of the telescope's [[focal length]] over the minimum magnification: &lt;math&gt; \frac {F}{m} = \frac {650}{18.6} \approx 35&lt;/math&gt;. An eyepiece of 35&amp;nbsp;mm is a non-standard size and would not be purchasable; in this scenario 
to achieve 100% one would require a standard manufactured eyepiece size of 40&amp;nbsp;mm. As the eyepiece has a larger focal length than the minimum magnification, an abundance of wasted light is not received through the eyes.

===Exit pupil===
The increase in [[surface brightness]] as one reduces magnification is limited; that limitation is what is described as the [[exit pupil]]: a cylinder of light that projects out the eyepiece to the observer. An exit pupil must match or be smaller in diameter than one's [[pupil]] to receive the full amount of projected light; a larger exit pupil results in the wasted light. The exit pupil &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; can be derived with from division of the telescope [[aperture]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and the [[magnification|minimum magnification]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, derived by: &lt;math&gt;e = \frac {D}{m} = \frac {130}{18.6} \approx 7&lt;/math&gt;. The pupil and exit pupil are almost identical in diameter, giving no wasted observable light with the optical system. A 7&amp;nbsp;mm pupil falls slightly short of 100% brightness, where the [[surface brightness]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; can be measured from the product of the constant 2, by the square of the pupil &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; resulting in: &lt;math&gt;B = 2*p^2 = 2*7^2 = 98&lt;/math&gt;. The limitation here is the pupil diameter; it's an unfortunate result and degrades with age. Some observable light loss is expected and decreasing the magnification cannot increase surface brightness once the system has reached its minimum usable magnification, hence why the term is referred to as ''usable''.

[[File:Comparison of exit pupils for astronomy.png|500px|thumb|center|These eyes represent a scaled figure of the [[human eye]] where 15 px = 1&amp;nbsp;mm, they have a [[pupil]] diameter of 7&amp;nbsp;mm. ''Figure A'' has an [[exit pupil]] diameter of 14&amp;nbsp;mm, which for [[astronomy]] purposes results in a 75% loss of light. ''Figure B'' has an exit pupil of 6.4&amp;nbsp;mm, which allows the full 100% of observable light to be perceived by the observer.]]

===Image Scale===
When using a CCD to record observations, the CCD is placed in the focal plane. Image scale (sometimes called ''plate scale'') describes how the angular size of the object being observed is related to the physical size of the projected image in the focal plane

&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{\alpha}{s},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the image scale, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angular size of the observed object, and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the physical size of the projected image. In terms of focal length image scale is

&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{1}{f},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is measured in radians per meter (rad/m), and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is measured in meters. Normally &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given in units of arcseconds per millimeter ("/mm). So if the focal length is measured in millimeters, the image scale is

&lt;math&gt;i(''/mm) = \frac{1}{f(mm)}\left[\frac{180 \times 3600}{\pi}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of this equation is fairly straightforward and the result is the same for reflecting or refracting telescopes. However, conceptually it is easier to derive by considering a reflecting telescope. If an extended object with angular size &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is observed through a telescope, then due to the [[Laws of reflection]] and [[Trigonometry]] the size of the image projected onto the focal plane will be

&lt;math&gt;s = \tan(\alpha) f.&lt;/math&gt;

Thefore, the image scale (angular size of object divided by size of projected image) will be

&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{\alpha}{s} = \frac{\alpha}{\tan(\alpha) f},&lt;/math&gt;

and by using the small angle relation &lt;math&gt;\tan(a) \approx a&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;a &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (N.B. only valid if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is in radians), we obtain

&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha f} = \frac{1}{f}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Imperfect images==
No telescope can form a perfect image. Even if a reflecting telescope could have a perfect mirror, or a refracting telescope could have a perfect lens, the effects of aperture diffraction are unavoidable. In reality, perfect mirrors and perfect lenses do not exist, so image [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]] in addition to aperture diffraction must be taken into account. Image aberrations can be broken down into two main classes, monochromatic, and polychromatic. In 1857, [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]] (1821&amp;ndash;1896) decomposed the first order monochromatic aberrations into five constituent aberrations. They are now commonly referred to as the five Seidel Aberrations.

===The five Seidel aberrations===
{{main article|Optical aberration}}
; [[Spherical aberration]] : The difference in focal length between paraxial rays and marginal rays, proportional to the square of the objective diameter.
; [[Coma (optics)|Coma]] : A defect by which points appear as comet-like asymmetrical patches of light with tails, which makes measurement very imprecise. Its magnitude is usually deduced from the [[optical sine theorem]].
; [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|Astigmatism]] : The image of a point forms focal lines at the sagittal and tangental foci and in between (in the absence of coma) an elliptical shape.
; Curvature of Field: The [[Petzval field curvature]] means that the image, instead of lying in a plane, actually lies on a curved surface, described as hollow or round. This causes problems when a flat imaging device is used e.g., a photographic plate or CCD image sensor.
; Distortion: Either barrel or pincushion, a radial distortion that must be corrected when combining multiple images (similar to stitching multiple photos into a [[Panoramic photography|panoramic photo]]).

Optical defects are always listed in the above order, since this expresses their interdependence as first order aberrations via moves of the exit/entrance pupils. The first Seidel aberration, Spherical Aberration, is independent of the position of the exit pupil (as it is the same for axial and extra-axial pencils). The second, coma, changes as a function of pupil distance and spherical aberration, hence the well-known result that it is impossible to correct the coma in a lens free of spherical aberration by simply moving the pupil. Similar dependencies affect the remaining aberrations in the list.

===Chromatic aberrations===
: Longitudinal [[chromatic aberration]]: As with spherical aberration this is the same for axial and oblique pencils.
: Transverse chromatic aberration (chromatic aberration of magnification)

==Astronomical research telescopes==
[[File:Two Unit Telescopes VLT.jpg|thumb|Two of the four Unit Telescopes that make up the [[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]], on a remote mountaintop, 2600 metres above sea level in the Chilean Atacama Desert.]]
Optical telescopes have been used in astronomical research since the time of their invention in the early 17th century. Many types have been constructed over the years depending on the optical technology, such as refracting and reflecting, the nature of the light or object being imaged, and even where they are placed, such as [[space telescope]]s. Some are classified by the task they perform such as [[Solar telescope]]s.

===Large reflectors===
Nearly all large research-grade astronomical telescopes are reflectors. Some reasons are: 
*In a lens the entire volume of material has to be free of imperfection and inhomogeneities, whereas in a mirror, only one surface has to be perfectly polished.
*Light of different colors travels through a medium other than vacuum at different speeds. This causes [[chromatic aberration]].
*Reflectors work in a wider [[spectrum]] of light since certain wavelengths are absorbed when passing through glass elements like those found in a refractor or catadioptric.
*There are technical difficulties involved in manufacturing and manipulating large-diameter lenses. One of them is that all real materials sag in gravity. A lens can only be held by its perimeter. A mirror, on the other hand, can be supported by the whole side opposite to its reflecting face.

[[File:Comparison optical telescope primary mirrors.svg|thumb|left|Comparison of nominal sizes of primary mirrors of some notable optical telescopes]]

Most large research reflectors operate at different focal planes, depending on the type and size of the instrument being used. These including the [[Reflecting telescope#Prime focus|prime focus]] of the main mirror, the [[Cassegrain telescope|cassegrain focus]] (light bounced back down behind the primary mirror), and even external to the telescope all together (such as the [[Reflecting telescope#Nasmyth and coudé focus|Nasmyth and coudé focus]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FGHhZf-k8SkC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=large+telescopes+can+use+prime+code+focus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h0A0T-uYN8j40gHZ3unlAg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=large%20telescopes%20can%20use%20prime%20code%20focus&amp;f=false S. McLean, Electronic imaging in astronomy: detectors and instrumentation, page 91]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new era of telescope making was inaugurated by the [[Multiple Mirror Telescope]] (MMT), with a mirror composed of six segments synthesizing a mirror of 4.5 [[metre|meter]]s diameter. This has now been replaced by a single 6.5 m mirror. Its example was followed by the [[Keck telescope]]s with 10 m segmented mirrors.

The largest current ground-based telescopes have a [[primary mirror]] of between 6 and 11 meters in diameter. In this generation of telescopes, the mirror is usually very thin, and is kept in an optimal shape by an array of actuators (see [[active optics]]). This technology has driven new designs for future telescopes with diameters of 30, 50 and even 100 meters.

Relatively cheap, mass-produced ~2 meter telescopes have recently been developed and have made a significant impact on astronomy research. These allow many astronomical targets to be monitored continuously, and for large areas of sky to be surveyed. Many are [[robotic telescope]]s, computer controlled over the internet (see ''e.g.'' the [[Liverpool Telescope]] and the [[Faulkes Telescope North]] and [[Faulkes Telescope South|South]]), allowing automated follow-up of astronomical events.

Initially the [[detector]] used in telescopes was the [[human eye]]. Later, the sensitized [[photographic plate]] took its place, and the [[spectrograph]] was introduced, allowing the gathering of spectral information. After the photographic plate, successive generations of electronic detectors, such as the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCDs), have been perfected, each with more sensitivity and resolution, and often with a wider wavelength coverage.

Current research telescopes have several instruments to choose from such as: 
*imagers, of different spectral responses
*spectrographs, useful in different regions of the spectrum
*polarimeters, that detect light [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]].

The phenomenon of optical [[diffraction]] sets a limit to the resolution and image quality that a telescope can achieve, which is the effective area of the [[Airy disc]], which limits how close two such discs can be placed. This absolute limit is called the [[diffraction limit]] (and may be approximated by the [[Rayleigh criterion]], [[Dawes limit]] or [[Sparrow's resolution limit]]). This limit depends on the wavelength of the studied light (so that the limit for red light comes much earlier than the limit for blue light) and on the [[diameter]] of the telescope mirror. This means that a telescope with a certain mirror diameter can theoretically resolve up to a certain limit at a certain wavelength. For conventional telescopes on Earth, the diffraction limit is not relevant for telescopes bigger than about 10&amp;nbsp;cm. Instead, the [[Astronomical seeing|seeing]], or blur caused by the atmosphere, sets the resolution limit. But in space, or if [[adaptive optics]] are used, then reaching the diffraction limit is sometimes possible. At this point, if greater resolution is needed at that wavelength, a wider mirror has to be built or [[aperture synthesis]] performed using an array of nearby telescopes.

In recent years, a number of technologies to overcome the distortions caused by [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] on ground-based telescopes have been developed, with good results. See [[adaptive optics]], [[speckle imaging]] and [[Optical interferometry#Astronomical optical interferometry|optical interferometry]].

'''Philip E. Eaton''' (born 1936) is a Professor Emeritus of [[Chemistry]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  He and his fellow researchers were the first to synthesize the "impossible" [[cubane]] [[molecule]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="eaton1964a"&gt;P. Eaton and T. W. Cole, The Cubane System, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 86 (1964) 962.  [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja01059a072 doi:10.1021/ja01059a072]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="eaton1964b"&gt;P. Eaton and T. W. Cole, Cubane, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 86 (1964) 3157. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja01069a041 doi:10.1021/ja01069a041]&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with Mao-Xi Zhang he is reported as having been the first to make [[octanitrocubane]] (their paper was published in the year 2003) Because of its eight nitro groups and highly [[Strain (chemistry)|strained]] C-C bonds - octanitrocubane is a [[R.E. factor|very powerful]] [[high explosive]].

==Early years==
Philip E. Eaton was born in 1936 in Brooklyn, New York. When Eaton was seven his family relocated to Budd Lake, New Jersey. Here he began attending Roxbury Grammar School and later Roxbury High School. It was during these high school years that he began to find his passion for science. It was the support of his parents and teachers that made him decide to major in chemistry.

== Education==
Eaton attended [[Princeton University]] seeking a major in chemistry. Eaton received his B.A. in 1957 before attending [[Harvard University]] and earning his M.A. in 1960 and Ph.D. in 1961. During his time in school he became familiar with cage chemistry, specifically [[Kepone]].

==Teaching Experience==
Upon graduating from Harvard Eaton accepted an assistant professorship position at the University of California, Berkeley. During this time he taught introductory organic chemistry. In 1962, he transferred to the University of Chicago where he remains today.&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Philip E.

==Research==
After arriving at University of Chicago Eaton began his research which he is now most well known for, cubane synthesis. In 1964 Eaton and Thomas W. Cole Jr. synthesized the "impossible" cubane molecule.&lt;ref  name="eaton1964a" /&gt;&lt;ref  name="eaton1964b" /&gt; It was given this name because of its unusual cubic geometry. Many scientists believed that the 90 degree bond-angles would be too strained to allow this molecule to form. He later studied larger [[prismanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The geometries of pentaprismane and hexaprismane insights from molecular mechanics |first1= Norman L. |last1= Allinger |authorlink1= Norman Allinger |first2= Philip E. |last2= Eaton |journal= Tetrahedron Letters |volume= 24 |issue= 35 |year= 1983 |pages= 3697–3700 |doi= 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)94512-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neuchâtel Herbarium - Crataegus monogyna - NEU000099707.jpg|thumb|Specimens prepared in a plant press are later glued to [[card stock]] with their labels, and are filed in a [[herbarium]].]]
A '''plant press''' is a set of equipment used by [[botanist]]s to flatten and dry field [[Sample (material)|sample]]s so that they can be easily stored. A professional plant press is made to the standard maximum size for [[biological specimen]]s to be filed in a particular [[herbarium]]. A '''flower press''' is a similar device of no standard size that is used to make flat dried flowers for [[pressed flower craft]].

Specimens prepared in a plant press are later glued to [[archival]]-quality [[card stock]] top their labels, and are filed in a [[herbarium]]. Labels are made with archival ink (or pencil) and paper, and attached with archival-quality glue.

==Construction==
[[File:Drying herbarium specimens.jpg|thumb|Filled plant presses arranged on a gas-fired heater, with air circulation upwards through the layers]]
A modern plant press consists of two strong outer boards with straps that can be tightened around them to exert pressure. Between the boards, fresh plant samples are placed, carefully labelled, between layers of paper. Further layers of absorbent paper and corrugated cardboard are usually added to help to dry the samples as quickly as possible, which prevents decay and improves colour retention. Layers of a sponge material can be used in order to prevent squashing parts of the specimens, such as fruit. Older plant presses and some modern flower presses have screws to supply the pressure, which often limits the thickness of the stack of samples that can be put into one press.

==History==
[[Luca Ghini]] (1490—1556)  Italian physician and botanist, created the first recorded herbarium, and is considered the first person to have used drying under pressure to prepare a plant collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.brit.org/brit-press/nctexasflora/specimens |title=Collecting Herbarium Specimens |publisher=Botanical Research Institute of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Withering]] English botanist, geologist, chemist and physician wrote popular books on [[Great Britain|British]] [[botany]], and by describing the screw-down plant press (and the [[vasculum]]) he brought it to the attention of amateur naturalists in Britain around 1770.&lt;ref name=Mygatt&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jane Mygatt |title=A Case for Collecting |journal=Iowa Native Plant Society Newsletter |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=5–6 |url=http://www.herbarium.iastate.edu/inps/newsletters/October01.pdf |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2050">'''Poikilohydry''' is the lack of ability (structural or functional mechanism) to maintain and/or regulate water content to achieve [[homeostasis]] of cells and tissue connected with quick equilibration of cell/tissue water content to that of the environment. Frequently, it is coupled with the capacity to tolerate dehydration to low cell or tissue water content and to recover from it without physiological damage. This condition occurs in such organisms as the [[lichen]]s and [[bryophytes]] that lack mechanisms such as a waterproofing [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] or [[stomata]] that can help resist [[desiccation]].  Poikilohydry also occurs in many forms of [[alga]]e, which may be able to survive desiccation between successive high tides, or during occasional stranding due to the drying of a lake or pond.  Similarly, poikilohydry occurs in land plants which survive environmental conditions when water supplies are seasonal or intermittent, as in the liverwort genus ''[[Targionia (plant)|Targionia]]'', which lives in Mediterranean habitats with hot dry summers.

The term is derived from Ancient Greek ποικίλος (poikílos, “spotted or variegate”). The antonym of poikilohydry is [[homoiohydry]], a suite of morphological adaptations and strategies that enable plants to regulate or achieve homeostasis of cell and tissue water content. The [[vascular plants]] have largely lost the capacity to tolerate dehydration. Aside from most seeds and spores, only about 300 species of vascular plants are desiccation-tolerant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/5/788.full Desiccation Tolerance in Bryophytes: A Reflection of the Primitive Strategy for Plant Survival in Dehydrating Habitats?]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[resurrection plant]]s (such as ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'') and aerophytes (including some species of ''[[Tillandsia]]'').{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">'''Radio activated guard (RAG) boxes''' are experimental  [[pest control]] devices intended to deter [[wolf|wolves]] from preying on [[livestock]]. Specifically, they are designed to work against wolves which have been fitted with [[radio]] [[tracking collar]]s prior to being re-released into the wild (and, by extension, the packs of which they are members). The device was conceived by  Edward Cummings, a rancher from [[Montana]], who suggested that a hazing device could be tuned to a radio collar's frequency; after discussions with ranchers, the specifications of the device were designed and prototyped by Dr. John Shivik, then with the [[Wildlife Services|United States Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services]], National Wildlife Research Center.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marguerite, H.  2000.  Wolves at the door:  Can we learn to dance with wild things again?  Discover June, 2000  59-65&lt;/ref&gt;  Very few of the devices have been produced for commercial sale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed ||date=November 2018}} 

The RAG box is a "disruptive stimulus device."&lt;ref&gt;Shivik, J. A., and D. J. Martin.  2000.  Aversive and disruptive stimulus applications for managing predation.  Proceedings of the Ninth Eastern Wildlife Damage Management Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a [[strobe light]] and two [[loudspeakers]] which emit an annoying noise; these are activated when the box detects the signal from a radio collar at short range, and scare off the wolf pack.

The boxes were subjected to limited testing on wolves in [[Idaho]] and researchers concluded that they are effective for
protecting livestock in small pastures; the technology is thought to be limited, however, because of the complexity of the device and its price.&lt;ref&gt;Breck, S., R. Williamson, C. Niemeyer, and J. A. Shivik.  2003. Non-lethal radio activated guard for deterring wolf depredation in Idaho: summary and call for research.

'''Sarah Ann Featon''' (née '''Porter''', 1848 &amp;ndash; 28 April 1927) was an accomplished botanical artist from [[New Zealand]].

==Early life==
There are few records of Featon's early life. She was of English origin, the daughter of Henry William Porter. It is unclear when she arrived in New Zealand but she is recorded as having married Edward Featon at St Paul's, Auckland in 1870. In 1875 Featon and her husband moved to [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]], as Edward had been appointed as the area's first District Land Officer.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawson|first1=Bee|title=Lady painters : the flower painters of early New Zealand|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=Auckland, N.Z.|isbn=0670886513|pages=61–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published work==
During this time Featon and her husband began work on their seminal work ''The Art Album of New Zealand Flora''.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;  Featon painted the watercolours for the plates while her husband wrote the text.&lt;ref name="Auckland, 1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sampson|first1=F. Bruce|title=Early New Zealand botanical art|date=1985|publisher=Reed Methuen|location=Auckland|isbn=047400015X|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Featons set out to produce their album to debunk the widely held belief that there were no flowers in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;
 
Reverend [[William Colenso]], a prominent early settler and noted expert on botany, and Archdeacon (later Bishop) W. L . Williams were keen supporters of the book and supplied specimens to Featon to paint. Colenso named a newly discovered species, Dracophyllum featonium, in her honour. Unfortunately this species is now regarded as being synonymous with Dracophyllum strictum and therefore the compliment became redundant.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;

The album was the first full-colour art book to be published in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Auckland, 1985" /&gt; It contained systematic and popular descriptions of the native flowering plants of New Zealand and the adjacent islands. Featon created all of the artwork for the book and commissioned the [[chromolithography]] for the book plates from the workshop of Bock and Cousins, Wellington. The album was originally published in three parts, the first part being released in November 1887 and the next two in 1888. The three parts were issued as a single volume in 1889.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;

A copy of the book was presented by the New Zealand Government to [[Queen Victoria]] in 1897 on the occasion of her diamond jubilee. That copy is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="Auckland, 1985" /&gt;

==Later life==
Featon suffered financial hardship later in life and sold the original artwork for the book to the Dominion Museum - now the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] where they continue to be held.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt; She died in Gisborne on 28 April 1927, and was buried at Makaraka Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/CHP19270429.2.6 | title=Women's corner | date=29 April 1927 | work=The Press | accessdate=24 October 2016 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cemeterysearch.gdc.govt.nz/detail/MAKARAKA*3518 |title=Cemetery record search |date= |website= |publisher=Gisborne District Council |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''somatic marker hypothesis''', formulated by Alice, proposes that [[emotion]]al processes guide (or bias) [[behavior]], particularly decision-making.&lt;ref name=Damasio94&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio R. |last=Damasio |authorlink=Antonio Damasio |title=Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MRY3hmYc1W8C |origyear=1994 |year=2008 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-4070-7206-7 |ref=harv}} ''[[Descartes' Error]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DTD1991"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Damasio |first1=A.R. |last2=Tranel |first2=D. |last3=Damasio |first3=H.C. |chapter=Ch. 11: Somatic markers and the guidance of behaviour: theory and preliminary testing |editor1-first=Harvey S. |editor1-last=Levin |editor2-first=Howard M. |editor2-last=Eisenberg |editor3-first=Arthur Lester |editor3-last=Benton |title=Frontal Lobe Function and Dysfunction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b1htO0V0rwC&amp;pg=PA217 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-506284-7 |pages=217–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Somatic markers" are feelings in the body that are associated with emotions, such as the association of rapid heartbeat with [[anxiety]] or of [[nausea]] with [[disgust]]. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers strongly influence subsequent decision-making. Within the brain, somatic markers are thought to be processed in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex|ventromedial]] [[prefrontal cortex]] (VMPFC) and the [[amygdala]]. The hypothesis has been tested in experiments using the [[Iowa gambling task]].

==Background==
In [[economics|economic theory]], human decision-making is often modeled as being devoid of emotions, involving only logical reasoning based on [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit calculations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loewenstein | first1 = G. F. | last2 = Weber | first2 = E. U. | last3 = Hsee | first3 = C. K. | last4 = Welch | first4 = N. |title=Risk as feelings |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=267–86 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11316014 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/127/2/267 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.2.267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the somatic marker hypothesis proposes that emotions play a critical role in the ability to make fast, rational decisions in complex and uncertain situations.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt;

Patients with frontal lobe damage, such as [[Phineas Gage]], provided the first evidence that the frontal lobes were associated with decision-making. Frontal lobe damage, particularly to the [[Ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (vmPFC), results in impaired abilities to organize and plan behavior and learn from previous mistakes, without affecting intellect in terms of [[working memory]], [[attention]], and [[Sentence processing|language comprehension and expression]].&lt;ref name=Damasio1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Damasio|first=A.|title=Somatic Markers and the Guidance of Behavior|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=217–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tranel1994&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tranel | first = D. |title="Acquired sociopathy": the development of sociopathic behavior following focal brain damage |journal=Prog Exp Pers Psychopathol Res |volume= |issue= |pages=285–311 |date=1994 |pmid=8044207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

vmPFC patients also have difficulty expressing and experiencing appropriate emotions. This led Antonio Damasio to hypothesize that decision-making deficits following vmPFC damage result from the inability to use emotions to help guide future behavior based on past experiences. Consequently, vmPFC damage forces those afflicted to rely on slow and laborious cost-benefit analyses for every given choice situation.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bechara|first=A.|last2=Damasio |first2=A.R.|title=The somatic marker hypothesis: A neural theory of economic decision|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|year=2005|volume=52|pages=336–372|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2004.06.010|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis==
When individuals [[decision-making|make decisions]], they must assess the [[incentive]] value of the choices available to them, using [[cognitive]] and emotional processes. When the individuals face complex and conflicting choices, they may be unable to decide using only cognitive processes, which may become overloaded. Emotions, consequently, are hypothesized to guide decision-making.

Emotions, as defined by Damasio, are changes in both body and brain states in response to stimuli.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; Physiological changes (such as [[muscle tone]], [[heart rate]], [[endocrine system|endocrine activity]], [[posture (psychology)|posture]], [[facial expression]], and so forth) occur in the body and are relayed to the brain where they are transformed into an emotion that tells the individual something about the stimulus that they have encountered. Over time, emotions and their corresponding bodily changes, which are called "somatic markers", become associated with particular situations and their past outcomes.

When making subsequent decisions, these somatic markers and their evoked emotions are consciously or unconsciously associated with their past outcomes, and influence decision-making in favor of some behaviors instead of others.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; For instance, when a somatic marker associated with a positive outcome is perceived, the person may feel happy and thereby motivated to pursue that behavior. When a somatic marker associated with the negative outcome is perceived, the person may feel sad, which acts as an internal alarm to warn the individual to avoid that course of action. These situation-specific somatic states based on, and reinforced by, past experiences help to guide behavior in favor of more advantageous choices, and therefore are adaptive.

According to the hypothesis, two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses. In the first pathway, emotion can be evoked by changes in the body that are projected to the brain – called the "body loop". For instance, encountering a feared object like a snake may initiate the [[fight-or-flight]] response and cause fear. In the second pathway, cognitive representations of the emotions (imagining an unpleasant situation "as-if" you were in that particular situation) can be activated in the brain without being directly elicited by a sensory stimulus – called the "[[as-if body loop]]". Thus, the brain can anticipate expected bodily changes, which allows the individual to respond faster to external stimuli without waiting for an event to actually occur.&lt;ref name=Damasio1991 /&gt; The amygdala and VMPFC (a subsection of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex or OMPFC) are essential components of this hypothesized mechanism, and therefore damage to either structure will disrupt decision-making.

==Experimental evidence==
{{Main article|Iowa gambling task}}
In an effort to produce a simple [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] tool that would assess deficits in emotional processing, decision-making, and [[social skills]] of OMPFC-[[lesion]]ed individuals, Bechara and collaborators created the [[Iowa gambling task]].&lt;ref name="DTD1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bechara1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bechara | first1 = A. | first2 = A. R. |last2=Damasio | first3 = H. |last3=Damasio | first4 = S. W. |last4=Anderson |title=Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex |journal=Cognition |volume=50 |issue=1–3 |pages=7–15 |date=1994 |pmid=8039375 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90018-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The task measures a form of emotion-based learning. Studies using the gambling task have found deficits in various neurological (such as [[amygdala]] and OMPFC lesions) and psychiatric populations (such as [[schizophrenia]], [[mania]], and [[drug abuse]]rs).

The Iowa gambling task is a computerized test in which participants are presented with four decks of cards from which they repeatedly choose. Each deck contains various amounts of rewards of either $50 or $100, and occasional losses that are greater in the decks with higher rewards. The participants do not know where the penalty cards are located, and are told to pick cards that will maximize their winnings. The most profitable strategy turns out to be to choose cards only from the small reward/small penalty decks, because although the reward is smaller, the penalty is proportionally much smaller than in the high reward/high penalty decks. Over the course of a session, most healthy participants come to adopt the profitable low-penalty deck strategy. Participants with brain damage, however, are unable to determine the better deck to choose from, and continue to choose from the high reward/high penalty decks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dezfouli | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Keramati | first2 = M. M. | last3 = Ekhtiari | first3 = H. | last4 = Safaei | first4 = H. | last5 = Lucas | first5 = C. |chapter=Understanding Addictive Behavior on the Iowa gambling task Using Reinforcement Learning Framework |chapterurl=http://amir.dezfouli.com/pubs/dkesl_cogsci_2008.pdf |title=Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society |date=2008 |pages=1094–9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Iowa gambling task measures participants' quickness in "developing anticipatory emotional responses to guide advantageous choices",&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"/&gt; it is helpful in testing the somatic marker hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers give rise to anticipation of the emotional consequences of a decision being made. Consequently, persons who perform well on the task are thought to be aware of the penalty cards and of the negative emotions associated with drawing such cards, and to realize which deck is less likely to yield a penalty.&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wardle | first1 = M. C. | last2 = Gonzalez | first2 = R. | last3 = Bechara | first3 = A. | last4 = Martin-Thormeyer | first4 = E. M. |title=Iowa gambling task performance and emotional distress interact to predict risky sexual behavior in individuals with dual substance and HIV diagnoses |journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=1110–21 |date=December 2010 |pmid=20480423 |pmc=3639122 |doi=10.1080/13803391003757833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This experiment has been used to analyze the impairments suffered by people with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which has been known to affect neural signaling of prospective rewards or punishments. Such persons perform less well on the task.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has been used to analyze the brain during the Iowa gambling task. The brain regions that were activated during the Iowa gambling task were also the ones hypothesized to be triggered by somatic markers during decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X. | last2 = Lu | first2 = Z. L. | last3 = D'Argembeau | first3 = A. | last4 = Ng | first4 = M. | last5 = Bechara | first5 = A. |title=The Iowa gambling task in fMRI images |journal=Hum Brain Mapp |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=410–23 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19777556 |pmc=2826566 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary significance==
Damasio has posited that the ability of humans to perform abstract thinking quickly and efficiently coincides with both the development of the ventromedial (VM) cortex and with the use of somatic markers to guide human behavior during evolution.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005 /&gt; Patients with damage to the VM cortices are more likely to engage in behaviors that negatively impact personal relationships in the distant future, but they never engage in actions that would lead to immediate harm to themselves or others.&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt; The evolution of the prefrontal cortex was associated with the ability to represent events that may occur in the future.&lt;ref name=Bechara2005 /&gt;

==Application to risky behavior==
The somatic marker hypothesis has been applied to trying to understand risky behaviors, such as [[risky sexual behavior]] and drug addiction.

According to the hypothesis, riskier sexual behaviors are more exhilarating and pleasurable, and therefore they are more likely to stimulate repetitive engagement in such behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = M. | last2 = Kuhlman | first2 = D. M. |title=Personality and risk-taking: common biosocial factors |journal=J Pers |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=999–1029 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11130742 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0022-3506&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=68&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=999 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this idea was tested in individuals who were infected with [[HIV]] and were [[Substance dependence|substance dependent]], differences were found between persons who scored well in the Iowa gambling test, and those who scored poorly. The high scorers showed a correlation between the amount of distress they reported having over their HIV status, and their acceptance of risk during sexual behavior – the greater the distress, the greater the risk that these people would take. The low scorers, on the other hand, showed no such correlation. These results were interpreted as indicating that persons with intact decision-making abilities are better able to rely on past emotional experiences when weighing risks, than are persons who are deficient in such abilities, and that acceptance of risk serves to ameliorate emotional distress.&lt;ref name="Wardle 2010"/&gt;

Drug abusers are thought to ignore the negative consequences of addiction while seeking drugs. According to the somatic marker hypothesis, such abusers are impaired in their ability to recall and consider past unpleasant experiences when weighing whether to consider drug seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="Bechara, A. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bechara | first = A. |title=Risky business: emotion, decision-making, and addiction |journal=J Gambl Stud |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=23–51 | date = 2003 |pmid=12635539 |doi=10.1023/A:1021223113233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verdejo-Garcia A 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verdejo-García | first1 = A. | last2 = Bechara | first2 = A. | last3 = Recknor | first3 = E.

In response to unpleasant images, drug users showed decreased levels of several neuroendocrine markers, including [[norepinephrine]], [[cortisol]], and [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]. Addicts showed lesser responses to both pleasant and unpleasant images, suggesting that they may have a diminished emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerra | first1 = G. | last2 = Baldaro | first2 = B. | last3 = Zaimovic | first3 = A. |title=Neuroendocrine responses to experimentally-induced emotions among abstinent opioid-dependent subjects |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12821203 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871603000656 |doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(03)00065-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroimaging]] studies utilizing fMRI indicate that drug-related stimuli have the ability to activate brain regions involved in emotional evaluation and reward processing. When shown a film of people smoking [[cocaine]], cocaine users showed greater activation of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], the right inferior [[parietal lobe]], and the [[caudate nucleus]] than did non-users. Conversely, the cocaine users showed lesser activation when viewing a sex film than did non-users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garavan | first1 = H. | last2 = Pankiewicz | first2 = J. | last3 = Bloom | first3 = A. |title=Cue-induced cocaine craving: neuroanatomical specificity for drug users and drug stimuli |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=157 |issue=11 |pages=1789–98 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11058476 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=157&amp;page=1789 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.157.11.1789 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
{{see also|Reward system}}
Some researchers believe that the use of somatic markers (i.e., [[afferent nerve|afferent feedback]]) would be a very inefficient method of influencing behavior. Damasio's notion of the ''as-if'' experience dependent feedback route,&lt;ref name=Damasio94/&gt;&lt;ref name="Damasio1999"&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio R. |last=Damasio |title=The Feeling of what Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making of Consciousness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usiJxdb897YC |year=2000 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-09-928876-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby bodily responses are re-represented utilizing the somatosensory cortex ([[postcentral gyrus]]), also proposes an inefficient method of affecting explicit behavior.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rolls |first=E.T. |title=The brain and emotion |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford | date = 1999 |isbn=978-0-19-852464-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolls (1999) stated that; "it would be very inefficient and noisy to place in the execution route a peripheral response, and transducers to attempt to measure that peripheral response, itself a notoriously difficult procedure" (p.&amp;nbsp;73).&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt; Reinforcement association located in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, where the incentive value of stimuli is decoded, is sufficient to elicit emotion-based learning and to affect behavior via, for example, the orbitofrontal-striatal pathway.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolls1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rolls | first = E. T. |title=Consciousness in Neural Networks? |journal=Neural Netw |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1227–40 |date=October 1997 |pmid=12662513 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0893-6080(97)00049-X |doi=10.1016/S0893-6080(97)00049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can occur via implicit or explicit processes.&lt;ref name="Rolls1999"/&gt;

The somatic marker hypothesis represents a model of how feedback from the body may contribute to both advantageous and disadvantageous decision-making in situations of complexity and uncertainty. Much of its supporting data comes from data taken from the Iowa gambling task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bechara | first1 = A. | last2 = Tranel | first2 = D. | last3 = Damasio | first3 = H. | last4 = Damasio | first4 = A. R. |title=Failure to respond autonomically to anticipated future outcomes following damage to prefrontal cortex |journal=Cereb.

First, the claim that it assesses implicit learning as the reward/punishment design is inconsistent with data showing accurate knowledge of the task possibilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maia | first1 = T. V. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = J. L. |title=A reexamination of the evidence for the somatic marker hypothesis: what participants really know in the Iowa gambling task |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=45 |pages=16075–80 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15501919 |pmc=528759 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406666101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that mechanisms such as working-memory appear to have a strong influence. Second, the claim that this knowledge occurs through preventive marker signals is not supported by competing explanations of the psychophysiology generated profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomb | first1 = I. | last2 = Hauser | first2 = M. | last3 = Deldin | first3 = P. | last4 = Caramazza | first4 = A. |title=Do somatic markers mediate decisions on the gambling task? |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=1103–4; author reply 1104 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12403997 |doi=10.1038/nn1102-1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the claim that the impairment is due to a 'myopia for the future' is undermined by more plausible psychological mechanisms explaining deficits on the tasks such as reversal learning, risk-taking, and working-memory deficits. There may also be more variability in control performance than previously thought, thus complicating the interpretation of the findings. 

Furthermore, although the somatic marker hypothesis has accurately identified many of the brain regions involved in decision-making, emotion, and body-state representation, it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. There are many experiments that could be implemented to further test the somatic marker hypothesis. One way would be to develop variants of the Iowa gambling task that control some of the methodological issues and interpretation ambiguities generated. It may be a good idea to include removing the reversal learning confound, which would make the task more difficult to consciously comprehend. Additionally, causal tests of the somatic marker hypothesis could be practiced more insistently in a greater range of populations with altered peripheral feedback, like on patients with facial paralysis. 

In conclusion, the somatic marker hypothesis needs to be tested in more experiments. Until a wider range of empirical approaches are employed in order to test the somatic marker hypothesis, it appears that the framework is simply an intriguing idea that is in need of some better supporting evidence. Despite these issues, the somatic marker hypothesis and the Iowa gambling task reestablish the notion that emotion has the potential to be a benefit as well as a problem during the decision-making process in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunn | first1 = B.

This '''timeline of egg fossils research''' is a chronologically ordered list of important discoveries, controversies of interpretation, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revisions, and cultural portrayals of [[egg fossils]]. Humans have encountered egg fossils for thousands of years. In [[stone age]] [[Mongolia]], local peoples fashioned fossil [[dinosaur]] eggshell into jewelry. In [[the Americas]], fossil eggs may have inspired [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[creation myths]] about the human theft of a primordial water monster's egg. Nevertheless, the [[scientific]] study of fossil eggs began much later. As reptiles, dinosaurs were presumed to have laid eggs from the 1820s on, when their first scientifically documented remains were being described in England.&lt;ref name="enbd-first-1" /&gt; In 1859, the first scientifically documented dinosaur ''egg'' fossils were discovered in southern France by a Catholic [[Catholic priest|priest]] and amateur naturalist named Father [[Jean-Jacques Poech]], however he thought they were laid by giant birds.

The first scientifically recognized dinosaur egg fossils were discovered [[serendipitously]] in 1923 by an [[American Museum of Natural History]] crew while looking for evidence of [[early humans]] in Mongolia. These eggs were mistakenly attributed to the locally abundant herbivore ''[[Protoceratops]]'', but are now known to be ''[[Oviraptor]]'' eggs. Egg discoveries continued to mount all over the world, leading to the development of multiple competing classification schemes. In 1975 Chinese paleontologist [[Zhao Zi-Kui]] started a revolution in fossil egg classification by developing a system of "[[parataxonomy]]" based on the traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] system to classify eggs based on their physical qualities rather than their hypothesized mothers. Zhao's new method of egg classification was hindered from adoption by Western scientists due to language barriers. However, in the early 1990s Russian paleontologist [[Konstantin Mikhailov]] brought attention to Zhao's work in the English language [[scientific literature]].

* A common theme in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] stories about Water Monsters involve the human theft of Water Monster eggs or young and the angry Monsters pursuing humanity through a series of worlds.&lt;ref name="mayor-egg-128" /&gt; Stories like this influenced the Navajos to fear large fossil bones, which they felt shouldn't be disturbed, because doing so might awaken the enraged ghosts of the Water Monsters, who might resume their rampage with [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] results.&lt;ref name="mayor-egg-129" /&gt; Stories like this may have been based on the discovery of fossil eggs in western North America. Fossil eggs and nests from this region that may have inspired the legend were left behind by creatures like possible [[aetosaurs]], giant [[condors]], [[duck-billed dinosaurs]], possible [[phytosaurs]], large [[theropods]], and [[sea turtles]].&lt;ref name="mayor-egg-129-130" /&gt;

* The first scientifically documented dinosaur egg fossils were discovered in southern France by a Catholic [[Catholic priest|priest]] and amateur naturalist named Father [[Jean-Jacques Pouech]].&lt;ref name="enbd-first-5" /&gt; These fossils were large chunks of eggshell that date back to the [[Late Cretaceous]].&lt;ref name="enbd-first-4" /&gt; Poech mistook them for the shell of a giant bird's eggs.&lt;ref name="enbd-first-5" /&gt;

'''[[1869 in paleontology|1869]]'''{{anchor|1869}}
* French geologist [[Phillippe Matheron]] made a fossil discovery in the same general region as Poech. Matheron discovered the fossil bones of an animal he named ''[[Hypselosaurus]]''. Matheron thought Hypselosaurus to be a [[crocodile]]-like animal,&lt;ref name="enbd-first-6" /&gt; but it is now recognized as a long-necked herbivorous [[sauropod]] dinosaur.&lt;ref name="enbd-reason3-253" /&gt; Eggshell fossils were found associated with the remains. Matheron presented the shell fossils to the director of [[comparative anatomy]] at Paris' [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], [[Paul Gervais]].&lt;ref name="enbd-first-6" /&gt; Gervais examined thin sections of the shell fossils and compared them with similar thin sections of eggs laid by modern birds and reptiles. He found them to be most similar to turtle eggs, but recognized that since dinosaur eggs had not yet been described scientifically, he could not rule out that possibility.&lt;ref name="enbd-first-6-7" /&gt;

* Paleontologist U. Lehman made the first plausible report of ammonite egg fossils in the scientific literature. The apparent clutch of eggs was preserved in the sediment that filled in the living chamber of a [[harboceratid]] dating back to the [[Toarcian]] age of the [[Jurassic]] period. The fossil itself was discovered in a concretion incorporated into glacial drift that came from the [[Baltic region]].

* German paleontologist [[H. Erben]] was the first to use scanning electron miscroscopy to study dinosaur eggshell. The level of detail was so much higher than that seen through light microscopy that Erben referred to what he saw as the egg's "ultrastructure".&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-125" /&gt;
* [[Folinsbee]] and his colleagues became one of the first research teams to study dinosaur eggs using [[mass spectrometry]]. They found that the eggshell of fossil eggs they attributed to the dinosaur ''[[Protoceratops]]'' (actually ''[[Oviraptor]]'') had more [[delta Oxygen 18]] compared to [[delta Oxygen 16]] in the calcium carbonate of their shell. This implies that the mother's drinking water had a higher percentage of the heavier oxygen in its water molecules due to evaporation, which meant the environment was hot.&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-131" /&gt;

They also found that the carbon in the eggshell is mostly the heavier [[Carbon 13]] rather than the lighter[[Carbon 12]]. This means the dinosaur were primarily feeding on [[C3 plants]] which use 3 carbon atoms in their [[photosynthesis]] products rather than [[C4 plants]] that use four.&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-132" /&gt;

* Chinese paleontologist Zhao Zhi-Kui began developing the "parataxonomy" that serves as the basis for the scientific classification of fossil eggs.&lt;ref name="enbd-classification-148-149" /&gt;

'''[[1978 in paleontology|1978]]'''{{anchor|1978}}
* Paleontologist [[William A. Clemens, Jr.|Bill Clemens]] alerted [[John R. Horner|Jack Horner]] and [[Bob Makela]] to the presence of unidentified dinosaur fossils in [[Bynum, Montana|Bynum]], [[Paleontology in Montana|Montana]]. Horner visited the town and recognized the remains as belonging to a [[Hadrosaur|duck-billed dinosaur]]. While in town the owner of a local rock shop, Marion Brandvold, showed him some tiny bones. Horner identified them as baby duck-bill bones. Horner also knew that this was an important find and convinced Brandvold to let him study her fossils at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name="bigsky-history-56" /&gt; The fossil embryos were returned to Bynum a few years ago and are now on display at the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center.

'''[[1979 in paleontology|1979]]'''{{anchor|1979}}
* Karl Hirsch disputed Romer and Price's claim to have discovered a Permian hard-shelled egg, since the fossil in question didn't show evidence for the [[calcite]] that should have composed the shell. Hirsch found enough [[phosphorus]] in the object's outer layer to propose that the fossil was actually an egg, with a leathery shell.&lt;ref name="enbd-evolution-43" /&gt;
* Erben and others found isotope ratios of [[Carbon]] and [[Oxygen]] in French dinosaur eggs similar to those found in Mongolian dinosaur eggs by Folinsbee and others in 1970. The ratios are indicative of a diet of C3 plants and hot living conditions.&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-132" /&gt;

'''[[1991 in paleontology|1991]]'''{{anchor|1991}}
* [[Jim Haywood]] and others were studying the nests of ground-nesting [[gulls]] buried by the [[Mount St. Helens eruption]]. They found that the [[volcanic ash]] was acidic enough to dissolve most of the eggshell in only two years.&lt;ref name="enbd-fossilize-112" /&gt;
* Sarkar found isotope ratios of [[Carbon]] and [[Oxygen]] in Indian dinosaur eggs similar to those found in Mongolian dinosaur eggs by Folinsbee and others in 1970. The ratios are indicative of a diet of C3 plants and hot living conditions.&lt;ref name="enbd-tools-132" /&gt;

'''Early to mid-1990s'''
* Russian paleontologist [[Konstantin Mikhailov]] brought attention to Zhao's classification system for egg fossil in the English language [[scientific literature]].&lt;ref name="enbd-classification-149" /&gt;

==21st-century paleontology==
[[File:Ammonoidea - Pectinatites pectinatus.jpg|thumb|75px|right|''[[Pectinatites]]''.]]
'''[[2009 in paleontology|2009]]'''{{anchor|2009}}
* [[Steve Etches]], [[Jane Clarke (scientist)|Jane Clarke]], and [[John Callomon]] reported the discovery of eight clusters of [[ammonite]] eggs in the Lower and Upper [[Kimmeridge Clay]] of the [[Dorset|Dorset Coast]] in England. The eggs are subspherical to spherical in shape. Some are isolated but some were also found in association with the shells of [[perisphinctid]] ammonites. They were interpreted by the researchers as ammonite eggs sacks and are the best preserved specimens of such known to science. The parents of the egg sacks are thought to be two local ammonite genera co-occurring with the eggs, ''[[Aulacostephanus]]'' and ''[[Pectinatites]]''.&lt;ref name="kim-am-eggs-abs-204" /&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{Further information|Eastern philosophy and clinical psychology}}

* c. 1550 BCE – Ancient Egyptians codified their knowledge of psychiatry, medicine, and surgery in the [[Ebers Papyrus]] and the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]]. The former mentioned [[dementia]] and depression, while the latter gave detailed instructions for various neurosurgical procedures. The power of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] ([[suggestion]]) was recognized as complementary to medicine.
* c. 500 BCE – [[Siddhartha Gautama]] (Lumbini, Nepal) founded the psychotherapeutic practices of [[Buddhism]] on the principle that the origin of mental suffering is ignorance, that the symptoms of ignorance are attachment and craving, and that attachment and craving can be ended by following the [[Eightfold Path]].
* c. 400 BCE – [[Hippocrates]] (Kos, Greece) taught that [[melancholia]] (depression) has a biological cause, namely an excess of black bile, one of the [[four humours]]. Ancient Greek therapy for disorders of mood involved adjustment of the humours, to bring them into balance.

[[Image:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]

'''Transportation engineering''' or '''transport engineering''' is the application of technology and [[scientific principle]]s to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods ([[transport]]) {{citation needed|reason=What is the source of this very specific definition|date=February 2016}}.  It is a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]].&lt;ref name="Institute of Transportation Engineering"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ite.org/career/index.asp|title=ITE – The Transportation Profession|work=ITE|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of transportation engineering within the civil engineering profession can be judged by the number of divisions in [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] (American Society of Civil Engineers) that are directly related to transportation. There are six such divisions (Aerospace; Air Transportation; Highway; Pipeline; Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean; and Urban Transportation) representing one-third of the total 18 technical divisions within the ASCE (1987).&lt;ref name="American Society of Civil Engineers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/ProgramProductLine.aspx?id=2147485055|title=ASCE – About Civil Engineering|work=ASCE|accessdate=2010-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702022026/http://www.asce.org/ProgramProductLine.aspx?id=2147485055|archivedate=2 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of [[urban planning]], and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors.  Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of [[trip generation]] (how many trips for what purpose), [[trip distribution]] (destination choice, where is the traveler going), [[mode choice]] (what [[mode of transport|mode]] is being taken), and [[route assignment]] (which streets or routes are being used).  More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as [[land use forecasting]]). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system.

A review of descriptions of the scope of various committees indicates that while facility planning and design continue to be the core of the transportation engineering field, such areas as operations planning, logistics, network analysis, financing, and policy analysis are also important to civil engineers, particularly to those working in highway and urban transportation. The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) list online the safety protocols, geometric design requirements, and signal timing.

Transportation engineering, as practiced by civil engineers, primarily involves planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities. The facilities support air, highway, railroad, pipeline, water, and even space transportation.&lt;ref name="Institute of Transportation Engineering"/&gt; The design aspects of transportation engineering include the sizing of transportation facilities (how many lanes or how much capacity the facility has), determining the materials and thickness used in [[Pavement (roads)|pavement]] designing the geometry (vertical and horizontal alignment) of the roadway (or track).

Before any planning occurs the Engineer must take what is known as an inventory of the area or if it is appropriate, the previous system in place. This inventory or database must include information on (1)population, (2)land use, (3)economic activity, (4)transportation facilities and services, (5)travel patterns and volumes, (6)laws and ordinances, (7)regional financial resources, (8)community values and expectations. These inventories help the engineer create business models to complete accurate forecasts of the future conditions of the system[[Review]].

Operations and management involve [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], so that vehicles move smoothly on the road or track.  Older techniques include [[Traffic sign|sign]]s, [[Traffic light|signals]], [[Road surface marking|marking]]s, and [[Toll road|toll]]ing.  Newer technologies involve [[intelligent transportation systems]], including advanced traveler information systems (such as [[variable message signs]]), advanced traffic control systems (such as [[ramp meter]]s), and [[vehicle infrastructure integration]]. [[Human factors]] are an aspect of transportation engineering, particularly concerning driver-vehicle interface and user interface of road signs, signals, and markings.

==Highway engineering==
{{Main article|Highway engineering}}
Engineers in this specialization:
*Handle the planning, design, construction, and operation of highways, roads, and other vehicular facilities as well as their related bicycle and pedestrian realms.
*Estimate the transportation needs of the public and then secure the funding for the project.
*Analyze locations of high traffic volumes and high collisions for safety and capacity.
*Use [[civil engineering]] principles to improve the transportation system.
*Utilizes the three design controls which are the drivers, the vehicles, and the roadways themselves.

==Railroad engineering==
{{main article|Railway systems engineering}}
Railway engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of railroads and mass transit systems that use a fixed guideway (such as [[light rail]] or even [[monorails]]).  Typical tasks would include determining horizontal and vertical alignment design, station location and design, and construction cost estimating.  Railroad engineers can also move into the specialized field of train dispatching which focuses on train movement control.

Railway engineers also work to build a cleaner and safer transportation network by reinvesting and revitalizing the rail system to meet future demands.  In the United States, railway engineers work with elected officials in Washington, D.C. on rail transportation issues to make sure that the rail system meets the country's transportation needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.org/AAR/About-Us.aspx|title=Association of American Railroads|work=AAR|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Port and harbor engineering==
{{Distinguish|Naval architecture|marine engineering}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}
Port and harbor engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of ports, harbors, canals, and other maritime facilities.

==Airport engineering==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Airport engineers design and construct airports.  Airport engineers must account for the impacts and demands of aircraft in their design of airport facilities. These engineers must use the analysis of predominant wind direction to determine runway orientation, determine the size of runway border and safety areas, different wing tip to wing tip clearances for all gates and must designate the clear zones in the entire port.

'''William Stephen Finsen''' (28 July 1905 &amp;ndash; 16 May 1979) was a [[South Africa]]n astronomer.

He discovered a number of [[double star]]s and took many photographs of [[Mars]]. He developed the Finsen [[eyepiece interferometer]] to measure very close double stars. He was the final director of [[Union Observatory]] in South Africa from 1957 until it closed in 1965 (it was renamed [[Republic Observatory]] in 1961); he had started there 55 years previous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58459.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[asteroid]] [[1794 Finsen]] is named after him, as is the geological feature [[Finsen Dorsum]] on the asteroid [[433 Eros]].

The '''World Data Centre''' (WDC) system was created to archive and distribute data collected from the observational programmes of the 1957-1958 [[International Geophysical Year]] by the International Council of Science ([[ICSU]]). The WDCs were funded and maintained by their host countries on behalf of the international science community.

Originally established in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], [[Soviet Union]], and [[Japan]], the WDC system expanded to other countries and to new scientific disciplines. The WDC system included up to 52 Centres in 12 countries. All data held in WDCs were available for the cost of copying and sending the requested information.

At the end of 2008, following the ICSU General Assembly in Maputo (Mozambique), the World Data Centres were reformed and a new ICSU [[World Data System]] (WDS) established in 2009 building on the 50-year legacy of the ICSU World Data Centre system (WDC) and the ICSU Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical data-analysis Services.
