'''{{'}}Abd ar-Rahman''', '''Abdurrahman''' or '''Darman''' was ''Shehu'' of [[Kanem-Bornu empire|Borno]] from 1853 to 1854.

==Reign of 'Abd ar-Rahman==
With the help of some courtiers of [[Kukawa]], 'Abd ar-Rahman deposed his brother [[Umar of Borno|Umar]] in November 1853 and became ''Shehu'' of Borno. He was considered too violent and tyrannical by his followers which explains why he only reigned for ten months before his brother reconquered his throne in September 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Brenner, ''The Shehus of Kukawa: A History of the Al-Kanemi Dynasty of Bornu'', Oxford Studies in African Affairs (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1973), pp.74-80.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then executed, most probably in December 1854.

=='Abd ar-Rahman as seen by Heinrich Barth==
In 1851, a British expedition led by [[Heinrich Barth]] arrived in Borno. For Barth,''''Abd ar-Rahman''' was a

{{quote|good soldier but a man of very loose and violent character. When a youth he had committed all sorts of violence and injustice, carrying off young brides by force to indulge his passions; he was besides, a man of little intelligence. Being but a few months younger than Omar, he thought himself equally entitled to the succession; and if once admitted into a high position in the empire, he might be expected to abuse his influence on the very first opportunity|[[Heinrich Barth]]&lt;ref name=Barth&gt;Heinrich Barth,[https://books.google.com/books?id=W8ByAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Travels and Discoveries in North and Central Africa''] (London: Longman, 1857), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Incident==
48 students&lt;ref name="deccan-journal1"/&gt; and 3 faculty/staff members of the [[VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology|V.N.R. Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology]] ([[Hyderabad]]) were on an Educational/Industrial Tour from [[Shimla]] to [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]], about 200 kilometres (130 miles) from [[Himachal Pradesh]] capital [[Shimla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-tragedy-hc-calls-its-grave-negligence-search-for-missing-students-continue/article1-1227888.aspx |title=Beas river tragedy: HC calls its 'grave negligence', seeks status report; search continues |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=9 June 2014|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were getting themselves photographed on the banks of the [[Beas river]] on the Mandi-Manali National Highway NH-21, when they were washed away as the water flow in the river suddenly increased. The surge of water occurred when the Larji hydroelectric power project opened its floodgates, sending tonnes of water downstream.

The dam water was released suddenly by the dam authorities without prior notice. Two students [https://www.facebook.com/Ramantejav Raman Teja Venigalla]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/X8NaZmnppusJGEr6CgNk0K/When-India-lost-its-student-engineers-on-sand-mafia-path-to.html|title=When India lost its student engineers on sand mafia path to Beas river|last=&amp;|first=Tom Lasseter|date=2014-12-17|newspaper=livemint.com/|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-17/indian-college-kids-a-sand-mafia-path-a-river-of-death.html|title=Inside India's Deadly Sand Mafia|last=Lasseter|first=Tom|last2=Speed|first2=Rakteem Katakey 2014-12-17T01:30:00Z- Comments Email Print|newspaper=Bloomberg|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Biswas Nandamuri were alarmed when men on the shore collecting sand began to point and yell "Dam"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; just a few seconds before the water gushed in.

Footage surfaced on the internet two days after the incident which showed how the victims were caught unaware before the river carried them away. The video was shot by Bihari Lal, who was present about 100 metres above the river bed on a hilly area where a wedding was being held .&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web|title=Video of Beas River Tragedy goes Viral on Internet|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/06/video-of-beas-river-tragedy-goes-viral-on-internet/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported by the surviving students that Kiran Kumar Muppidi had saved 5 fellow students before he slipped away. Devasish Bose was seen fighting hard to save one of the fellow students before he went missing. According to first hand witness the unofficial tour guide had jumped into the current to save some students.

==Rescue==
Authorities deployed over 550 rescue team members including divers from [[National Disaster Response Force|NDRF]], [[Sashastra Seema Bal]] (SSB), and Indo-Tibetan Border Police [[ITBP]], Indian Army, Indian Navy, the Paramilitary, the local firemen and policemen, and a private team of swimmers and divers trained by the Additional DGP of Police (Sports) in Telangana, Mr. Rajeev Trivedi. [[UAV]]s, multi-beam [[sonar]], and [[lidar]] were also deployed to trace missing students along the 15&amp;nbsp;km stretch from Larji Dam to Pandoh Dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vyas River tragedy: Water level lowered, but no bodies found|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/06/vyas-river-tragedy-water-level-lowered-but-no-bodies-found/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning 16 June, the parents of the students who were camping in Himachal Pradesh started leaving for their native places.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents asked to return back|url=http://deccan-journal.com/content/beas-tragedy-parents-asked-return-home|work=Deccan-Journal|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government response==

===Probe===
A case has been registered against officials of the Larji Hydroelectric Project and College for causing the death of 24 engineering students through negligence. The case was registered after eyewitnesses claimed that the hooter was not sounded before the flow of water into the river was increased.&lt;ref name="video" /&gt;

An initial probe suggested that Larji power project was asked to reduce generation on the day of the tragedy but that plant officials  instead shut it down. As a result of this, the water that had built up in its reservoir needed to be released, leading to a sudden surge in the Beas river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Corruption and Mismanagement caused Beas River Tragedy?|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/06/how-corruption-and-mismanagement-caused-beas-river-tragedy/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported by some news agencies that the Larji hydroelectric power project has been involved with local sand mafia and this was what made the officials open the gates without proper control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The New York Times Blames 'Sand Mafia' for Beas Tragedy|url = http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/the-new-york-times-blames-sand-mafia-for-beas-tragedy-583075|website = NDTV.com|accessdate = 2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
The Himachal High Court awarded compensation of 20 Lakh rupees to parents of students which will be shared in a ratio  of 60:30:10 by the Electricity Board, the College and the State of Himachal Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;https://factly.in/himachal-pradesh-tragedy-college-students-compenstation-20-lakh-rupees-to-parents-beas-river/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===
Macklovitch was born to Moroccan Jewish Mother and Russian Jewish father in [[Montréal, Quebec]]. When he was 18 years old, his mother took him and his brother back to Morocco to connect with their roots. His older brother, David Macklovitch, is one-half of the electro-funk duo [[Chromeo]].

'''Abibus of Nekressi''' ({{lang-ka|აბიბოს ნეკრესელი|tr}}) (fl. 6th century) was one of the [[Thirteen Assyrian Fathers|thirteen Assyrian apostles]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[bishop]] of [[Nekresi]] who arrived in Georgia under the leadership of [[Thirteen Assyrian Fathers|St. Ioane of Zedazeni]] (John of Zedazeni). He began his activity as bishop in a village which was located in the hills in the eastern region of [[Kakheti]].
According to the chronicle Life of Kartli, he was spreading Christianity not only among Georgians but also among the mountain tribes such as the Dagestani/Didoians, the ancient predecessors of modern [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name="pravo"&gt;[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/7366.html/ Holy Martyr Abibos of Nekresi (6th Century)] Retrieved on 21 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time there was a dark period of [[Sasanian Empire|Persian rule]] in eastern Georgia. The main religion of Persians was [[Zoroastrianism]] - worship of fire. St. Abibos is said to have doused a sacred Zoroastrian flame with water. He was captured by the pagan priests, was tied up and beaten before be brought to the [[marzban]]. [[Simeon the Stylite]] of the Wonderful Mountain sent him  a letter, an [[eulogia]] (probably a piece of prosphoron) and a staff to strengthen his soul. He was stoned to death by [[Zoroastrian]] [[Persian people|Persians]] at [[Rekhi]] and his body was dragged from the city and cast to the beasts.&lt;ref name="pravo"/&gt;

In spite of the stringent prohibition to take his body the priests and monks of Rekhi stole it. They buried it with great honor at [[Samtavisi Cathedral|Samtavisi Monastery]] (located midway between [[Mtskheta]] and [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]). During the rule of [[Stephen III of Iberia|Prince Stepanoz]] of [[Kartli]], the relics of St. Abibos were relocated from [[Samtavisi Cathedral|Samtavisi]] to [[Samtavro Monastery]] in Mtskheta. They were buried under the holy altar at [[Samtavro Monastery|Samtavro Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelgeorgia.ru/325/ About Sights – Nekresi Monastery] Retrieved on 21 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[feast day]] had been kept on November 12 through 1700, but later changed to December 12 on the Gregorian calendar and November 29 on the Julian calendar correspondingly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="897">'''Agnes II de Dammartin''' (fl. 1507), was a German-Roman monarch as [[Abbess of Remiremont|Princess Abbess]] of the Imperial [[Remiremont Abbey]] in France. She was abbess from 1505 until 1507.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1500.htm|title=Women in power 1500-1540|website=www.guide2womenleaders.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

During her tenure, the discipline was described as lax. The nuns of the chapter had declared themselves canonesses without the consent of the pope, admitted only novices who could give proof of noble descent, and did not take the vows.

Sithu's reign was a prosperous one in which Pagan was an integral part of in-land and maritime trading networks. Sithu engaged in a massive building campaign throughout the kingdom, which included colonies, forts and outposts at strategic locations to strengthen the frontiers, ordination halls and pagodas for the support of religion, as well as reservoirs, dams and other land improvements to assist the farmers. He also introduced standardized weights and measures throughout the country to assist administration as well as trade. He presided over the beginning of a transition away from the [[Mon people|Mon]] culture toward the expression of a distinctive [[Bamar|Burman]] style.

Sithu is remembered a peripatetic king who traveled extensively throughout his realm, built monuments and nurtured [[Theravada Buddhism]] with acts of piety.

==Early life==
Sithu was born '''Zeyathura Sithu''' ({{lang-my|ဇေယျ သူရ စည်သူ}}, {{lang-pi|Jayyasura Cansu}})&lt;ref name=gc-114&gt;Cœdès 1966: 114&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Saw Yun of Pagan|Saw Yun]] (son of King [[Saw Lu]]) and [[Shwe Einthi]] (daughter of King [[Kyansittha]]) on 17 January 1090.&lt;ref name=yt-1-116-6&gt;(Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 116, footnote #6): Thursday, full moon of Tabodwe 451 ME = 17 January 1190&lt;/ref&gt; (According to ''Zatadawbon Yazawin'', he was born on 13 December 1089.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Than Tun 1964: 124): According to the chronicles, Sithu I was born two years after Kyansittha's accession, but a contemporary inscription (inscribed in 1115 CE) says the king was born in 451 ME (1089/1090 CE). ''[[Zatadawbon Yazawin]]'' (Zata 1960: 65) says he was born on 8th day of 10th month of 455 ME. But 455 ME is a typo since the numbers 1 ({{my|၁}}) and 5 ({{my|၅}}) in Burmese are similar. It should be year 451 as corroborated by the inscription.&lt;/ref&gt;) The chronicles do not agree on the dates regarding his life and reign. The table below lists the dates given by the four main chronicles.&lt;ref name=my-1-348&gt;Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 348&lt;/ref&gt;

At Sithu's birth, Kyansittha, who thought that he had no son, was so delighted that he crowned the infant as king, and presented the baby to the people saying "''Behold your king! Henceforth, I reign only as his regent.''"&lt;ref name=geh-39&gt;Harvey 1925: 39&lt;/ref&gt; (It turned out that Kyansittha did have a son by a wife during one of his exiles in the 1070s. That son, [[Yazakumar]], made no claims of the throne.)

==Accession==
Sithu faced no opposition to the throne after his grandfather, Kyanzittha, died in 1112. He was the great grandson of [[Anawrahta]] on his mother's side.&lt;ref name=gc-1968-166&gt;Coedès 1968: 166&lt;/ref&gt; His coronation was presided by an aging [[primate (bishop)|Primate]] [[Shin Arahan]] who also presided the coronations of the two predecessor kings, and adviser to three previous kings.&lt;ref name=geh-44&gt;Harvey 1925: 44&lt;/ref&gt; Upon ascending the throne, Sithu assumed the royal style '''Sri Tribhuwanaditya Pavarapandita Sudhammaraja Mahadhipati Narapatisithu'''.&lt;ref name=tks-216&gt;Taw, Blagden 1911: 216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==

===Administration===
The early part of Sithu's reign was spent repressing revolts, especially in [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim]] and north [[Rakhine State|Arakan]]. A [[Pali]] inscription found at [[Mergui]] (Myeik) is evidence that Tenasserim then paid allegiance to the Pagan monarchy. In north Arakan, a usurper ('''Kahton''', lord of Thets)&lt;ref name=kt-67&gt;Kyaw Thet 1962: 67&lt;/ref&gt; had driven out the rightful heir, who fled to Pagan, where he subsequently died. Pagan's initial attempt to restore the rightful heir [[Letya Min Nan]]&amp;mdash;a combined land and seaborne invasion&amp;mdash;failed but the second attempt in 1118 succeeded. (The Arakanese chronicles report the date as 1103.) Letya Min Nan, in gratitude, repaired the [[Buddhagaya]] shrine in the honor of his overlord Sithu.&lt;ref name=dgeh-21-22&gt;Hall 1960: 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-46&gt;Harvey 1925: 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Sithu traveled far and wide throughout his dominions, building many works of merit. These pious pilgrimages form the main theme of the chronicles of his reign. He reportedly sailed as far south as [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and [[Bengal]] in the west. Like his great-grandfather Anawrahta, he also traveled to [[Nanzhao Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=geh-48-49&gt;Harvey, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; There was apparently much disorder during his long absences from the capital.&lt;ref name=dgeh-21-22/&gt;

The rulings given at his court, some of which by himself, once existed in a collection, the '''''Alaungsithu Hpyatton'''''.&lt;ref name=geh-48-49/&gt;

===Economy===
Sithu's reign was a prosperous one in which Pagan was an integral part of in-land and maritime trading networks. Sithu engaged in a massive building campaign throughout the kingdom, which included colonies, forts and outposts at strategic locations to strengthen the frontiers, ordination halls and pagodas for the support of religion, as well as reservoirs, dams and other land improvements to assist the farmers. He also introduced standardized weights and measures throughout the country to assist administration as well as trade. The standardization provided an impetus for the monetization of Pagan's economy, the full impact of which however would not be felt until later in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=rsw-130-131&gt;Wicks 1992: 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
[[File:That-byin-nyu.jpg|thumb|Thatbyinnyu Temple, the tallest in Pagan (Bagan)]]
The wealth funded the temple building boom that began in his grandfather's reign. However, a noticeable shift from the Mon architecture to a Burman-style architecture began. The temples built during his reign include the last examples of Mon architecture at Pagan as well as the earliest efforts to construct Burman-style temples, the most famous example of which is the [[Thatbyinnyu Temple|Thatbyinnyu]].&lt;ref name=chsea-166&gt;Tarling 1999: 166&lt;/ref&gt; Consecrated in 1144, the temple stands about 500 yards from the [[Ananda Temple]], and with its spire rising to a height of over {{convert|200|ft|m}}, it is the tallest of all the Pagan monuments.&lt;ref name=dgeh-21-22/&gt; He also built the [[Shwegugyi Temple]], next to the palace.

==Fall out with Min Shin Saw==
His eldest son [[Min Shin Saw]] was the heir-apparent for most of Sithu's reign. In the 1060s, the king banished Min Shin Saw for the latter's ill treatment of people. Having sent Min Shin Saw a small town about 90 miles north of Pagan, Sithu then appointed the second son [[Narathu]] as heir apparent.&lt;ref name=pmt-126-127&gt;Pe Maung Tin, Luce 1960: 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Shwegugyi-Bagan-Myanmar-01-gje.jpg|thumb|left|Shwegugyi Temple where Sithu was assassinated]]
In 1167, Sithu fell ill. Narathu, who could not wait to be king, moved the king from the palace to the nearby Shwegugyi Temple. When he regained consciousness, Sithu was furious that he had been set aside. Narathu came in and smothered the king with bedclothes.&lt;ref name=dgeh-21-22/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-50&gt;Harvey 1925: 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Sithu is posthumously remembered in Burmese history as Alaungsithu (lit. ''Sithu the [[Maitreya Buddha]]'') for his numerous pious deeds. The devout Buddhist king was also inducted into the pantheon of Burmese animist [[nat (spirit)|nats]] as [[Min Sithu]]. (All but one of the nat sprits in the pantheon were murdered.)

'''Alla Amidas''' (c. 540) was a [[List of kings of Axum|King]] of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. He is primarily known from the [[Aksumite currency|coins]] minted during his reign.

Due to die-links between the coins of Alla Amidas and [[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]], Munro-Hay suggests that the two kings were co-rulers. Alla Amidas possibly ruled the Aksumite territories on the western side of the [[Red Sea]], while Kaleb was campaigning in the east in [[Southern Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;S. C.

[[File:Baby Doe Tabor.jpg|thumb|250px|Baby Doe Tabor, circa 1883]]

'''Elizabeth McCourt Tabor''' (1854 – March 7, 1935), better known as '''Baby Doe''', was the second wife of pioneer [[Colorado]] businessman [[Horace Tabor]]. Her rags-to-riches and back to rags again story made her a well-known figure in her own day, and inspired an opera and a Hollywood movie based on her life.

Born in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]], she moved to Colorado in the mid-1870s with her first husband, Harvey Doe, whom she divorced for drinking, gambling, frequenting brothels, and being unable to provide a living.

She then moved to [[Leadville, Colorado]], where she met Tabor, a wealthy silver magnate almost twice her age. In 1883 he divorced his first wife, to whom he had been married for 25 years, and married Baby Doe in [[Washington, D.C.]] during his brief stint as a US senator, after which they took up residence in [[Denver]]. His divorce and remarriage to the young and beautiful Baby Doe caused a scandal in 1880s Colorado. Although Tabor was one of the wealthiest men in Colorado, supporting his wife in a lavish style, he lost his fortune when the repeal of the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] caused the [[Panic of 1893]] with widespread bankruptcies in silver-producing regions such as Colorado. He died destitute, and she returned to Leadville with her two daughters, living out the rest of her life there.

At one time the "best dressed woman in the West",&lt;ref name = "Madigan"/&gt; for the final three decades of her life, she lived in a shack on the site of the [[Matchless Mine]], enduring great poverty, solitude, and repentance. After a snowstorm in March 1935, she was found frozen in her cabin, aged about 81 years.&lt;ref name = "Madigan"/&gt; During her lifetime she became the subject of malicious gossip and scandal, defied Victorian gender values, and gained a "reputation of one of the most beautiful, flamboyant, and alluring women in the mining West".&lt;ref&gt;Riley, 2&lt;/ref&gt;   Her story inspired the opera ''[[The Ballad of Baby Doe]]''.

==Early life and marriage==
'''Elizabeth Bonduel McCourt''' (or according to some accounts '''Elizabeth Nellis McCourt''') was born in 1854 in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] to Irish-Catholic immigrants Peter and Elizabeth McCourt.&lt;ref name=Bancroft4ff /&gt; She later claimed to have been born in 1860. She appears to have been christened on October 7, 1854&lt;ref name="temple-7"&gt;Temple, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; at St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="burke-7"&gt;Burke, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Called Lizzie as a child, the fourth of eleven children, she grew up in a middle-class family in a two-story house.  Her father was a partner in a local clothing store and owner of Oshkosh's first theater, McCourt Hall. Her mother fostered in her beautiful daughter the belief that her looks were of great worth, excusing her from domestic chores so as to preserve her skin and allowing her to dream of a future as an actress. Concerned by his wife's indulgence in their young and striking daughter, Peter McCourt thought it prudent to put her to work at the clothing store, where she was often in the company of fashionable young men. At age 16, she was a "fashionably plump" blond-haired young woman with a hectic social schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Oshkosh was a frontier lumber town, filled with mills. When fires raged through Oshkosh in 1874 and again in 1875, the McCourts lost their home, the clothing store, and the theater. They mortgaged their property to rebuild the home and the business, but this put Peter McCourt deeply in debt.  The family was forced to live on what amounted to little more than a clerk's salary.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, Lizzie McCourt met Harvey Doe, who was a Protestant. She enchanted him when, as the only woman competitor, she entered and won a skating competition, while at same time scandalizing many of the townspeople by wearing a costume that showed glimpses of her legs. Lizzy and Harvey were married in 1877 at the Catholic church, to the dissatisfaction of his parents.  They then traveled with Harvey's father to Colorado to look after his mining investments, most importantly his half-ownership of the Fourth of July Mine in [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]]. After a two-week honeymoon in Denver's American House, the newlyweds joined the elder Doe in the mining town in the mountains. Lizzie found Colorado enchanting.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; There she may have gained the nickname "Baby Doe".&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Historical Society, [http://www.coloradohistory.org/kids/Baby%20Doe%20Tabor.pdf Baby Doe Tabor, Colorado's silver queen], PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Colorado==

In Central City, she quickly found that her husband's reserved temperament was unsuitable for a boisterous frontier mining town, and that he was unable either to manage a mine on his own or to follow his father's instructions on how to do so.  Rather than see him fail, and enchanted with the possibility of becoming wealthy from mining gold, she helped her husband. She often dressed in mining clothes and worked directly in the mine. Despite a somewhat relaxed culture in the frontier mining town, those in the highest strata of the city's society considered her behavior and dress scandalous, causing her to be ignored. Through both their efforts, the Does did manage to bring up a small amount of gold, but when the vein ran out and a poorly constructed shaft collapsed, Harvey gave up and decided to take a job as a common mucker at another mine.  He told his wife to stop wearing men's clothing and stay at home.&lt;ref name ="Riley7ff"&gt;Riley, 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iron bridge over Black Hawk, by Weitfle, Charles, 1836-1921.jpg|thumb|300px|View of [[Black Hawk, Colorado|Black Hawk]] during the period Baby Doe Tabor lived there.]]

At that time, they moved from Central City to [[Black Hawk, Colorado|Black Hawk]] to live in a less expensive rooming house. Greatly disappointed and disenchanted by the noise and dirt in Black Hawk, Baby Doe began to take walks around the city each day.  Then aged 23, she may have gained the name "Baby Doe" from the local men watching. She lacked domestic skills with which to work and earn money, and she had nothing in common with the women of the town.  Often, having little to do with her time, she visited the local clothing store, attracted in part by the expensive fabrics. She became friendly with the owner of the town's clothing store, Jake Sandelowsky.  At the same time Harvey lost his job, and their marriage began to deteriorate. By that time Baby Doe was pregnant. Suspecting the child was Jake's, Harvey left her temporarily, and in July 1879, Baby Doe gave birth to a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] boy.&lt;ref name = "Riley9ff"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Harvey's parents, expecting a grandchild, had moved to Colorado to be near the family. Disappointed, they severed their ties with the two and moved to [[Idaho Springs]], while Baby Doe followed Harvey to Denver despite wishing for a divorce from him. In Denver, Harvey frequented saloons and brothels.  After witnessing him with a prostitute, Baby Doe filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery. The divorce was quickly granted in March 1880, but for unknown reasons was not officially recorded until April 1886. Baby Doe then moved to [[Leadville, Colorado]], almost certainly invited there by Sandelowsky, who changed his name to Sands.  Alone and without a husband, Baby Doe needed to find a means of financial support quickly. Jake Sandelowsky, who opened a store in Leadville and almost certainly wanted to marry her, offered her employment. Working at a clothing store, however, was a prospect Baby Doe found dull, boring, and too similar to the life she had left behind in Oshkosh.&lt;ref name = "Riley9ff"&gt;Riley, 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadville==
[[File:TABOR GRAND HOTEL, LEADVILLE, COLORADO.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Horace Tabor built the Tabor Grand Hotel in Leadville, shown here in a modern photograph.]]
[[File:Tabor Opera House - Leadville 2007.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Tabor Opera House in Leadville]]
In Leadville, she caught the attention of [[Horace Tabor]], mining millionaire and owner of Leadville's [[Matchless Mine]]. Tabor was married, but in 1880 he left his wife Augusta to be with Baby Doe; he established her in plush suites at hotels in Leadville and Denver.&lt;ref name = "Riley13ff"/&gt;

Horace and [[Augusta Tabor]] had lived for 25 years on the frontier, first moving to Kansas where they tried their hand at agriculture, then following the gold rush to Colorado, but never striking it rich. Eventually they found their way to Leadville, where Horace, in 1878, grub-staked two prospectors with about $60 worth of goods in return for one-third of their profits. To everyone's surprise, the two men's stake was successful, beginning Tabor's path to wealth. With his profits, he bought out the two, then bought stakes in more mines, and had a house built in Denver. He ran successfully for Lieutenant Governor of Colorado in 1878,&lt;ref name = "Madigan"/&gt; (when still a territory), and established the Little Pittsburg Consolidated Mining Company, which quickly gained a worth of about $20 million. He bought the Matchless Mine, which for many years produced large amounts of silver.  His profits were so great that he was quickly on his way to becoming one of the richest men in the country.&lt;ref name = "Riley13ff"&gt;Riley, 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

At an altitude of 10,000 feet, Leadville was the second largest city in Colorado. It boasted over 100 saloons and gambling places, multiple daily and weekly newspapers, and 36 brothels. Tabor's presence seemed to be everywhere.&lt;ref name ="Temple13ff"&gt;Temple, 13&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the Tabor Opera House in Leadville, bought luxury items for his wife, Augusta, and established a private army that he used for protection of his holdings and as a force against striking miners. He spent his money lavishly, mostly on his own entertainment—drinking, gambling and frequenting brothels. In 1880, Augusta moved away from him to live in Denver while Tabor enjoyed himself in Leadville.&lt;ref name = "Riley13ff"/&gt; A Denver newspaper columnist described him as "Stoop-shouldered; ambling gait&amp;nbsp;...black hair, inclined to baldness&amp;nbsp;....dresses in black; magnificent cuff buttons of diamonds and onyx&amp;nbsp;...worth 8 million dollars."&lt;ref name ="Temple13ff"/&gt; Historian Judy Nolte Temple writes that it "seemed inevitable that the prettiest woman in the mining West would eventually meet the richest man."&lt;ref name ="Temple13ff"/&gt;

Baby Doe met Horace Tabor in a restaurant in Leadville one evening in 1880. She told him her story and that she had arrived in Leadville because of Jake Sandelowsky's generosity. Tabor gave her $5000 on the spot. Baby Doe then had a message, and $1000, delivered to Sandelowsky, in which she declared that she would not marry him. Instead, Tabor moved her to the Clarendon Hotel, next to the opera house and Sandelowsky's store, Sands, Pelton &amp; Company. Sandelowsky later moved to [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], where he opened another store, married, and built a house.&lt;ref name = "Riley16ff"&gt;Riley, 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some months later, Tabor moved Baby Doe to the Windsor Hotel in Denver. A newly constructed turreted building, meant to look like Windsor castle, the hotel had extremely lavish decorations such as mirrors made of diamond dust. Tabor had a gold-leafed bath-tub in his suite. Guests were wealthy, well-known and well-connected.&lt;ref name = "Riley18ff"&gt;Riley, 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Baby Doe claimed to love Tabor, and he loved her. He moved permanently out of his Denver home and asked his wife Augusta for a divorce. She refused him. He, in turn, refused to send her an invitation to attend the grand opening of Denver's Tabor Grand Opera House. He stopped giving his wife money; she sued him but failed; he again demanded a divorce. Baby Doe suggested that he seek a divorce in a different jurisdiction, and in 1882 a [[Durango, Colorado]], judge granted them a divorce.&lt;ref name = "Riley18ff"&gt;Riley, 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the filing was irregular, and once Tabor realized that, he had the county clerk paste together two pages in the records to hide the action.  Despite his existing marriage to Augusta, Horace Tabor and Elizabeth McCourt Doe married secretly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in September 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Leadville.com, [http://www.leadville.com/history/tabor.htm Leadville's famous love triangle: Horace, Augusta, and "Baby Doe" Tabor].&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time both were bigamists: his divorce was questionable and hers was not yet recorded.&lt;ref name = "Riley18ff"&gt;Riley, 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage to Horace Tabor==

In January 1883, Augusta sued Tabor again, and now he compensated her with real estate in Denver and stock in his mines.&lt;ref name = "Riley18ff"/&gt; Tabor finally obtained a legal divorce at that time.  That same month, the Colorado State Legislature appointed him to a 30-day term as [[United States Senator]] to fill a temporary vacancy because the sitting senator, [[Henry Teller]], had been appointed a cabinet member.&lt;ref name = "Madigan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willison, 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Baby Doe and Horace married publicly on 1 March 1883, just two months after Tabor and Augusta had divorced. He was 52 and she 28, and she claimed to be only 22. The marriage took place during Tabor's brief tenure as a US senator, at the [[Willard Hotel]] in [[Washington, DC]]. Baby Doe invited President [[Chester A. Arthur]] and other dignitaries who attended, as reported by the media at the time of her death,&lt;ref name = "Time"/&gt; though a more recent biography claims many invitations were declined.&lt;ref name = "Riley20ff"&gt;Riley, 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horace Austin Warner Tabor - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Horace Austin Warner Tabor, taken between 1870 and 1880]]

She planned a lavish wedding, going first to Oshkosh, making arrangements for her family to attend the event, and purchasing clothing and jewelry for them. Her mother was proud that her daughter was marrying a wealthy man, and Baby Doe herself was quite happy.  At her wedding in Washington, she wore a white satin dress that cost $7,000&lt;ref name = "Riley20ff"/&gt; and the $90,000 necklace known as the "Isabella" necklace.&lt;ref name = "Time"/&gt;  Two days after the wedding, the priest who had performed the ceremony refused to sign the marriage license when he learned that both the bride and the groom had previously divorced and that Baby Doe was a Roman Catholic.  Although Tabor's contemporaries had winked at or ignored his dalliance with Baby Doe, Tabor's divorce and quick remarriage created a scandal which prevented the couple from being accepted in polite society. Only a few months later, Horace's bid to be elected governor of Colorado ended in failure. Baby Doe's father died at around the same time.&lt;ref name = "Riley20ff"/&gt;

The couple returned to Colorado, where they took up permanent residence in a Denver mansion. Baby Doe was snubbed by Denver socialites, from whom she received neither visits nor invitations. Although she did not join charities or clubs, as was customary during that period for wealthy women,&lt;ref name = "Riley20ff"/&gt; she was generous with her money, donating funds to various charities, and providing free offices to the Colorado [[suffragette]] movement. To keep herself busy, she shopped, bought jewelry and clothing, had her hair done and continued with the hobby of scrapbooking she had taken up when living in Central City.&lt;ref name = "Riley22ff"&gt;Riley, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth "Baby Doe" Tabor.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Baby Doe Tabor taken between 1885 and 1895]]

On July 13, 1884, she gave birth to the first of her and Tabor's two daughters, Elizabeth Bonduel Lily Tabor. The infant was christened in an extravagant and frilly outfit costing $15,000. Baby Doe was reportedly a good mother, staying at home with her daughter instead of accompanying Horace on his frequent trips to look after widespread business interests. Their second daughter, Rose Mary Echo Silver Dollar Tabor, was born on December 17, 1889. Both girls were attractive and well looked-after, and their mother doted on them. The second child was fondly called Silver or Silver Dollar, whom Baby Doe "defiantly nursed&amp;nbsp;... as she rode through the streets in Denver in one of her carriages."&lt;ref name = "Riley22ff"&gt;Riley, 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the birth of their second child, in 1890, the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] was enacted, which brought to Colorado, and Colorado mine-owners, the hope that wildly fluctuating silver prices would stabilize. Profits from silver mining had diminished as the supply had declined and the extraction process and labor costs had increased. When a few of Horace's investments began to fail, he was forced to mortgage the Tabor theater in Denver and other real estate he had bought during the past decades.&lt;ref name = "Riley22ff"/&gt;

Horace Tabor lost his fortune in 1893 when the repeal of the Silver Act caused the [[Panic of 1893]]. Silver prices plummeted and fortunes in Colorado were instantly wiped out. As she had with her first husband, Baby Doe pitched in. Horace gave her the legal power to run his business concerns in Denver, and she made decisions for him during his absences. To raise money, she sold most of her jewelry, and when the couple had the power turned off in their mansion, she made a game of it for the children. Eventually, the mansion and its contents were sold.  At age 65, to earn a living, Horace took a job as a common mineworker, while the family lived in a boarding house. From 1893 to 1898, the Tabors endured great poverty, although some friends lent them money.  To save him from poverty, some political friends arranged his appointment as postmaster of Denver in 1898. The family at that time lived on his annual salary of $3700 per year and took up residence in a plain room at the Windsor Hotel. Horace's health soon gave out, and 15 months after his appointment to the position, he died.&lt;ref name = "Riley24ff"&gt;Riley, 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral was well attended, with perhaps as many as 10,000 there. On his deathbed he is said to have told Baby Doe to "hold on the Matchless mine … it will make millions again when silver comes back." However, that story might not be true; by then, it appears they had mortgaged and/or lost the Matchless mine.&lt;ref name = "Riley24ff"/&gt; At the time of her husband's death, Baby Doe was still an attractive woman in her mid-forties.&lt;ref name = "Temple109ff"/&gt;

==Later years==

===The Matchless mine===
[[Image:Matchless mine.jpg|thumb|Matchless mine and Baby Doe Tabor cabin, where she lived for the latter part of her life]]

After her husband's death, Baby Doe stayed in Denver for a period, according to her diaries and correspondence. Why she decided to leave Denver and the society there to make a return to Leadville, in the high mountains with its cold winters, is unknown, but it almost certainly had to do with the Matchless mine.&lt;ref name="Temple109ff"&gt;Temple, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; For two years she unsuccessfully tried to find investors to bring the Matchless back into production.&lt;ref name = "Temple31ff"&gt;Temple, 31&lt;/ref&gt; The family may have tried to regain ownership to the Matchless mine, but documentation is fragmented, and it is unclear to whom the mine belonged at that time.&lt;ref name = "Riley24ff"/&gt;  In 1901, one of her McCourt sisters may have attempted to buy the mine at a sheriff's sale, but again the fragmented documentation is murky about ownership. When Baby Doe moved with her girls back to Leadville, she claimed she would work the mine herself, despite its deteriorated condition. Temple writes that the mine's shafts were flooded and had not been in working condition for many years, and furthermore that Horace would have known this.&lt;ref name = "Temple31ff"/&gt; To earn money, she took on menial domestic jobs.  Unknown to her, her brother paid the grocer so that the three women had food.&lt;ref name = "Riley24ff"/&gt;  Eventually, in an attempt to keep the decrepit mine going and to raise funds, she reluctantly sold the "Isabella necklace" Tabor had given her, but during her lifetime she refused to sell his gold [[watch fob]].&lt;ref name = "Temple31ff"/&gt;

Her older daughter, Lily, left her mother to live with Baby Doe's family in Wisconsin.  Later, after her mother died, Lily denied being Baby Doe's daughter.&lt;ref name="Temple35ff" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Temple42ff"&gt;Temple, 42&lt;/ref&gt; Of the two daughters, Lily, born into wealth, seemed more affected by the fall into poverty. When in 1902, Baby Doe traveled with her daughters to Oshkosh to visit her relatives, Lily decided then to prolong her visit, to stay and provide care for her elderly grandmother. Later, Lily moved to Chicago, where in 1908 she married her first cousin, and soon after gave birth to Baby Doe's grandchild.  In 1911, Baby Doe and Silver again visited relatives in Wisconsin, going on to visit Lily in Chicago. After such a prolonged absence, Lily claimed she barely knew Silver Dollar.&lt;ref name = "Temple116ff"&gt;Temple, 116-118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Silver Dollar Tabor.jpg|thumb|left|Baby Doe's daughter Silver Dollar Tabor]]

After Lily's departure, Baby Doe and Silver Dollar moved into a cabin on the site of the Matchless mine. The living quarters were basic and inadequate for Colorado winters: "All told, it was no larger than a medium sized room. Two windows had been cut into the flimsy weatherboards, but these had been nailed up".&lt;ref name="Temple31ff" /&gt;  The structure was a former tool shed located adjacent to the hoisthouse, described by a visitor in 1927 as "crowded with very primitive furniture, decorated with religious pictures, and stacked high in newspapers."&lt;ref name = "Bancroft4ff"&gt;Bancroft, 4-6&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin was isolated, located above Leadville in Little Strayhorse Gulch, and had an unimpeded view of [[Mount Elbert]] and [[Mount Massive]].&lt;ref name = "Bancroft4ff"/&gt;

Silver Dollar also left Leadville, soon after she had turned to drink and had become sexually precocious. Worried, Baby Doe was happy to send her away to Denver. There, Silver Dollar wrote for the ''Denver Times'', sending part of her earnings to her mother on a weekly basis. She then attempted to become a novelist, while at the same time gaining a bad reputation in Denver for her drunken antics. Perhaps to escape Colorado, she moved to Chicago where again she tried her hand at writing.  Eventually, after working as a dancer under various names, she became the mistress of a Chicago gangster.  In 1925, Silver Dollar was found scalded to death under suspicious circumstances in her Chicago boarding house, where she had been living under the name "Ruth Norman".&lt;ref name = "Temple35ff"&gt;Temple, 34-36&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of her life, Baby Doe refused to believe the woman found as Ruth Norman had been her daughter, stating, "I did not see the body they said was my little girl."&lt;ref name = "Temple42ff"/&gt;

Alone in the cabin outside Leadville, Baby Doe turned to religion. She considered her life of great wealth a period of vanity and created penances for herself. During the frigidly bitter Colorado high-country winters, she wound burlap sacks around her legs. With no money, she ate very little, living on stale bread and suet, and refused to accept charity. Baby Doe lived like this for 35 years.&lt;ref name="Riley26ff"&gt;Riley, 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;  During these years she wrote incessantly. In diaries, letters, and scraps she called "Dreams and Visions", consisting of about 2000 fragments later found bundled in piles of paper in her cabin, she wrote entries such as: "Nov. 26—1918 Papa Tabor's Birthday I owe my room rent &amp; am in need of food and only enough bread for tonight &amp; breakfast&amp;nbsp;.... my shoes and stockings only 1 pair are in rags."&lt;ref name = "Templexff"/&gt; An eyewitness described her in 1927 as dressed "in corduroy trousers, mining boots, and a torn soiled blouse .... [with] a blue bandana tied around her head", and went on to say that "her eyes were very far apart and a gorgeous blue".&lt;ref name = "Bancroft4ff"/&gt;

She wandered the streets of Leadville, rags on her feet, wearing a cross, and came to be known as a madwoman. Some who had been acquainted with her earlier thought she deserved to suffer for having broken up the marriage between Horace and Augusta, and believed that she had been the cause of his ruin.&lt;ref name="Templexff"&gt;Temple, x&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Leadville had lost much of its boomtown population and was becoming a ghost-town. She often walked the empty streets at night, dressed in a mixture of women's and men's clothing, wearing trousers and mining boots. She protected the mine from strangers with a shot-gun, and "she became a sad spectre of Baby Doe to old-timers; a spectacle to the young."&lt;ref name = "Temple35ff"/&gt;

===Death===
In the winter of 1935, after an unusually severe snowstorm, some neighbors noticed that no smoke was coming out of the chimney at the Matchless mine cabin.  Investigating, they found Baby Doe dead, her body frozen on the floor.&lt;ref name = "Time"&gt;''Time'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748526,00.html "Women: the end of Baby Doe,"] 18 March 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judy Nolte Temple, "The demons of Elizabeth Tabor," ''Colorado Heritage'', Winter 2001, p.3-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' reported that a miner and friend, concerned at not seeing her for some days, broke into the cabin and found the body. The newspaper went on to compare her to another female Leadville resident, [[Molly Brown]].  For one last time, Baby Doe made the front pages of the papers. The interment had to be postponed because the ground in Leadville at that time of year was "still frozen five feet deep".&lt;ref name = "Madigan"&gt;Michael Madigan, [http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/12/the-rocky-150-years-the-death-of-baby-doe/ "March 8, 1935: the death of 'Baby Doe',"], ''Rocky Mountain News''.&lt;/ref&gt; While a gravesite was being prepared in Leadville—the ground had to be dynamited—wealthy Denverites raised money to have her body brought there. A funeral mass was held in Leadville, then her casket was sent by train to Denver.&lt;ref name = "Temple42ff"/&gt; She was apparently 81 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name = "Madigan"/&gt;

Her remaining possessions were auctioned off to souvenir collectors for $700.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770068,00.html "People,"] 1 July 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baby Doe Tabor is buried with her husband in [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Wheat Ridge)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] in [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado]].

==Reputation and legacy==
Baby Doe Tabor is a legend among the women of the mining West. She holds the reputation of being a great beauty, a home-wrecker, and in her later years, a madwoman. Judy Nolte Temple writes that Baby Doe's legend, and her sins, grew quickly in retelling, as evidenced by an exaggerated description of her death in an early biography: "The formerly beautiful and glamorous Baby Doe Tabor&amp;nbsp;... was found dead on her cabin floor&amp;nbsp;.... only partially clothed&amp;nbsp;....frozen into the shape of a cross".&lt;ref name = "Templeixff"/&gt; She was rumored to be a gold-digger and a poor mother. Scavengers searched for non-existent treasure after her death, but Temple says the real treasure was found in Baby Doe's writing, which has taken decades to archive, analyze and study, and only now is beginning to reveal the inner life of the woman.&lt;ref name = "Templeixff"&gt;Temple, ix&lt;/ref&gt; Temple sees her as one in a long line of women who endured shunning and punishment for her beauty and for being disruptive to prevailing social norms. Temple speculates that Baby Doe's move to Leadville after Horace's death may have been self-shunning from Denver society.&lt;ref name = "Temple109ff"/&gt;

Baby Doe was portrayed in the [[Warner Brothers]] film ''Silver Dollar'', which premiered in Denver in 1932. "Lily", the fictionalized character of Baby Doe, was portrayed by actress [[Bebe Daniels]]; [[Edward G. Robinson]] played Yates Martin, a fictionalized Horace Tabor.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,847129,00.html "Cinema: the new pictures,"] 2 January 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Moore]]'s opera ''[[The Ballad of Baby Doe]]'' premiered in [[Central City, Colorado]], in 1956.  In the New York premiere in 1958, Baby Doe was sung by [[Beverly Sills]].&lt;ref&gt;US Opera, [http://www.usopera.com/operas/ballad.html The Ballad of Baby Doe].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, a string of western-themed "Baby Doe's Matchless Mine" restaurants was established in a number of US cities. Almost all are now closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babydoe.org/restaurant.htm Baby Doe's Restaurant]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Categories of Databases within BioCyc:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Based on the manual curation done, BioCyc database family is divided into 3 tiers:

'''Tier 1:''' Databases which have received at least one year of literature based manual curation. Currently there are seven databases in Tier 1. Out of the seven, [[MetaCyc]] is a major database that contains almost 2500 metabolic pathways from many organisms.&lt;ref name="BioCyc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BioCyc2"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00204-011-0705-2|pmid=21523460|title=A survey of metabolic databases emphasizing the Meta ''Cyc'' family|journal=Archives of Toxicology|volume=85|issue=9|pages=1015–33|year=2011|last1=Karp|first1=Peter D.|last2=Caspi|first2=Ron|pmc=3352032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other important Tier 1 database is HumanCyc which contains around 300 metabolic pathways found in humans.&lt;ref name="BioCyc3"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1186/gb-2004-6-1-r2|pmid=15642094|pmc=549063|year=2004|last1=Romero|first1=Pedro|title=Computational prediction of human metabolic pathways from the complete human genome|journal=Genome Biology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=R2|last2=Wagg|first2=Jonathan|last3=Green|first3=Michelle L|last4=Kaiser|first4=Dale|last5=Krummenacker|first5=Markus|last6=Karp|first6=Peter D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining five databases include, EcoCyc  (''E. coli''),&lt;ref name="BioCyc4"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1143|pmid=21097882|pmc=3013716|title=Eco ''Cyc'': A comprehensive database of Escherichia coli biology|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=39|issue=Database issue|pages=D583–90|year=2010|last1=Keseler|first1=I.

D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; AraCyc  (''Arabidopsis thaliana''),  YeastCyc (''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''), LeishCyc (''Leishmania major Friedlin'') and TrypanoCyc (''Trypanosoma brucei'').

'''Tier 2:''' Databases that were computationally predicted but have received moderate manual curation (most with 1–4 months curation). Tier 2 Databases are available for manual curation by scientists who are interested in any particular organism. Tier 2 databases currently contain 43 different organism databases.

'''Tier 3:''' Databases that were computationally predicted by PathoLogic and received no manual curation. As with Tier 2, Tier 3 databases are also available for curation for interested scientists.

&lt;big&gt;'''Software Tools within BioCyc:'''&lt;/big&gt;

The BioCyc website contains a variety of software tools for searching, visualizing, comparing, and analyzing genome and pathway information. It includes a genome browser, and browsers for metabolic and [[Gene regulatory network|regulatory networks]]. The website also includes tools for painting large-scale ("omics") datasets onto metabolic and regulatory networks, and onto the genome.

&lt;big&gt;'''Use of BioCyc Database Collection in Research:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Since BioCyc Database family comprises a long list of organism specific databases and also data at different systems level in a living system, the usage in research has been in a wide variety of context. Here, two studies are highlighted which show two different varieties of uses, one on a genome scale and other on identifying specific SNPs ([[Single Nucleotide Polymorphism]]s)  within a genome.

'''AlgaGEM'''

AlgaGEM is a genome scale metabolic network model for a compartmentalized algae cell developed by Gomes de Oliveira Dal’Molin et al.&lt;ref name = "BioCyc9"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=22369158|pmc=3287588|year=2011|author1=Dal'Molin|first1=C.

It has 866 unique ORFs, 1862 metabolites, 2499 gene-enzyme-reaction-association entries, and 1725 unique reactions. One of the Pathway databases used for reconstruction is MetaCyc.

'''SNPs'''

The study by Shimul Chowdhury et al.&lt;ref name = "BioCyc10"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23059056|pmc=3523122|year=2012|author1=Chowdhury|first1=S|title=Associations between maternal genotypes and metabolites implicated in congenital heart defects|journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism|volume=107|issue=3|pages=596–604|last2=Hobbs|first2=C.

The study used HumanCyc to select candidate genes and SNPs.

'''Biochemistry''', sometimes called '''biological chemistry''', is the study of [[chemical process]]es within and relating to living [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/areas-of-chemistry/biological-biochemistry.html.html |title=Biochemistry|work=acs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of [[life]]. 

A sub-discipline of both [[biology]] and [[chemistry]], biochemistry can be divided in three fields; [[molecular genetics]], [[Protein|protein science]] and [[metabolism]]. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has through these three disciplines become successful at explaining living processes. Almost all [[List of life sciences|areas of the life sciences]] are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research.&lt;ref name="Voet_2005"&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemistry focuses on understanding how [[biomolecule|biological molecules]] give rise to the processes that occur within living [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and between cells,&lt;ref name="Karp2009"&gt;[[#Karp|Karp]] (2009), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], and organism structure and function.&lt;ref name="MillerSpoolman2012"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]] (2012). p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biochemistry is closely related to [[molecular biology]], the study of the [[molecule|molecular]] mechanisms by which [[Genetics|genetic]] information [[Genetic code|encoded]] in [[DNA]] is able to result in the processes of life.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;[[#Astbury|Astbury]] (1961), p. 1124.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Much of biochemistry deals with the structures, functions and interactions of biological [[macromolecule]]s, such as [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipid]]s, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life.&lt;ref name="Biology"&gt;[[#Eldra|Eldra]] (2007), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller [[molecule]]s and [[ion]]s. These can be [[inorganic]], for example [[water]] and [[metal]] ions, or [[Organic compound|organic]], for example the [[amino acid]]s, which are used to [[Protein biosynthesis|synthesize proteins]].&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;[[#Marks|Marks]] (2012), Chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as [[metabolism]]. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in [[medicine]], [[nutrition]], and [[agriculture]]. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and [[Pharmaceutical drug|cures]] of [[disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finkel|Finkel]] (2009), pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In nutrition, they study how to maintain health wellness and study the effects of [[nutritional deficiencies]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010&gt;[[#UNICEF|UNICEF]] (2010), pp. 61, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In agriculture, biochemists investigate [[soil]] and [[fertilizer]]s, and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation, crop storage and [[pest control]].

== History==
{{Main article| History of biochemistry}}
[[File:Gerty Theresa Radnitz Cori (1896-1957) and Carl Ferdinand Cori.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gerty Cori]] and [[Carl Cori]] jointly won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1947 for their discovery of  the [[Cori cycle]] at RPMI.]]

At its broadest definition, biochemistry can be seen as a study of the components and composition of living things and how they come together to become life, in this sense the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as far as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref name="history of science"&gt;[[#Helvoort|Helvoort]] (2000), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, biochemistry as a specific [[scientific discipline]] has its beginning sometime in the [[19th century]], or a little earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first [[enzyme]], [[diastase]] (today called [[amylase]]), in 1833 by [[Anselme Payen]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hunter|Hunter]] (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; while others considered [[Eduard Buchner]]'s first demonstration of a complex biochemical process [[Ethanol fermentation|alcoholic fermentation]] in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hamblin|Hamblin]] (2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hunter|Hunter]] (2000), pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by [[Justus von Liebig]], ''Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology'', which presented a chemical theory of metabolism,&lt;ref name="history of science" /&gt; or even earlier to the 18th century studies on [[fermentation]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] by [[Antoine Lavoisier]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Berg|Berg]] (1980), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holmes|Holmes]] (1987), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry, for example [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] for his work on the chemistry of proteins,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Feldman|Feldman]] (2001), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|F. Gowland Hopkins]] on enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rayner|Rayner-Canham]] (2005), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "biochemistry" itself  is derived from a combination of [[biology]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1877, [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]] used the term (''biochemie'' in German) as a synonym for [[physiological chemistry]] in the foreword to the first issue of ''[[Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie]]'' (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ziesak|Ziesak]] (1999), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kleinkauf|Kleinkauf]] (1988), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[chemist]] [[Carl Neuberg]] however is often cited to have coined the word in 1903,&lt;ref name="Ben-Menahem 2009"&gt;[[#Ben|Ben-Menahem]] (2009), p. 2982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amsler|Amsler]] (1986), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Horton|Horton]] (2013), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; while some credited it to [[Franz Hofmeister]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kleinkauf|Kleinkauf]] (1988), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DNA orbit animated.gif|thumb|left|upright|DNA structure ({{PDB2|1D65}})&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]] (1992), pp. 1161–1173.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was once generally believed that life and its materials had some essential property or substance (often referred to as the "[[vital principle]]") distinct from any found in non-living matter, and it was thought that only living beings could produce the molecules of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fiske|Fiske]] (1890), pp. 419–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1828, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] published a paper on [[Wöhler synthesis|the synthesis]] of [[urea]], proving that [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds can be created artificially.&lt;ref name="Kauffman 2001"&gt;[[#Kauffman|Kauffman]] (2001), pp. 121–133.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, biochemistry has advanced, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as [[chromatography]], [[X-ray diffraction]], [[dual polarisation interferometry]], [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], [[radioisotopic labeling]], [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], and [[molecular dynamics]] simulations. These techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and [[metabolic pathway]]s of the [[cell (biology)|cell]], such as [[glycolysis]] and the [[Krebs cycle]] (citric acid cycle), and led to an understanding of biochemistry on a molecular level.[[philip Randle]] is well-known for his discovery in diabetes research is possibly the glucose-fatty acid cycle in 1963.He confirmed that fatty acids reduce oxidation of sugar by the muscle. High fat oxidation was responsible for the insulin resistance.&lt;ref name= "Ashcroft, Steve, 2006"&gt;[[#Ashcroft|Ashcroft]](2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant historic event in biochemistry is the discovery of the [[gene]], and its role in the transfer of information in the cell. This part of biochemistry is often called [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Rosalind Franklin]], and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were instrumental in solving DNA structure and suggesting its relationship with genetic transfer of information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]] received the [[Nobel Prize]] for work in fungi showing that [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis|one gene produces one enzyme]].&lt;ref name="Krebs 2012"&gt;[[#Krebs|Krebs]] (2012), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[Colin Pitchfork]] was the first person convicted of murder with [[DNA]] evidence, which led to the growth of [[forensic science]].&lt;ref name="Butler 2009"&gt;[[#Butler|Butler]] (2009), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Andrew Z. Fire]] and [[Craig C. Mello]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|2006 Nobel Prize]] for discovering the role of [[RNA interference]] ([[RNAi]]), in the silencing of [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name="Sen 2007"&gt;[[#Chandan|Chandan]] (2007), pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Starting materials: the chemical elements of life ==
[[Image:201 Elements of the Human Body.02.svg|thumb|upright|The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant (by mass) to least abundant.]]
{{main article|Composition of the human body|Dietary mineral}}

Around two dozen of the 92 naturally occurring [[chemical elements]] are essential to various kinds of [[life|biological life]]. Most [[Rare earth element|rare elements on Earth]] are not needed by life (exceptions being  [[selenium]] and [[iodine]]), while a few common ones ([[aluminum]] and [[titanium]]) are not used. Most organisms share element needs, but there are a few differences between [[plants]] and [[animals]]. For example, ocean algae use [[bromine]], but land plants and animals seem to need none. All animals require [[sodium]], but some plants do not. Plants need [[boron]] and [[silicon]], but animals may not (or may need ultra-small amounts).

Just six elements&amp;mdash;[[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]]&amp;mdash;make up almost 99% of the mass of living cells, including those in the human body (see [[composition of the human body]] for a complete list). In addition to the six major elements that compose most of the human body, humans require smaller amounts of possibly 18 more.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nielsen|Nielsen]] (1999), pp. 283–303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomolecules==
{{main|Biomolecule}}
The four main classes of molecules in biochemistry (often called [[biomolecule]]s) are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref name=slabaugh&gt;[[#Slabaugh|Slabaugh]] (2007), pp. 3–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Many biological molecules are [[polymer]]s: in this terminology, [[monomer]]s are relatively small micromolecules that are linked together to create large [[macromolecule]]s known as polymers. When monomers are linked together to synthesize a [[Biopolymer|biological polymer]], they undergo a process called [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration synthesis]]. Different macromolecules can assemble in larger complexes, often needed for [[biological activity]].

Two of the main functions of carbohydrates are energy storage and providing structure. [[Sugar]]s are carbohydrates, but not all carbohydrates are sugars. There are more carbohydrates on Earth than any other known type of biomolecule; they are used to store energy and [[genetic information]], as well as play important roles in cell to [[Cell–cell interaction|cell interactions]] and [[Cell signaling|communications]].

The simplest type of carbohydrate is a [[monosaccharide]], which among other properties contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, mostly in a ratio of 1:2:1 (generalized formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n'' is at least 3). [[Glucose]]  (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the most important carbohydrates; others include [[fructose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), the sugar commonly associated with the [[sweet taste]] of [[fruit]]s,&lt;ref name=Whiting1970&gt;[[#Whiting|Whiting]] (1970), pp. 1–31.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and [[deoxyribose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  A monosaccharide can switch between [[Open-chain compound|acyclic (open-chain) form]] and a [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] form.  The open-chain form can be turned into a ring of carbon atoms bridged by an [[oxygen]] atom created from the [[carbonyl group]] of one end and the [[hydroxyl]] group of another. The cyclic molecule has an [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]] group, depending on whether the linear form was an [[aldose]] or a [[ketose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Existence in solution.png|center|thumb|500px|Conversion between the [[furanose]], [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]], and [[pyranose]] forms of D-glucose]]

In these cyclic forms, the ring usually has '''5''' or '''6''' atoms.  These forms are called [[furanose]]s and [[pyranose]]s, respectively&amp;nbsp;— by analogy with [[furan]] and [[pyran]], the simplest compounds with the same carbon-oxygen ring (although they lack the [[double bond]]s of these two molecules).  For example, the aldohexose [[glucose]] may form a hemiacetal linkage between the hydroxyl on carbon 1 and the oxygen on carbon 4, yielding a molecule with a 5-membered ring, called [[glucofuranose]].  The same reaction can take place between carbons 1 and 5 to form a molecule with a 6-membered ring, called [[glucopyranose]]. Cyclic forms with a 7-atom ring called [[heptoses]] are rare.

Two monosaccharides can be joined together by a [[Glycosidic bond|glycosidic]] or [[ether bond]] into a ''[[disaccharide]]'' through a [[dehydration reaction]] during which a molecule of water is released. The reverse reaction in which the glycosidic bond of a disaccharide is broken into two monosaccharides is termed ''[[hydrolysis]]''.  The best-known disaccharide is [[sucrose]] or ordinary [[sugar]], which consists of a [[glucose]] molecule and a [[fructose]] molecule joined together. Another important disaccharide is [[lactose]] found in milk, consisting of a glucose molecule and a [[galactose]] molecule. Lactose may be hydrolysed by [[lactase]], and deficiency in this enzyme results in [[lactose intolerance]].

When a few (around three to six) monosaccharides are joined, it is called an ''[[oligosaccharide]]'' (''oligo-'' meaning "few"). These molecules tend to be used as markers and [[Cell signaling|signals]], as well as having some other uses.&lt;ref name=Varki_1999&gt;[[#Varki|Varki]] (1999), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Many monosaccharides joined together make a [[polysaccharide]]. They can be joined together in one long linear chain, or they may be [[Branching (polymer chemistry)|branched]]. Two of the most common polysaccharides are [[cellulose]] and [[glycogen]], both consisting of repeating glucose [[monomer]]s.  Examples are ''cellulose'' which is an important structural component of plant's [[cell wall]]s, and ''[[glycogen]]'', used as a form of energy storage in animals.

[[Sugar]] can be characterized by having [[Reducing sugar|reducing]] or non-reducing ends. A [[reducing end]] of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain [[aldehyde]] ([[aldose]]) or keto form ([[ketose]]). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the [[pyranose]] or [[furanose]] form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full [[acetal]]. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. [[Saccharose]] does not have a reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).

===Lipids===
{{Main article|Lipid|Glycerol|Fatty acid}}

[[File:Common lipids lmaps.png|thumb|right|320px|Structures of some common lipids. At the top are [[cholesterol]] and [[oleic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stryer|Stryer]] (2007), p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The middle structure is a [[triglyceride]] composed of [[oleate|oleoyl]], [[stearate|stearoyl]], and [[palmitate|palmitoyl]] chains attached to a [[glycerol]] backbone. At the bottom is the common [[phospholipid]], [[phosphatidylcholine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), Ch. 12 Lipids and Membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''[[Lipid]]s''' comprises a diverse range of [[molecules]] and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or [[nonpolar]] compounds of biological origin, including [[wax]]es, [[fatty acid]]s, fatty-acid derived [[phospholipid]]s, [[sphingolipid]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, and [[terpenoid]]s (e.g., [[retinoid]]s and [[steroid]]s). Some lipids are linear [[aliphatic]] molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are [[aromatic]], while others are not. Some are flexible, while others are rigid.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipids are usually made from one molecule of [[glycerol]] combined with other molecules.  In [[triglyceride]]s, the main group of bulk lipids, there is one molecule of glycerol and three [[fatty acid]]s. Fatty acids are considered the monomer in that case, and may be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] (no [[double bond]]s in the carbon chain) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds in the carbon chain).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 382–385.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most lipids have some [[polar molecule|polar]] character in addition to being largely nonpolar. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or [[hydrophobic]] ("water-fearing"), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or [[hydrophilic]] ("water-loving") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them [[amphiphilic]] molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of [[cholesterol]], the polar group is a mere -OH (hydroxyl or alcohol). In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), pp. 385–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipids are an integral part of our daily diet. Most [[oil]]s and [[milk product]]s that we use for cooking and eating like [[butter]], [[cheese]], [[ghee]] etc., are composed of [[fat]]s. [[Vegetable oil]]s are rich in various [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFA). Lipid-containing foods undergo digestion within the body and are broken into fatty acids and glycerol, which are the final degradation products of fats and lipids.  Lipids, especially [[phospholipid]]s, are also used in various [[pharmaceutical product]]s, either as co-solubilisers (e.g., in [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] infusions) or else as [[drug carrier]] components (e.g., in a [[liposome]] or [[transfersome]]).

===Proteins===

[[File:AminoAcidball.svg|thumbnail|160px|The general structure of an α-amino acid, with the [[amine|amino]] group on the left and the [[carboxyl]] group on the right.]]

[[Protein]]s are very large molecules – macro-biopolymers – made from monomers called [[amino acid]]s. An amino acid consists of a carbon atom attached to an [[amino]] group, &amp;mdash;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a [[carboxylic acid]] group, &amp;mdash;COOH (although these exist as &amp;mdash;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;mdash;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; under physiologic conditions), a simple hydrogen atom, and a side chain commonly denoted as "&amp;mdash;R". The side chain  "R" is different for each amino acid of which there are 20 [[proteinogenic amino acid|standard ones]].  It is this "R" group that made each amino acid different, and the properties of the side-chains greatly influence the overall [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional conformation]] of a protein. Some amino acids have functions by themselves or in a modified form; for instance, [[glutamate]] functions as an important [[neurotransmitter]]. Amino acids can be joined via a [[peptide bond]]. In this [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] synthesis, a water molecule is removed and the peptide bond connects the nitrogen of one amino acid's amino group to the carbon of the other's carboxylic acid group. The resulting molecule is called a ''[[dipeptide]]'', and short stretches of amino acids (usually, fewer than thirty) are called ''peptides'' or polypeptides. Longer stretches merit the title ''proteins''. As an example, the important blood [[blood plasma|serum]] protein [[human serum albumin|albumin]] contains 585 amino acid residues.&lt;ref name="Metzler 2001"&gt;[[#Metzler|Metzler]] (2001), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1GZX Haemoglobin.png|thumb|right|160px|A schematic of [[hemoglobin]]. The red and blue ribbons represent the protein [[globin]]; the green structures are the [[heme]] groups.]]
Proteins can have structural and/or functional roles. For instance, movements of the proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] ultimately are responsible for the contraction of skeletal muscle. One property many proteins have is that they specifically bind to a certain molecule or class of molecules&amp;mdash;they may be ''extremely'' selective in what they bind. [[Antibody|Antibodies]] are an example of proteins that attach to one specific type of molecule. Antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains. Two heavy chains would be linked to two light chains through disulfide linkages between their amino acids. Antibodies are specific through variation based on differences in the N-terminal domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2009.11.005 |pmid=20022755 |pmc=4716677 |title=How antibodies fold |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=189–198 |year=2010 |last1=Feige |first1=Matthias J. |last2=Hendershot |first2=Linda M. |last3=Buchner |first3=Johannes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA), which uses antibodies, is one of the most sensitive tests modern medicine uses to detect various biomolecules. Probably the most important proteins, however, are the [[enzyme]]s. Virtually every reaction in a living cell requires an enzyme to lower the activation energy of the reaction. These molecules recognize specific reactant molecules called ''[[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s''; they then [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the reaction between them. By lowering the [[activation energy]], the enzyme speeds up that reaction by a rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; or more; a reaction that would normally take over 3,000 years to complete spontaneously might take less than a second with an enzyme. The enzyme itself is not used up in the process, and is free to catalyze the same reaction with a new set of substrates. Using various modifiers, the activity of the enzyme can be regulated, enabling control of the biochemistry of the cell as a whole.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The structure of proteins is traditionally described in a hierarchy of four levels. The [[primary structure]] of a protein consists of its linear sequence of amino acids; for instance, "alanine-glycine-tryptophan-serine-glutamate-asparagine-glycine-lysine-…". [[Secondary structure]] is concerned with local morphology (morphology being the study of structure). Some combinations of amino acids will tend to curl up in a coil called an [[alpha helix|α-helix]] or into a sheet called a [[Beta sheet|β-sheet]]; some α-helixes can be seen in the hemoglobin schematic above. [[Tertiary structure]] is the entire three-dimensional shape of the protein. This shape is determined by the sequence of amino acids. In fact, a single change can change the entire structure. The alpha chain of hemoglobin contains 146 amino acid residues; substitution of the [[glutamate]] residue at position 6 with a [[valine]] residue changes the behavior of hemoglobin so much that it results in [[sickle-cell disease]]. Finally, [[quaternary structure]] is concerned with the structure of a protein with multiple peptide subunits, like hemoglobin with its four subunits. Not all proteins have more than one subunit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 35–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingested proteins are usually broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides in the [[small intestine]], and then absorbed. They can then be joined to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] can be used to make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], [[lysine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[valine]]. These are the [[essential amino acid]]s, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize [[alanine]], [[asparagine]], [[aspartate]], [[cysteine]], [[glutamate]], [[glutamine]], [[glycine]], [[proline]], [[serine]], and [[tyrosine]], the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize [[arginine]] and [[histidine]], they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.

If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an α-[[keto acid]]. Enzymes called [[transaminase]]s can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This is important in the biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via [[transamination]]. The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 279–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar process is used to break down proteins. It is first hydrolyzed into its component amino acids. Free [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), existing as the [[ammonium]] ion (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in blood, is toxic to life forms. A suitable method for excreting it must therefore exist. Different tactics have evolved in different animals, depending on the animals' needs. [[Unicellular]] organisms simply release the ammonia into the environment. Likewise, [[osteichthyes|bony fish]] can release the ammonia into the water where it is quickly diluted. In general, mammals convert the ammonia into urea, via the [[urea cycle]].&lt;ref name="Sherwood 2012"&gt;[[#Sherwood|Sherwood]] (2012), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to determine whether two proteins are related, or in other words to decide whether they are homologous or not, scientists use sequence-comparison methods. Methods like [[sequence alignment]]s and [[structural alignment]]s are powerful tools that help scientists identify [[Sequence homology|homologies]] between related molecules.&lt;ref name="Fariselli 2007"&gt;[[#Fariselli|Fariselli]] (2007), pp. 78–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relevance of finding homologies among proteins goes beyond forming an evolutionary pattern of [[Protein family|protein families]]. By finding how similar two protein sequences are, we acquire knowledge about their structure and therefore their function.

===Nucleic acids===
{{Main article|Nucleic acid|DNA|RNA|Nucleotide}}
[[File:0322 DNA Nucleotides.jpg|thumbnail|350px|The structure of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA), the picture shows the monomers being put together.]]

[[Nucleic acids]], so called because of their prevalence in cellular [[cell nucleus|nuclei]], is the generic name of the family of biopolymers. They are complex, high-molecular-weight biochemical macromolecules that can convey [[genetic information]] in all living cells and viruses.&lt;ref name="Voet_2005"/&gt; The monomers are called [[nucleotide]]s, and each consists of three components: a nitrogenous heterocyclic [[base (chemistry)|base]] (either a [[purine]] or a [[pyrimidine]]), a pentose sugar, and a [[phosphate]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Saenger|Saenger]] (1984), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nucleotides 1.svg|thumb|center|500px|Structural elements of common nucleic acid constituents. Because they contain at least one phosphate group, the compounds marked ''nucleoside monophosphate'', ''nucleoside diphosphate'' and ''nucleoside triphosphate'' are all nucleotides (not simply phosphate-lacking [[nucleoside]]s).]]

The most common nucleic acids are [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tropp|Tropp]] (2012), pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[phosphate group]] and the sugar of each nucleotide bond with each other to form the backbone of the nucleic acid, while the sequence of nitrogenous bases stores the information. The most common nitrogenous bases are [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[thymine]], and [[uracil]].  The [[nitrogenous base]]s of each strand of a nucleic acid will form [[hydrogen bonds]] with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid (similar to a zipper). Adenine binds with thymine and uracil; thymine binds only with adenine; and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another.

Aside from the genetic material of the cell, nucleic acids often play a role as [[second messenger]]s, as well as forming the base molecule for [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the primary energy-carrier molecule found in all living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knowles|Knowles]] (1980), pp. 877–919.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the nitrogenous bases possible in the two nucleic acids are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine occur in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.

==Metabolism==

===Carbohydrates as energy source===
{{Main article|Carbohydrate metabolism}}
Glucose is an energy source in most life forms. For instance, polysaccharides are broken down into their monomers ([[glycogen phosphorylase]] removes glucose residues from glycogen). Disaccharides like lactose or sucrose are cleaved into their two component monosaccharides.

====Glycolysis (anaerobic)====
{{Glycolysis summary}}
Glucose is mainly metabolized by a very important ten-step [[Metabolic pathway|pathway]] called [[glycolysis]], the net result of which is to break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of [[pyruvate]]. This also produces a net two molecules of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the pyruvate to [[lactic acid|lactate (lactic acid)]] (e.g., in humans) or to [[ethanol]] plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in [[yeast]]). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 163–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aerobic====
In [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] cells with sufficient oxygen, as in most human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to [[acetyl-CoA]], giving off one carbon atom as the waste product [[carbon dioxide]], generating another reducing equivalent as [[NADH]]. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the [[citric acid cycle]], producing two more molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an [[electron transport system]] transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released energy in the form of a proton gradient over a membrane ([[inner mitochondrial membrane]] in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[quinone]] are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional ''28'' molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Voet|Voet]] (2005), Ch. 17 Glycolysis.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.

====Gluconeogenesis====
{{Main article|Gluconeogenesis}}
In [[vertebrate]]s, vigorously contracting [[skeletal muscle]]s (during weightlifting or sprinting, for example) do not receive enough oxygen to meet the energy demand, and so they shift to [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic metabolism]], converting glucose to lactate. The [[liver]] regenerates the glucose, using a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. This process is not quite the opposite of glycolysis, and actually requires three times the amount of energy gained from glycolysis (six molecules of ATP are used, compared to the two gained in glycolysis). Analogous to the above reactions, the glucose produced can then undergo glycolysis in tissues that need energy, be stored as glycogen (or [[starch]] in plants), or be converted to other monosaccharides or joined into di- or oligosaccharides. The combined pathways of glycolysis during exercise, lactate's crossing via the bloodstream to the liver, subsequent gluconeogenesis and release of glucose into the bloodstream is called the [[Cori cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fromm|Fromm and Hargrove]] (2012), pp. 183–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other "molecular-scale" biological sciences==
[[File:Schematic relationship between biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic relationship between biochemistry, [[genetics]], and [[molecular biology]].]]

Researchers in biochemistry use specific techniques native to biochemistry, but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas developed in the fields of [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]] and [[biophysics]]. There has never been a hard-line among these disciplines in terms of content and technique. Today, the terms ''molecular biology'' and ''biochemistry'' are nearly interchangeable. The following figure is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationship between the fields:

* ''Biochemistry'' is the study of the chemical substances and vital processes occurring in living [[organism]]s. [[Biochemist]]s focus heavily on the role, function, and structure of [[biomolecule]]s. The study of the chemistry behind biological processes and the synthesis of biologically active molecules are examples of biochemistry.
* ''Genetics'' is the study of the effect of genetic differences on organisms. Often this can be inferred by the absence of a normal component (e.g., one [[gene]]), in the study of "[[mutant]]s" &amp;ndash; organisms with a changed gene that leads to the organism being different with respect to the so-called "[[wild type]]" or normal [[phenotype]]. [[Genetic interactions]] ([[epistasis]]) can often confound simple interpretations of such "knock-out" or "knock-in" studies.
* ''Molecular biology'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of the [[genetic material]]. The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of molecular biology, still provides a good starting point for understanding the field. This picture, however, is undergoing revision in light of emerging novel roles for [[RNA]].&lt;ref name="Ulveling 2011"&gt;[[#Ulveling|Ulveling]] (2011), pp. 633–644.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Chemical biology]]'' seeks to develop new tools based on [[small molecule]]s that allow minimal perturbation of biological systems while providing detailed information about their function. Further, chemical biology employs biological systems to create non-natural hybrids between biomolecules and synthetic devices (for example emptied [[viral capsid]]s that can deliver [[gene therapy]] or [[Pharmaceutical drug|drug molecules]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rojas|Rojas-Ruiz]] (2011), pp. 2672–2687.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Fructose is not the only sugar found in fruits. Glucose and sucrose are also found in varying quantities in various fruits, and indeed sometimes exceed the fructose present. For example, 32% of the edible portion of date is glucose, compared with 23.70% fructose and 8.20% sucrose. However, peaches contain more sucrose (6.66%) than they do fructose (0.93%) or glucose (1.47%).&lt;ref name=Whiting1970p5&gt;[[#Whiting|Whiting]], G.C. (1970), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumours are characterized by genomic and epigenetic instability that alters the functions of many different molecules and networks in a single cell as well as altering the interactions with the local environment. Cancer systems biology approaches, therefore, are based on the use of computational and mathematical methods to decipher the complexity in tumorigenesis as well as cancer heterogeneity.

Cancer systems biology merges traditional basic and clinical cancer research with “exact” sciences, such as applied [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], and [[physics]]. It incorporates a spectrum of “omics” technologies ([[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[epigenomics]], etc.) and [[molecular imaging]], to generate computational algorithms and quantitative models&lt;ref name="genome_scale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis, NE|author2=Abdel-Haleem, AM|title=The evolution of genome-scale models of cancer metabolism|journal=Front.

Application of cancer systems biology include but are not limited to- elucidating critical cellular and molecular networks underlying cancer risk,initiation and progression; thereby promoting an alternative viewpoint to the traditional reductionist approach which has typically focused on characterizing single molecular aberrations.

== History ==

Cancer systems biology finds its roots in a number of events and realizations in biomedical research, as well as in technological advances. Historically cancer was identified, understood, and treated as a monolithic disease.  It was seen as a “foreign” component that grew as a homogenous mass, and was to be best treated by excision.  Besides the continued impact of surgical intervention, this simplistic view of cancer has drastically evolved. In parallel with the exploits of molecular biology, cancer research focused on the identification of critical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in the etiology of cancer.  These breakthroughs revolutionized our understanding of molecular events driving cancer progression.  Targeted therapy may be considered the current pinnacle of advances spawned by such insights.

Despite these advances, many unresolved challenges remain, including the dearth of new treatment avenues for many cancer types, or the unexplained treatment failures and inevitable relapse in cancer types where targeted treatment exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garraway|author2=Jänne|title=Circumventing cancer drug resistance in the era of personalized medicine|journal=Cancer Discovery|year=2012|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–226|pmid=22585993|doi=10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such mismatch between clinical results and the massive amounts of data acquired by omics technology highlights the existence of basic gaps in our knowledge of cancer fundamentals. Cancer Systems Biology is steadily improving our ability to organize information on cancer, in order to fill these gaps. Key developments include:

* The generation of comprehensive molecular datasets (genome, transcriptome, epigenomics, proteome, metabolome, etc.)

The practice of Cancer Systems Biology requires close physical integration between scientists with diverse backgrounds. Critical large-scale efforts are also underway to train a new workforce fluent in both the languages of biology and applied mathematics. At the translational level, Cancer Systems Biology should engender precision medicine application to cancer treatment.

== Applications ==
* Modelling Cancer Growth and Development
Mathematical modeling can provide useful context for the rational design, validation and prioritization of novel cancer drug targets and their combinations. Network-based modeling and multi-scale modeling have begun to show promise in facilitating the process of effective cancer drug discovery. Using a systems network modeling approach, Schoerberl et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoeberl|first1=B|last2=Kudla|first2=A|last3=Masson|first3=K|last4=Kalra|first4=A|last5=Curley|first5=M|last6=Finn|first6=G|last7=Pace|first7=E|last8=Harms|first8=B|last9=Kim|first9=J|last10=Kearns|first10=J|last11=Fulgham|first11=A|last12=Burenkova|first12=O|last13=Grantcharova|first13=V|last14=Yarar|first14=D|last15=Paragas|first15=V|last16=Fitzgerald|first16=J|last17=Wainszelbaum|first17=M|last18=West|first18=K|last19=Mathews|first19=S|last20=Nering|first20=R|last21=Adiwijaya|first21=B|last22=Garcia|first22=G|last23=Kubasek|first23=B|last24=Moyo|first24=V|last25=Czibere|first25=A|last26=Nielsen|first26=UB|last27=MacBeath|first27=G|title=Systems biology driving drug development: from design to the clinical testing of the anti-ErbB3 antibody seribantumab (MM-121).|journal=NPJ systems biology and applications|date=2017|volume=3|pages=16034|doi=10.1038/npjsba.2016.34|pmid=28725482|pmc=5516865}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified a previously unknown, complementary and potentially superior mechanism of inhibiting the ErbB receptor signaling network. ErbB3 was found to be the most sensitive node, leading to Akt activation; Akt regulates many biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and growth, which are all relevant to tumor progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Z|last2=Deisboeck|first2=TS|title=Mathematical modeling in cancer drug discovery.|journal=Drug Discovery Today|date=February 2014|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–50|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2013.06.015|pmid=23831857}}&lt;/ref&gt; This target driven modelling has paved way for first of its kind clinical trials. Bekkal et al. presented a nonlinear model of the dynamics of a cell population divided into proliferative and quiescent compartments. The proliferative phase represents the complete cell cycle (G (1)-S-G (2)-M) of a population committed to divide at its end. The asymptotic behavior of solutions of the nonlinear model is analysed in two cases, exhibiting tissue homeostasis or tumor exponential growth. The model is simulated and its analytic predictions are confirmed numerically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekkal Brikci|first1=F|last2=Clairambault|first2=J|last3=Ribba|first3=B|last4=Perthame|first4=B|title=An age-and-cyclin-structured cell population model for healthy and tumoral tissues.|journal=Journal of mathematical biology|date=July 2008|volume=57|issue=1|pages=91–110|doi=10.1007/s00285-007-0147-x|pmid=18064465}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Furthermore, advances in hardware and software have enabled the realization of clinically feasible, quantitative multimodality imaging of tissue pathophysiology. Earlier efforts relating to multimodality imaging of cancer have focused on the integration of anatomical and functional characteristics, such as PET-CT and single-photon emission CT (SPECT-CT), whereas more-recent advances and applications have involved the integration of multiple quantitative, functional measurements (for example, multiple PET tracers, varied MRI contrast mechanisms, and PET-MRI), thereby providing a more-comprehensive characterization of the tumour phenotype. The enormous amount of complementary quantitative data generated by such studies is beginning to offer unique insights into opportunities to optimize care for individual patients. Although important technical optimization and improved biological interpretation of multimodality imaging findings are needed, this approach can already be applied informatively in clinical trials of cancer therapeutics using existing tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankeelov|first1=TE|last2=Abramson|first2=RG|last3=Quarles|first3=CC|title=Quantitative multimodality imaging in cancer research and therapy.|journal=Nature Reviews.

In 2004, the US National Cancer Institute launched a program effort on Integrative Cancer Systems Biology&lt;ref&gt;NCI Cancer Bulletin. Feb 24, 2004. V1, 8. p5-6&lt;/ref&gt; to establish Centers for Cancer Systems Biology that focus on the analysis of cancer as a complex biological system. The integration of experimental biology with mathematical modeling will result in new insights in the biology and new approaches to the management of cancer.

'''Cher Ami''' ([[French language|French]] for "dear friend", in the [[Grammatical gender|masculine]]) was a female [[homing pigeon]] who had been donated by the pigeon fanciers of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for use by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in [[France]] during [[World War I]] and had been trained by American pigeoners. She is most famous for delivering a message from [[Lost Battalion (World War I)|an encircled battalion]] despite serious injuries during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/marotta47/256588828/ | title = Cher Ami "Dear Friend" WWI | publisher = Flickr| accessdate = 2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I service==
On October 3, 1918, [[Charles White Whittlesey|Major Charles White Whittlesey]] and more than 194 men were trapped in a small depression on the side of the hill behind enemy lines without food or ammunition. They were also beginning to receive [[friendly fire]] from allied troops who did not know their location. Surrounded by the Germans, many were killed and wounded in the first day and by the second day, merely 194{{Verify source|date=May 2011}}&lt;!-- does not compute with data given in main article --&gt; men were still alive and not captured. Because his runners were consistently intercepted or killed by the Germans, Whittlesey began dispatching messages by pigeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/05/for-heavens-sake-stop-it.html | title = The 'Stop It' Telegram | publisher = www.lettersofnote.com | accessdate = 2010-05-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The pigeon carrying the first message, "Many wounded. We cannot evacuate." was shot down. A second bird was sent with the message, "Men are suffering. Can support be sent?" That pigeon also was shot down. After another pigeon provided incorrect coordinates to headquarters, resulting in a barrage inadvertently targeting the battalion, "Cher Ami" was dispatched with a note, written on onion paper, in a canister on her left leg,

{{quote|text=We are along the road {{sic|para|lell|hide=y|expected=parallel but misspelling is correct transcription of the note}} to 276.4. Our own artillery is dropping a barrage directly on us. For heavens sake stop it.}}

As Cher Ami tried to fly back home, the Germans saw her rising out of the brush and opened fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pigeoncenter.org/militarypigeons.html | title = Pigeons in Military History | author = Jim Greelis | publisher = World of Wings | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070825005152/http://www.pigeoncenter.org/militarypigeons.html | archivedate = 2007-08-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several seconds, she was shot down but managed to take flight again. She arrived back at her loft at division headquarters 25 miles (40&amp;nbsp;km) to the rear in just 25 minutes, helping to save the lives of the 194 survivors. She had been shot through the breast, blinded in one eye, and had a leg hanging only by a tendon.

Cher Ami became the hero of the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]]. Army medics worked to save her life. They were unable to save her leg, so they carved a small wooden one for her. When she recovered enough to travel, the now one-legged bird was put on a boat to the United States, with General [[John J. Pershing]] seeing her off.

==Awards==
The pigeon was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] Medal with a palm [[Oak leaf cluster|Oak Leaf Cluster]] for her heroic service in delivering 12 important messages in [[Verdun]]. She died at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, on June 13, 1919 from the wounds she received in battle and was later inducted into the Racing Pigeon Hall of Fame in 1931. She also received a gold medal from the Organized Bodies of American Racing Pigeon Fanciers in recognition of her service during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nationalpigeonday.blogspot.com/2008/03/history-of-cher-ami.html | title = History of Cher Ami | author = National Pigeon Day | accessdate = 2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man responsible for training and caring for the pigeon in the signal corps, Enoch Clifford Swain, was given an award for his service.

==Remembered==
To American school children of the 1920s and 1930s, Cher Ami was as well known as any human World War I heroes. Cher Ami's body was later mounted by a taxidermist and enshrined in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. It is currently on display with that of [[Sergeant Stubby]] in the [[National Museum of American History]]'s "Price of Freedom" exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmah/cherami.htm | title = Cher Ami - World War I Carrier Pigeon | publisher = Smithsonian Institution | accessdate = 2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''Convolutional Deep Belief Network '''(CDBN) is a type of [[deep learning|deep]] [[artificial neural network]] that is composed of multiple layers of [[Convolutional neural network|convolutional]] [[restricted Boltzmann machine]]s stacked together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Honglak |author2=Grosse, Ranganath |author3=Andrew Ng|title=Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/rgrosse/icml09-cdbn.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it is a hierarchical [[generative model]] for deep learning, which is highly effective in the tasks of [[image processing]] and [[object recognition]], though it has been used in other domains too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Honglak|title=Unsupervised feature learning for audio classification using convolutional deep belief networks|url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips09-AudioConvolutionalDBN.pdf |author2=Yan Largman |author3=Peter Pham |author4=Andrew Y. Ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The salient features of the model include the fact that it scales well to high-dimensional images and is translation-invariant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coviello|first=Emanuele|title=Convolutional Deep Belief Networks|url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/254-deep/emanuele.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDBNs use the technique of probabilistic max-pooling to reduce the dimensions in higher layers in the network. Training of the network involves a pre-training stage accomplished in a [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] layer-wise manner, similar to other deep belief networks. Depending on whether the network is to be used for discrimination or generative tasks, it is then "fine tuned" or trained with either back-propagation or the up-down algorithm (contrastive-divergence), respectively.

[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], first [[President of Turkey|President]] of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]], died at the [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], his official residence in [[Istanbul]], on 10 November 1938. His state funeral was held in the capital city of [[Ankara]] on 21 November, and was attended by dignitaries from seventeen nations. His body remained at the [[Ethnography Museum of Ankara]] until 10 November 1953, the fifteenth anniversary of his death, when his remains were carried to his final resting place at [[Anıtkabir]].

During 1937, indications of Atatürk's worsening health started to appear. In the early 1938, while he was on a trip to Yalova, he suffered from a serious illness. After a short period of treatment in Yalova, an apparent improvement in his health was observed, but his condition again worsened following his journeys first to Ankara, and then to Mersin and Adana. Upon his return to Ankara in May, he was recommended to go to İstanbul for treatment, where he was diagnosed with [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.

During his stay in İstanbul, he made an effort to keep up with his regular lifestyle for a while, heading the Council of Ministers meeting, working on the [[Hatay State|Hatay]] issue, and hosting King [[Carol II of Romania]] during his visit in June. He stayed on board his newly arrived yacht, ''[[MV Savarona|Savarona]]'', until the end of July, after which his health again worsened and then he moved to a room arranged for him at the Dolmabahçe Palace.

Atatürk's [[death certificate]], signed by nine medical professors, officially declared that the founder and President of the Turkish Republic had died at 09:05 local time on November 10, 1938 in the state residence of Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul from his long-lasting illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbul.gov.tr/?pid=397 İstanbul mayor's page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
Preparations started for the state funeral of Atatürk organized by the leading officials. However, no decision was made yet for the final resting place.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; The next day on November 11, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly|parliament in Ankara]] convened and elected [[İsmet İnönü]] as the new president.&lt;ref&gt;Türkiye'nin 75 Yılı, Tempo Yayıncılık, 1998, İstanbul, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious service ===

No religious funeral service was at first foreseen. However, his sister Makbule Atadan, who stayed at the palace for several days, insisted on a religious funeral service to be held in a [[mosque]], as is normally the case, before her brother's body was transferred to Ankara. She was subsequently convinced by the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|President of Religious Affairs]] Rıfat Börekçi that an [[Islamic funeral]] service may also be held outside of a mosque.

The [[Salat al-Janazah|funeral prayer]] was conducted at 08:10 local time in the morning of November 19 by Prof. Şerafettin Yaltkaya, Director of the Institute for [[Islamic Studies]], in Turkish, not in the traditional Arabic. During the religious ceremony, photographs were not allowed. The funeral prayer was attended by people who were close to him, some generals, religious officials, palace servants and [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Hafız]] [[Major]] Yaşar Okur, who served with Atatürk for fifteen years.&lt;ref name="h1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dosyalar.hurriyet.com.tr/hur/turk/98/11/10/gundem/04gun.htm |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |title=Atatürk'ün cenaze namazı  |date=1998-11-10 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="z1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/yazar.do?yazino=758216 |newspaper=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] |title=Atatürk'ün cenaze namazı neden camide kılınmadı? |author=Armağan, Mustafa |date=2008-09-28 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314014641/http://www.zaman.com.tr/yazar.do?yazino=758216 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Mehmet Kâmil Berk, one of the signers of the death certificate, bound Atatürk's jaw with a silk handkerchief and his [[big toe]]s with a bandage, as per [[Islamic funeral|Islamic rites]]. Since the burial would be delayed, his body was embalmed by pathologist Prof. Lütfi Aksu, who came for this purpose from the Gülhane Military Medical Academy (GMMA) in Ankara.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; His body then [[lay in repose]] while his sister [[Makbule Atadan]], high-ranking government officials and officers, and other influential people came at specified times to pay their respects.

Atatürk's body was put in a zinc-lined [[mahogany]] casket of [[Juglans|walnut wood]]. The flag-draped casket was placed on November 16&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bizimmektep.azbuz.ekolay.net/blog/yazi/oku/5000000004723026/ATATURKUN-OLDUGU-AN-CEKILEN-FOTOGRAFI-VE-15-YIL-SONRA-TABUTUNUN-ACILDIGI-O-AN |publisher=AzBuz |title=Atatürk'ün Öldüğü An Çekilen Fotoğrafı ve 15 Yıl Sonra Tabutununu Açıldığı O AN... |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808012736/http://bizimmektep.azbuz.ekolay.net/blog/yazi/oku/5000000004723026/ATATURKUN-OLDUGU-AN-CEKILEN-FOTOGRAFI-VE-15-YIL-SONRA-TABUTUNUN-ACILDIGI-O-AN |archivedate=2011-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the reception hall of the palace on a catafalque.

For three days, thousands of mourning people paid their respects passing by the catafalque, where an honor guard of officers stood vigil.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

=== Transfer to the capital city ===
Following the funeral prayer, Atatürk's casket was taken out the Dolmabahçe Palace, placed on a [[limbers and caissons (military)|horse-drawn caisson]] and brought in front of a cortege to [[Gülhane Park]]. From [[Sarayburnu|Seraglio Point]], a torpedo boat forwarded it to the [[battlecruiser]] {{TCG|Yavûz}}. Turkish navy ships and foreign vessels escorted TCG ''Yavûz '' with Atatürk's casket aboard until off [[Büyükada]]. ''Yavûz'' carried then Atatürk's body to [[Izmit]].&lt;ref name="ab"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9905-yavuz-zirhlisinin-guvertesinde-19-kasim-1938.html |publisher=K-Atatürk |title=Yavuz zırhlısının güvertesinde (19 Kasım 1938) |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120903133411/http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9905-yavuz-zirhlisinin-guvertesinde-19-kasim-1938.html |archivedate=2012-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Atatürk's casket was transferred to a [[funeral train]] in Izmit that brought it to Ankara arriving the next day on November 20. In Ankara, President [[İsmet İnönü]], Speaker of the Parliament [[Abdülhalik Renda]], Prime minister [[Celal Bayar]], government ministers, Chief of the General Staff Marshal [[Fevzi Çakmak]], high-ranked officers and members of the parliament were all present during the arrival of the funeral train in the [[Ankara Central Station]].&lt;ref name="ab"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9903-izmitte-trene-verilirken-19-kasim-1938.html |publisher=K-Atatürk |title=İzmit’te trene verilirken (19 Kasım 1938) |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126234835/http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9903-izmitte-trene-verilirken-19-kasim-1938.html |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9902-ankaraya-varisi-20-kasim-1938.html |publisher=K-Atatürk |title=Ankara’ya varışı (20 Kasım 1938) |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127101124/http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9902-ankaraya-varisi-20-kasim-1938.html |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atatürk's casket was brought on a caisson to the [[War of Independence Museum|building]] of [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] in [[Ulus, Ankara|Ulus]], where it was placed on a catafalque in front of the parliament building for lying in state.  Thousands of residents of Ankara paid their respects.&lt;ref name="ab"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9901-ankarada-meclis-onunde-katafalkta-20-kasim-1938.html |publisher=K-Atatürk |title=Ankara’da Meclis önünde Katafalkta (20 Kasım 1938) |language=Turkish |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127074117/http://www.k-ataturk.com/kronolojik-album-1938-ve-sonrasi/9901-ankarada-meclis-onunde-katafalkta-20-kasim-1938.html |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer to Anıtkabir ==

=== Temporary resting place ===
Arrived at the Ethnography Museum of Ankara, Atatürk's casket was placed inside a white marmor sarcophagus specially built along with the covering Turkish flag.

Officials planned a monumental [[mausoleum]] for Atatürk at the topmost hill in Ankara, Rasattepe as it was called that time. During the fifteen years required for the mausoleum's construction, the Ethnography Museum of Ankara became Atatürk's temporary resting place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Faces of the state: secularism and public life in Turkey |author=Navaro-Yashin, Yael |year=2002 |page=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Anitkabir}}
After completion of Anıtkabır in 1953, his sarcophagus was opened and his casket was taken out with the help of a [[crane (machine)|trispastos]] in the presence of his sister Makbule Atadan, President [[Celal Bayar]], Parliament speaker [[Refik Koraltan]], Prime Minister [[Adnan Menderes]], Chief of General Staff Nuri Yamut, [[Abdülhalik Renda]] and some other high officials. The casket was placed on a catafalque. Pathologist Prof. Kamile Şevki Mutlu from the Faculty of Medicine at [[Ankara University]] was tasked by Kemal Aygün, the governor of Ankara, with the opening of the casket, the inspection of the remains and the supervision of the preparations for the subsequent burial, which is required by funeral traditional customs. On November 9, her colleagues Dr. Cahit Özen and Dr. Şeref Yazgan and ten teachers of the technical vocational high school assisted her at this operation attended by high state officials.&lt;ref name="ab"/&gt;

After opening of the casket's zinc lining, a brown plastic sack holding his remains came into appearance supported by wood splints. Following the removal of the plastic sack and the [[shroud]] inside wrapping his body, it was seen that Atatürk's body remained intact and unputrified thanks to the perfect embalming by Prof. Lütfi Aksu, who died in 1951. A sample of the embalming chemical used was found in the casket in a sealed bottle, labeled with the chemical's description.&lt;ref name="ab"/&gt;

The dignitaries present climbed one by one to the catafalque and looked at Atatürk's face. Following the advice of Mutlu, the casket was closed again after treatment of the remains with a special fixator and wrapping in shroud again.&lt;ref name="ab"/&gt;

On November 10, the 15th anniversary of Atatürk's death, his flag-covered casket was taken out the Ethnography Museum and carried on the shoulders of twelve soldiers onto a caisson. 138 young reserve officers in a procession that stretched for two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) including the President, the Premier, every Cabinet minister, every parliamentary deputy, every provincial governor and every foreign diplomat, while at the same time 21 million Turks stood silently and motionless for five minutes all over the country.&lt;ref name=burial&gt;{{cite news | title=The Burial of Atatürk| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860125,00.html | work=Time Magazine | pages= 37–39 | date=November 23, 1953 | accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One admiral guarded a velvet cushion which bore the Medal of Independence; the only decoration, among many others held, that Atatürk preferred to wear. The Father of the Turks finally came to rest at his mausoleum, the [[Anıtkabir]]. An official noted: {{quote|I was on active duty during his funeral, when I shed bitter tears at the finality of death. Today I am not sad, for 15 years have taught me that Atatürk will never die.&lt;ref name=burial/&gt;}}

In the cortege, the leaders of different religious communities in Turkey as the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarch]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Patriarch]], [[Bishop|Roman Catholic Bishop]] and [[Hakham Bashi|Jewish Chief Rabbi]] marched along with the [[Muslim]] President of Religious Affairs of Turkey.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

'''Diastasis symphysis pubis''' is the separation of normally joined [[pubic bone]]s, as in the dislocation of the bones, without a fracture.

==Cause==

External forces such as falling from a horse or a car accident can result in this type of injury to the symphysis pubis.
== Diagnosis ==

This abnormally wide gap can be [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] by [[radiology|radiologic]] studies such as [[x-ray]], [[MRI]], [[CT scan]] or [[bone scan]]. Manual testing by a healthcare professional can also be used. The patient is placed in various positions and pressure is applied in such a way that it provokes pain and maybe movement in the pubis.
===Differential diagnosis===
*In [[Bladder exstrophy|bladder extrophy]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartleby.com/107/255.html (end of page)&lt;/ref&gt; there is a gap between the pubis, which are joined by a strong interpubic ligament.

=== X-ray ===
[[File:Diastasis symphysis pubis nevit.jpg|thumbnail|Separation of symphysis pubis (diastasis)]]
An X-ray film will show a marked gap between the pubic bones, normally there is a 4–5&amp;nbsp;mm gap but in [[pregnancy]], [[hormone|hormonal]] influences cause relaxation of the connecting [[ligaments]] and the bones separate up to 9&amp;nbsp;mm. To demonstrate instability of the joint the patient is required to stand in the "flamingo" position, (standing with weight on one leg and the other bent).&lt;ref&gt;An Analysis of Pubis Symphysis Misalignment Using Plain Film Radiography Ruch WJ, Ruch BM.  J Manipulative Physiol Ther.  2005;28(5):330-335&lt;/ref&gt; A vertical displacement of more than 1&amp;nbsp;cm is an indicator of symphysis pubis instability.&lt;ref&gt;Vertically Unstable Pelvic Fractures Fixed with Percutaneous Iliosacral Screws: Does Posterior Injury Predict Fixation Failure?

Jones, MD; Shelly Whitlock, CCRA; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX&lt;/ref&gt; A displacement of more than 2&amp;nbsp;cm usually indicates involvement of the sacroiliac joints.

"'''Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep'''" is a [[poem]] written in 1932 by [[Mary Elizabeth Frye]]. Although the origin of the poem was disputed until later in her life, Mary Frye's authorship was confirmed in 1998 after research by [[Abigail Van Buren]], a newspaper columnist.&lt;ref name="timesobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mary E. Frye|date=5 November 2004|newspaper=The Times|location=London, United Kingdom|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2077955.ece|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There have been many claimants to the poem's authorship, including attributions to traditional and Native American origins. ''[[Dear Abby]]'' author [[Pauline Phillips|Abigail Van Buren]] researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that [[Mary Elizabeth Frye]], who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, but she had been warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never had the chance to "stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on a brown paper shopping bag. Later she said that the words "just came to her" and expressed what she felt about life and death.&lt;ref name="timesobit"/&gt;

Frye circulated the poem privately, never publishing or copyrighting it. She wrote other poems, but this, her first, endured. Her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' stated that she was the author of the famous poem, which has been recited at funerals and on other appropriate occasions around the world for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary|journal=London Magazine|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was introduced to many in the United Kingdom when it was read by the father of a soldier killed by a bomb in [[Northern Ireland]]. The soldier's father read the poem on BBC radio in 1995 in remembrance of his son, who had left the poem among his personal effects in an envelope addressed 'To all my loved ones'.

The poem is common reading for funerals.

==BBC poll==
To coincide with National Poetry Day 1995, the British television programme ''The Bookworm'' conducted a poll to discover the nation's favourite poems, and subsequently published the winning poems in book form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Nation's Favourite Poems| year=1996| publisher=BBC Books| isbn=978-0-563-38782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book's preface stated that "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" was "the unexpected poetry success of the year from Bookworm's point of view"; the poem had "provoked an extraordinary response... the requests started coming in almost immediately and over the following weeks the demand rose to a total of some thirty thousand. In some respects it became the nation's favourite poem by proxy... despite it being outside the competition."&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Stephens. [http://www.royblakeley.name/larry_blakeley/poetry/who_did_write_Geoff_Stephens200210.pdf "Who DID Write the Nation's Favourite Poem?"] October 2002. Retrieved November 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This was all the more remarkable, since the name and nationality of the American poet did not become known until several years later. In 2004 ''[[The Times]]'' wrote: "The verse demonstrated a remarkable power to soothe loss. It became popular, crossing national boundaries for use on bereavement cards and at funerals regardless of race, religion or social status".&lt;ref name="timesobit"/&gt;

==Translations==
The poem has been translated into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: "Gråt ej vid min grav..." Translated, it reads: "Do not weep at my grave - I am not there / I am in the sun's reflection in the sea / I am in the wind's play above the grain fields / I am in the autumn's gentle rain / I am in the [[Milky Way]]'s string of stars / And when on an early morning you are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again." (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: "I am not dead. I only left".)

Every so often the poem and similar variations appear in death and funeral announcements in Swedish morning papers (such as ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' August 14, 2010). On August 29, 2010, the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' carried the following short English version: "I am thousand winds that blow / I am the diamond glints on snow / I am the sunlight, I am the rain / Do not stand on my grave and cry / I am not there / I did not die".

==Derivative works==
Several notable choral compositions, pop songs, and other creative works have been based on "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep", adapting lines from Frye's poem as lyrics.

*''The Better Angels of Our Nature'' (song by Monks of Doom): Parts of "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" are interpolated with the lyrics to the rock song "The Better Angels of Our Nature," from the 1991 [[Monks of Doom]] album ''Meridian.''
*''Requiem'' (composition by Eleanor Joanne Daley): [[Eleanor Joanne Daley]]'s ''Requiem'' (1993) includes a movement titled "In Remembrance", which uses the poem as its text. The movement has also been published as a stand-alone work.
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (Epitaph by Maria Newman): The poem was set by violinist/violist &amp; composer [[Maria Newman]] in 1998 for soprano, violin, viola &amp; piano and subsequently set in 2014 for mezzo-soprano, violin, viola &amp; piano. It is part of Newman's  song cycle, [[Songs On Motherhood]] in G Major, Op. 36, No. 2: V. In Newman's setting the poem clearly states that death is not an end, but a metamorphosis that makes possible a melding with our physical earth and metaphysical surroundings. In this final movement, the voice emerges with a prayerful plainchant, as the tutti ensemble blossoms into the movement proper.
*"The Ballad of Mairéad Farrell" (song by Seanchai and the Unity Squad): On [[Seanchai and the Unity Squad]]'s 1998 album ''Rebel Hip Hop'', the song "The Ballad of Mairéad Farrell" tells the story of [[Mairéad Farrell]], a member of the [[Irish Republican Army]], and her imprisonment and eventual death at the hands of British security forces in [[Gibraltar]]. The song uses the opening couplet from the poem, and alters the closing couplet to say, "Do not stand at my grave and cry / When Ireland lives, I do not die."
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (song by Alias Grace): On ''Embers'', the 1998 debut album by British ambient folk duo Alias Grace ([[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]] and Sandra O'Neill), the closing track is a straight setting of the original poem for piano, voice, guitar and [[Chapman Stick]].
*"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" (composition by Paul K. Joyce): At the request of a friend who had been diagnosed with cancer, composer [[Paul K. Joyce]] wrote a song for her funeral, setting the text of "Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep" to music. Joyce subsequently incorporated the composition into a larger [[oratorio]] (1998) and the score for a [[BBC]] adaptation of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesnowqueenpkj.com/ |title=The Snow Queen - A magical adventure told through songs and poems.

'''''Drive-Thru''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film|horror]] [[black comedy]] film, directed by Brendan Cowles and Shane Kuhn, starring [[Leighton Meester]] and [[Nicholas D'Agosto]]. It is set in [[Orange County, California]] and involves an [[evil clown]] as a [[serial killer]]. The film was released [[direct-to-video]] on May 29, 2007.

==Plot==
{{Plot|film|date=November 2017}}
Brandon Meeks (Edward DeRuiter), Tony (Haven Lamoureux) and their girlfriends, Brittany (Jessica Landon) and Tiffany (Nicole Cavazos) arrive at the fast food restaurant "Hella Burger". Upon placing an order at the drive-thru, the group are introduced to the restaurant's mascot, Horny the Clown (voiced by Gordon Clapp) via intercom. The group is continuously insulted after Brandon mouths off to him, causing a furious Tony to enter.  He searches the restaurant and hears a commotion coming from the kitchen. After looking around in the walk-in cooler, Horny suddenly jumps out and attacks him across the room before dunking him face first in the deep fryer. Brandon soon enters, only to find Tony dead in the deep fryer with his face burnt off, much to his horror. He is then attacked and murdered by Horny with a [[Cleaver (knife)|meat cleaver]]. Horny then proceeds outside and brutally murders Brittany and Tiffany when they discover the bodies of their boyfriends in the backseat.

Meanwhile, Mackenzie ([[Leighton Meester]]) is having a house party with her boyfriend Fisher ([[Nicholas D'Agosto]]), and friends Val (Sita Young), Van ([[Penn Badgley]]) and Starfire ([[Rachael Bella]]). The group find a [[ouija board]] and decide to ask it what their future will hold, to which the ouija board spells out "N1KLPL8", a message that is unclear until the next day when the group see a news bulletin, showing the message is the license plate on Brandon's car. The following day at school, Val is ambushed by Horny in the locker room. Mackenzie complains that someone stole her camera at the party, but after school the janitor, Eddie ([[Sean Whalen]]), gives her the camera.

Mackenzie stays behind to develop the photos, and discovers that they show the deaths of the four murdered teenagers. Horny chases Mackenzie into the gymnasium, where she finds Val's head has been placed in a modified microwave, that when turned on causes her head to explode. Horny chases Mackenzie throughout the school, where she finds Lenny has been hanged, before bumping into a police officer, who fails to find any bodies. Mackenzie is taken down to the police station with her mom, Marcia ([[Melora Hardin]]) and dad, Bill ([[Paul Ganus]]) to be questioned by Detective Brenda Chase ([[Lola Glaudini]]) and Detective Dwayne Crockers ([[Larry Joe Campbell]]). The two detectives don't believe Mackenzie's story, but do suspect Lenny as the killer.

The next day, the detectives visit Jack Benjamin (John Gilbert), the owner of Hella Burger, who proves to be no help in solving the case. That night, Mackenzie and Fisher get ready to work at a carnival's haunted house. As they work, they have an argument with Chad ([[Tyler King]]) and Tina (Maliabeth Johnson), before they go into the ride. Suddenly, the lights are switched off and Chad is decapitated, before Tina is stabbed to death by Horny. Mackenzie and Starfire enter the haunted house after it breaks down. They find Fisher in a state of shock after witnessing the murders.

Mackenzie goes to visit Fisher in the hospital with Marcia. Mackenzie becomes annoyed with Marcia as she believes she is hiding something from her, as all the murdered teenagers are the children of her old high-school friends. Detective Chase overhears this and questions Tina's father, Bert ([[Robert Curtis Brown]]).

As Mackenzie arrives home, Marcia tells her that when she was young, she and her friends accidentally murdered Archie Benjamin (Van De La Plante), Jack Benjamin's son, on his 18th birthday at Hella Burger, and now his vengeful spirit has returned from the dead to get revenge. Mackenzie and Fisher are next attacked, resulting in Mackenzie being knocked unconscious and Fisher being cornered. Fisher manages to unmask Horny, who makes Fisher's eyes go bloody red after making eye contact with him before hurling him through a window. Meanwhile, Detective Chase and Detective Crockers come to the house and find Jack Benjamin behind his own bed, trying to hide from Archie.

Mackenzie wakes up in Hella Burger, tied to a chair with her mouth gagged with duct tape and surrounded by her murdered friends. A birthday cake is in front of her, as it is now her 18th birthday. Horny appears and reveals his murderous plan before dousing her with gasoline and holds a lit candle close to her face, about to repeat what Marcia did to him years ago just as Marcia herself arrives in time to save her daughter. Marcia shoots the clown in the mouth but with no effect. He reemerges and pins Marcia to the floor. Mackenzie drinks a bottle of whiskey she had earlier. Horny torments her with another candle while cackling at her face to face, unaware that Mackenzie has whiskey in her mouth. She defeats him by spraying whiskey onto the flame, setting him on fire. Mackenzie and Marcia escape as Horny burns to death.

Mackenzie and Marcia rush to the hospital to see Fisher whose eyes are still bloodshot, revealing that Archie has possessed Fisher's body. Mackenzie goes in to see him only to find the window wide open and his discarded clothes thrown outside on the ground, implying that the nightmare is not over.  Detective Crockers places an order at the drive thru and Horny jumps onto the hood of his patrol car to kill him through the windshield.

==Release==
The film was released on [[DVD]] by [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment|Lionsgate]] on May 29, 2007 and in Canada by [[Maple Pictures]] that same day.&lt;ref name="allmovedvd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drive Thru (2007) - Brendan Cowles, Shane Kuhn, Gretchen Skogerson|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/drive-thru-v384038/releases|website=Allmovie.com|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
''Popcorn Pictures'' gave the film a negative review, writing, "Really hard to sit through despite the promise of a killer clown, ''Drive Thru'' is eighty-three minutes of pure fast food junk. Like a fast food burger, it may look good when you pick it up but as soon as you take your first bite, you realize you’ve made a horrible mistake and all you’ve got left is an ultimately fatty concoction of things that are bad for your health."&lt;ref name="ppreview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drive-Thru (2007)|url=http://www.popcornpictures.co.uk/drive-thru-2007/|website=Popcorn Pictures.co.uk|publisher=Popcorn Pictures|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dread Central]] panned the film calling the film's dialogue "painfully bad" and criticized the film's ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Condit|first1=Jon|title=Drive Thru (DVD) - Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4686/drive-thru-dvd/|website=Dread Central.com|publisher=Jon Condit|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[DVD Talk]] called it "routine slice and dice dreariness", criticizing its inadequate humor, "callous characterization", and lack of actual scares.&lt;ref name="dvdtalkrev"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibron|first1=Bill|title=Drive Thru : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28165/drive-thru/|website=DVD Talk.com|publisher=Bill Gibron|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eben Alexander III''' (born December 11, 1953) is an American [[neurosurgeon]] and author. His book ''Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife'' (2012) describes his 2008 [[near-death experience]] and asserts that science can and will determine that the brain does not create consciousness and that consciousness survives bodily death. Alexander is also the author of the 2014 book ''The Map of Heaven'' which builds on the claims in his previous book, and coauthor of the 2017 book ''Living in a Mindful Universe'' which describes his personal journey since 2008.

==Early life and education==
Alexander was born in Charlotte, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/best-seller-proof-of-heaven-author-remembers-winston-salem-roots/article_e3a4132a-3f3f-11e2-af95-001a4bcf6878.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He was adopted by [[Eben Alexander Jr]] and his wife Elizabeth West Alexander and raised in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with three siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wakehealth.edu/News-Releases/2004/Renowned_Neurosurgeon_Eben_Alexander_Dies_at_91.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9122126.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] (class of 1972), [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (A.B., 1975), and the [[Duke University School of Medicine]] (M.D., 1980). He completed his Neurosurgery residency at Duke University Medical Center in 1987 followed by a Cerebrovascular Neurosurgery fellowship at the Newcastle General Hospital in the United Kingdom in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vahealthprovider.com/print_report.asp?License_no=0101239440]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
Alexander has taught and had appointments at [[Duke University Medical Center]], [[Harvard Medical School]], [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]], and the [[University of Virginia]] Medical School, [[Boston Children's Hospital]], [[Dana–Farber Cancer Institute]] et al.{{sfn|Dittrich Aug 2013}}

While practicing medicine in Lynchburg at the Lynchburg General Hospital, Alexander was reprimanded by the Virginia Board of Medicine for performing surgery at an incorrect surgical site two times over the course of a month. In one instance, Alexander altered his operative report because he believed the surgery had diminished the patient's symptoms. He was sued by the patient for damages totaling $3 million in August 2008, but the case was dismissed by the plaintiff in 2009. As a result of the mishaps, Alexander lost his privileges at the hospital and was forced to pay a $3,500 fine to the Virginia Board of Medicine and complete ethics and professionalism training to maintain an unrestricted medical license in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/neurosurgeon-reprimanded-by-state-board/article_ad7ef3c2-f705-11e2-99b8-0019bb30f31a.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of his 2012 book ''Proof of Heaven'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine reported that Alexander had been terminated or suspended from multiple hospital positions, and had been the subject of several malpractice lawsuits and that he settled five malpractice suits in Virginia within a period of ten years.{{r|Esquire-Aug2013}}

==Writing career==
===''Proof of Heaven''===
In 2012, Alexander authored a semi-autobiographical book ''Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife'', in which he asserted that his self-experience of [[out of body]] and [[near-death experience]] (NDE), while in a [[meningitis]]-induced coma in 2008, proved that consciousness is independent of the brain and that death is a transition phase into another realm.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Eben (2012), ''Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], pg 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Eben (2012), ''Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], pg 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander said in a ''New York Times'' interview that he had preferred a title of "An N of One" (a medical trial size of one patient) instead of "Proof of Heaven". He said, believers in heaven were not happy with the title because, "This is not scientific proof."&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/books/dr-eben-alexanders-tells-of-near-death-in-proof-of-heaven.html|title=Dr. Eben Alexander’s Tells of Near Death in ‘Proof of Heaven’|last=Kaufman|first=Leslie|date=2012-11-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander's book was excerpted in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine cover story in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Eben (October 8, 2012), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/10/07/proof-of-heaven-a-doctor-s-experience-with-the-afterlife.html "Heaven Is Real: A Doctor’s Experience With the Afterlife"], ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander provided a slightly more technical account of the events described in his book in an article, "My Experience in Coma", in ''AANS Neurosurgeon'', the [[trade publication]] of the [[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eben Alexander III |year=2012 |title=My Experience in Coma |journal=AANS Neurosurgeon |volume=21 |number=2 |url=http://www.aansneurosurgeon.org/210212/6/1611 |accessdate=November 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527094428/http://www.aansneurosurgeon.org/210212/6/1611 |archivedate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the release of the book, he has presented hundreds of lectures around the world in churches, hospitals, medical schools, and academic symposia, besides appearing on TV shows including ''[[Super Soul Sunday]]'' with [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dr. Eben Alexander Says It's Time for Brain Science to Graduate From Kindergarten |author= Ingrid Peschke | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ingrid-peschke/near-death-experiences_b_4151093.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2013-10-24| accessdate = 2014-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== ''The Map of Heaven'' ===
Alexander's second book, ''The Map of Heaven: How Science, Religion, and Ordinary People Are Proving the Afterlife'', was published in October 2014, where he again asserted the existence of an afterlife and that [[Hard problem of consciousness|consciousness is independent of the brain]]. ''The Map of Heaven'' was number 12 on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list during the week ending November 2, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2014/11/02/paperback-nonfiction/?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Books&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fbooks%2Fbest-sellers%2F2014%2F10%2F19%2Fpaperback-nonfiction%2F&amp;region=Header&amp;module=ArrowNav&amp;version=Right&amp;pgtype=Reference |title=New York Times |last= |first= |date=2 Nov 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Living in a Mindful Universe''===
Alexander's third book, ''Living in a Mindful Universe: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Heart of Consciousness'', was coauthored with Karen Newell, cofounder of Sacred Acoustics. Published in 2017, the book discusses attempts to understand the true nature of consciousness backed by scientific findings and cultivating a state of harmony with the universe and our higher purpose. The authors also discuss awareness of spiritual realms and developing experience that leads to profound understanding for a more harmonious and peaceful world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/podcast/53-Inspired-Living-28387666/episode/living-in-a-mindful-universe-a-29303135/|title=Living In A Mindful Universe: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey Into The Heart Of Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.readings.com.au/products/24260301/living-in-a-mindful-universe-a-neurosurgeons-journey-into-the-heart-of-consciousness|title=Living in a Mindful Universe: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Heart of Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transformationtalkradio.com/episode/the-dr-pat-show-talk-radio-to-thrive-by-living-in-a-mindful-universe-a-neurosurgeons-journey-into-the-heart-of-consciousness-with-dr-eben-alexander,24810.html|title=The Dr. Pat Show: Talk Radio to Thrive By!

===Criticism and reaction===
In a 2013 investigation of Alexander's story and medical background, ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine reported that before the publication of ''Proof of Heaven'', Alexander had been terminated or suspended from multiple hospital positions, and had been the subject of several malpractice lawsuits, including at least two involving the alteration of medical records to cover up a [[medical error]]. He settled five malpractice suits in Virginia within a period of ten years.{{r|Esquire-Aug2013}}
''Esquire'' also found what it said were discrepancies with regard to Alexander's version of events in the book. Among the discrepancies, was that Alexander had written the cause of his coma was bacterial meningitis, despite his doctor telling the reporter that he had been conscious and hallucinating before being placed in a medically induced coma.&lt;ref name="Esquire-Aug2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-Jul2-13" /&gt;  In a statement responding to the criticism, Alexander maintained that his representation of the experience was truthful and that he believed in the message contained in his book. He also claimed that the ''Esquire'' article "cherry-picked" information about his past to discredit his accounts of the event.&lt;ref name="Forbes-Jul2-13"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/07/02/esquire-unearths-proof-of-heaven-authors-credibility-problems/ |title=Esquire Unearths 'Proof of Heaven' Author's Credibility Problems |author=Jeff Bercovici |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Proof of Heaven'' was also criticized by scientists, including [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] who described Alexander's NDE account on his blog as "alarmingly unscientific", and that claims of experiencing visions while his [[cerebral cortex]] was shut down demonstrated a failure to acknowledge existing brain science with little evidence prove otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://samharris.org/this-must-be-heaven/|title=This Must Be Heaven|last=Harris|first=Sam|authorlink=Sam Harris|date=October 12, 2012|access-date=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurologist]] and writer [[Oliver Sacks]] agreed with Harris, and argued that Alexander had failed to recognize that the experience could have been the result of his cortex returning to full function at the outset of his coma, rather than a supernatural experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver, [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/seeing-god-in-the-third-millennium/266134/ "Seeing God in the Third Millennium"], ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' (December 12, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Alexander responded to critics in a second ''Newsweek'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Eben Alexander |title=The Science of Heaven|url=http://www.newsweek.com/science-heaven-63823 |publisher=''Newsweek'' |date=November 18, 2012 |accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2000, Alexander located his birth parents but learned his birth mother did not want to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Burkhart, Jesse|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/best-seller-proof-of-heaven-author-remembers-winston-salem-roots/article_e3a4132a-3f3f-11e2-af95-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Best-Seller 'Proof of Heaven' Author Remembers Winston-Salem Roots|website=Journalnow.com (Winston-Salem Journal)}}&lt;/ref&gt; His birth mother eventually changed her mind and Alexander met his birth parents and siblings in 2007.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite web|author=Washburn, Mark|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9122126.html|title='Proof of Heaven' Author Discusses His Adoption at the Westin Uptown|website=Charlotte Observer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[England]] in 1831, Birch emigrated to Western Australia on the ''Parkfield'' in March 1841.  There he was apprenticed to [[George Shenton Sr]] as a [[pharmacist]].  From 1852 to 1853, he was an assistant at the Colonial Hospital (now [[Royal Perth Hospital]]).  He then went into partnership with his father and brother as pharmacists and grocers in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].  In May 1856 he married Anne Hymus; they would have eight children.

Birch began to take an interest in public life, becoming vice president of the [[Perth Workingmen's Association]] and chairman of the [[Swan Mechanics' Institute]].  In 1862 he was a founding director of the [[Perth Building Society]].  The following year he became a member of the [[City of Perth|Perth Municipal Council]], which position he held until his death.  He became a member of the Perth Board of Education, a director of the WA Bank, and in 1872 was captain of the [[Volunteer Rifle Corps]].

On 19 October 1870, Birch contested the Legislative Council's [[Electoral district of Perth (Legislative Council)|seat of Perth]], but was unsuccessful.  On 18 November 1873, he contested the seat again in a [[by-election]].  He won the seat, holding it until his death.  He died on 16 January 1875 as a result of injuries from a fire.

Nordic Institute of African Studies, 2000. pp116-117&lt;/ref&gt; a dominant pressure group and a leading women's coalition in Nigeria.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Adekogbe was born to a family from Ijebu-Ife in 1919. She studied at St Agnes Catholic Training School and Yaba College of Technology. She soon joined the civil service and rose to become an Assistant Inspector of Prices during World War II.&lt;ref name="Maitron"&gt;[http://maitron-en-ligne.univ-paris1.fr/spip.php?article170968  Brief Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political career===
The Women's Movement was formed in Ibadan in 1952. The group's objectives were universal suffrage, admission of women to Native Authority councils, the nomination of members to the Western House of Assembly, enrollment of more girls in secondary schools, a reduction in the bride price and controls over Syrian and Lebanese trading monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;Jega (2000) p116-117&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was sometimes aligned with the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]].&lt;ref name="Odim"&gt;Cheryl Johnson-Odim, For Women and the Nation: Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti of Nigeria. University of Illinois Press, 1997. p 101. {{ISBN|0-252-06613-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few or zero politicians and parties put forth women candidates in federal [[elections]] during the period, though women played a major role in [[electioneering]] at the time. The women groups were more likely used for gaining [[votes]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, African Women: a modern history, Westview Press. 1997.p173. {{ISBN|0-8133-2361-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, a women's conference was convened in [[Abeokuta]]. The [[Academic conference|conference]] contained all the major women's organization in the country. A leader of the assembly, [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti]], who was favorably disposed towards the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC), named the congregation: the Federation of Nigerian Women's Society. However, there was a battle of wills among the two prominent women at the assembly: Adekogbe and Kuti. Adekogbe lost, and left the assembly. Later, she supported an alliance with the women's league of the Action Group.&lt;ref&gt;Odim (1997) p101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
As a [[chieftain]] of the [[Yoruba people]] to which she belonged, she held the title of the '''Iyalaje''' of Ikija.

Her husband, L.A.G Adekogbe, was a [[civil servant]].

In the [[Pauline Epistles|Letters of Paul]] eternal life is achieved through [[Faith in Christianity#Faith in Jesus as belief.2C trust and reliance|faith in Jesus]], with [[Christian views on sin|sin]] as an obstacle along the path.&lt;ref name=Bock162 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mercer264 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mercer513 /&gt;]]
'''Eternal life''' traditionally refers to continued [[afterlife|life after death]], as outlined in [[Christian eschatology]]. The [[Apostles' Creed]] testifies: "I believe... the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting." In this view, eternal life commences after the [[Second Coming|second coming of Jesus]] and the [[Resurrection of the Dead#Christianity|resurrection of the dead]], although in the [[New Testament]]'s [[Johannine literature]] there are references to eternal life commencing in the earthly life of the believer, possibly indicating an [[inaugurated eschatology]].

According to mainstream Christian theology, after death but before the [[Second Coming]], the saved live with God in an [[intermediate state]], but after the Second Coming, experience the physical [[resurrection of the dead]] and the physical recreation of a [[the New Earth|New Earth]]. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states, "By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our body, transformed by reunion with our soul. Just as Christ is risen and lives for ever, so all of us will rise at the last day." &lt;ref name="CCL1016"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm#1016]&lt;/ref&gt; [[N.T. Wright]] argues that "God's plan is not to abandon this world... Rather, he intends to remake it. And when he does, he will raise all people to new bodily life to live in it. That is the promise of the Christian gospel" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Simply Christian |last=Wright |first=N.T. |authorlink=N.T. Wright |year=2006 |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=San Francisco |isbn=0060507152 |page=219 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 18, 2012--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Synoptic Gospel]]s and the [[Pauline Letters]], eternal life is generally regarded as a future experience, but the [[Gospel of John]] differs from them in its emphasis on eternal life as a "present possession".&lt;ref name=Bromiley161 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brenda87 &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XWj__iL0czgC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Images of Salvation in the New Testament''], by Brenda B. Colijn 2010 {{ISBN|0-8308-3872-4}} pages 87-90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond E. Brown]] points out that in the synoptic gospels eternal life is something received at the [[final judgment]], or a [[Age to Come|future age]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#10:30|Mark 10:30]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#18:8|Matthew 18:8-9]]) but the Gospel of John positions eternal life as a present possibility, as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#5:24|John 5:24]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=obj6XCWIX1AC&amp;pg=PA115 ''The Westminster Theological Wordbook of the Bible''] by Donald E. Gowan 2003 {{ISBN|0-664-22394-X}} pages 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, unlike the synoptics, in the Gospel of John eternal life is not only futuristic, but also pertains to the present.&lt;ref name=Mercer264 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromiley161 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brenda87 /&gt; In John, those who accept Christ can possess life "here and now" as well as in eternity, for they have "passed from death to life", as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#5:24|John 5:24]]: "He who hears my word, and believes him that sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."&lt;ref name=Mercer513 /&gt; In John, the purpose for the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]], [[Death of Jesus|death]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Glorification#Catholicism|glorification]] of [[Logos (Christianity)|The Word]] was to provide eternal life to humanity.&lt;ref name=Mercer264 /&gt;

==In the New Testament==
Scholars such as [[John H. Leith]] assert that eternal life is never described in detail in the [[New Testament]], although assurances are provided that the faithful will receive it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e913KYTEaDsC&amp;pg=PA296 ''Basic Christian doctrine''] by John H. Leith 1993 {{ISBN|0-664-25192-7}} page 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eerdmans &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qRtUqxkB7wkC&amp;pg=PA430 ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible''] 2000 {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 430&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as [[D. A. Carson]] suggest that eternal life is explicitly defined in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#17:3|John 17:3]], where Jesus says in his [[High Priestly Prayer]], "Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent." Carson says of this verse that "Eternal life turns on nothing more and nothing less than knowledge of the true God" and that it is "not so much everlasting life as personal knowledge of the [[Attributes of God in Christianity#Infinity|Everlasting One]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. A. Carson]], ''The Gospel According to John'' (Apollos, 1991), p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' on the other hand, contends that "the nature of eternal life is only sketched in its essential elements in the New Testament".&lt;ref name=Eerdmans /&gt;
[[File:Ostromir Gospel 1.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Ostromir Gospels|Ostromir]] Gospel of John, 1056]]
While the [[Synoptic Gospel]]s are seen as focusing on the proclamation of the [[Kingdom of God]], some scholars see eternal life as the central theme of [[Jesus]]' preaching in the [[Gospel of John]],&lt;ref name=Mercer264 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladd290 &gt;''A theology of the New Testament'' by [[George Eldon Ladd]] 1993 {{ISBN|0-8028-0680-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=eIdkM00EdlAC&amp;pg=PA290 pages 290–293]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PainHarrington /&gt; where receiving eternal life is seen to be synonymous with entering the Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ladd70&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eIdkM00EdlAC&amp;pg=PA70 ''A theology of the New Testament''] by [[George Eldon Ladd]] 1993 {{ISBN|0-8028-0680-5}} page 70&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian teachings, eternal life is not an inherent part of human existence, and is a unique gift from God, based on the model of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], viewed as a unique event through which death was conquered "once for all", permitting Christians to experience eternal life.&lt;ref name=Mercer513 /&gt; This eternal life is provided to believers, generally assumed to be at the [[resurrection of the dead]].&lt;ref name=Mercer513 &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA513 ''Mercer dictionary of the Bible''] by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 513&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Testament [[theology]], in addition to "life" (zoe, i.e. ''ζωὴ'' in Greek), there is also a promised spiritual life sometimes described by the adjective ''eternal'' (aionios i.e. ''αἰώνιος'' in Greek) but other times simply referred to as "life".&lt;ref name=Mercer513 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Westmin296 /&gt; In both John and Paul the possibility of attaining eternal life and avoiding the wrath of God is dependent on believing in Jesus, the [[Son of God]]. For John abiding in Christ involves love for one another, as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#15:9|John 15:9-17]], and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#5:24|John 5:24]]. The existence of divine love in believers, then facilitates the influence of the gospel on the world, and lead to widespread salvation.&lt;ref name=Mercer513 /&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 John#3:14|1 John 3:14]] then manifests "the already but not yet" acquisition of eternal life by referring to the acquisition of eternal life as a once for all (''ephapax'') event, and the role of love in attaining it: "We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death", somewhat reminiscent of the words of Jesus in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#5:24|John 5:24]].&lt;ref&gt;''1-3 John'' by Robert W. Yarbrough 2008 {{ISBN|0801026873}} page 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pauline letters===

In the [[Pauline epistles]], the oldest texts in the New Testament,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} eternal life becomes possible in the person of Christ, where by the grace of God and through faith in Christ humans can receive the gift of eternal life.&lt;ref name=Bock162 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Word Study'' by Darrell Bock 2006 {{ISBN|0-7814-3445-9}} page 162&lt;/ref&gt; For Paul (as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#6:8|Galatians 6:8]]) future eternal life arrives as a result of the indwelling of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] during the present life.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NHFfHulVTNMC&amp;pg=PA152 ''The Theology of Paul the Apostle''] by James D. G. Dunn 2006 {{ISBN|0-8028-4423-5}} page 479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google_a"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F6jLsrN8YSE] by John W. Yates 2008 {{ISBN|3-16-149817-8}} page 121&lt;/ref&gt; Paul views [[Christian views on sin|sin]] as an obstacle to attaining eternal life, as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#6:23|Romans 6:23]].
For Paul eternal life is a future possession and "the [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] goal towards which believers strive."&lt;ref name=Brenda87 /&gt; Paul emphasizes that eternal life is not merely something to be earned, but a gift from God, as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#6:23|Romans 6:23]]: "wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."&lt;ref name=Brenda87 /&gt; Romans 6:23 thus also counter-positions sin and eternal life: while sin results in death, those who are "in Christ" will reap eternal life.&lt;ref name=Hultgren264 &gt;''Paul's Letter to the Romans: A Commentary'' by Arland J. Hultgren 2011 {{ISBN|0-8028-2609-1}} page 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul also discusses the relationship of eternal life to the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]], stating that to be with the Spirit and to think with the Spirit leads to eternal life, e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#6:8|Galatians 6:8]]: :"he who sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life."&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; For Paul future eternal life arrives as a result of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit during the present life, and the inter-related statements about the present life, the Spirit and future life form a key element of the teachings on the topic in Galatians.&lt;ref name="books.google_a" /&gt;

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Timothy#1:16|1 Timothy 1:16]] characterizes Christians by reference to eternal life and calls the followers of Jesus: "an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life." and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Timothy#6:12|6:12]] advises them to "fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal".&lt;ref name=Brenda87 /&gt;

===Synoptic Gospels===
{{see also|Salvation (Christianity)}}
The [[Synoptic Gospels]] include fifteen occurrences of the word life, eight of these including the adjective eternal.&lt;ref name=Westmin296 &gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=obj6XCWIX1AC&amp;pg=PA298 The Westminster theological wordbook of the Bible''] by Donald E. Gowan 2003 {{ISBN|0-664-22394-X}} pages 296–298&lt;/ref&gt;

There are parallels in how the synoptics refer to "being saved" and John refers to eternal life, as in the table below:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xlWveEVuGscC&amp;pg=PA33 ''Three views on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels''] by Robert L. Thomas 2002 {{ISBN|0-8254-3838-1}} pages 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gospel of Luke, the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] begins with a question about eternal life in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#10:25|10:25]] when a lawyer asks Jesus what he needs to do to "inherit eternal life".

The [[Gospel of Matthew]] includes references to eternal life, in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#19:16|19:16]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#19:29|19:29]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#25:46|25:46]]. The reference in Matthew 19:16 is within the parable of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] which also appears in Mark 10:17–31 and Luke 18:18–30.&lt;ref name=Turner469 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} page 469&lt;/ref&gt; This parable relates the term "eternal life" to entry into the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref name=Turner473 &gt;''Matthew'' by David L. Turner 2008 {{ISBN|0-8010-2684-9}} page 473&lt;/ref&gt; The parable starts by a question to Jesus from the young man: "what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?" and Jesus advises him to keep the commandments, and then refers to entry into the "Kingdom of God" in the same context.&lt;ref name=Westmin296 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner473 /&gt;

===Johannine literature===
{{quote|''For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life''.|[[John 3:16]]}}
The Johannine concept of eternal life differs from the [[Synoptic gospels|synoptic view]].&lt;ref name=Bromiley161 &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yklDk6Vv0l4C&amp;pg=PA161 ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J''] by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 {{ISBN|0-8028-3782-4}} page 161&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannine writings]] specifically present the view of eternal life as not simply [[Futurism (Christianity)|futuristic]], but also pertaining to the [[Realized eschatology|present]], so those who hear the words of Jesus and trust in Yaweh can possess life "here and now" as well as in eternity, for they have "passed from death to life", as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#5:24|John 5:24]].&lt;ref name=Mercer264 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mercer513 /&gt; Overall, the New Testament balances the present and future with respect to eternal life: the believer has passed from death to eternal life, but this remains to be totally realized in the future.&lt;ref name=Eerdmans /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible summarizes this as follows: "The NT searches for a balance on eternal life between present and future - the believer has passed in Christ from death to eternal life, but this remains to be fully realized in God's future, specially in the Resurrection and new creation at the eschaton".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:End of 2 Peter and Beginning of 1 John in Alexandrinus.JPG|thumb|140px|left|[[First Epistle of John]] in [[Codex Alexandrinus]], 5th century]]
There are about 37 uses of the word life in the [[Gospel of John]] of which about half refer to eternal life.&lt;ref name=Mercer264 &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA264 ''Mercer dictionary of the Bible''] by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} Entry for "eternal life", pages 264–265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PainHarrington &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=231LfndVpPsC&amp;pg=PA195 ''1, 2, and 3 John''] by [[John Painter (theologian)|John Painter]], Daniel J. Harrington 2002 {{ISBN|0-8146-5812-1}} pages 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Westmin296 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Different authors provide slightly different counts for the use of the term life in John, e.g. 37 in ''The Westminster theological wordbook of the Bible'' vs 36 in Painter and Harrington's book&lt;/ref&gt; There are six appearances in [[1 John]].&lt;ref name=Mercer264 /&gt; The concept so permeates Johannine writings that in many cases one may just read ''life'' as ''eternal life''.&lt;ref name=PainHarrington /&gt;

Reformed evangelical theologian [[D. A. Carson]] sees {{bibleverse||John|5:24|NKJV}} as giving the "strongest affirmation of [[inaugurated eschatology]] in the [[Gospel of John|Fourth Gospel]]": it is not necessary for the believer to "wait until the [[End time|last day]] to experience something of resurrection life."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. A. Carson]], ''The Gospel According to John'' (Apollos, 1991), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Eldon Ladd]] points out that, like the [[Kingdom of God]], eternal life is "not only an eschatological gift belonging to the [[Age to Come]]; it is also a gift to be received in the old aeon".&lt;ref name=Ladd70 /&gt; In this context, the gift of eternal life in the old [[aeon]] in which sin and death are still present is contrasted with eternal life in the new aeon of life and righteousness, the [[World to Come]] to which the faithful will belong.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eIdkM00EdlAC&amp;pg=PA528 ''A theology of the New Testament''] by George Eldon Ladd 1993 {{ISBN|0-8028-0680-5}} page 528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&amp;pg=PA525 ''The international standard Bible encyclopedia''] by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1995 {{ISBN|0-8028-3784-0}} page 525&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:16|John 3:16]] God has provided the gift of eternal life to believers, the possibility of perishing (''απόληται'') remains if one rejects Jesus. According to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:36|John 3:36]], "He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him."

Towards the end of the Gospel of John ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#20:31|20:31]]), the purpose of writing the Fourth Gospel is stated as: "so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name".&lt;ref name=Ladd290 /&gt; This is often correlated to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 John#5:13|1 John 5:13]]: "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life."&lt;ref name=PainHarrington69 &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=231LfndVpPsC&amp;pg=PA71 ''1, 2, and 3 John''] by John Painter, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 {{ISBN|0-8146-5812-1}} pages 69–72&lt;/ref&gt;

John's Gospel positions ''eternal life'' around the person of ''Jesus'', the Christ.&lt;ref name=Aquinas&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vSbb6siLONoC&amp;pg=PA159 ''Reading John with St. Thomas Aquinas''] edited by Michael Dauphinais 2005 {{ISBN|0-8132-1405-X}} page 159&lt;/ref&gt; In the Johannine view Christ can reveal life to humans because he is life himself.&lt;ref name= Mercer513 /&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 John#1:2|1 John 1:2]]: "proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us" is compared to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:1|John 1:1]]: "and the Word was with God", referring to the [[pre-existence of Christ]].&lt;ref name=PainHarrington69 /&gt;

The term is used in the [[Gospel of John]] in the context of the ''[[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]'' and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#4:14|John 4:14]] states: "the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life."&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity'' by Paul Barnett 2002 {{ISBN|0-8308-2699-8}} page 312&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:51|John 6:51]] Jesus states that: "he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day." This has been transposed, not only into a relationship with Jesus in common with [[Christian Theology]] but also into the [[Eucharist]] as an element of obtaining eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6D3o6fZd67EC&amp;pg=PA268 ''New Testament Theology''] by Leon Morris 1990 {{ISBN|0-310-45571-5}} pages 267–269&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (item 1212) teaches that Christians are born through the sacrament of [[Baptism]] and receive the "food of eternal life" in the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1.htm Catechism item 1212]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:27|John 10:27–28]] Jesus states that: "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish." This refers to the personal, heart to heart relationship the Christian is expected to have with Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''You have words of eternal life'' by Hans Urs von Balthasar 1991 {{ISBN|0-89870-308-5}} page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use is in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#17:3|John 17:3]]: "And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, Jesus Christ", this usage relating to the "theme of life" in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref name=Stott53 &gt;''Revelation: The Triumph of Christ'' by John R.

==Roman Catholicism==
[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christians teach that there is a supernatural realm called [[Purgatory]] where souls who have died in a [[divine grace|state of grace]] but have yet to expiate venial sins or temporal punishments due to past sins are cleansed before they are admitted into [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Seventh-day Adventists==
Seventh-day Adventists believe that only God has [[immortality]], and when a person dies, death is a state of unconscious sleep until the resurrection. They base this belief on biblical texts such as Ecclesiastes 9:5 which states "the dead know nothing", and 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 which contains a description of the dead being raised from the grave at the second coming.

:"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." (cf. {{Bibleverse||Gen|2:7|KJV}})

The text of Genesis 2:7 clearly states that God breathed into the formed man the "breath of life" and man became a living soul. He did not receive a living soul; he became one. The New King James Bible states that "man became a living being". According to the Scriptures, only man received life in this way from God. Because of this man is the only living creature to have a soul.

:"And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field ... wherein is the breath of life." (cf. {{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:19|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|7:15|KJV}})

:"Both man and beast ... have all one breath, so that a man hath no preeminence above the beast."(cf. {{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|3:19|KJV}})

Of the many references to soul and spirit in the Bible, never once is either the soul or the spirit declared to be immortal, imperishable or eternal. Indeed, only God has immortality (1 Timothy 1:17; 6:16). Adventists teach that the resurrection of the righteous will take place at the second coming of Jesus, at which time they will be restored to life and taken to reside in Heaven.

==Jehovah's Witnesses==
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe the word soul (''nephesh'' or ''psykhe'') as used in the Bible is a person, an animal, or the life a person or animal enjoys. Hence, the soul is not part of man, but is the whole man—man as a living being. Hence, when a person or animal dies, the soul dies, and death is a state of non-existence, based on [[Psalms]] 146:4, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 18:4, and other passages.&lt;ref name="Watchtower2001"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is There Life After Death?|journal=The Watchtower|date=July 15, 2001|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2001520}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hell]] ([[Hades]]) is not a place of fiery torment, but rather the common grave of humankind, a place of unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Watchtower1993"&gt;Hell-Eternal Torture or Common Grave? ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1993, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Watchtower2002"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2002521|date=July 15, 2002|title=What Really is Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group, referenced as "the little flock" of 144,000 people, will receive immortality and go to heaven to rule as Kings and Priests with Christ during the [[Messianic Age|thousand years]]. As for the rest of humankind, after the [[final judgment]], it is expected that the [[righteous]] will receive eternal life and live forever on an Earth turned into a [[paradise]]. 

Those granted immortality in heaven are absolutely immortal and ''cannot'' die by any cause.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', 1 December 1963, 732, "The Gift of Immortality"&lt;/ref&gt; Even God himself wouldn't be able to kill them.&lt;ref&gt;"The Watchtower", 1 April 1956, 219, "Question From Readers"&lt;/ref&gt; They teach that Jesus was the first to be rewarded with heavenly immortality, but that [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 7:4 and Revelation 14:1, 3 refer to a literal number (144,000) of additional people who will become "self-sustaining", that is, not needing anything outside themselves (food, sunlight, etc.) to maintain their own life.&lt;ref&gt;''Insight on the Scriptures'' Vol. 1 p. 1196: "Incorruption"&lt;/ref&gt;

They make a distinction between immortality and eternal life in that humans who have passed the final judgement and were rewarded "eternal life" ''can'' still technically lose that life and die if they were ever hypothetically sin at some future point in time, though they do not succumb to disease or old age, due to their living forever still being subject to obedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006607|title=Questions From Readers — Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY|website=wol.jw.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also still continue to be dependent on food, water, air, and such to maintain life.&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower, April 1st, pgs. 30-31, Questions From Readers, "What is the difference between immortality and everlasting life?"

Though immortality is, in a sense, everlasting life, immortality apparently implies more than that its possessor will live forever. It seems to indicate a particular quality of life, and it is linked with incorruption. The Bible says about spirit-anointed Christians who receive the heavenly reward: “This which is corruptible [in its human body] must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality. But when this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and this which is mortal puts on immortality, then the saying will take place that is written: ‘Death is swallowed up forever.’”—1 Corinthians 15:53, 54.

Still, the Bible does not provide much detail about the quality of life termed immortality. We do know that mortal humans—even perfect humans having the prospect of endless life on earth—must eat and drink to maintain life, or they die and their bodies experience corruption. (Genesis 2:9, 15, 16) No doubt immortality involves a quality of life that does not need to be sustained like that. Thus it could be said that all who become immortal are not subject to death or that ‘death is master over them no more.’ That would harmonize, too, with their receiving incorruptibility, indicating that their spirit body or organism is inherently beyond decay, ruin or corruption. (Compare 2 Corinthians 5:1; Revelation 20:6.) In these ways a difference might be seen between immortality and everlasting human life.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, those who pass that final test are "guaranteed" to remain faithful throughout all eternity due to the test being perfect and designed to eliminate those who would ever misuse their free will.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' 1974 6/1 pp. 346-348; ''The Watchtower'' 1967 9/1 pp. 525; ''The Watchtower'' 1967 8/15 pp. 508-509; ''The Watchtower'' 1954 4/15 pp. 255 par. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latter Day Saints==
{{main article|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}
[[File:Plan of Salvation.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of the [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon plan of salvation]].]]
In Latter-day Saint ([[Mormonism]]) theology, the spirit and the body constitute the human soul. Whereas the human body is subject to death on earth, they believe that the spirit never ceases to exist and that one day the spirits and bodies of all mankind will be reunited again. This doctrine stems from their belief that the resurrection of Jesus Christ grants the universal gift of immortality to every human being.

[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], provided a description of the [[afterlife]] based upon a vision he received, which is recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]].&lt;ref name="Degrees of glory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/76 |title=Section 76 lds.org |publisher=Scriptures.lds.org |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 76th section of the [[Standard Works|LDS scripture]], the afterlife consists of three degrees or kingdoms of glory, called the [[Celestial Kingdom]], the [[Terrestrial Kingdom]], and the [[Telestial Kingdom]]. Other Biblical scriptures speak of varying degrees of glory, such as {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:40-41|KJV}}: "There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."

The few who do not inherit any degree of glory (though they are resurrected) reside in a state called [[outer darkness]], which, though not a degree of glory, is often discussed in this context. Only those known as the "[[Son of Perdition|Sons of Perdition]]" are condemned to this state.

==Other Christian beliefs==
The doctrine of [[conditional immortality]] states the human soul is naturally mortal, and that immortality is granted by God as a gift. The doctrine is a "significant minority [[evangelical]] view" that has "grown within evangelicalism in recent years".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eauk.org/theology/acute/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=9164 The Nature of Hell. Conclusions and Recommendations] by [[Evangelical Alliance]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sects who hold to the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]] also believe in a third realm called [[Limbo]], which is the final destination of [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s who have not been [[baptised]], but who have been innocent of mortal sin. Souls in Limbo include unbaptised [[infant]]s and those who lived virtuously but were never exposed to Christianity in their lifetimes. [[Christian Science|Christian Scientists]] believe that sin brought death, and that death will be overcome with the overcoming of sin.

The term ''homophobia'' and its usage have been criticized by several sources as unwarrantedly pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01371377|title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues|first1=William|last1=O'Donohue|first2=Christine E.|last2=Caselles|date=1 September 1993|publisher=|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177–195|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/BF01371377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
Although sexual attitudes tracing back to [[Ancient Greece]] (8th to 6th centuries BC to the end of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] (ca. 600 AD)) have been termed homophobia by scholars, the term itself is relatively new,&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herek |first=Gregory M. |date=April 2004 |title=Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Herek_2004_SRSP.pdf |journal=Sexuality Research and Policy: Journal of NSRC |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=6–24 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an intolerance towards homosexuality and homosexuals grew during the Middle Ages, especially by adherents of [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Eric|title=Homophobia (psychology and society)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1758377/homophobia|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptualizing anti-LGBT prejudice as a [[social issues|social problem]] worthy of scholarly attention was not new.  A 1969 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described examples of negative attitudes toward homosexuality as "homophobia", including "a mixture of revulsion and apprehension" which some called ''[[homosexual panic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Behavior: The Homosexual: Newly Visible, Newly Understood|journal=Time|date=October 1969|volume=94|issue=18|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,839116-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Kenneth Smith used ''homophobia'' as a personality profile to describe the psychological aversion to homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Smith1971&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith |first=Kenneth T |year=1971 |title=Homophobia: a tentative personality profile |journal=Psychological Reports |pages=1091–4 |volume=29 |issue=3 |issn=0033-2941 |oclc=100640283 |pmid=5139344 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1971.29.3f.1091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg also used it this way in his 1972 book ''Society and the Healthy Homosexual'',&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972&gt;{{cite book|title=Society and the healthy homosexual |last=Weinberg |first=George |year=1973 |publisher=Garden City, New York Anchor Press Doubleday &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-385-05083-8 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/434538701 |origyear=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; published one year before the [[American Psychiatric Association]] voted to remove homosexuality from its list of [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recalling APA's Historic Step |url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |first=Alfred M |last=Freedman |periodical=APA News |date=September 1, 2000 |accessdate=2010-08-21 |issn=0033-2704 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203759/http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |archivedate=November 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macionis2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |year=2005 |title=Sociology: a global introduction |first2=Kenneth |last2=Plummer |edition=3 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-128746-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=P4z3GgAgMFYC |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg's term became an important tool for gay and lesbian activists, advocates, and their allies.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"/&gt; He describes the concept as a medical [[phobia]]:&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972 /&gt;

In 1992, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], recognizing the power of the stigma against homosexuality, issued the following statement, reaffirmed by the Board of Trustees, July 2011:
"Whereas homosexuality ''per se'' implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) calls on all international health organizations, psychiatric organizations, and individual psychiatrists in other countries to urge the repeal in their own countries of legislation that penalizes homosexual acts by consenting adults in private. Further, APA calls on these organizations and individuals to do all that is possible to decrease the stigma related to homosexuality wherever and whenever it may occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.org/ps2011homosexuality |publisher=American Psychiatric Association|title=Position Statement on Homosexuality }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many world religions contain anti-homosexual teachings, while other religions have varying degrees of ambivalence, neutrality, or incorporate teachings that regard homosexuals as [[third gender]]. Even within some religions which generally discourage homosexuality, there are also people who view homosexuality positively, and some [[religious denomination]]s bless or conduct [[same-sex marriages]]. There also exist so-called [[Queer religion]]s, dedicated to serving the spiritual needs of [[LGBTQI]] persons. [[Queer theology]] seeks to provide a counterpoint to religious homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=614#queerspirit |title=Queer Spirituality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011751/http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=614 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] stated that [[Kim Davis]] "is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate [against [[homosexuality|same-sex]] couples]."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=October 15, 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=October 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Christianity and the Bible =====
{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality|The Bible and homosexuality}}
The [[Bible]], especially the [[Old Testament]], contains some passages commonly interpreted as condemning homosexuality or same-gender sexual relations. [[Leviticus]] 18:22, says "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." The destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] is also commonly seen as a condemnation of homosexuality. Christians and Jews who oppose homosexuality often cite such passages; historical context and interpretation is more complicated. Scholarly debate over the interpretation of these passages has focused on placing them in proper historical context, for instance pointing out that Sodom's sins are historically interpreted as being other than homosexuality, and on the translation of rare or unusual words in the passages in question. In ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex". She states that the Bible has no condemnation for "loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships" and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/|title=The "Gay" Princess Di Bible|date=2 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official teaching of the [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church regarding homosexuality]] is that same-sex behavior should not be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, a February 2012 [[Pew Research Center]] poll shows that Catholics support [[gay marriage]] by a margin of 52% to 37%.({{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Gay-Marriage-and-Homosexuality/Religion-and-Attitudes-Toward-Same-Sex-Marriage.aspx|title=Religion and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage&amp;nbsp;– Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|author=ANALYSIS February 7, 2012|date=2012-02-07|publisher=Pewforum.org|accessdate=2012-07-05}}) That is a shift upwards from 2010, when 46% of Catholics favored gay marriage.(Biden's support for gay marriage matches most Catholics' views, By Dan Gilgoff, CNN.com Religion Editor [http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/07/bidens-support-for-gay-marriage-matches-most-catholics-views/])&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church States that, "'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.'...They are contrary to the natural law....

===== Islam and sharia =====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Islam}}
In some cases, the distinction between religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia is not clear, a key example being territories under [[Islamic]] authority. All major [[Islamic sects]] [[Homosexuality and Islam|forbid homosexuality]], which is a crime under [[Sharia Law]] and treated as such in most [[Muslim]] countries. In [[Afghanistan]], for instance, homosexuality carried the death penalty under the [[Taliban]]. After their fall, homosexuality was reduced from a capital crime to one that is punished with fines and prison sentences. The legal situation in the [[United Arab Emirates]], however, is unclear.

In 2009, the [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]] (ILGA) published a report entitled ''State Sponsored Homophobia 2009'',&lt;ref name="ilga.org"&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2009.pdf ILGA: 2009 Report on State Sponsored Homophobia (2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029181019/http://www.ilga.org/statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2009.pdf |date=October 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden.

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], homosexuality was considered [[sodomy]] and it was punishable by death. Persecutions reached their height during the [[Medieval Inquisition]]s, when the sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were accused of [[fornication]] and sodomy, alongside accusations of [[Satanism]]. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman "The Guilt of the Templars" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] was influential in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of [[natural law]], arguing that "special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices."&lt;ref name="civ2"&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003. Page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bisexuality was accepted as normal human behavior in Ancient China,&lt;ref name="civ"&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; homophobia became ingrained in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] due to interactions with the Christian West,&lt;ref name="Kang1"&gt;Kang, Wenqing.

Despite there being no law in the [[communist]] People's Republic against homosexuality, "police regularly rounded up gays and lesbians." Other laws were used to prosecute homosexual people and they were "charged with hooliganism or disturbing public order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = History of Chinese homosexuality|date= 2004-04-01 | work = Shanghai Star| accessdate= July 3, 2009 |url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/01/content_319807.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] decriminalized homosexuality in 1922, long before many other European countries. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] effectively legalized no-fault divorce, abortion and homosexuality, when they abolished all the old [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] laws and the initial Soviet criminal code kept these liberal sexual policies in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unity and diversity in socialist law |last=Hazard |first=John N |author2=Columbia University.

Homosexuals were one of the many groups alongside Jews that were murdered during [[the Holocaust]].

This can include extreme repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel "normal" or "accepted." Other expressions of internalized homophobia can also be subtle. Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"/&gt; Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT people who support "compromise" policies, such as those that find [[civil union]]s acceptable in place of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Marriage amendments and psychological distress in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults.

Researcher Iain R. Williamson, in his 1998 paper "Internalized Homophobia and Health Issues Affecting Lesbians and Gay Men" finds the term ''homophobia'' to be "highly problematic" but for reasons of continuity and consistency with the majority of other publications on the issue retains its use rather than using more accurate but obscure terminology.&lt;ref name="Iain"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Iain R.|date=2000-02-01|title=Internalized homophobia and health issues affecting lesbians and gay men|url=http://her.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/97.full|journal=Health Education Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1093/her/15.1.97|issn=0268-1153|pmid=10788206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''internalized sexual stigma'' is sometimes used in place to represent internalized homophobia.&lt;!-- This sentence is grammatically awkward. I'm not sure how to phrase it better though. --&gt;&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt; An internalized stigma arises when a person believes negative stereotypes about themselves, regardless of where the stereotypes come from. It can also refer to many stereotypes beyond sexuality and [[gender role]]s. Internalized homophobia can cause discomfort with and disapproval of one's own [[sexual orientation]]. [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] or [[egodystonic]] homophobia, for instance, is a condition characterized by having a sexual orientation or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized [[self-image]], causing [[anxiety]] and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation. Such a situation may cause extreme repression of homosexual desires.&lt;ref name=Adams96 /&gt; In other cases, a conscious internal struggle may occur for some time, often pitting deeply held religious or social beliefs against strong sexual and emotional desires. This discordance can cause [[clinical depression]], and a higher rate of [[suicide among LGBT youth]] (up to 30 percent of [[non-heterosexual]] youth attempt suicide) has been attributed to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek&gt;Journal of Adolescent Health Care, Volume 9, Issue 2, March 1988, pp. 114–122, Mental health issues of gay and lesbian adolescents, John C. Gonsiorek, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapy, such as [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]], and participation in a sexual-minority affirming group can help resolve the internal conflicts, such as between religious beliefs and sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa /&gt; Even informal therapies that address understanding and accepting of non-heterosexual orientations can prove effective.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek /&gt; Many diagnostic "Internalized Homophobia Scales" can be used to measure a person's discomfort with their sexuality and some can be used by people regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Critics of the scales note that they presume a discomfort with non-heterosexuality which in itself enforces heternormativity.&lt;ref name=Adams96&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Adams HE, Wright LW, Lohr BA |title=Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal? |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=440–5 |date=August 1996 |pmid=8772014 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/105/3/440 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.105.3.440 }}Summarized in an [[American Psychological Association]] press release, August 1996: {{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html |title="New Study Links Homophobia with Homosexual Arousal" |accessdate=2017-04-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202035152/http://www.apa.org/releases/homophob.html |archivedate=February 2, 2004 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/books/lesbian-and-gay-psychology/n10.xml|title=Chapter 10: Internalized Homophobia: Conceptual and Empirical Issues in Measurement|last=Shidlo|first=Ariel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social homophobia ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:RyanHalligan.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Suicide of Ryan Halligan|Ryan Halligan]] committed suicide due to bullying which included receiving homophobic messages]] --&gt;
The fear of being identified as gay can be considered as a form of social homophobia. Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay. Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title= Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, homophobia is allegedly rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters that is considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] male, such as [[association football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change|title= Fans' culture hard to change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobic thoughts and feelings does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person. This interpretation alludes to the idea that a person may posit violent opposition to "the Other" as a means of establishing their own identity as part of the majority and thus gaining social validation.

Nancy J. Chodorow states that homophobia can be viewed as a method of protection of male masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-8166-0812-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disapproval of homosexuality and of gay people is not evenly distributed throughout society, but is more or less pronounced according to age, ethnicity, geographic location, race, sex, [[social class]], education, partisan identification and religious status.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"/&gt;  According to UK [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] charity [[AVERT]], religious views, lack of homosexual feelings or experiences, and lack of interaction with gay people are strongly associated with such views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.avert.org/hsexu3.htm|title= Prejudice &amp; Attitudes to Gay Men &amp; Lesbians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the works of authors who merely have the word "Gay" in their name ([[Gay Talese]], [[Peter Gay]]) or works about things also contain the name (''[[Enola Gay]]'') have been destroyed because of a perceived pro-homosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petras |first1=Kathryn |last2=Petras|first2=Ross|title=Unusually Stupid Americans (A compendium of all American Stupidity)|year=2003|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York|isbn=0-9658068-7-1|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attitudes about people who are homosexual may vary on the basis of partisan identification. [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] are far more likely than [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] to have negative attitudes about people who are gay and lesbian, according to surveys conducted by the [[National Election Studies]] from 2000 through 2004. This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or [[conservatism]] with respect to the traditional family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Democrats and Republicans—rhetoric and reality : comparing the voters in statistics and anecdotes |last=Fried |first=Joseph |year=2008 |publisher=Algora Pub |isbn=0-87586-605-0 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183179592 |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998 address, author, activist, and [[civil rights]] leader [[Coretta Scott King]] stated that "Homophobia is like racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood."&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Defender, April 1, 1998, front page&lt;/ref&gt; One study of white adolescent males conducted at the [[University of Cincinnati]] by Janet Baker has been used to argue that negative feelings towards gay people are also associated with other [[discriminatory]] behaviors.&lt;ref name=jetstudy&gt;{{cite news|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0rkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12|title= Homophobia, racism likely companions, study shows|work= Jet|date= January 10, 1994|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, hatred of gay people, [[anti-Semitism]], and [[racism]] are "likely companions."&lt;ref name=jetstudy /&gt; Baker hypothesized "maybe it's a matter of power and looking down on all you think are at the bottom."&lt;ref name=jetstudy /&gt; A study performed in 2007 in the UK for the charity Stonewall reports that up to 90 percent of the population support [[anti-discrimination laws]] protecting gay and lesbian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,,2086335,00.html |title=Majority support gay equality rights, poll finds|date=May 23, 2007|publisher=Guardian | location=London | first=Hugh | last=Muir | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least two studies which indicate that homophobia may have a negative economic impact for the countries where it is widespread. In these countries there is a [[Queer migration|flight]] of their LGBT populations —with the consequent loss of talent—, as well as an avoidance of [[LGBT tourism]], that leaves the [[pink money]] in LGBT-friendlier countries. As an example, LGBT tourists contribute 6,800&amp;nbsp;million dollars every year to the [[Spanish economy]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=David |title=The Hidden Cost of Homophobia in Africa |url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/in-the-news/the-hidden-cost-of-homophobia-in-africa/ |website= the Williams institute |language=en |access-date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as 2005, an editorial from the ''[[New York Times]]'' related the politics of ''[[don't ask, don't tell]]'' in the [[US Army]] with the lack of translators from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and with the delay in the translation of Arabic documents, calculated to be about 120,000 hours at the time. Since 1998, with the introduction of the new policy, about 20 Arabic translators had been expelled from the Army, specifically during the years the US was involved in wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Price of Homophobia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/20/opinion/the-price-of-homophobia.html |access-date=10 December 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=20 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M. V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], presented in March 2014 in a meeting of the [[World Bank]] the results of a study about the economical impact of homophobia in [[India]]. Only in health expenses, caused by depression, suicide, and [[HIV]] treatment, India would have spent additional 23,100 million dollars due to homophobia. On top, there would be costs caused by violence, workplace loss, rejection of the family, and bullying at school, that would result in a lower education level, lower productivity, lower wages, worse health, and a lower life expectancy among the LGBT population.&lt;ref name="Alimi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alimi |first=Adebisi |title=The development costs of homophobia |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/development-policy/development-costs-homophobia-302899 |language=en |date=19 June 2014 |access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, she estimated for 2014 in India a loss of up to 30,800 million dollars, or 1,7 % of the Indian [[GDP]].&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Badgett |first=M.V.

The LGBT activist Adebisi Alimi, in a preliminary estimation, has calculated that the economic loss due to homophobia in [[Nigeria]] is about 1% of its GDP. Taking into account that in 2015 homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 54 African countries, the money loss due to homophobia in the continent could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars every year.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

A study had been conducted regarding socioecological measurement of homophobia for all countries and its public health impact for 158 countries. They had found that prejudice against gay people the economic cost is $119.1 billion of GDP in worldwide. They had found Asian economical loss is 88.29 billion dollar for homophobia and for 8.04 billion dollar for latin America &amp; Caribbean. Economical cost of East Asia and middle asia is 10.85 billion dollar. Economical cost of Middle East and North Africa is 16.92 billion dollar. The researcher suggested that 1% decrease in the level of homophobia is associated with a 10% increase in the gross domestic product per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamontagne |first1=Erik |last2=d’Elbée |first2=Marc |last3=Ross |first3=Michael W |last4=Carroll |first4=Aengus |last5=Plessis |first5=André du |last6=Loures |first6=Luiz |title=A socioecological measurement of homophobia for all countries and its public health impact |journal=European Journal of Public Health |date=3 March 2018 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=967–972 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky023 |url=https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/28/5/967/4919666 |language=en |issn=1101-1262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to combat homophobia ==
[[File:Cologne Germany Cologne-Gay-Pride-2015 Parade-17b.jpg|thumb|LGBT activists at [[Cologne Pride]] carrying a banner with the flags of over 70 countries where [[LGBT rights by country or territory|homosexuality is illegal]].]]
Most international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994, the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] has also ruled that such laws violated the [[right to privacy]] guaranteed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In 2008, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] issued a statement which "urges States to do away with criminal penalties against [homosexual persons]." The statement, however, was addressed to reject a resolution by the UN Assembly that would have precisely called for an end of penalties against homosexuals in the world.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html|title= Statement of the Holy See Delegation at the 63rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity|date=18 December 2008|publisher=vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, described by CoE Secretary General as the first legal instrument in the world dealing specifically with one of the most long-lasting and difficult forms of discrimination to combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR277(2010)&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=DC&amp;BackColorInternet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorLogged=A9BACE|title = Council of Europe to advance human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons|date = 2010-04-01|publisher = coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat homophobia, the LGBT community uses events such as [[gay pride parade]]s and [[political activism]] (''See [[gay pride]]).'' This is criticized by some{{Who|date=July 2009}} as counter-productive though, as gay pride parades showcase what could be seen as more "extreme" sexuality: fetish-based and gender-variant aspects of LGBT culture. One form of organized resistance to homophobia is the [[International Day Against Homophobia]] (or IDAHO),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 Towards an international Day against Homophobia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217063659/http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 |date=2005-12-17 }}", April 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; first celebrated May 17, 2005 in related activities in more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm 1st Annual International Day Against Homophobia to be Celebrated in over 40 Countries on May 17]", May 12, 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211224159/http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm |date=February 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four largest countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia) developed mass media campaigns against homophobia since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|title=Campaigns against Homophobia in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=355 |accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public expression, legislation has been designed, controversially, to oppose homophobia, as in [[hate speech]], [[hate crime]], and laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Successful preventative strategies against homophobic prejudice and bullying in schools have included teaching pupils about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/26/gay-history-lessons-bullying-schools |title=Lessons on gay history cut homophobic bullying in north London school |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |first=Jessica |last=Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that anti-LGBT prejudice is immoral and goes above and beyond the effects on that class of people. Warren J. Blumenfeld argues that this emotion gains a dimension beyond itself, as a tool for extreme right-wing conservatives and fundamentalist religious groups and as a restricting factor on gender-relations as to the weight associated with performing each role accordingly.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992&gt;{{cite book|title=Homophobia : how we all pay the price |last=Blumenfeld |first=Warren J |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-7919-5 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24544734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Blumenfeld in particular stated:

{{quote|"Anti-gay bias causes young people to engage in sexual behavior earlier in order to prove that they are straight. Anti-gay bias contributed significantly to the spread of the AIDS epidemic. Anti-gay bias prevents the ability of schools to create effective honest sexual education programs that would save children's lives and prevent STDs ([[sexually transmitted diseases]])."&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992 /&gt;}}

Drawing upon research by [[Arizona State University]] Professor Elizabeth Segal, [[University of Memphis]] professors Robin Lennon-Dearing and Elena Delavega argued in a 2016 article published in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]'' that homophobia could be reduced through exposure (learning about LGBT experiences), explanation (understanding the different challenges faced by LGBT people), and experience (putting themselves in situations experienced by LGBT people by working alongside LGBT co-workers or volunteering at an LGBT community center).&lt;ref name="journaldosocialworkersapply"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delavega|first1=Elena|last2=Lennon-Dearing|first2=Robin|title=Do Social Workers Apply "Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself" to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transpersons in the South?|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2016|volume=63|issue=9|pages=1171–1193|doi=10.1080/00918369.2016.1150058|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2016.1150058|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of meaning and purpose ==

=== Distinctions and proposed alternatives ===
Researchers have proposed alternative terms to describe prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. Some of these alternatives show more [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]] while others do not include -''[[phobia]]'':

*''Homoerotophobia'', being a possible precursor term to ''homophobia'', was coined by Wainwright Churchill and documented in ''Homosexual Behavior Among Males'' in 1967.
*The etymology of ''homophobia'' citing the union of ''homos'' and ''phobos'' is the basis for [[LGBT history|LGBT historian]] Boswell's criticism of the term and for his suggestion in 1980 of the alternative ''homosexophobia''.&lt;ref name = BOS1980&gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: Gay people in Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century |first=John |last=Boswell |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Homonegativity'' is based on the term ''homonegativism'' used by Hudson and Ricketts in a 1980 paper; they coined the term for their research in order to avoid ''homophobia'', which they regarded as being unscientific in its presumption of motivation.&lt;ref name=Hudson1980&gt;{{cite book|title=A strategy for the measurement of homophobia. |last=Hudson |first=WW |last2=Ricketts |first2=WA |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |pages=357–72 |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=1980 |issn=0091-8369 |oclc=115532547 |doi=10.1300/J082v05n04_02 |pmid=7204951}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Heterosexism]]'' refers to a system of negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favour of opposite-sex sexual orientation and relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|author2=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/sup&gt; It can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[norm (sociology)|norm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/r_motclef/index800_1.asp |title=Avis au public |publisher=Granddictionnaire.com |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archivedate=2003-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore superior.
*''Sexual prejudice'' – Researcher at the [[University of California, Davis]] [[Gregory M. Herek]] preferred ''sexual prejudice'' as being descriptive, free of presumptions about motivations, and lacking value judgments as to the irrationality or immorality of those so labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herek GM |title=The context of [[Gay bashing|anti-gay]] violence: Notes on cultural and psychological heterosexism |journal=J Interpers Violence |volume=5 |pages=316–33 |year=1990 |doi=10.1177/088626090005003006|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herek |first=Gregory M. |title=The psychology of sexual prejudice |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=9 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Current_Directions_preprint.pdf |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229101852/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Current_Directions_preprint.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared ''homophobia'', ''heterosexism'', and ''sexual prejudice'', and, in preferring the third term, noted that ''homophobia'' was "probably more widely used and more often criticized." He also observed that "Its critics note that homophobia implicitly suggests that antigay attitudes are best understood as an irrational fear and that they represent a form of individual [[psychopathology]] rather than a socially reinforced prejudice."

=== Opposition to the term ''homophobia'' ===
People and groups have objected to the use of the term ''homophobia''.&lt;ref name="Banks2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banks|first=James A.|title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDDqLBBk7BcC&amp;pg=PA1093|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2012-05-24|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-8152-1|pages=1093–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Eric|title=On Brokeback Mountain: Meditations About Masculinity, Fear, and Love in the Story and the Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2IM8prnsxQC&amp;pg=PR42|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2008-03-31|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-2165-8|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warhol-DownHerndl2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhol-Down|first1=Robyn|last2=Herndl|first2=Diane Price|title=Feminisms Redux: An Anthology of Literary Theory and Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuisMJOOsbEC&amp;pg=PA196|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2009-11-30|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4620-9|pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Non-neutral phrasing ====
Use of ''homophobia'', ''homophobic'', and ''homophobe'' has been criticized as [[pejorative]] against [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights opponents]]. [[behavioral science|Behavioral scientists]] [[William O'Donohue]] and Christine Caselles stated in 1993 that "as [''homophobia''] is usually used, [it] makes an illegitimately pejorative evaluation of certain open and debatable value positions, much like the former disease construct of homosexuality" itself, arguing that the term may be used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument against those who advocate values or positions of which the user does not approve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William |last1=O'Donohue|first2=Christine |last2=Caselles |title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues |journal=J Psychopathol Behav Assess |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=September 1993 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0264m864t146585/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Gary Colwell stated in 1999 that "the boundary of the term 'homophobia' is made so elastic that it can stretch around, not just phobias, but every kind of rational fear as well; and not just around every kind of fear, but also around every critical posture or idea that anyone may have about the practice of homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gary Colwell|title=Turning the Tables with 'Homophobia' |work=[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]|publisher=Wiley |date=1999|jstor = 24354374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[Associated Press Stylebook]] was revised to advise against using non-clinical words with the suffix -phobia, including homophobia, in "political and social contexts." AP Deputy Standards Editor Dave Minthorn said the word homophobia suggests a severe mental disorder, and that it could be substituted with "anti-gay" or similar phrasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP nixes 'homophobia', 'ethnic cleansing'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/11/ap-nixes-homophobia-ethnic-cleansing-150315.html|last=Byers|first=Dylan|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Words with negative power|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-05/news/ct-oped-1205-page-20121205_1_homophobia-islamophobia-fear|first=Clarence|last=Page|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=5 December 2012|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP's decision was criticized in some media outlets, especially those in the [[Gay media|LGBT area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huffington Post discussion|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/05/associated-press-ban-homophobia-discussion_n_2245697.html|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=5 December 2012|first=Noah|last=Michelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that homophobia did not necessarily have to be interpreted in a strict clinical sense.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-ap-homophobia-style-book-20121128,0,2905541.story|title=No more 'homophobia'?

The term ''heterophobia'' is sometimes used to describe [[reverse discrimination]] or negative attitudes towards heterosexual people and opposite-sex relationships.&lt;ref name="noonan1999" /&gt; The scientific use of ''heterophobia'' in [[sexology]] is restricted to few researchers, notably those who question [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s sex research.&lt;ref&gt;''Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination of a People. An Investigation Into the Human Sexuality Research of Alfred C. Kinsey, Wardell B. Pomeroy, Clyde E. Martin, and Paul H. Gebhard'' by Judith A. Reisman and Edward W. Eichel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Dictionary of Sexuality'' by Robert T. Francoeur&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the existence or extent of heterophobia is mostly unrecognized by sexologists.&lt;ref name="noonan1999" /&gt; Beyond sexology there is no consensus as to the meaning of the term because it is also used to mean "fear of the opposite" such as in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]'s ''The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and Its Doubles'' (2001).

Referring to the debate on both meaning and use, [[State University of New York|SUNY]] lecturer Raymond J. Noonan, in his 1999 presentation to The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS) and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) Conference,&lt;ref name="noonan1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.bway.net/rjnoonan/Conf1999.html|title=Heterophobia: The Evolution of an Idea|author=Raymond J. Noonan|date=November 6, 1999|publisher=Dr. Ray Noonan’s 1999 Conference Presentations|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term heterophobia is confusing for some people for several reasons. On the one hand, some look at it as just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stephen M. White and Louis R. Franzini introduced the related term ''heteronegativism'' to refer to the considerable range of negative feelings that some gay individuals may hold and express toward heterosexuals. This term is preferred to ''heterophobia'' because it does not imply extreme or irrational fear.&lt;ref name="Franzini"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Heteronegativism?

'''Hyperhydricity''' (previously known as vitrification) is a [[Physiology|physiological]] [[malformation]] that results in excessive [[Tissue hydration|hydration]], low [[lignification]], impaired stomatal function and reduced [[mechanical strength]] of tissue culture-generated plants. The consequence is poor regeneration of such plants without intensive [[greenhouse]] acclimation for outdoor growth.&lt;ref&gt;Kei-ichiro U, Susan C and Kalidas S (1998). Reduced hyperhydricity and enhanced growth of tissue culture-generated raspberry (Rubus sp.) clonal lines by Pseudomonas sp. isolated from oregano. Process Biochemistry 33(4): 441-445.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, it may also lead to leaf-tip and bud [[necrosis]] in some cases, which often leads to loss of [[apical dominance]] in the shoots.&lt;ref&gt;Cassells A and Curry R (2001). Oxidative stress and physiological, epigenetic and genetic variability in plant tissue culture: implications for micropropagators and genetic engineers. Plant Cell Tissue And Organ Culture. 64(2-3):145-157&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the main symptom of hyperhydricity is translucent characteristics signified by a shortage of [[chlorophyll]] and high water content. Specifically, the presence of a thin or absent [[cuticular]] layer, reduced number of [[palisade cells]], irregular [[stomata]], less developed [[cell wall]] and large intracellular spaces in the [[mesophyll cell]] layer have been described as some of the anatomic changes associated with hyperhydricity.&lt;ref&gt;Franck T, Kevers C, Gaspar T, Dommes J, Deby C, Greimers R, Serteyn D and Deby-Dupont G (2004). Hyperhydricity of Prunus avium shoots cultured on gelrite: a controlled stress response. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 42: 519-527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The main causes of hyperhydricity in plant [[tissue culture]] are those factors triggering [[oxidative stress]]es such as high salt concentration, high [[relative humidity]], low [[irradiance|light intensity]], gas accumulation in the atmosphere of the jar, length of time intervals between [[subculture]]s; number of subcultures, concentration and type of [[gelling agent]], the type of explants used, the concentrations of microelement and hormonal imbalances.&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperhydricity is commonly apparent in [[liquid culture]]-grown plants or when there is low concentration of gelling agent. High [[ammonium]] concentration also contributes to hyperhydricity.&lt;ref&gt;Franck T, Kevers C, Gaspar T, Dommes J, Deby C, Greimers R, Serteyn D and Deby-Dupont G (2004). Hyperhydricity of Prunus avium shoots cultured on gelrite: a controlled stress response. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 42: 519-527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==

Hyperhydricity can be monitored by modifying the atmosphere of the culture vessels. Adjusting the relative humidity in the vessel is one of the most important parameters to be controlled. Use of gas-permeable membranes may help in this regard as this allows increased exchange of [[water vapor]] and other gases such as ethylene with the surrounding environment. Using higher concentration of a gelling agent, on top of the use of a higher-strength gelling agent may reduce the risk from hyperhydricity. Hyperhydricity can also be controlled by bottom cooling, which allows water to condense on the medium,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez-Tornero O, Egea J, Olmos E and Burgos L (2001). Control of Hyperhydricity in Micropropagated Apricot Cultivars. In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology. Plant. 37(2): 250-254&lt;/ref&gt; the use of cytokinin-meta-topolin (6-(3-Hydroxybenzylamino)purine)&lt;/9&gt;, the combination of lower [[cytokinin]] and [[ammonium nitrate]] in the medium, use of [[nitrate]] or [[glutamine]] as the sole [[nitrogen]] source  and decreasing the ratio of NH4+:NO3- in the medium.&lt;ref&gt;Bairu M, Stirk W, Dolezal K, Van Staden J (2007). Optimizing the micropropagation protocol for the endangered Aloe polyphylla: can meta-topolin and its derivatives serve as replacement for benzyladenine and zeatin? Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult 90:15–23&lt;/ref&gt;
In studies on calcium deficiency in tissue cultures of ''Lavandula angustifolia'', it was shown that an increase in calcium in the medium reduced hyperhydricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Machado, M.P.|first1=A.L.L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13908">'''Inclusion bodies''', sometimes called ''' elementary bodies''', are [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] or [[cytoplasmic]] aggregates of stable substances, usually proteins. They typically represent sites of viral multiplication in a [[bacterium]] or a [[eukaryotic]] cell and usually consist of viral [[capsid]] proteins. Inclusion bodies can also be hallmarks of genetic diseases, as in the case of neuronal inclusion bodies in disorders like [[frontotemporal dementia]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cruts M, Gijselinck I, van der Zee J, Engelborghs S, Wils H, Pirici D, Rademakers R, Vandenberghe R, Dermaut B, Martin JJ, van Duijn C, Peeters K, Sciot R, Santens P, De Pooter T, Mattheijssens M, Van den Broeck M, Cuijt I, Vennekens K, De Deyn PP, Kumar-Singh S, Van Broeckhoven C|title=Null mutations in progranulin cause ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17q21.|journal=Nature|date=2006-08-24|volume=442|issue=7105|pages=920–4|pmid=16862115|doi=10.1038/nature05017}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 August 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Inclusion bodies contain very little host protein, ribosomal components or DNA/RNA fragments. They often almost exclusively contain the over expressed protein and aggregation in inclusion bodies has been reported to be reversible. It has been suggested that inclusion bodies are dynamic structures formed by an unbalanced equilibrium between aggregated and soluble proteins of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. There is a growing body of information indicating that formation of inclusion bodies occurs as a result of intracellular accumulation of partially folded expressed proteins which aggregate through [[non-covalent interactions|non-covalent]] hydrophobic or ionic interactions or a combination of both.

Inclusion bodies are dense electron-refractile particles of aggregated protein found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic  spaces of ''E. coli'' during high-level expression of heterologous protein. It is generally assumed that high level expression of non-native protein (higher than 2% of cellular protein) and highly hydrophobic protein is more prone to lead to accumulation as inclusion bodies in ''E. coli''.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the case of proteins having [[disulfide bond]]s, formation of protein aggregates as inclusion bodies is anticipated since the reducing environment of bacterial [[cytosol]] inhibits the formation of disulfide bonds. The diameter of spherical bacterial inclusion bodies varies from 0.5–1.3&amp;nbsp;μm and the protein aggregates have either an amorphous or [[paracrystalline]] nature depending on the localization.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Inclusion bodies have higher density (~1.3&amp;nbsp;mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) than many of the cellular components, and thus can be easily separated by high-speed centrifugation after cell disruption. Inclusion bodies despite being dense particles are highly hydrated and have a porous architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Solubilization and refolding of bacterial inclusion body proteins|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172305703728|journal = Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering|date = 2005-04-01|pages = 303–310|volume = 99|issue = 4|doi = 10.1263/jbb.99.303|first = Surinder Mohan|last = Singh|first2 = Amulya Kumar|last2 = Panda|pmid = 16233795|subscription = Yes|quote = Inclusion bodies are dense electron-refractile particles of aggregated protein found in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic  spaces of E. coli during high-level expression of heterologous protein.

==Composition==
Inclusion bodies have a non-unit lipid membrane. Protein inclusion bodies are classically thought to contain [[misfolded protein]].  However, this has recently been contested, as green fluorescent protein will sometimes fluoresce in inclusion bodies, which indicates some resemblance of the native structure and researchers have recovered folded protein from inclusion bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Biochem Biophys Res Com 328(2005) 189-197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Protein Eng 7(1994) 131-136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biochem Biophys Res Comm 312 (2003) 1383-1386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of formation==
When [[genes]] from one organism are expressed in another organism the resulting protein sometimes forms inclusion bodies. This is often true when large evolutionary distances are crossed:  a [[cDNA]] isolated from [[Eukarya]] for example, and expressed as a [[recombinant gene]] in a [[prokaryote]] risks the formation of the inactive aggregates of protein known as inclusion bodies. While the [[cDNA]] may properly code for a translatable [[mRNA]], the [[protein]] that results will emerge in a foreign microenvironment. This often has fatal effects, especially if the intent of [[cloning]] is to produce a biologically active [[protein]]. For example, [[eukaryotic]] systems for [[carbohydrate]] modification and [[membrane transport]] are not found in [[prokaryotes]].  The internal microenvironment of a [[prokaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] ([[pH]], [[osmolarity]]) may differ from that of the original source of the [[gene]]. Mechanisms for folding a [[protein]] may also be absent, and [[hydrophobic residues]] that normally would remain buried may be exposed and available for interaction with similar exposed sites on other [[ectopic expression|ectopic]] proteins. Processing systems for the cleavage and removal of internal [[peptides]] would also be absent in [[bacteria]].  The initial attempts to clone [[insulin]] in a [[bacterium]] suffered all of these deficits. In addition, the fine controls that may keep the concentration of a [[protein]] low will also be missing in a [[prokaryotic cell]], and [[overexpression]] can result in filling a cell with [[ectopic expression|ectopic]] protein that, even if it were properly folded, would [[precipitate]] by saturating its environment.&lt;sup&gt;{[[citation needed]]}&lt;/sup&gt;

==Viral inclusion bodies==

Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic (acidophilic)-
* [[Negri bodies]] in [[Rabies]]
* Guarnieri bodies in [[vaccinia]], [[variola|variola (smallpox)]]
* Paschen bodies in [[variola|variola (smallpox)]]
* Bollinger bodies in [[fowlpox]]

Depending on the plant and the plant virus family these inclusions can be found in epidermal cells, mesophyll cells, and stomatal cells when plant tissue is properly stained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Materials and Methods for the Detection of Viral Inclusions |url=http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/pdc/Inclusionpage/Howto.html |publisher=University of Florida |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219032419/http://plantpath.ifas.ufl.edu/pdc/Inclusionpage/Howto.html |archivedate=February 19, 2012 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion bodies in Erythrocytes==
Normally a [[red blood cell]] does not contain inclusions in the cytoplasm. However, it may be seen because of certain hematologic disorders.

There are three kinds of erythrocyte inclusions:
#'''Developmental Organelles'''
##[[Howell-Jolly bodies]]: small, round fragments of the nucleus resulting from [[karyorrhexis]] or nuclear disintegration of the late [[reticulocyte]] and stain reddish-blue with [[Wright stain]].
##[[Basophilic stipplings]] - these stipplings are either fine or coarse, deep blue to purple staining inclusion that appears in [[erythrocytes]] on a dried [[Wright stain]].
##[[Pappenheimer bodies]] - are [[siderosis|siderotic]] granules which are small, irregular, dark-staining granules that appear near the periphery of a young [[erythrocyte]] in a [[Wright stain]].
##Polychromatophilic red cells - young red cells that no longer have nucleus but still contain some RNA.
##[[Cabot rings|Cabot Rings]] - ring-like structure and may appear in erythrocytes in [[megaloblastic anemia]] or in severe [[anemias]], [[lead poisoning]], and in [[dyserythropoiesis]], in which [[erythrocytes]] are destroyed before being released from the [[bone marrow]].
#'''Abnormal Hemoglobin Precipitation'''
##[[Heinz bodies]] - round bodies, refractile inclusions not visible on a [[Wright stain]] film. It is best identified by supravital staining with basic dyes.
##[[Hemoglobin]] H Inclusions - [[thalassemia|alpha thalassemia]], greenish-blue inclusion bodies appear in many [[erythrocytes]] after four drops of blood is incubated with 0.5mL of Brilliant cresyl blue for 20 minutes at 37&amp;nbsp;°C.
#'''Protozoan Inclusion'''
##[[Malaria]]
##[[Babesia]]

==Inclusion bodies in Bacteria==
Polyhydroxyalkanoates or PHA are produced by bacteria as inclusion bodies, the size of PHA granules are limited in ''E. coli'', due to its small bacterial size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiang XR, Wang H, Shen Chen GQ | year = 2015 | title = Engineering the bacterial shapes for enhanced inclusion bodied accumulation | url = | journal = Metabolic Engineering | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 227–237 | doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2015.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial cell's inclusion bodies are not as abundant intracellularly, in comparison to eukaryotic cells.

== Current problems with the isolation of proteins from bacterial inclusion bodies ==

70-80% of recombinant proteins expressed ''E. coli'' are contained in inclusion bodies (i.e., protein aggregates).&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Zhong, et  al.  "Highly efficient production of soluble proteins from insoluble inclusion bodies by a two-step-denaturing and refolding method." PloS  one 6.7 (2011): e22981.&lt;/ref&gt; The purification of the expressed proteins from inclusion bodies usually require two main steps: extraction of inclusion bodies from the bacteria followed by the solubilisation of the purified inclusion bodies. The use of recombinant proteins can be used to find the mass of misfolding proteins, with the use of mass spectrometry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Upadhyay V, Singh A, Panda AK | year = | title = Purification of recombinant ovalbumin from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592815300656 | journal = Protein Expression and Purification | volume =  117| issue = | pages =  52–58| doi=10.1016/j.pep.2015.09.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudo-inclusions==
''Pseudo-inclusions'' are invaginations of the cytoplasm into the [[cell nuclei]], which may give the appearance of intranuclear inclusions. They may appear in [[papillary thyroid carcinoma]].&lt;ref name=Kumar20&gt;Chapter 20 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard |author2=Kumar, Vinay |author3=Abbas, Abul K. |author4=Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jakob Johann [[Baron]] von Uexküll''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʏkskʏl|lang}}; 8 September 1864 – 25 July 1944) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] biologist who worked in the fields of muscular [[physiology]], animal behaviour studies, and the [[cybernetics]] of [[life]]. However, his most notable contribution is the notion of ''[[Umwelt]]'', used by [[Semiotics|semiotician]] [[Thomas Sebeok]] and philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. His works established [[biosemiotics]] &lt;ref&gt;Donald Favareau, ''Essential Readings in Biosemiotics'', Springer, 2010, 91-89.&lt;/ref&gt; as a field of research.

==Early life==
The son of [[Alexander Rudolf Karl von Uexküll|Alexander Baron von Uexküll]] and Sophie von Hahn, Jakob von Uexküll was born in the Keblas estate, [[Mihkli]], [[Governorate of Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://personen.digitale-sammlungen.de/baltlex/Blatt_bsb00000600,00507.html?prozent= Genealogisches ''Handbuch der baltischen Ritterschaften'', 1930, p. 490.]&lt;/ref&gt; His aristocratic family lost most of their fortune by expropriation during the Russian Revolution. Needing to support himself, Uexküll took a job as professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] where he founded the ''Institut für Umweltforschung''.&lt;ref name="Agamben 39"&gt;[[Giorgio Agamben]], ''The Open: Man and Animal'', trans. Kevin Attell, Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umwelt==
{{main|Umwelt}}

Uexküll was particularly interested in how living beings [[Perception|perceive]] their [[Natural environment|environment]](s). He argued that organisms experience life in terms of species-specific, spatio-temporal, 'self-in-world' subjective reference frames that he called ''Umwelt'' (translated as ''surrounding-world'',&lt;ref&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''Theoretical Biology'', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1926, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''phenomenal world''&lt;ref name=Uexküll1957&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds''. In ''Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept'', edited and translated by Claire H. Schiller, New York: International Universities Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''self-world''&lt;ref name=Uexküll1957/&gt;, ''environment''&lt;ref&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With A Theory of Meaning'', translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, Minneapolis/London: University of Minnesota Press, 2010, pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  - lit. German ''environment''). These ''Umwelten'' (plural of ''Umwelt'') are distinctive from what Uexküll termed the "[[Umgebung]]" which would be the living being's surroundings as seen from the likewise peculiar perspective or ''Umwelt'' of the human observer. ''Umwelt'' may thus be defined as the perceptual world in which an organism exists and acts as a subject. By studying how the senses of various organisms like  [[tick]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[amoebae]], [[jellyfish]] and [[sea worms]] work, he was able to build theories of how they experience the world. Because all organisms perceive and react to sensory data as signs, Uexküll argued that they were to be considered as living subjects. This argument was the basis for his biological theory in which the characteristics of biological existence ("life") could not simply be described as a sum of its non-organic parts, but had to be described as subject and a part of a sign system.

The [[biosemiotic]] turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The ''Umwelt'' is for him an environment-world which is (according to [[Giorgio Agamben]]), "constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] "carriers of significance" or "marks" which are the only things that interest the animal". Agamben goes on to paraphrase one example from Uexküll's discussion of a tick, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, for the tick, the ''Umwelt'' is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The [[odor]] of [[butyric acid]], which emanates from the [[sebaceous]] follicles of all [[mammals]], (2) The [[temperature]] of 37 degrees Celsius (corresponding to the [[blood]] of all mammals), (3) The hairiness of mammals.

==Theoretical biology==
{{Semiotics}}
von Uexküll anticipated many computer science ideas, particularly in the field of robotics, roughly 25 years before these things were invented.&lt;ref&gt;Lagerspetz, Kari Y. (2001): Jakob von Uexküll and the origins of cybernetics. ''Semiotica'' 134 (1/4): 643–651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uexküll views organisms in terms of information processing. He argues every organism has an outer boundary which defines an '''Umwelt''' (German word generally meaning 'environment', 'surrounding world'). Rather than the general meaning, Uexküll's concept draws on the literal meaning of the German word, which is 'surround-world', to define the '''Umwelt''' as the subjectively perceived surroundings about which information is available to an organism through its senses.&lt;ref&gt;Chien, 2007, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a subjective ''weltanschauung'', or "world view", and is therefore fundamentally different from the [[black box]] concept, which is derived from the objective Newtonian viewpoint.

The organism has sensors that report the state of the ''Umwelt'' and effectors that can change parts of the ''Umwelt''. He distinguished the effector as the logical opposite of the sensor, or sense organ. Sensors and effectors are linked in a [[Feedback|feedback loop]]. Sensor input is processed by a ''Merkorgan'' and effectors are controlled by a ''Werkorgan''. The modern term 'sensorimotor' used in [[Enactivism|enactive theories of cognition]] encompasses these concepts.

He further distinguishes the ''Umgebung'' (that part of the ''Umwelt'' that represents distal features of the external world, in German 'that which is being given as surroundings') from the Innenwelt which is reported directly by sensors and is therefore the only unmediated reality immediately knowable to the organism. The relationship between the distal (mediated, transformed) features of the Umbegung and the proximal (untransformed, unmediated, primal) features of the Innenwelt must be learned by the organism in infancy. The nature of the Umbegung::Innenwelt relationship is relevant to the later theories of [[Embodied cognition]].

This is also similar to Kant's [[phenomenon]] and [[noumenon]] but derived logically from the properties of the sensors. What we now call a "feedback loop" he calls a "function-circle" and "circle" seems to be something like "system". He uses the term "melody" to mean something close to "algorithm". He coins around 75 technical terms, and a proper understanding of his book would require clearly defining them in modern terms and understanding their relations. He notices [[qualia]], comes close to object-oriented programming (page 98) uses the image of a helmsman which later showed up as "cybernetics" (page 291) and makes a good guess about DNA (page 127). He has a large number of ideas, although not expressed clearly in modern terms. His metaphysics is hyper-Kantian ("All reality is subjective appearance", page xv.) Space is a set of direction symbols. He rejects Darwin and says nothing of God. Organisms are based on something called "Plan", the origin of which we cannot know.

Uexküll was an advocate of [[non-Darwinian evolution]] and critic of Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;Kreitler, Shulamith. (2013). ''Cognition and Motivation: Forging an Interdisciplinary Perspective''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 185-186. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalevi Kull]] noted that "despite his opposition to Darwinism, Uexküll was not anti-evolutionist".&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Brett. (2008). ''Onto-ethologies : The Animal Environments of Uexküll, Heidegger, Merleau-ponty, and Deleuze''. SUNY Press. p. 18. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7611-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Works by scholars such as [[Kalevi Kull]] connect Uexküll's studies with some areas of [[philosophy]] such as [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]]. Jakob von Uexküll is also considered a pioneer of [[Semiotics|semiotic]] biology, or [[biosemiotics]]. However, despite his influence (on the work of philosophers [[Max Scheler]],   [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] (in their ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''), for example) he is still not widely known, and his books are mostly out of print in German and in English. A paperback French translation of ''Streifzüge durch die Umwelten von Tieren und Menschen'' [A stroll through the Umwelten of animals and humans] of 1934 is currently in print.  This book has been translated in English as ''A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans, with A Theory of Meaning'' by Jakob von Uexküll, translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, introduction by Dorion Sagan, University of Minnesota Press, 2011. The other available book is "Theoretical Biology", a reprint of the 1926 translation of "Theoretische Biologie" (1920). "Foray" is a popular introduction while "Theoretical Biology" is intended for an academic audience.

== Family ==
His sons were the physician [[Thure von Uexküll]] and journalist Gösta von Uexküll. His daughter was Sophie Luise Damajanti von Uexküll ('Dana'). His grandson is the writer [[Jakob von Uexkull]].

==In popular culture==
Uexküll's ideas about how organisms create their own concept of time are described in [[Peter Høeg|Peter Høeg's]] novel ''[[Borderliners]]'', and contrasted with [[Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton's]] view of time as something that exists independent of life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Høeg, ''Borderliners'', trans. Barbara Haveland (The Harvill Press, 1995), pp. 214–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Shannon Munn''' (6 June 1880 – 24 February 1918) was a prominent early-20th-century [[Newfoundland]]er. The step-son of Sir [[Edgar Rennie Bowring|Edgar Bowring]], he rose to become managing director of [[Bowring Brothers]], but died in the wreck of the [[SS Florizel|SS ''Florizel'']] in 1918, along with his three-year-old daughter, Betty. Munn had also been a talented [[cricket]]er in his youth, and is one of the few Newfoundlanders to play at [[first-class cricket|first-class]] level, having played in England for [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]].

==Family and early life==
John Shannon Munn was born in 1880 in [[Harbour Grace]], Newfoundland, into a prominent local family. The company established by his Scottish-born grandfather, [[John Munn (Newfoundland politician)|John Munn]], owned several boats in Newfoundland's sealing and fishing fleets, and also owned Harbour Grace's newspaper and main store. Following the elder Munn's retirement in 1878, his son (John Shannon Munn's father), William Panton Munn, assumed management of the company together with his cousin, [[Robert Stewart Munn]]. William Munn died in 1882 and his widow, born Flora LeMessurier Clift, remarried in 1888 to [[Edgar Rennie Bowring]], scion of another merchant family.&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt;

Bowring (later Sir Edgar) later became a director at [[Bowring Brothers]] (established by his grandfather, [[Benjamin Bowring]]), and John Shannon Munn became his protege at the firm after completing his education. Munn initially attended the [[Bishop Feild College|Church of England College]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] (now Bishop Feild College), but was sent to England for further schooling, as had his step-father. From 1894, he attended the [[Forest School (Walthamstow)|Forest School]], a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Walthamstow]], [[Essex]].&lt;ref name="liverman"&gt;David Liverman. [http://www.canadacricket.com/nlcricket/?page_id=78 "John Shannon Munn"] – Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador. Retrieved 1 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
Cricket had become reasonably popular in Newfoundland by the late 19th century, but died out following the First World War. Munn was likely introduced to the sport on the island, and continued playing at the Forest School, where he was a regular in the school first XI. In his last season at the school, [[1899 English cricket season|in 1899]], he took 55 wickets at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 13.96. ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'', in its coverage of public schools cricket, noted especially his performance against [[Epsom College]], where he took a five-wicket haul and scored a half-century to help Forest School to a 220-run victory.&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt;

Going on to [[Hertford College, Oxford]], Munn played in two trial matches for [[Oxford University Cricket Club]] prior to the start of the [[1900 English cricket season|1900 season]], taking a five-wicket haul in both games.&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt; Despite this form, he did not make his debut for the first XI until Oxford's fourth first-class match of the season, likely due to his status as a first-year student.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/31/31621/First-Class_Matches.html First-class matches played by John Munn (10)] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On debut against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in June 1900, Munn opened the bowling with [[Harold White (cricketer)|Harold White]], with his teammates including [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]], and, [[Tip Foster]], a future [[England cricket team|England]] captain. He took the wickets of four top-order batsmen in Somerset's first innings, finishing with 4/53.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5452.html Oxford University v Somerset], University Match 1900 – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Munn played three further matches during the 1900 season, against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] at Oxford, [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] at [[The Oval]], and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] at [[Lord's]].&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt; He finished the season with 13 wickets at an average of 16.76, including another four-wicket haul, 4/39 against Worcestershire.&lt;ref name="bwls"&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/31/31621/f_Bowling_by_Season.html First-class bowling in each season by John Munn] – CricketArchive.

Retrieved 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his earlier performances, Munn failed to make the Oxford team for the [[University Match (cricket)|annual match]] against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. Instead of playing for a [[County Championship]] side later in the season, like many of his teammates, he returned to Newfoundland for the rest of the summer. There, Munn played in the local St. John's league. In late August 1900, he turned out for a St. John's representative side in two games against an [[I Zingari]] team from [[Boston]]. He took figures of 8/17 in the second of those matches, which was attended by around 1,200 people.&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt; Back at Oxford for the [[1901 English cricket season|1901 season]], Munn performed poorly in pre-season trial matches, but was in the first XI for Oxford's third first-class fixture of the season, against Surrey in late May.&lt;ref name="fc"/&gt; Usually batting at number eleven, following a series of [[not out]] innings, he was promoted to open the batting in a second fixture against Surrey, played in late June.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5703.html Surrey v Oxford University], University Match 1901 – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He scored only 11 runs, and was back at number eleven for the next match, against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5712.html Sussex v Oxford University], University Match 1901 – CricketArchive.

Retrieved 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; finishing his season with 11 wickets from six games.&lt;ref name="bwls"/&gt;

Munn returned to Newfoundland at the end of 1901, having never graduated from Oxford, or received his [[Oxford blue|Blue]].&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt; He finished his first-class career with 24 wickets from 10 matches, at an average of 29.62.&lt;ref name="ca"/&gt; Two of his step-father's second cousins also played cricket at high levels—[[William Bowring (cricketer)|William Bowring]] played for [[Barbados national cricket team|Barbados]] and the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/23/23313/23313.html William Bowring] – CricketArchive.

==Later life and death==
[[File:Betty Munn.JPG|thumb|right|140px|John Munn's three-year-old daughter, Betty, died with him in the wreck of the SS ''Florizel''.]]
Having risen to become a director of his step-father's company, in January 1908 Munn married Alice May McGowen, the daughter of [[John Roche McGowen]], the Inspector-General (chief officer) of the [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]]. The wedding, officiated by the [[Bishop of Newfoundland]], [[Llewellyn Jones (bishop)|Llewellyn Jones]], was held at the [[Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (St. John's)|Cathedral of St. John the Baptist]] in St. John's, and attended by a number prominent Newfoundlanders. A reception was held at [[Government House (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Government House]], the official residence of the [[Governor of Newfoundland]]. The couple had one daughter together, Elizabeth Shannon Munn (known as Betty), born in 1914.&lt;ref name="glimpse"&gt;[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/cns_archives/22riggsoct17_1996.html Collection Offers Glimpses of St. John's Society] – Memorial University of Newfoundland's Archival Treasures.

Aged 34, Munn was too old to enlist during the First World War, but served as treasurer of a committee established to fund the volunteer [[Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Newfoundland Regiment]], which saw service in France throughout the war. By 1918, he had succeeded his step-father as managing director of Bowring Brothers.&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt; Early in that year, he booked passage from St. John's to New York City via [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], aboard the [[SS Florizel|SS ''Florizel'']], a [[passenger liner]] employed by his company's Red Cross Line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admiraltymuseum.ca/florizelBowring.html THE S.S.

His wife was already in New York, and the family planned to vacation in Florida for two months. On the night of 23 February, shortly after leaving St. John's, ''Florizel'' met a blizzard near [[Cape Race]]. Due to a navigational error, the ship's captain, William J. Martin, turned westward well before passing the cape, causing her to founder {{convert|300|yards|m}} offshore of Horn Head Point, close to [[Cappahayden]]. Munn, his daughter, and her nurse were killed, along with 91 others.&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glimpse"/&gt;

After the deaths of his granddaughter and step-son, Sir Edgar Bowring commissioned several memorials in their honour. John Munn was commemorated by a stained-glass window at St. Thomas' Anglican Church, St. John's, as well as a park in Harbour Grace (Shannon Park) and new facilities for a St. John's orphanage (renamed the Shannon Munn Memorial).&lt;ref name="liverman"/&gt; The most notable memorial, in honour of Betty Munn, was an exact replica of the [[statue of Peter Pan]] in [[Kensington Gardens]], London, made by sculptor [[George Frampton]] from his original.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Russell (29 August 2005). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/4197315/Memorial-to-a-girl-who-never-grew-up.html "Memorial to a girl who never grew up"] – ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The replica, standing in [[Bowring Park (St. John's)|Bowring Park]], St. John's, was unveiled in August 1925, inscribed "''In memory of a dear little girl who loved the Park''".&lt;ref&gt;Bert Riggs (24 June 1998). [http://www.geocities.ws/Heartland/Valley/8414/bowering-park.htm "Bowering: The Man and the Park"] – ''The Evening Telegram''. Retrieved 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Frampton believed the St. John's statue to be superior to the Kensington Gardens original, as "the wholly natural surroundings and flowing river [were] more in keeping with the spirit of Peter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfld.com/tourism/bowring/history.htm Bowring Park: The History] – nfld.com.

}}'''José Emeterio Rivas''' (c. 1957 or '58 – April 6, 2003), a [[Colombia]]n radio journalist and host of the talk show "Las Fuerzas Vivas" (Translated: "Live Forces") for Radio Calor Estéreo in [[Barrancabermeja]], [[Magdalena Medio Antioquia]], [[Colombia]], was murdered along with another man by [[paramilitary]]. The case was unique because this journalist's murderers were convicted in the country, which is rare for cases of killed journalists.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;

== Personal ==
José Emeterio Rivas lived in Barrancabermeja, Colombia. He was 44 years old and a father of two children.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cpj"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/2003/jose-emeterio-rivas.php|title=José Emeterio Rivas - Journalists Killed|date=April 6, 2003|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colectivodeabogados"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://colectivodeabogados.org/PARAMILITAR-CONFIESA-EL-ASESINATO|title=PARAMILITAR CONFIESA EL ASESINATO DEL PERIODISTA JOSE EMETERIO RIVAS EN BARRANCABERMEJA|website=Colectivo de Abogados}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Rivas ran for senate where he acquired more than 8000 votes.&lt;ref name="barrancabermejavirtual"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://barrancabermejavirtual.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1291:especial040713&amp;catid=58&amp;Itemid=124|title=Emeterio Rivas cumple 10 años de haber sido asesinado:  Análisis del periodista Jorge Toloza.|website=Barrancabermeja Virtual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Rivas was a political radio journalist for the Radio Calor Estéreo. He hosted a morning public affairs show called "Fuerzas Vivas" (Translated: "Live Forces") with opinions about politics that critics found to be insulting to some Barrancabermeja politicians.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7srDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT132&amp;lpg=PT132&amp;dq=reactions+to+josé+emeterio+rivas+death&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LRU1WvKmMv&amp;sig=LbF9by0zVa5OjPi8v4gngc381pE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDtvn_hunSAhUW42MKHahwCWgQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=reactions%20to%20josé%20emeterio%20rivas%20death&amp;f=false|title=Attacks on the Press: Journalism on the World's Front Lines|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|author=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt; On his program, Rivas accused the mayor of [[corruption]] and collaboration with members of the right-wing paramilitary group [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]], known as the AUC. He had called the mayor a "[[Kleptocracy|plunderer]]".&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;

}}&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;On April 5, 2003, a day before his death, José Emeterio Rivas publicly accused the town's mayor Julio César Ardila Torres and other local politicians of corruption and collaboration with members of the right-wing paramilitary group AUC.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;&lt;ref name=sipiapa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.sipiapa.org/notas/1125722-colombia|title=Colombia|publisher=SIP-IAPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that Rivas called Ardila a "plunderer" in the television appearance.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;

The next day Rivas was murdered in Barrancabermeja but detectives found his corpse seven days after his killing in the same spot he had been shot, next to Colombia's [[Magdalena River]].&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt; Rivas's body was alongside another body of a man by the name of Paolo César Montesinos, who was a 22-year-old college student majoring in [[Environmental engineering|Environmental Engineering]] at the University Institute of Peace. It is not known why these two bodies were found together.&lt;ref name="eltiempo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-989563|title=MUERTO PERIODISTA EN BARRANCABERMEJA - Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 - eltiempo.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elespectador"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/crimen-del-periodista-jose-emeterio-rivas-dificil-de-re-articulo-607521|title=Crimen del periodista José Emeterio Rivas, difícil de resolver|publisher=ELESPECTADOR.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Riva's body was found, there were four bullet holes in his abdomen, indicating that he probably died almost instantly.&lt;ref name="globalfreedomofexpression" /&gt;

===Investigation===
There was an investigation after the bodies were found and it took them about ten years to finalize the case and send the men to prison that were involved.&lt;ref name="elespectador" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ifex" /&gt;

Diego Waldrón, a colleague to Rivas, told [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] that Rivas had received repeated death threats.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; It was after hearing this that the detectives linked some killers to Rivas's murder.&lt;ref name="rsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/news/death-threats-against-two-journalists-barrancabermeja|title=Death threats against two journalists in Barrancabermeja - Reporters without borders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/world/americas/14colombia.html|title=Two in Colombia Charged in Killing|date=14 September 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sandiegouniontribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-lt-colombia-journalist-slaying-012209-2009jan22-story.html|title=Stiff sentence in Colombian journalist's murder|first=LIBARDO CARDONA, The Associated|last=Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/14/world/fg-colombia14|title=2 held in slaying of Colombia reporter|first=Chris|last=Kraul|date=14 September 2007|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=globalfreedomofexpression&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/case-assassination-colombian-journalist-jose-emeterio-rivas/|title=The Case on Assassination of Colombian Journalist José Emeterio Rivas |publisher=Global Freedom of Expression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mayor and his three collaborators, Fabio Pajón Lizcano, Abelardo Rueda Tobón, and Juan Pablo Ariza, who were a few of his high-up officials, had hired militia leaders to kill Rivas with the reward for $68,000.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/colombia/2009/01/26/court_sentences_masterminds_behind/|title=Court sentences masterminds behind killing of journalist José Emeterio Rivas - IFEX|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A militia leader by the name of Bedoya later admitted his participation as a material author in Riva's death.&lt;ref name="colectivodeabogados" /&gt; Ardila was sentenced to 28 years and eight months in prison and Lizcano and Tobón were each sentenced to 26 years and eight months in prison.&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt; Along with imprisonment, the mayor was also fined 1,192 million pesos (US $531,000).&lt;ref name="cpj" /&gt;

The case continued in 2016, with the arrest of Elkin Bueno Altahona, a.k.a., "Ernesto Báez," who was the mayor of Barrancabermeja mayor until 2015 and president of the Colombian Federation of Municipalities, on suspicion of being at a meeting where Rivas's murder was discussed and receiving financial support for one of his political campaigns.&lt;ref name="elespectador" /&gt;&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/ordenan-captura-del-exalcalde-de-barrancabermeja-parapo-articulo-624697|title=Ordenan captura del exalcalde de Barrancabermeja por "parapolítica" - ELESPECTADOR.COM|date=31 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=periodicoportada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicoportada.com/emeterio_rivas.html|title=Periodico Portada|website=www.periodicoportada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Armed paramilitary groups threaten journalists in Colombia and were hired for Riva's murder by the town's mayor at the time.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; This shows how easy it is for someone of power to hire a paramilitary group to do a job.

Due to [[impunity]], it is still dangerous for journalists in Colombia. Although they are doing their job by stating their political opinions, like Rivas when he called the mayor a "plunderer", there are very few cases reported that have been brought to justice after death threats and murders to a journalist.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;

== Impact ==
The Rivas case affected Colombia because it was the first case of a journalist killing in a long time {{how many|date=May 2017}} that someone was found responsible for the death.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt; From 1994-2009 there were 57 journalists killed and of those 57, over 70 percent of them went unpunished.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;

The impunity, exemption from punishment, in Colombia is said to be one of the highest and is still a threat.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
The Inter American Press Association found reason to be "optimistic" about the convictions in Rivas's case.&lt;ref name=IAPA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.sipiapa.org/notas/1123410-to-put-an-end-to-violence-and-impunity-is-priority-of-ours|title=To put an end to violence and impunity is a priority of ours|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee to Protect Journalists released a statement after the case was resolved in the courts: "We welcome the sentencing of these three former officials for plotting the murder of José Emeterio Rivas. This is the first time in recent Colombian history that the masterminds of a journalist's murder were effectively prosecuted and punished. We commend the attorney general's office and its human rights unit for taking this crucial step forward in the campaign to end impunity in the murders of journalists around the world."&lt;ref name=ifex /&gt;

'''Jpred''' v.4 is the latest version of the JPred [[Protein]] Secondary Structure Prediction Server&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPred4: A Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Server|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides predictions by the JNet algorithm, one of the most accurate methods for secondary structure prediction,&lt;ref name=DROZDETSKIY2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drozdetskiy|first1=Alexey|last2=Cole|first2=Chris|last3=Procter|first3=James|last4=Barton|first4=Geoffrey|title=JPred4: a protein secondary structure prediction server|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Apr 16, 2015|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv332|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/04/16/nar.gkv332|volume=43|pages=W389–W394|pmid=25883141|pmc=4489285}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has existed since 1998 in different versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/old_news.shtml | title=JPred old news | date=Oct 25, 1998 | accessdate=16 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to protein secondary structure, JPred also makes predictions of solvent accessibility and coiled-coil regions. The JPred service runs up to 134 000 jobs per month and has carried out over 2 million predictions in total for users in 179 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPred4 statistics|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/stats.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version of JPred (v4) has the following improvements and updates incorporated:
* Retrained on the latest UniRef90 and SCOPe/ASTRAL version of Jnet (v2.3.1) - mean secondary structure prediction accuracy of &gt;82%.&lt;ref name=DROZDETSKIY2015/&gt;
* Upgraded the Web Server to the latest technologies (Bootstrap framework, JavaScript) and updating the web pages – improving the design and usability through implementing responsive technologies.
* Added RESTful API and mass-submission and results retrieval scripts - resulting in peak throughput above 20,000 predictions per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPred4 RESTful API|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/api.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Added prediction jobs monitoring tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPred4 monitoring tools|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/monitor.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Upgraded the results reporting – both, on the web-site, and through the optional email summary reports: improved batch submission, added results summary preview through Jalview results visualization summary in SVG and adding full multiple sequence alignments into the reports.
* Improved help-pages, incorporating tool-tips, and adding one-page step-by-step tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPred4 Help and Tutorials|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/help.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JPred v3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred3/index.html|title=JPred3: previous version of JPred|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed on from previous versions of JPred developed and maintained by James Cuff and Jonathan Barber (see JPred References&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JPred4 references|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/refs.shtml|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This release added new functionality and fixed lots of bugs. The highlights are:
* New, friendlier user interface
* Retrained and optimised version of Jnet (v2) - mean secondary structure prediction accuracy of &gt;81%
* Batch submission of jobs
* Better error checking of input sequences/alignments
* Predictions now (optionally) returned via e-mail
* Users may provide their own query names for each submission
* JPred now makes a prediction even when there are no PSI-BLAST hits to the query
* PS/PDF output now incorporates all the predictions

The static HTML pages of JPred 2 are still available for reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4/legacy/|title=JPred2: legacy|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequence residues are categorised or assigned to one of the secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helix, beta-sheet and coiled-coil.

Jnet uses two neural networks for its prediction. The first network is fed with a window of 17 residues over each amino acid in the alignment plus a conservation number. It uses a hidden layer of nine nodes and has three output nodes, one for each secondary structure element.
The second network is fed with a window of 19 residues (the result of first network) plus the conservation number. It has a hidden layer with nine nodes and has three output nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10861942 | volume=40 | title=Application of multiple sequence alignment profiles to improve protein secondary structure prediction | date=August 2000 | journal=Proteins | pages=502–11 | last1 = Cuff | first1 = JA | last2 = Barton | first2 = GJ | doi=10.1002/1097-0134(20000815)40:3&lt;502::aid-prot170&gt;3.0.co;2-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khelifa Belkacem''' (1907 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1951) was an Algerian [[singer]].

==Biography==
Khelifa Belkacem was born in 1907 in [[Koléa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitaminedz.com/portrait-de-khelifa-belkacem/Articles_19417_360792_28_1.html |title=Portrait de Khelifa Belkacem |publisher=Vitaminedz.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[Staouéli]] near Algiers in 1911. At the age of nine he becomes fatherless. In 1935 he moves to Algiers which then housed prestigious names of the [[Chaabi (Algeria)|chaâbi]] ''chanson'' like [[El Hadj M'Hamed El Anka]]. He had learned the music profession in the streets of Staouéli. He wanted to compete with the giants of the era: [[El Hadj Menouar]], Hadj Bouchiba, [[Hadj M'rizek]] and succeeded by starting up a young band to enliven family celebrations around Algiers.

To penetrate into the middle of chaâbi he left Staouéli to install at the Casbah where work did not lack but where the public was difficult. 
His orchestra was composed of Moh Saghir Laama on [[oud]], Belkaïd Abdelghani on [[alto violin]], Mohamed Zerbout on [[darbuka]], Hadj Omar on [[Tar (drum)|tar]] and Kaddour Cherchali, Mouloud Bahri and Ali Bousbia on banjos. Evenings dates at the circle of Chartres' place, or coffee "Ismailia" square Lavigerie (now up Benbadis) in the 1940s, during the holy month of Ramadan, were famous.

Persistent, passionate, rigorous. He had a melodious voice and his "Istikhbar" (musical improvisation, vocal prelude improvised at [[tempo rubato]]) was a treat. He faced the "bit siah wah" genre without complex and other more difficult pieces. His mastering the art of Chaabi influenced singers of fame like [[Dahmane El Harrachi]] or [[Hsissen]].

He left a television recording of the song Saki Baki (filmed by the [[French cinema]] in the 1940s and adopted by many artists like [[El Hachemi Guerouabi]]) that the [[Algerian television]] transmits from time to time. Radio also broadcasts songs he interpreted like "Messaad dhek ennhar jani bachar" (by the poet Abdelouahab), "Daâni are menne lem Helti" (by the poet Benali) and "El bez ghebli."

He died on November 4, 1951 by bullets after a brawl at the Casbah, near his home, rue Darfour, at 44 years old. He is buried in the cemetery of Sidi M'hamed alongside Kaddour Cherchali a virtuoso banjo player that was part of his orchestra.

'''Knapp's relational development model''' portrays [[Social penetration theory|relationship development]] as a ten step process, broken into two phases. Created by and named after communication scholar [[Mark L. Knapp]], the model suggests that all of the steps should be done one at a time, in sequence, to make sure they are effective. However, not every relationship will go through these stages of development in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, K. (2016). ''Interpersonal Communication'' (3rd ed.). McGraw-Hill Education. p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to DeVito's six-stage model of relational development,&lt;ref&gt;DeVito, J. A. (1993). ''Messages: Building Interpersonal Communication Skills''. New York, HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt; Knapp's model is far more prescriptive and detailed, but also presupposes that the relationship will ultimately dissolve, as evident in the five "coming apart" stages that make up the second half of the model. However, Knapp himself has said that his model is also descriptive; the model describes what seems to happen, not necessarily what should happen. The model proposes that coming apart need not be seen as inherently bad, just as coming together need not be seen as inherently good.&lt;ref name="Knapp et al"&gt;Knapp, M. L., Vangelisti, A. L., &amp; Caughlin, J. P. (2014). ''Interpersonal Communication and Human Relationships'' (7th ed.). Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

[[File:African print couple love.jpg|thumb|Couple showing signs of affection]]

The following stages are identified by the type of communication behavior that occurs in a given stage as well as the proportion of that type of communication behavior to another. In this case, proportion may constitute the frequency with which the acts occur or to the relative weight given to certain acts by those involved.&lt;ref name="Knapp et al"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

==Phase of coming together==

===Initiation===
''Initiation'' is the first stage where individuals make their first impressions on each other. While a lot of important impressions are being processed, the actual initiation stage likely lasts less than 15 seconds. In this stage, individuals are trying to display their best selves. Also, we are observing the other person to learn about them and, therefore, reduce our own [[Uncertainty reduction theory|uncertainty]]. Physical appearance often plays a big role in this stage when it comes to forming first impressions.

The methods and messages used to initiate communication vary based on:&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"&gt;Knapp, M. L. (1978). ''Social Intercourse: From Greeting to Goodbye''. Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

*The kind of relationship and whether or not the individuals have been through this stage before
*The time allowed for the interaction
*The amount of time since the last greeting
*Situational or normative constraints
*Special codes of particular groups

===Experimentation===
''Experimentation'' is the stage where individuals begin to engage in [[self-disclosure]] to learn information about each other. The individuals use this stage to explore and get a feel for the relationship as well as one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knapp's Relationship Model|url=http://communicationtheory.org/knapps-relationship-model/|website=communicationtheory.org|publisher=Communication Theory|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Small talk]] is a common form of communication in this stage, as both parties use it to search for an area of common interest of experience. At this stage, relationships are generally pleasant, casual, and uncritical. Knapp has long emphasized that most relationships will not progress past this stage.&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name="Knapp et al"/&gt;{{rp|40}}

===Intensifying===
During the ''intensifying'' stage of Knapp's model, the two individuals will continue experimentations to determine whether there is mutual emotional affection and attachment. Whereas in the previous experimentation phase, conversation focused more on superficial topics such as discovering shared areas of interest and commonalities, in the intensifying stage the level of self-disclosure deepens. The breadth of topics discussed broadens and the depth in which each individual feels comfortable discussing those topics with the other becomes intimate and personal.

In this stage, certain behaviors, such as increasing one-on-one contact through more frequent communication (through face to face encounters, text, or phone calls), doing favors for a partner or offering gifts as tokens of affection, requesting commitment from a partner through direct definitional bid, personalized verbal expressions of affection such as "I love you" or assigning pet names such as "babe," and suggestive actions such as flirtation, gazing, or touching, may all emerge as methods of intensifying the connection between the two people.

Essential to the intensifying stage are "secret tests"&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, L. A., &amp; Wilmot, W. W. (1984). ''Secret tests''. ''Human Communication Research'', 11, 171–201.&lt;/ref&gt; performed by each individual to ascertain whether his or her overtures are actually helpful in their intensification efforts. These tests most often manifest themselves through:

* ''Endurance'', in which a partner is placed in an unpleasant, inconvenient, or uncomfortable situation or respond to certain requests to determine his or her commitment to the relationship.
* ''Public presentation'' during which a partner is introduced under a particular label such as "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" to see if they are comfortable with being identified in this manner.
* ''Separation'', which tests whether communication and feelings of affection will continue despite an inability to physically be together.
* ''Third-party questioning'', where one partner may attempt to find out the hidden feelings of the interested party indirectly by asking a friend to probe the person of interest for indication as to their depth of feeling and affection.
* ''Triangle tests'', in which one partner sees if they can elicit jealousy from the other partner when another person expresses interest in the person concocting the test.

While all five of these methods are common methods of testing intensification efforts, it's important to note that endurance, separation, and triangle tests are generally the least constructive, and can even be destructive when it comes to building the relationship.&lt;ref name="Rothwell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothwell|first1=J. Dan|title=In The Company of Others|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=4th|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|227–228}}

==Phase of coming together and Relational Maintenance ==
===Integration===
Once each individual feels confident, through their various intensification efforts, that mutual affection has been confirmed, the couple may begin to transition into the ''integration'' stage of their relationship. In addition to bonding, the integration stage makes up maintenance stage of a relationship. During this stage, the couple is fused and elements of their respective social identities, such as friends, belongings, and living spaces, are now shared. Other verbal and nonverbal manifestations of the integration include the couple seeing their relationship as special or unique in some way, the exchange of "trophies" for the other to wear or display, and potentially similarities in manner, dress, and verbal behavior can be seen.&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|20}} Today, another indicator of integration can be seen on social media sites where partners can be seen in each other's profile picture.&lt;ref&gt;Papp, L. M., Danielewicz, J., &amp; Cayemberg, C. (2012). "Are we Facebook official?" Implications of dating partners' Facebook use and profiles for intimate relationship satisfaction. ''Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, 15''(2), 85–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the exclusive commitment each partner has for the other is generally solidified in this stage through even deeper self-disclosure and revealing of secrets, sex, and discussion of future plans.&lt;ref name="Rothwell"/&gt;{{rp|228}}

===Bonding===
The final stage of the coming together half of the relational model is ''bonding''. This stage puts the relationship on public display and suggests that the relationship is exclusive. This stage often involves marriage or another type of public contract, though marriage is not necessary to successfully bond. There is usually a turning point that happens in this stage that signals a change in the relationship, making the relationship intimate. Reaching this stage does not guarantee that the relationship will remain bonded, though many intimate relationships will remain in this stage until divorce, death, or another type of separation.&lt;ref name="Rothwell"/&gt;{{rp|228–229}}

==Phase of coming apart and Relational Maintenance ==
Along with the coming together stages, all relationships will go through the coming apart stages of the relational development model, though some may skip steps (e.g. a sudden death terminating the relationship).

===Differentiating===
''Differentiating'' is a process of disengaging or uncoupling. During this stage, differences between the relationship partners are emphasized and what was thought to be similarities begins to disintegrate. Instead of working together, partners quickly begin to become more individualistic in their attitudes. Conflict is a common form of communication during this stage; oftentimes, it acts as a way to test how much the other can tolerate something that may threaten the relationship. Knapp believes that differentiating can be the result of bonding too quickly; meaning, sufficient breadth and depth (see: [[Social penetration theory]]) was not established during the previous stages.&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|23}} However, differentiating is expected to happen in romantic relationships. A common solution to differentiating is for each partner to give the other some space, though extreme differentiating can lead to a damaged relationship.&lt;ref name="Rothwell"/&gt;{{rp|228–229}}

===Circumscribing===
''Circumscribing'' sees a qualitative and quantitative decrease in information exchange. Communication is limited to safe topics. This stage is marked by less total communication in terms of number of interactions, depth and breadth of topics discussed, and communication occurs in shorter durations. Expressions of love and commitment also decrease.&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

==Phase of coming apart ==

===Stagnation===
In the ''stagnation'' stage, what were once patterns in the relationship become ruts and people feel stuck or trapped in the relationship. Communication in this stage sees partners saying very little because they "know" how the other person will respond. Individuals will engage in [[imagined interaction]]s to predict a conversation with their partner.&lt;ref&gt;Honeycutt, J. M., &amp; Cantrill, J. G. (2001). ''Cognition, Communication, and Romantic Relationships''. Routledge. pp. 62–81.&lt;/ref&gt; These imaginary dialogues can be either narratives ("I'll say this, and then she'll say this...") or perceived actual dialogues ("I'll do it." "You don't have to.").

At this stage, there is still some hope that the relationship can be revived. However, in many cases there are too many costs accumulating and, therefore, most do not stay at this stage for long. A key reason why individuals stay in this stage is to avoid the pain associated with terminating the relationship.&lt;ref name="Knapp et al"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

===Avoidance===
While the stagnation stage sees partners continue to inhabit the same environment, the ''avoidance'' stage sees partners exist in separate physical environments. When actual avoidance cannot take place, however, partners will simply avoid each other while they're together, treating the other as if they didn't exist. Essentially, the individuals in the relationship become separate from one another physically, emotionally, and mentally. When there is communication, it is often marked by antagonism or unfriendliness ("I just don't want to see or talk to you").&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|26}} In addition to not spending time with one another, they both begin to avoid the other person's needs and start to focus solely on themselves.

Different forms of distancing are also common at this stage:&lt;ref&gt;Hess, J. A. (2002). Distance regulation in personal relationships: The development of a conceptual model and a test of representational validity. ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'', 19, 663–683.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Avoidance'': preventing or reducing interaction during an encounter
*''Disengagement'': hiding information and interacting in a less personal manner
*''Cognitive dissociation'': disregarding messages and showing cognitive or emotional detachment

===Termination===
During the ''termination'' stage, both people that were in the relationship decide to end their connection with one another. No longer are they both receiving a mutually satisfying outcome from being with one another. Neither one of them is happy and the relationship must come to an end. In this model, this step is unavoidable and relationships can terminate at any time. Termination can occur due to physical separation, growing socially or psychologically apart, or the death of one of the partners. Communication in this stage is marked by distance (an attempt to put psychological and physical barriers between partners) and disassociation (messages that prepare one or both parties for their life without the other).&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|26–27}}

==Summary of movement through the stages==
According to Knapp, movement through the stages has the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|32–35.}}

#Movement is generally systematic and sequential. This does not suggest that the process is linear or unchangeable; the phenomena is never at rest and is continually in flux. People do generally follow the same pattern, however. Each stage contains important presuppositions for the next. Sequencing makes forecasting adjacent stages easier. Skipping steps is risky due to potentially losing information that would have been provided in the skipped step.
#Movement may be forward. Any movement toward greater levels of intimacy is considered "forward." When in the coming apart stages, any movement back toward a coming together stage would be a forward movement.
#Movement may be backward. "Backward" movement constitutes any movement away from the bonding stage. Backward movement can be the result of moving too quickly, thus preventing any sort of stabilization. 
#Movement occurs within stages.
#Movement is always to a new state. Partners can go through the same stages more than once, but they can never truly go back to "the way things were." However, their previous experience in a given stage will color their next trip through said stage.

In an effort to determine which stage partners are in, Welch and Rubin (2002) gave partners a list of behaviors and asked them to indicate the extent to which each behavior was characteristic of their relationship.&lt;ref name="Welch and Rubin"&gt;Welch, S. A., &amp; Rubin, R. B. (2002). Development of relationship stage measures. ''Communication Quarterly'', 50, 24–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Welch and Rubin also found that the relational development model was useful for describing the development of task or business relationships.&lt;ref name="Welch and Rubin"/&gt;

===Rate of movement===
According to Knapp, rate of movement is:&lt;ref name="Knapp 1978"/&gt;{{rp|35–36}}

#Usually rapid through stages that have already been achieved (e.g. there's no need for small talk if you've already passed through the experimenting stage before)
#Usually rapid through areas where positive rewards have been achieved (e.g. avoiding conflict until later on in the relationship as it may be too costly early on)
#Potentially rapid when time is short (e.g. a summer fling)
#Potentially facilitated when proximity is high
#Generally faster during the early stages
#Based on individual needs (e.g. lonely or isolated people may move faster than popular people with large friend groups)
#Slower if only one person wants to move to a different stage
#Rapid in deterioration if one party commits a violation

[[File:Liberty with her puppies &amp; GeraldFord's Family at the WhiteHouse.jpg|thumb|Susan, Betty and President Gerald Ford with Liberty and her puppies at the White House in 1975]]
'''Honor's Foxfire Liberty Hume''' (February 8, 1974 &amp;ndash; 1984) ([[American Kennel Club|AKC]] Registration Number SB578950) was the [[Golden Retriever]] [[List of United States Presidential pets|Presidential pet]] of [[Betty Ford]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. '''Liberty''' was born February 8, 1974 and given to the president as an 8-month-old puppy by his daughter [[Susan Ford]] and new White House photographer [[David Hume Kennerly]] in the fall of 1974.  The breeder of the dark gold pup was Ann (Avis) Friberg of [[Mount Vernon, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grweekly.com/cgi-bin/webdata_pro.pl?_cgifunction=form&amp;_layout=Offspring%20Non%20Member&amp;keyval=dogdirectory.alphanumeric_name%3DHONORSFOXFIRELIBERTYHUME Honor's Foxfire Liberty Hume - Golden Retriever Weekly - Directory Section - Dog Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberty was frequently photographed with Ford in the [[Oval Office]], in the swimming pool at [[Camp David]] and on the South Lawn of the [[White House]].  She also had a litter of pups in the White House on September 14, 1975, one of which &amp;ndash; Misty &amp;ndash; was kept by Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=5215|title=Gerald R. Ford: Remarks at a Republican Party Fundraising Dinner in Portland.|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point Ford was locked in a White House stairwell after returning from walking the dog on the South Lawn early one morning.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times of My Life'' - by Betty Ford - October 1978. {{ISBN|0-06-011298-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the dog were autographed with a rubber stamp of her paw print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landofpuregold.com/famous2.htm|title=Golden Retrievers with Celebrity (Moms and Dads) - E to H|first=Rochelle Lesser, School|last=Psychologist|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories indicated that if Ford wanted to end a conversation in the Oval Office he would signal Liberty and she would go to the guest wagging her tail creating a natural break.&lt;ref&gt;''A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford'', by Gerald R. Ford, August 1979. {{ISBN|0-06-011297-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford discussed the dog in a speech on October 9, 1974 in a tribute to [[William Scranton]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4445|title=Gerald R. Ford: Remarks at a Dinner Honoring William W. Scranton in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: This puppy has really taken over the White House. In fact, you may have seen some of us laughing up here during dinner. As I reached in my pocket to get a match to light my pipe, look what I pulled out of the pocket — some [[dog biscuit]]s! [Laughter]

: Let me tell you the story about Susan and Dave and how they bought this dog. I first should preface that the Fords had had two previous golden retrievers. One lived 13 years and died, and then another one died a year ago in August after 9 years. So we are fairly partial, I would say, to golden retrievers.

: Well, Dave and Susan called up a very highly recommended individual who had contacts with the people who raise golden retrievers all over the country. And Dave, as I understand it — who is communicating with the breeder who happened to have a golden retriever about this age — Dave asked the individual if they had a dog and was it available, and the owner said that they had this 8-month-old golden retriever, but breeder was a little cautious — they're very possessive about these dogs — and he asked in a very nice way who the dog's owner would be.

: And they said, Dave and Susan, that they had to keep it a secret. Well, the kennel owner said that they don't sell dogs that way. He would have to know who the dog's owner would be, and he wanted to know would the dog have a good home.

: So, Dave and Susan very specifically assured the dog owner that it would have a good home. They explained that the parents were friendly and middle-aged and they had four children. The kennel owner said, "That sounds fine. What kind of a house do they live in?"

: Susan and Dave said, "Well, it is a big white house with a fence around it." The kennel owner said, "This is a big dog. Will it have enough to eat? Does the father have a steady job?" Well, on that question, they were stuck a bit. [Laughter]

: Needless to say they got the dog and, in the appropriate spirit of the city of Philadelphia, we have named her "Liberty." One of those inquisitive reporters that we have in Washington asked Susan who is going to take care of Liberty; who is going to feed her and groom her and take her out each night or every morning? And Susan did not hesitate one minute.  She said, "Of course, it will be Dad." So, I have this feeling — this is one Liberty that is going to cost me some of mine. [Laughter]

: But in a very broader sense, that is the true nature of liberty. It comes with both privileges and obligations. Freedom, we all know, is seldom free.

'''Lindow Woman''' is the name given to the partial remains of a female [[bog body]], discovered in a [[peat bog]] at [[Lindow Moss]], near [[Wilmslow]] in [[Cheshire]], England, on 13 May 1983 by commercial peat-cutters. The remains were largely a skull fragment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Study of Mummies|last=Aufderheide|first=Arthur|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0521818265|location=Cambridge|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; with soft tissue and hair attached, and were dated to the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. It was more technically known Lindow I after another body was discovered in the same bog, which is identified as [[Lindow Man]] or Lindow II, the most extensive [[bog body]] yet found in England.

==Discovery==
The bog body of Lindow I was discovered on 13 May 1983 by commercial peat cutters Andy Mould and Stephen Dooley. They first noticed an unusual item on the conveyor belt, which was similar in shape and size to a football. They took the object from the conveyor to examine it more closely. After they removed the adhesive remains of peat, they realized the incomplete preserved human head with attached remnants of soft tissue, brain, eye, optic nerve, and hair.

The police summoned by the Scouts{{clarify|reason=Who are these Scouts?|date=November 2017}} suspected a crime, confiscated the remains and launched  an investigation for murder.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Don Reginald Brothwell, British Museum / Trustees (Hrsg.): . 4. Auflage. British Museum Publications, London 1991, {{ISBN|0-7141-1384-0}}, S. 15, Abb. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; For over two decades, a local 57-year-old man Peter Reyn-Bardt, had been under suspicion of murdering his estranged wife, Malika de Fernandez, and of disposing of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient Skull Leads Man to Confess to Wife's Murder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=892&amp;dat=19831214&amp;id=maRaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2k8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4415,2987263&amp;hl=en|accessdate=18 August 2015|work=The Courier|date=14 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unearthing the living dead|url=http://mg.co.za/article/1998-04-09-unearthing-the-living-dead|accessdate=18 August 2015|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=9 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When questioned, Reyn-Bardt assumed that the skull fragment came from his wife's body, saying, "It has been so long I thought I would never be found out." Afterward, he made a full confession about how he had killed De Fernandez in June 1961, after she returned home, found that he was sharing the premises with another man, and attempted to extort Reyn-Bardt in return for not revealing his [[homosexuality]] ([[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|still criminalized under British law at the time]]). Reyn-Bardt subsequently dismembered De Fernandez's body and buried the pieces in a trench leading to the bog.

Reyn-Bardt was set for trial before [[Chester Crown Court]] in December 1983. By then, [[Carbon-14]] dating of the skull fragment had returned a date of 1740 ± 80BP (c. 250 AD). Reyn-Bardt tried to revoke his confession, but he was still convicted of his wife's murder even though [[murder conviction without a body|no trace of her own body was found]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=12.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, only the bony remains of the skull from the discovery exist because of improper handling of evidence by the police. The remains of the skull were anthropologically known as probably belonging to a 30–50-year-old woman. Recent studies have however raised doubts about the sex of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another body was recovered in the area in 1987 and this was referred to as Lindow III. It was headless and some scientists believe that this was the body of the Lindow Woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bog Mummies: Preserved in Peat|last=Wilcox|first=Charlotte|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2006|isbn=0736813063|location=Mankato, Minnesota|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory described the killings of both Lindow I and II as [[Sacrifice|ritual sacrifice]] attributed to the [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] enclaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Gawain and the Classical Tradition: Essays on the Ancient Antecedents|last=Risden|first=E.L.|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|year=2006|isbn=0786420731|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbert Alonzo "Lon" McCallister Jr.''' (April 17, 1923 – June 11, 2005) was an American actor.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Born in Los Angeles, Lon McCallister began appearing in movies at the age of 13. He had uncredited appearances in ''[[Let's Sing Again]]'' (1936), ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936), ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937), ''[[Souls at Sea]]'' (1937), ''[[Make a Wish (1937 film)|Make a Wish]]'' (1937), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938 film)|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' (1938), ''[[Judge Hardy's Children]]'' (1938), ''[[Lord Jeff]]'' (1938), ''[[That Certain Age]]'' (1938), ''[[Little Tough Guys in Society]]'' (1939), ''[[The Spirit of Culver]]'' (1939), ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]'' (1939), ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939), ''[[First Love (1939 film)|First Love]]'' (1939), and ''[[Joe and Ethel Turp Call on the President]]'' (1939).

McCallister could also be glimpsed in ''[[Susan and God]]'' (1940), ''[[Henry Aldrich for President]]'' (1941), ''[[Dangerously They Live]]'' (1941), ''[[Always in My Heart (film)|Always in My Heart]]'' (1942), ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy (film)|Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), ''[[Spy Ship (film)|Spy Ship]]'' (1942), ''[[Night in New Orleans]]'' (1942), ''[[That Other Woman]]'' (1942), ''[[Gentleman Jim (film)|Gentleman Jim]]'' (1942), ''[[Quiet Please: Murder]]'' (1942), ''[[Over My Dead Body (1942 film)|Over My Dead Body]]'' (1942), ''[[The Hard Way (1943 film)|The Hard Way]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Meanest Man in the World]]'' (1943).

===Stardom===
At 20, he appeared in the World War II morale booster ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'', where he played a star struck serviceman with theater actress and producer [[Katharine Cornell]].

McCallister leapt to fame playing the lead as Sparke in the horse-racing tale ''[[Home in Indiana]]'' (1944), also starring [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Jeanne Crain]].  This led to a contract with [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25995389 |title=The SCREEN |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |volume=CLVIII |issue=22,780 |location=Tasmania, Australia |date=4 December 1943 |accessdate=30 December 2017 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed it with ''[[Winged Victory (film)|Winged Victory]]'' (1944) but then his career momentum was interrupted by war service.

Growing only to 5'6" he found it difficult to find roles as an adult. He appeared with [[Edward G. Robinson]] in 1947's ''[[The Red House (1947 movie)|The Red House]]'' and had the star role in ''[[Thunder in the Valley (film)|Thunder in the Valley]]'' (1947), and supported [[June Haver]] in ''[[Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!]]'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article220757723 |title=Hollywood REPORTS. |newspaper=[[Lithgow Mercury]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=13 January 1947 |accessdate=30 December 2017 |page=4|edition=CITY |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCallister had the lead in another animal story ''[[The Big Cat (film)|The Big Cat]]'' (1949) and co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[The Story of Seabiscuit]]'' (1949). He was in ''[[The Boy from Indiana]]'' (1950).

===Television===
McCallister began appearing on TV in episodes of ''[[Suspense (TV series)|Suspense]]'' ("Lunch Box", "Collector's Item"), and ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'' ("Down Bayou DuBac").

He had the lead in [[Sam Katzman]]'s ''[[A Yank in Korea]]'' (1951) and a Western, ''[[Montana Territory (film)|Montana Territory]]'' (1952) but was mostly in TV: ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' ("Verdict from Space"), "The Last Man on Earth", ("Enemy Unknown"), ''[[The Ford Television Theatre]]'' ("My Daughter's Husband"), ''[[Schlitz Playhouse]]'' ("Operation Riviera"), and ''[[Footlights Theater]]'' ("My Daughter's Husband"). His last feature film was ''[[Combat Squad]]'' (1953).

===Post-acting career===
In 1953, at the age of 30, he retired from acting. Later in life he became a successful [[real estate]] manager. After retirement, he still appeared in two [[television series]], as Coley Wilks in the 1961 episode "The Hostage" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', starring [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]], and as Willie in the 1963 episode "Triple Indemnity" of the [[CBS]] [[sitcom]], ''[[The New Phil Silvers Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564708/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|title=Lon McCallister|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
He was a long time romantic partner of fellow actor [[William Eythe]], up until Eythe's death in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Mann | first=William | authorlink=William J.

'''Natural evolution strategies''' ('''NES''') are a family of [[numerical optimization]] algorithms for [[black box]] problems. Similar in spirit to [[evolution strategies]], they iteratively update the (continuous) parameters of a ''search distribution'' by following the [[information geometry#Natural gradient|natural gradient]] towards higher expected fitness.

==Method==

The general procedure is as follows: the ''parameterized'' search distribution is used to produce a batch of search points, and the [[fitness function]] is evaluated at each such point. The distribution’s parameters (which include ''strategy parameters'') allow the algorithm to adaptively capture the (local) structure of the fitness function. For example, in the case of a [[Gaussian distribution]], this comprises the mean and the [[covariance matrix]]. From the samples, NES estimates a search gradient on the parameters towards higher expected fitness. NES then performs a gradient ascent step along the '''[[Information_geometry#Natural_gradient|natural gradient]]''', a second order method which, unlike the plain gradient, renormalizes the update w.r.t. uncertainty. This step is crucial, since it prevents oscillations, premature convergence, and undesired effects stemming from a given parameterization. The entire process reiterates until a stopping criterion is met.

All members of the NES family operate based on the same principles. They differ in the type of [[probability distribution]] and the gradient [[approximation]] method used. Different search spaces require different search distributions; for example, in low dimensionality it can be highly beneficial to model the full covariance matrix. In high dimensions, on the other hand, a more scalable alternative is to limit the covariance to the [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] only. In addition, highly multi-modal search spaces may benefit from more [[Heavy-tailed_distribution|heavy-tailed distributions]] (such as [[Cauchy_distribution|Cauchy]], as opposed to the Gaussian). A last distinction arises between distributions where we can analytically compute the natural gradient, and more general distributions where we need to estimate it from samples.

===Search gradients===
Let &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; denote the parameters of the search distribution &lt;math&gt;\pi(x \,|\, \theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; the fitness function evaluated at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. NES then pursues the objective of maximizing the ''expected fitness under the search distribution''
:: &lt;math&gt;J(\theta) = \operatorname{E}_\theta[f(x)] = \int f(x) \; \pi(x \,|\, \theta) \; dx&lt;/math&gt;
through [[gradient ascent]]. The gradient can be rewritten as
::&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) = \nabla_{\theta} \int f(x) \; \pi(x \,|\, \theta) \; dx &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;   = \int f(x) \; \nabla_{\theta} \pi(x \,|\, \theta) \; dx &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;   = \int f(x) \; \nabla_{\theta} \pi(x \,|\, \theta) \; \frac{\pi(x \,|\, \theta)}{\pi(x \,|\, \theta)} \; dx &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;   = \int \Big[ f(x) \; \nabla_{\theta} \log\pi(x \,|\, \theta) \Big] \; \pi(x \,|\, \theta) \; dx&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;   = \operatorname{E}_\theta \left[ f(x) \; \nabla_{\theta} \log\pi(x \,|\, \theta)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
that is, the [[expected value]] of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; times the [[Logarithmic derivative|log-derivatives]] at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, it is possible to use the [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] approximation based on a finite number of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; samples
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) \approx 
   \frac{1}{\lambda} 
\sum_{k=1}^{\lambda} f(x_k) \; \nabla_{\theta} 
\log\pi(x_k \,|\, \theta)&lt;/math&gt;.
Finally, the parameters of the search distribution can be updated iteratively
::&lt;math&gt;\theta \leftarrow \theta + \eta \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;

===Natural gradient ascent===
Instead of using the plain stochastic gradient for updates, NES
follows the '''natural gradient''', which has been shown to 
possess numerous advantages over the plain (''vanilla'') gradient, e.g.:
* the gradient direction is independent of the parameterization of the search distribution 
* the updates magnitudes are automatically adjusted based on uncertainty, in turn speeding convergence on [[Plateau_(mathematics)|plateaus]] and ridges.

The NES update is therefore
::&lt;math&gt;\theta \leftarrow \theta + \eta \mathbf{F}^{-1}\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta) &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fisher_information#Matrix_form|Fisher information matrix]].
The Fisher matrix can sometimes be computed exactly, otherwise it is estimated from samples, reusing the log-derivatives &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\theta \log\pi(x|\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Fitness shaping===
NES utilizes [[Ranking|rank]]-based fitness shaping in order to render the
algorithm more robust, and ''invariant'' under monotonically
increasing transformations of the fitness function. 
For this purpose, the fitness of the population is transformed into a set of [[utility]] values
&lt;math&gt;u_1 \geq \dots \geq u_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; best individual.
Replacing fitness with utility, the gradient estimate becomes
::&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{\theta} J (\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^\lambda u_k \; \nabla_{\theta} \log\pi(x_k \,|\, \theta) &lt;/math&gt;.
The choice of utility function is a free parameter of the algorithm.

===Pseudocode===

 1  '''repeat'''
    
 2     {{nowrap|'''for ''' &lt;math&gt;k=1\ldots\lambda&lt;/math&gt; '''do'''}}                                              ''// {{mvar|&amp;lambda;}} is the population size''

'''''Paws and Claws: Pet Vet''''' is a [[pet-raising simulation]] [[video game]] by German studio Radon Labs in which players can nurse [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[horse]]s, birds, [[guinea pig]]s and [[rabbit]]s back to health. The game features 20 ailments. Players can design their own clinic, choose which kennels to build and expand existing buildings to provide further services to their patients.&lt;ref name="GZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nds.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r30398.htm|title=Paws and Claws Pet Vet Review|author=Grabowski, Dakota|publisher=''GameZone''|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players assume the role of a [[veterinarian]] running a pet clinic and must heal sick pets back to full health. At the beginning of the game, this involves treating smaller pets such as guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, and birds. As the player gains experience, larger animals such as horses, dogs, or cats become available. The clinic's facilities can be expanded and altered (for instance, the style of kennels used to house the animals). Expanding facilities enables more pets to be housed and increases the range of treatments available. Players are also responsible for managing the clinic's finances and supplies.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt;

Each type of pet has a different type of task to be completed in order to heal them. Dogs can play fetch and be taken for a run to increase their fitness and horses can be ridden and taken out to the pasture. The Nintendo DS version utilizes voice recognition via the inbuilt microphone to issue commands to pets as well as to calm them during treatment.&lt;ref name="GZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/764/764168p1.html|title = Paws &amp; Claws Pet Vet Review| author = Thomas, Lucas|publisher = [[IGN]]| date = 2007-02-14|accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six available buildings to construct and expand: the practice, the therapy house, the small animal house, the cat house, the dog house, and the horse stalls. In town, there are nine stores to conduct business and train players' characters.

During the game, players can learn about different diseases and ailments. Ailments include fungus infection, Vitamin E Deficiency, ear inflammation, mold infection, Rabbit Flu, lung infection, corneal injury, liver infection, sunburn, asthma, and tonsil infections. As players move through the game, they are able to keep animals in animal houses for prolonged treatment. In the small animal house, they may keep guinea pigs, rabbits, or birds that have more serious injuries and diseases. When animals are in the animal houses, players must treat and feed them every day.

The game has a large playing world in which the character's actions are constrained by what time of day it is in-game. The clinic opens and closes at certain times of day, and if players wait too long to service a customer, they will leave the clinic. Patients must be healed in a certain amount of time, and customers will not pay their bill if players do not heal their animals.

===Characters===
In the game, players assume one of three characters: Hanna, Alex or Sophie. As one of these characters, players have many responsibilities to the clinic and the animals they are treating. They can dress the character for work, riding a horse, or for leisure. Players can also make them walk with the arrow keys or run while holding shift and using the arrow keys.

===Settings===
The game takes place in town, the animal practice, small animal house, cat house, therapy center, dog house, horse barn, fields and meadows, the forest, the beach, and town outskirts.  The  fields, meadows, practice, and town are the areas of the world that do not have to be purchased.  The small animal house, cat house, therapy center, dog house, and horse barn are things that players must purchase using the money they receive from treating patients. The forest, beach and town outskirts are areas players can eventually earn by completing objectives.

[[File:Tomb of pope Johannes Paulus I.jpg|thumb|Tomb of John Paul I in the Vatican Grottoes]]
[[Pope John Paul I]] died suddenly in September 1978, 33 days after his election. Following contradictory reports about the circumstances of his death and apparent anomalies about the issuing of the death certificate and other procedures, several conspiracy theories have gained currency.

Many of these concern the serious corruption in the [[Institute for the Works of Religion|Vatican Bank]] (Istituto per le Opere Religiose), possibly linked to [[Freemasonry]], which is forbidden by church law. None of the claims have been substantiated. 

==Rationale==
Discrepancies in the Vatican's account of the events surrounding John Paul I's death – its inaccurate statements about who found the body;&lt;ref name="BISHOP TELLS STORY OF POPE JOHN PAUL I'S DEATH HE DEBUNKS CONSPIRACY THEORY, BUTS SAYS VATICAN ALTERED SOME DETAILS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0872605057EA5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=BISHOP TELLS STORY OF POPE JOHN PAUL I'S DEATH HE DEBUNKS CONSPIRACY THEORY, BUTS SAYS VATICAN ALTERED SOME DETAILS|date=October 11, 1998|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; what he had been reading; when, where, and whether an [[autopsy]] could be carried out&lt;ref name="BISHOP TELLS STORY OF POPE JOHN PAUL I'S DEATH HE DEBUNKS CONSPIRACY THEORY, BUTS SAYS VATICAN ALTERED SOME DETAILS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evidence of foul play in Pope death claimed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/613208502.html?dids=613208502:613208502&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+07%2C+1978&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=Evidence+of+foul+play+in+Pope+death+claimed&amp;pqatl=google|title=Evidence of foul play in Pope death claimed|date=Oct 7, 1978|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; – produced a number of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], many associated with the [[Vatican Bank]], which owned many shares in [[Banco Ambrosiano]]. 

Some conspiracy theorists connect the death of John Paul in September 1978 with the image of the "[[Third Secret of Fátima|bishop dressed in white]]" said to have been seen by [[Lucia Santos]] and her cousins [[Jacinta and Francisco Marto]] during the [[Marian apparitions|visitations]] of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crc-internet.org/1830-ther-murder-of-pope-john-paul-i.html John Paul I at Catholic Counter-Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902161009/http://crc-internet.org/1830-ther-murder-of-pope-john-paul-i.html |date=2013-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicvoice.co.uk/fatima4/ch9.htm Chapter 4 of Whole Truth about Fátima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505024625/http://www.catholicvoice.co.uk/fatima4/ch9.htm |date=2010-05-05 }}, sections 7, 8 and 9, webpage found 2010-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to a colleague, John Paul had said he was deeply moved by having met Lucia and vowed to perform the [[Consecration of Russia]] in accordance with her vision.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Camillo Bassotto's book ''My Heart Is Still in Venice'', a biography of John Paul I (Krinon, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==

===David Yallop===
[[David Yallop]]'s 1984 book ''[[In God's Name]]'' proposed the theory that the pope had been in "potential danger" because of corruption in the Vatican Bank (known officially as the [[Institute for Works of Religion]] or ''Istituto per le Opere di Religione''), the Vatican's most powerful financial institution&lt;ref&gt;Ben Walsh, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-vatican-bank_us_56031658e4b00310edf9e8d9 The Pope’s Overlooked Legacy: Reforming The Vatican Bank]. ''Huffington Post'', 2015-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt; which owned many shares in [[Banco Ambrosiano]].

Marcinkus, at the time head of the Vatican Bank, was indicted in Italy in 1982 as an accessory in the $3.5 billion collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.&lt;ref&gt;Margalit Fox, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/22/business/archbishop-marcinkus-84-banker-at-the-vatican-dies.html Archbishop Marcinkus, 84, Banker at the Vatican, Dies].

His death was initially ruled suicide and a second inquest – ordered by his family – then returned an [[open verdict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2537853.stm | work=BBC News | first=Chris | last=Summers | title=Call for third 'God's banker' inquest | date=4 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon publication of his book, Yallop agreed to donate every penny he made from sales to a charity of the Vatican's choice if they agreed to investigate his central claim, that when the body of the pope was discovered, his contorted hand gripped a piece of paper that was later destroyed because it named high-ranking members of the curia who were [[Freemason]]s and others who had a role in numerous corruption scandals and the laundering of mafia drug money. One of the names believed to be on the paper was that of Bishop Paul Marcinkus, who was later promoted by Pope John Paul II to Pro-President of Vatican City, making him the third most powerful person in the Vatican, after the pope and the secretary of state. None of Yallop's claims, which are unproven, has thus far been acknowledged by the Vatican, although Yallop disclosed the Masonic Lodge numbers of the Curia members whom he alleged to be Freemasons in his book.&lt;ref name="Declaration on Masonic Associations"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19831126_declaration-masonic_en.html Declaration on Masonic Associations], Vatican website, in English.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[papal ban of Freemasonry]], and it is forbidden by Church law for a Roman Catholic to be a Freemason.


Yallop specifically summarized his conspiracy theory in his book: Three archbishops—Marcinkus, Villot and Cody—conspired with three Mafia types—Calvi, Sindona and Gelli—in the murder of John Paul I. “It was clear that these six men—Marcinkus, Villot, Cody, Calvi, Sindona and Gelli—had a great deal to fear if the papacy of John Paul I should continue… all of them stood to gain in a variety of ways if John Paul I should suddenly die.” &lt;ref&gt;In God’s Name June 1984, David Yallop. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Cornwell===
In his book ''[[A Thief in The Night (John Cornwell)|A Thief in the Night]]'', British historian and journalist [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] examines and challenges Yallop’s points of suspicion. Yallop’s murder theory requires that the pope’s body be found at 4:30 or 4:45 a.m., one hour earlier than official reports estimated. He bases this, ''inter alia'', on an early story by [[Vatican Radio]] and the Italian news service [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] that garbled the time and misrepresented the layout of the papal apartments. Yallop claims to have had testimony from [[Sister Vincenza Taffarel]] (the nun who found the pope's body) to this effect but refused to show Cornwell his transcripts.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Abbé Georges de Nantes===
Theologian and cult leader [[Abbé]] {{ill|Georges de Nantes|fr}} spent much of his life building a case for murder against the Vatican, collecting statements from people who knew the pope before and after his election. His writings go into detail about the banks and about John Paul&amp;nbsp;I's supposed discovery of a number of Freemason priests in the Vatican, along with a number of his proposed reforms and devotion to [[Our Lady of Fátima]].&lt;ref name="Declaration on Masonic Associations"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crc-internet.org/?s=Luciani Search for "Luciani"] at [[League for Catholic Counter-Reformation|CRC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lucien Gregoire===

Gregoire builds on his forerunners, benefiting by events not available to the others when they wrote their books. “I owe a great debt of gratitude to my predecessors…had Yallop not laid out the blueprint, had Cornwell not told the truth, had Manhattan not struck on the plot; I could have never written my book.”&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican Murders 2017 Lucien Gregoire p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Avro Manhattan linked the CIA to the murder of John Paul I. “The CIA resolved to destroy John Paul I before he would destroy a Vatican subservient to the will of the USA.”&lt;ref&gt;The Dollar and the Vatican 1988 Avro Manhattan p.147&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 1978, with the growing likelihood that Carter would cut off funds to Somoza, the CIA feared if Nicaragua fell to the Marxist Sandinistas, the USA would soon be looking at a half-dozen mini-Cubas in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard Crimson September 19, 1978 Carter Must End Aid to Somoza &lt;/ref&gt; 

Suspected CIA covert agent Chicago Cardinal Cody visited the Polish cardinal (John Paul II) in Krakow during the papacy of John Paul I. &lt;ref&gt;In God’s Name 1984 David Yallop. p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; 

What Gregoire brings to the table is the complete record of the courts that tried the bank scandal—from the first transaction that took place on October 22, 1978 six days after John Paul II took office, &lt;ref&gt;Tribunal Latour vs. Ambrosiano, Paris 22 Oct 1985 &lt;/ref&gt; to the last transaction in 1981 when Ambrosiano was caught funneling hundreds of millions of dollars through the Vatican Bank to Nicaragua and Panama to the benefit of Somoza and the Contras and to a lesser extent   Solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican Murders 2017 Lucien Gregoire p. 403 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Hence, Lucien Gregoire’s conspiracy theory: ”The conspiracy that planned the Vatican-Ambrosiano Bank Scandal&lt;ref&gt;Banco Ambrosiano swindled investors of $1.3 billion routing it through the Vatican Bank to the Contras to crush Liberation Theology (Marxist revolution of the poor) in Central America&lt;/ref&gt; was the same conspiracy that plotted the murder of John Paul I.”&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican Murders 2017 Lucien Gregoire p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tridentine Mass===
According to the [[Catholic Traditionalist Movement]], their founder Fr. [[Gommar DePauw]] was to have gone to Rome to help John Paul I reestablish the [[Tridentine Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinmass-ctm.org/ctmnews/September2013.htm |title=September 2013 News From CTM |last1=Cuneo |first1=Richard |date=8 September 2013 |website=latinmass-ctm.org |publisher=Catholic Traditionalist Movement |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
[Fr. DePauw] stated on the 15th anniversary of the pope’s death: “Well, I tell you one thing, if he had remained Pope, you wouldn’t have me here at the Chapel because with that beautiful official letter signed by the Secretary of State, also came an unofficial message that I better start packing my suitcase, that there was a job waiting for me in Rome, in the Vatican, to help Pope John Paul I bring the Truth back to the Church. Well, it wasn’t to be and the Lord, Who knows what He does, obviously wanted me to be in this Chapel. … What was I going to do in Rome? Well let’s just forget it.”&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
Other prominent Traditionalist Catholic websites, not related to CTM, have suggested John Paul I may have been assassinated to prevent restoration of the Tridentine Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traditio.com/comment/com1106.htm#110627 |title=John Paul I May Have Been the "Traditional" Pope Prayed For: The Arguably-assassinated Pope Was Reportedly About to Restore the Traditional Latin Mass |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 June 2011 |website=traditio.com |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/359825/papa-luciani-35-years-later-michael-potemra |title=Papa Luciani, 35 Years Later |last1=Potemra |first1=Michael |date=28 September 2013 |website=nationalreview.com |publisher=[[National Review]] |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malachi Martin]]'s book ''Vatican: A Novel'' &lt;ref&gt;Martin, Malachi, ''Vatican: A Novel'', Harper &amp; Row, New York, 1986 {{ISBN|0-06-015478-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a novel based on recent papal history. Although officially a work of fiction, Martin proposes the theory that the pope was murdered by the Soviet Union because he would abdicate the benign policy of his two predecessors, [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], towards accommodating [[communism]], and once again condemn it as an atheistic totalitarian ideology. Martin believed that the church structure was infiltrated for decades by [[illuminati]] agents who reached positions of high influence and rank, such as [[Jean-Marie Villot]], at that time [[Cardinal Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name="LACR"&gt;{{Citation|author=Les Amis du Christ-Roi|language=French|title=L'Eglise Eclipsée?

It was subsequently broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 4 October 2008. In October 2010 the play was brought to continental Europe by the Antwerp Theater Group "De Speling".

[[File:Paolo Veronese cat01c.jpg|thumb|240px|right|''Raising of Jairus' Daughter'' by [[Paolo Veronese]], 1546]]
The episode of the '''daughter of Jairus''' is a combination of [[miracles of Jesus in the Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 5:21–43, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 9:18–26, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 8:40–56).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%205:21-43&amp;version=NIV Biblegateway Mark 5:21–43]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209:18-26&amp;version=NIV Biblegateway Matthew  9:18–26]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:40-56&amp;version=NIV Biblegateway Luke 8:40–56]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story immediately follows the [[Exorcising the Gerasenes demonic|exorcism at Gerasa]]. Jairus ({{Lang-el|Ἰάειρος}}, ''Iaeiros'', from the Hebrew name [[Yair (name)|Yair]]), a patron or ruler of a [[Galilee]] [[synagogue]], had asked Jesus to heal his 12-year-old daughter.

As they were traveling to Jairus' house, a sick woman in the crowd touched Jesus' cloak and was healed of her sickness. Jesus turned round to the woman and said "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace." (see Luke 8:43-48) ([[Christ healing the bleeding woman]]). In the 2nd and 3rd Gospel's version, a messenger arrived with the news that Jairus' daughter had died, and he was advised not to trouble Jesus any further. However, Jesus responded:

{{quote|''Be not afraid, only believe.'' ([http://biblehub.com/mark/5-36.htm Mark 5:36])}}

Jesus continued to the house, where there were "flute players and crowd making a commotion" (Mark 5:23). He informed all those present that the girl was not dead but asleep. He then went upstairs and restored the little girl to life. In Mark's account, the [[Aramaic]] phrase "[[Language_of_Jesus#Talitha_kum_.28.CE.A4.CE.B1.CE.BB.CE.B9.CE.B8.E1.BD.B0_.CE.BA.CE.BF.CF.8D.CE.BC_.5B.CE.BA.CE.BF.E1.BF.A6.CE.BC.CE.B9.5D.29|Talitha Koum]]" (transliterated into Greek as ταλιθα κουμ and meaning, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!") is attributed to Jesus.

The combined stories have been used as an example of [[intercalation (literature)|intercalation]], where one incident is inserted within another, linked in this case by the connection between the 12-year ailment and the 12-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textexcavation.com/intercalations.html#jairushemorrhage Intercalations in the synoptic tradition]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
John Donahue and [[Daniel J. Harrington|Daniel Harrington]] state that this episode shows that "faith, especially as embodied by the bleeding woman, can exist in seemingly hopeless situations".&lt;ref&gt;John R. Donahue, Daniel J. Harrington 2005 ''The Gospel of Mark'' {{ISBN|0-8146-5965-9}} page 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Keene]] states that there is a link between Jairus and the woman: "The link between them is faith since both Jairus and the bleeding woman showed great faith in Jesus".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Keene, 2002 ''St Mark's Gospel and the Christian faith'' {{ISBN|0-7487-6775-4}} page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

John Walvoord and Roy Zuck state that: "What appeared to be a disastrous delay in the healing of the woman actually assured the restoration of Jairus' daughter. It was providentially ordered to test and strengthen Jairus' faith."&lt;ref&gt;John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck, 1983 ''The Bible Knowledge Commentary'' {{ISBN|0-88207-812-7}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Peter Lange|Johann Lange]] also states that: "This delay would serve both to try and to strengthen the faith of Jairus."&lt;ref&gt;Johann Peter Lange, 1960 ''A commentary on the Holy Scriptures'' Zondervan Press ASIN: B00133NOEM page 174&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Lawrence''' ([[Circa|c.]] 1800 – June 13, 1861) was an American [[house painter]] who was the first known person to attempt to assassinate a sitting [[President of the United States]]. Lawrence attempted to shoot President [[Andrew Jackson]] outside the [[United States Capitol]] on January 30, 1835. At trial, Lawrence was found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] and spent the remainder of his life in [[insane asylum]]s. 

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in [[England]], most likely around 1800 or 1801. His family immigrated to the United States when he was 12 years old and settled in [[Virginia]], near Washington, DC. Lawrence's childhood and early adult years were apparently normal. At his trial, he was described by acquaintances and relatives as a "relatively fine young boy" who was "reserved in his manner; but industrious and of good moral habits."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|2012|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence later found work as a house painter. Historians have speculated that exposure to the toxic chemicals in the paints that he used may have contributed to his mental illness, which manifested in his thirties.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2010|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental illness==
By November 1832, Lawrence's behavior and mental stability had inexplicably changed. He abruptly announced to his family that he was returning to England, and he left Washington, DC, shortly thereafter. He returned a month later telling his family he decided not to travel abroad as it was too cold. Shortly after returning, he again announced that he was returning to England to study landscape painting.&lt;ref name=“clarke1”&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|2012|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence left once again and briefly stayed in [[Philadelphia]] before returning home. He told his family that "unnamed persons" had prevented him from traveling abroad and that the US government also disapproved of his plan to return to England. Lawrence also claimed that while he was in Philadelphia, he read several stories about himself in the newspaper that were critical of his travel plans and his character. Lawrence told his family that he had no choice but to return to Washington, DC, until he could afford to buy a ship and hire a captain who would sail the ship to England for him.&lt;ref name=“clarke1” /&gt;

Around this time, Lawrence abruptly quit his house painting job. When questioned by his sister and brother-in-law with whom he was living, Lawrence claimed that he did not need to work because the US government owed him a large sum of money. Lawrence had come to believe that he was owed money because he was [[Richard III of England]] and owned two English estates. Lawrence became convinced that he was not receiving the money because of President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s opposition to the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. He felt that if Jackson were no longer in office, Vice President [[Martin Van Buren]] would establish a national bank and allow Congress to pay him the money for his English estate claims.&lt;ref name=“clarke1” /&gt;

Lawrence's personality and outward appearance changed dramatically around this time. Once conservatively dressed, Lawrence grew a mustache and began buying expensive and flamboyant clothing, which he would change three or four times a day. He took to standing in the doorway of his home for hours and gazing out into the street. Neighborhood children would jokingly address him as "King Richard," which typically pleased Lawrence, who failed to realize the children were teasing him. He also became paranoid and hostile towards others. On one occasion, he threatened to kill a maid who he thought was laughing at him. Lawrence also began verbally and physically abusing his family, mainly his sisters, over imagined slights. In one instance, he threatened to hit his sister with a paperweight because he believed that she had been talking about him. At Lawrence's trial, witnesses described the bizarre behavior that he exhibited. Several people testified that Lawrence would engage in nonsensical conversations with himself, and others stated that he would have laughing and [[profanity|cursing]] fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|2012|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempt==
[[Image:JacksonAssassinationAttempt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The etching of the assassination attempt.]]

In the weeks leading up to the assassination attempt on Jackson, Lawrence began observing Jackson's movements. Witnesses later testified that Lawrence was often seen sitting in his paint shop muttering to himself about Jackson. On January 30, 1835, the day of the assassination attempt, Lawrence was seen sitting in his paint shop with a book in his hand while laughing. Lawrence suddenly got up, left the shop and stated, "I'll be damned if I don't do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|2012|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, Jackson was attending the funeral of [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Warren R. Davis]] at the [[US Capitol]]. Lawrence originally planned to shoot Jackson as he entered the service but was unable to get close enough to Jackson. However, when Jackson left the funeral, Lawrence had found a space near a pillar on the East Portico l, where Jackson would pass. As Jackson walked, Lawrence stepped out and fired his first pistol at Jackson's back; it misfired. Lawrence quickly made another attempt with his second pistol, but that also misfired. It was later determined that the weapons that he had chosen were noted for being vulnerable to moisture, and the weather on that date was humid and damp.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

Lawrence's unsuccessful attempts were noticed by Jackson, who proceeded to beat him with his cane. The crowd (which included Representative [[Davy Crockett|David "Davy" Crockett]]) eventually intervened and wrestled Lawrence into submission.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

==Trial and commitment==
Lawrence was brought to trial on April 11, 1835, at the [[District of Columbia City Hall]]. The prosecuting attorney was [[Francis Scott Key]].&lt;ref name="bartee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartee|first1=Wayne C.|last2=Fleetwood Bartee|first2=Alice|title=Litigating Morality: American Legal Thought and Its English Roots|date=1992|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-94127-2|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial, Lawrence was prone to wild rants and he refused to recognize the legitimacy of the proceedings. At one point he said to the courtroom, "It is for me, gentlemen, to pass judgment on you, and not you upon me"." After only five minutes of deliberation, the jury found Lawrence "[[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Regan|2008|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following his acquittal, Lawrence was held by several institutions and hospitals. In 1855, he was committed to the newly-opened Government Hospital for the Insane (later renamed [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]]), in Washington, DC, where he remained until his death on June 13, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oliver|Marion|2010|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Barbour |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XKNcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V1gNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6794,1770212 |title=Troubled minds pass through St Elizabeths Hospital |date=November 18, 1982 |work=Gettysburg Times |agency=Associated Press |page=23 |accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
As with later assassinations, there was speculation that Lawrence was part of a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]]. While nobody denied Lawrence's involvement, many people, including Jackson, believed that he may have been supported in or put up to carrying out the assassination attempt by the President's political enemies. U.S. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] made a statement on the Senate floor that he was not connected to the attack. Nevertheless, Jackson believed that Calhoun, an old enemy, was at the bottom of the attempt.&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Knight, Peter|title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-576-07812-4|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson also suspected a former friend and supporter, Senator [[George Poindexter]] of Mississippi, who had used Lawrence to do some house painting a few months earlier. Because Poindexter was unable to convince his supporters in Mississippi that he was not involved in a plot against Jackson, he was defeated for re-election. However, no evidence was ever discovered that connected Lawrence, Calhoun, or Poindexter in a plot to kill Jackson.&lt;ref name="knight"/&gt;

Captain '''Robert Townsend''' (October 21, 1819 – August 15, 1866) was a Civil War-era ship Captain in the United States Navy. He served twice, once before the war then again during the war. He saw active combat while serving aboard three ships, most notably as commander of the USS ''Essex'' from 1863–1864, an ironclad gunship on the Mississippi River. Captain Townsend died of [[heatstroke]] while commanding the [[USS Wachusett (1861)|USS ''Wachusett'']] in China in 1866, and is buried in Albany, New York.

==Ancestry==
Robert Townsend was born on October 21, 1819 in Albany, New York to Isaiah and Hannah Townsend. His father was an executive of the [[Stirling Iron Works]] which under his great-grandfather Peter Townsend forged [[Hudson River Chain|The Great Chain]] which was strung across the [[Hudson River]] at [[West Point]] and prevented the British Royal Navy from threatening that important American base and potentially controlling the river. His grandfather was Captain [[Solomon Townsend]] who was a merchant ship captain before the American Revolution. Robert Townsend was descended from John and [[Henry Townsend (Oyster Bay)|Henry Townsend]], New York, among the first settlers of that area in the early 17th century.

==Early life and pre-Civil War career==
Townsend received his primary education at [[The Albany Academy]], and his secondary education at the Rev. Dr. Dewey's Boarding School in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. After graduating he attended [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady]], New York, but left college before graduating in order to join the board of survey of the [[Utica and Schenectady Railroad]] Company.

Townsend entered the United States Navy on August 4, 1837, serving first as a [[midshipman]] on the ship {{USS|John Adams|1799|2}}. In 1838 he was ordered to the battleship {{USS|Ohio|1820|2}}, then in each subsequent year to the sloop {{USS|Falmouth|1827|2}}, the steamship {{USS|Missouri|1841|2}}. In 1843 he was promoted to [[passed midshipman]] and served on the frigate {{USS|Raritan|1843|2}}, then a year later on the brig {{USS|Porpoise|1836|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Memorial Biographies of the New England Historic Genealogical Society |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1905|publisher= New England Historic Genealogical Society|location= Boston|isbn= |page= 175|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NXEtAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA176&amp;lpg=RA1-PA176&amp;dq=uss+wachusett+townsend&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2J4puJLUh4&amp;sig=tP1nCGnE9a4XlgAbHlQnLdZSceQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Qwn6SYjEN4HOMrrqqNEE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PRA1-PA175,M1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in the Mexican–American War from 1846–1847 where he was engaged in the capture of Vera Cruz. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] in 1850, and resigned from the navy on April 7, 1851.

On June 19, 1850, Townsend married Harriet Munro, the daughter of Nathan Munro and Cynthia Champlin, of [[Elbridge (town), New York|Elbridge, New York]]. The couple had three children; a son, Robert Townsend, Jr., born October 4, 1854, and daughters Mary Walker Townsend, born December 23, 1858, and Elizabeth Munroe Townsend, born July 19, 1860.

==Civil War service==
At the beginning of the civil war Townsend re-entered the service on 17 September 1861 as acting-lieutenant, receiving a promotion to commander a few months later, and served on a number of fighting ships.

===USS Miami===
[[File:USSMiami1861.jpg|thumb|right|USS Miami]]
In 1862 Townsend was acting-lieutenant of the {{USS|Miami|1861|2}} under the command of Abram Davis Harrell. The ''Miami'' was a side-wheel, double-ender gunboat with a crew of 134 and armament of one 80-pounder [[Parrott rifle]], one 9&amp;nbsp;inch smoothbore, and four 24-pounder cannon. The ship participated under Admiral [[David Farragut]] as part of the Mortar Flotilla in neutralizing Confederate forts below New Orleans. Eliminating the forts permitted the Union ships to move upriver and eventually take New Orleans. Townsend became Commander of the ''Miami'' by October of that year.

===USS Essex===
[[File:USS essex 1856.jpg|thumb|right|USS Essex]]
In 1863, he was promoted to commander and given command of the {{USS|Essex|1856|2}} under Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]]'s [[Mississippi Squadron]]. The ''Essex'' was a 1,000 ton [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] river [[gunboat]] of the [[United States Army]] and later [[United States Navy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It was named for [[Essex County, Massachusetts]]. ''Essex'' was originally constructed in 1856 at [[New Albany, Indiana]] as a [[steam powered]] ferry named ''New Era''. She had a crew of 134, armament consisting of one 32-pounder, three 11-inch [[Dahlgren gun|Dahlgren smooth bore]]s, one 10-inch Dahlgren smoothbore and one 12-pounder [[howitzer]], with armor consisting of 1¾ inch forward casemate, ¾-inch sides.

Under Townsend's command the ''Essex'' participated in the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] which occurred from May 21 to July 9, 1863, when Union Army troops assaulted and then captured the Mississippi River town of Port Hudson, Louisiana. Along with the Mortar Flotilla, the ''Essex'' bombarded the area daily and helped bring about the surrender of the city. The Union's success in this battle gave Northern forces effective control of the Mississippi River and effectively cut the states of Arkansas and Texas off from the rest of the confederacy.

On July 9, she engaged the enemy at [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]], and although damaged in the battle, carried out her patrol duty at this point through March 6, 1864 when she sailed with the fleet into the mouth of the Red River and assisted in the [[Battle of Fort De Russy|capture of Fort de Russy]] on March 15 and 16.

Townsend relinquished command of the ''Essex'' on November 3, 1864 to Commander Bryson.

===USS Wachusett===
[[File:Wachusett.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Wachusett'']]
[[File:Robert Townsend Grave.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Townsend's grave at the [[Albany Rural Cemetery]].]]
After relinquishing command of the ''Essex'', Townsend was given command of the {{USS|Wachusett|1861|2}}. The ''Wachusett'' was a wooden steam frigate with a detachable propeller, carrying nine guns and a complement of 170 men. She was a large (1,032-ton) steam [[sloop-of-war]] that served the United States Navy in the [[American Civil War]].  She was outfitted as a [[gunboat]] and used by the Navy as part of the [[Union blockade]] of the [[Confederate States of America]]. On February 17, 1865, the ship was given orders to proceed to the [[East India Squadron|East India Station]] by way of the Cape of Good Hope.  There, she joined {{USS|Wyoming|1859|2}} and {{USS|Iroquois|1859|2}} in an effort to track down the Confederate [[commerce raider]] {{Ship|CSS|Shenandoah}}.

While in China the ship was engaged in efforts to track down outlaws and pirates who were harming American interests. In mid-August the ship sailed up the [[Yangtze River]] in this mission. The heat was reportedly 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42&amp;nbsp;°C) in the shade and the ship made difficult passage up the river. A number of cases of heat stroke, some of them fatal occurred. At 1:45 am on August 15, 1866, Robert Townsend died of heat stroke. The executive officer [[John Woodward Philip|John Woodward (Jack) Philip]], (later Admiral), assumed command of the ''Wachusett'' and sailed it downriver with the goal of making it to Japan for the health of the crew. That evening the ship anchored by the consulate in [[Shanghai]] and held a funeral for their commander.

==Burial==
Robert Townsend's body was returned to America and is interred at the Albany Rural Cemetery in New York.

'''Scott Field''' (January 26, 1847 – December 20, 1931) was an [[United States|American]] politician who represented [[Texas]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1903–1907.

==Biography==

Field was born in [[Canton, Mississippi]]. He attended the McKee School in [[Madison County, Mississippi]].

==Military service==

During the [[American Civil War]], Field enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army]] as a member of the Harvey Scouts. Later, he served in Major General W.H. Jackson’s division, Forrest's Command, composed of Ross's Texas Brigade and Armstrong's Tennessee Brigade (cavalry).&lt;ref name="Ross's Brigade C.S.A."&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | name=Ross's Brigade C.S.A.| id=qkr02| author=Benner, Judith Ann| retrieved=27 June 2010}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2nd Mississippi Partisan Rangers Cavalry"&gt;{{cite web|title=2nd Mississippi Partisan Rangers Cavalry|url=http://www.mississippiscv.org/MS_Units/2nd_MS_Partisan_Rangers_Cav.htm|publisher=Mississippi Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott Field-Lucy E. Garrett Randolph"/&gt; According to C.E. Holmes in an affidavit in Field's pension application, Field served in the [[Atlanta Campaign]] of 1864 commanded by [[John Bell Hood]].

==Education and law practice==

After the war, Field attended the [[University of Virginia at Charlottesville]], where he graduated  in 1868.  He returned to Mississippi and taught school for two years while studying law.  Field was admitted to the Mississippi Bar in 1871.&lt;ref name="Scott Field"/&gt;

Scott Field moved to [[Calvert, Texas]] in 1872 and opened a private law practice.

==Career in public service==

He was the prosecuting attorney of [[Robertson County, Texas]] 1878–1882. Field also served in the [[Texas Senate]] 1887–1891 and was a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]] in 1892. During his term in the Texas State Senate, he was the lead sponsor of a law to ban convict labor, a practice thought of as a second incarnation of slavery, as it routinely involved rounding up minorities on false misdemeanor charges and putting them to work during harvest season.

Field was elected as a Democrat to the Fifty-eighth and Fifty-ninth Congresses (March 4, 1903 – March 3, 1907). He was not a candidate for reelection in 1906 to the [[Fiftieth Congress]]. After leaving Congress, he resumed the practice of law until 1913, when he engaged in extensive agricultural pursuits.

==Later years and Confederate pension==

Soldier's Application for a Confederate Pension, #49968, State of Texas, was filed by Scott Field, Sr., July 13, 1931.&lt;ref name="Scott Field-Lucy E. Garrett Randolph"/&gt;  It was approved the same date.  In the application, Field stated that he had enlisted from [[Canton, Mississippi]] and served from September 1863 until the end of the war. The application contains a letter from Joe Y. McNutt, County Judge of Robertson County, to the Hon. Geo. H. Sheppard, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Austin, Texas,  July 11, 1931, stating that Field was completely blind and aided by an attendant.  McNutt testified to Field's character and stated that Field had suffered financial reverses in recent years.

==Personal life==

Scott Field was the son of Henry and Jane (Bates) Field.&lt;ref name="Scott Field"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas | name=Scott Field| id=ffi03| author=Hailey, James R| retrieved=26 June 2010}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt;   of Canton, Mississippi.

He married three times.  Field married Victoria Lucky on December 13, 1874, and she died on February 21, 1877,&lt;ref name="Victoria Field final resting place"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria Field final resting place|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=field&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=191821&amp;GRid=26039167&amp;|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
at the age of 26.  He married Lucy E. Garrett Randolph on June 6, 1878.  Lucy was the widow of George F. Randolph.  Scott and Lucy had three sons, Thomas, Scott and Eugene.  Lucy died on August 20, 1903.&lt;ref name="Lucy Field final resting place"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucy Field final resting place|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=field&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=191821&amp;GRid=26028669&amp;|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Upon her death, he married the widow Maude Harlan Green.&lt;ref name="Scott Field"/&gt;    According to his application for a Confederate pension, his wife was "not living" at the time of the application.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Sociobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that aims to examine and explain [[social behavior]] in terms of [[evolution]]. It draws from disciplines including [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], and [[population genetics]]. Within the study of human [[society|societies]], sociobiology is closely allied to [[Darwinian anthropology]], [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of [[social insect]]s. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.

While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s, the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of [[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of [[scientific controversy|controversy]].  Critics, led by [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as aggressiveness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between [[nature and nurture]].

==Definition==

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, E. O. |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year=1978 |title=On Human Nature |page=x |publisher=Harvard |isbn=978-0674016385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by [[natural selection]]. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be [[Heredity|inherited]] from generation to generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking The Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology | author1=Wilson, David Sloan Wilson |author2=Wilson, Edward O. |author2link=E. O. Wilson | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=2007 | volume=82 | issue=4 | pages=327–348 | doi=10.1086/522809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This [[adaptive behaviour|behavior is adaptive]] because killing the cubs eliminates [[competition (biology)|competition]] for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Packer |first1=Craig |last2=Pusey |first2=Anne E. |title=Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males |journal=Am. Nat.|date=1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716–728 |url=https://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/Adaptations_of_female_lions_to_infanticide.pdf |doi=10.1086/284097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|upright|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]], a central figure in the history of sociobiology, from the publication in 1975 of his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'']]

The philosopher of biology [[Daniel Dennett]] suggested that the political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |pages=453–454 |isbn=978-0140167344}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geneticist of animal behavior [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]] coined the word ''sociobiology'' at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life of J.P. Scott |url=https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/neuroscience/john-paul-scott/the-life-of-jp-scott.html |publisher=Bowling Green State University |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levallois |first1=Clement |title=The Development of Sociobiology in Relation to Animal Behavior Studies, 1946–1975 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2018 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=419–444 |doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9491-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a  "Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology" of the ESA was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, [[E. O. Wilson]] came in contact this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a "sociobiologist" at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's sociobiology is different from [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]]'s or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximisation of the genetic fitness by [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[John Maynard Smith]], and [[George R. Price]]. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when "biology in the field" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by "modern" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).&lt;ref name=Dobzhansky1966&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=Theodosius |title=Are Naturalists Old-Fashioned? |journal=The American Naturalist |date=September 1966 |volume=100 |issue=915 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1086/282448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a specialist term, "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'', which sparked an intense controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilson's vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other [[Hymenoptera]], but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book, ''[[On Human Nature]]'', that addressed human behavior specifically.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walsh, Bryan | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/on-human-nature-by-edward-o-wilson/ | title=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books |date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Psychology 2005"&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen &lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Sociobiologists maintain that [[Human nature|human behavior]], as well as nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.

[[Natural selection]] is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be "selected for". Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an [[organism]] a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman [[Species|animal species]] has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it has become a foundation of [[evolutionary biology]]. However, there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.

[[File:Nikolaas Tinbergen 1978.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], whose work influenced sociobiology]]

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore, these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]] and explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called "ultimate explanations") are
* the function (i.e., [[adaptation]]) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e., [[phylogeny]]) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
* the development of the individual (i.e., [[ontogeny]]) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g., [[brain anatomy]] and [[hormone]]s).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in [[instinct]]ive, or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of [[mammals]] – including humans – are very protective of their [[offspring]]. Sociobiologists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral [[adaptation]]s, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.

Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon [[social group|groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1975. Chapter 5. "Group Selection and Altruism"&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms responsible for [[group selection]] employ [[paradigms]] and population statistics borrowed from [[evolutionary game theory]]. Altruism is defined as "a concern for the welfare of others". If altruism is genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tessman |first=Irwin |title=Human altruism as a courtship display |journal=Forum |year=1995 |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological [[hypothesis]] by finding an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy, and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between [[social insect]]s and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costa-Leonarda |first=Ana Maria |title=Termite Communication during different behavioral activities |journal=In: Witzany G (ed). Biocommunication of Animals |year=2014 |pages=161–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some animals has been correlated to the degree of [[genome]] shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of [[infanticide]] by male harem-mating animals when the [[alpha male]] is displaced as well as [[rodent]] female infanticide and fetal resorption are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the [[food]] and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an [[ecological]] balance. Just as an expansion of a [[sheep]] population might encourage the expansion of a [[wolf]] population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] have high [[heritability]]. The researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=E. |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas |year=2009 |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217–220 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20%282009%29.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmc=2899491 |pmid=20625474 |quote=Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008). |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turkheimer |first=Eric |date=April 2008 |title=A Better Way to Use Twins for Developmental Research |journal=LIFE Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–5 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20%282008%29.pdf |accessdate=29 October 2010 |quote=But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. . . . Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn't an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crime|Criminality]] is actively under study, but extremely controversial. There are arguments that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html The Sociobiology Of Sociopathy: An Integrated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026131543/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |date=2002-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Elias Canetti]] also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Canetti]], ''[[Crowds and Power]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1981, p. 444-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for premise==
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For example, the [[transcription factor]] FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the [[serotonergic system]] in the brain, is required for normal [[aggression|aggressive]] and [[anxiety]]-like behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks TJ, Fyodorov DV, Wegman LJ, Lelutiu NB, Pehek EA, Yamamoto B, Silver J, Weeber EJ, Sweatt JD, Deneris ES. Pet-1 ETS gene plays a critical role in 5-HT neuron development and is required for normal anxiety-like and aggressive behaviour]. Neuron. 2003 Jan 23;37(2):233-47&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behaviour. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal behaviour in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerch-Haner | first1 = JK | last2 = Frierson | first2 = D | last3 = Crawford | first3 = LK | last4 = Beck | first4 = SG | last5 = Deneris | first5 = ES | date = Sep 2008 | title = Serotonergic transcriptional programming determines maternal behavior and offspring survival | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 11 | issue = 9| pages = 1001–3 | doi=10.1038/nn.2176| pmid = 19160496 | pmc = 2679641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic basis for instinctive behavioural traits among non-human species, such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists; however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviours in human societies has remained extremely controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Helen |title='Wilson,' They Said, 'Your All Wet!' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/wilson-naturalist.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=21 July 2015 |date=16 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Sociobiology: the art of storytelling |journal=New Scientist |date=16 November 1978 |volume=80 |issue=1129 |pages=530–533|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRj7EyRFVqYC&amp;pg=PA530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Steven Pinker]] argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of [[biological determinism]],{{efn|Biological determinism was a right wing philosophy underlying the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinian]] and [[Eugenics#History|eugenics movements]] of the early 20th century, and [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|controversies in the history of intelligence testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} accusing among others [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven | authorlink=Steven Pinker |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=149 |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 |quote=A surprising number of intellectuals, particularly on the left, do deny that there is such a thing as inborn talent, especially intelligence.

Gould grouped sociobiology with [[eugenics]], criticizing both in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1996 |title=The Mismeasure of Man |page=Introduction to the Revised Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]], as reported by [[Ullica Segerstråle]], Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|p=205}} Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the "[[blank slate]]" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 ''Reflections on Language''.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1975), ''Reflections on Language'':10. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995). [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 "Rollback, Part II."] ''Z Magazine'' 8 (Feb.): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ''ought'' to be, only what ''is'' the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought",&lt;ref name=lrk84/&gt; an instance of the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered anti-social, such as [[ethnic nepotism]], is based on [[morality|moral]] assumptions, meaning that such opposition is not [[falsifiable]] by scientific advances.&lt;ref name=Pinker2002&gt;Pinker, Steven (2002). ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. New York: Viking. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this debate, and others related to it, are covered in detail by {{harvtxt|Cronin|1993}}, {{harvtxt|Segerstråle|2000}}, and {{harvtxt|Alcock|2001}}.

{{Campaignbox French Wars of Religion}}
The '''St. Bartholomew's Day massacre''' ({{lang-fr|Massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy}}) in 1572 was a targeted group of [[assassination]]s and a wave of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[mob violence]], directed against the [[Huguenots]] (French [[Calvinist]] [[Protestant]]s) during the [[French Wars of Religion]]. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]], the mother of King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], the [[massacre]] took place a few days after the wedding day (18 August) of the king's sister [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] to the Protestant [[Henry III of Navarre]] (the future Henry IV of France). Many of the most wealthy and prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic [[Paris]] to attend the wedding.

The massacre began in the night of 23–24 August 1572 (the eve of the feast of [[Bartholomew the Apostle]]), two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], the military and political leader of the Huguenots. The king ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre expanded outward to other urban centres and the countryside. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 5,000 to 30,000.

The massacre also marked a turning point in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re-conversions by the rank and file. Those who remained were increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, it "was the worst of the century's religious massacres".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koenigsburger|first1=H.

==Background==
[[File:François Clouet - Admiral Gaspard II de Coligny.jpg|thumb|upright|Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], the leader of the Huguenots]]

The Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day was the culmination of a series of events:
*The [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], which put an end to the third War of Religion on 8 August 1570.
*The marriage between [[Henry III of Navarre]] and [[Margaret of Valois]] on 18 August 1572.
*The failed assassination of Admiral de Coligny on 22 August 1572.

=== An unacceptable peace and an unacceptable marriage ===
The [[Peace of Saint-Germain]] put an end to three years of terrible civil war between Catholics and Protestants. This peace, however, was precarious since the more intransigent Catholics refused to accept it. The [[House of Guise|Guise]] family (strongly Catholic) was out of favour at the French court; the Huguenot leader, Admiral [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], was readmitted into the king's council in September 1571. Staunch Catholics were shocked by the return of Protestants to the court, but the queen mother, [[Catherine de' Medici]], and her son, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], were practical in their support of peace and Coligny, as they were conscious of the kingdom's financial difficulties and the Huguenots' strong defensive position: they controlled the fortified towns of [[La Rochelle]], [[La Charité-sur-Loire]], [[Cognac, France|Cognac]], and [[Montauban]].

To cement the peace between the two religious parties, Catherine planned to marry her daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] to the Protestant prince, Henry of Navarre (the future King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]), son of the Huguenot leader Queen [[Jeanne d'Albret]]. The royal marriage was arranged for 18 August 1572. It was not accepted by traditionalist Catholics or by the [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope]]. Both the Pope and King [[Philip II of Spain]] strongly condemned Catherine's Huguenot policy as well.

===Tension in Paris===
[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - François Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles IX of France]], who was 22 years old in August 1572]]
The impending marriage led to the gathering of a large number of well-born Protestants in Paris, who had come to escort their prince. But Paris was a violently anti-Huguenot city, and Parisians, who tended to be extreme Catholics, found their presence unacceptable. Encouraged by Catholic preachers, they were horrified at the marriage of a princess of France with a Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln (1989), pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parlement]]'s opposition and the court's absence from the wedding led to increased political tension.&lt;ref name="Shennan1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. H. Shennan|title=The Parlement of Paris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCOJAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Sutton|isbn=978-0-7509-1830-5|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding this bad feeling was the fact that the harvests had been poor and taxes had risen.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in food prices and the luxury displayed on the occasion of the royal wedding increased tensions among the common people. A particular point of tension was an open-air cross erected on the site of the house of [[Philippe de Gastines]], a Huguenot who had been executed in 1569. The mob had torn down his house and erected a large wooden [[cross]] on a stone base. Under the terms of the peace, and after considerable popular resistance, this had been removed in December 1571 (and re-erected in a cemetery), which had already led to about 50 deaths in riots, as well as mob destruction of property.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, Mack P. (2005). ''The French Wars of Religion 1562-1626'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 79-80 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=En23VTbYwhQC&amp;dq='The+French+Wars+of+Religion+1562+-+1629'&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wBH9h9vUbu&amp;sig=GnD1UDWCtyelLY63ZgQJpC77p_M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA95,M1 google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; In the massacres of August, the relatives of the Gastines family were among the first to be killed by the mob.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The court itself was extremely divided. Catherine had not obtained Pope Gregory XIII's permission to celebrate this irregular marriage; consequently, the French prelates hesitated over which attitude to adopt. It took all the queen mother's skill to convince the [[Cardinal de Bourbon]] (paternal uncle of the Protestant groom, but himself a Catholic clergyman) to marry the couple. Beside this, the rivalries between the leading families re-emerged. The Guises were not prepared to make way for their rivals, the [[House of Montmorency]]. [[François de Montmorency|François, Duke of Montmorency]] and governor of Paris, was unable to control the disturbances in the city. On August 20, he left the capital and retired to [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]].&lt;ref name="Daussy2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugues Daussy|title=Les huguenots et le roi: le combat politique de Philippe Duplessis-Mornay, 1572-1600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxQjVTLAgC4C&amp;pg=PA84|year=2002|publisher=Librairie Droz|isbn=978-2-600-00667-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift in Huguenot thought===
In the years preceding the massacre, Huguenot "political rhetoric" had for the first time taken a tone against not just the policies of a particular monarch of France, but [[monarchy]] in general. In part this was led by an apparent change in stance by [[John Calvin]] in his ''Readings on the Prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]'', a book of 1561, in which he had argued that when kings disobey God, they "automatically abdicate their worldly power" – a change from his views in earlier works that even ungodly kings should be obeyed. This change was soon picked up by Huguenot writers, who began to expand on Calvin and promote the idea of the [[Popular sovereignty|sovereignty of the people]], ideas to which Catholic writers and preachers responded fiercely.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005), pp. 78-79; Calvin's book was "Praelectiones in librum prophetiarum Danielis", Geneva and [[Laon]], 1561&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it was only in the aftermath of the massacre that anti-monarchical ideas found widespread support from Huguenots, among the "[[Monarchomachs]]" and others. "Huguenot writers, who had previously, for the most part, paraded their loyalty to the Crown, now called for the deposition or assassination of a Godless king who had either authorised or permitted the slaughter".&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Felipe Fernández-Armesto|Fernández-Armesto, F.]]}} &amp; Wilson, D. (1996), ''Reformation: Christianity and the World 1500 – 2000'', Bantam Press, London, {{ISBN|0-593-02749-3}} paperback, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the massacre "marked the beginning of a new form of French Protestantism: one that was openly at war with the crown. This was much more than a war against the policies of the crown, as in the first three civil wars; it was a campaign against the very existence of the [[Gallicanism|Gallican]] monarchy itself".&lt;ref&gt;Holt (1995 ed), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huguenot intervention in the Netherlands===
Tensions were further raised when in May 1572 the news reached Paris that a French Huguenot army under [[Louis of Nassau]] had crossed from France to the [[Netherlandish]] province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and captured the Catholic strongholds of [[Mons]] and [[Valenciennes]] (now in Belgium and France, respectively). Louis governed the [[Principality of Orange]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France for his brother [[William the Silent]], who was leading the [[Dutch Revolt]] against the Spanish. This intervention threatened to involve France in that war; many Catholics believed that Coligny had again persuaded the king to intervene on the side of the Dutch,&lt;ref name="Holt81"&gt;Holt (2005), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; as he had managed to do the previous October, before Catherine had got the decision reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Jean Knecht|Knecht, Robert Jean]] (2001), ''The Rise and Fall of Renaissance France, 1483-1610'', p. 356, Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-22729-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-631-22729-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nuyx5E_wp7QC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=Elizabeth+England+St+Bartholomew%27s+Day&amp;as_brr=3#PPA356,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The attempted assassination of Admiral de Coligny===
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Frans Hogenberg, The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, circa 1572.jpg|thumb|This [[popular print]] shows the attempted assassination of Coligny at left, his subsequent murder at right, and scenes of the general massacre in the streets.]]
After the wedding on 18 August 1572, Coligny and the leading Huguenots remained in Paris to discuss some outstanding grievances about the Peace of St. Germain with the king. On 22 August, an attempt was made on Coligny's life as he made his way back to his house from the Louvre. He was shot from an upstairs window, and seriously wounded. The would-be assassin, probably Charles de Louviers, Lord of Maurevert (c. 1505-1583), escaped in the ensuing confusion, and it is still difficult today to decide who was ultimately responsible for the attack. History records three possible candidates:

*The Guises: the [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Cardinal of Lorraine]] (who was in fact in Rome at the time), and his nephews, the Dukes of Guise and [[Claude, Duke of Aumale|Aumale]], are the most likely suspects. The leaders of the Catholic party, they wanted to avenge the death of the two dukes' father [[Francis, Duke of Guise]], whose assassination ten years earlier they believed to have been ordered by Coligny. The shot aimed at Admiral de Coligny came from a house belonging to the Guises.
*The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]]: he governed the Netherlands on behalf of Philip II. Coligny planned to lead a campaign in the Netherlands to participate in the [[Dutch Revolt]] to free the region from Spanish control. During the summer, Coligny had secretly dispatched a number of troops to help the Protestants in Mons, who were now besieged by the Duke of Alba. So Admiral de Coligny was a real threat to the latter.
*Catherine de' Medici: according to tradition, the Queen Mother had been worried that the king was increasingly becoming dominated by Coligny. Amongst other things, Catherine reportedly feared that Coligny's influence would drag France into a war with Spain over the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Holt1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mack P. Holt|title=The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUBQKCEhylIC&amp;pg=PA83|date=19 October 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35873-6|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The massacres==

===Paris===
The attempted assassination of Coligny triggered the crisis that led to the [[List of massacres|massacre]]. Admiral de Coligny was the most respected Huguenot leader and enjoyed a close relationship with the king, although he was distrusted by the king's mother. Aware of the danger of reprisals from the Protestants, the king and his court visited Coligny on his sickbed and promised him that the culprits would be punished. While the Queen Mother was eating dinner, Protestants burst in to demand justice, some talking in menacing terms.&lt;ref&gt;Garrisson, pp. 82-83, and Lincoln, p. 96, and Knecht (2001), p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of Huguenot reprisals grew. Coligny's brother-in-law led a 4,000-strong army camped just outside Paris&lt;ref name="Holt81"/&gt; and, although there is no evidence it was planning to attack, Catholics in the city feared it might take revenge on the Guises or the city populace itself.

That evening, Catherine held a meeting at the [[Tuileries]] Palace with her Italian advisers, including [[Albert de Gondi]], Comte de Retz. On the evening of 23 August, Catherine went to see the king to discuss the crisis. Though no details of the meeting survive, Charles IX and his mother apparently made the decision to eliminate the Protestant leaders. Holt speculated this entailed "between two and three dozen noblemen" who were still in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians are reluctant to speculate on the composition or size of the group leaders targeted at this point, beyond the few obvious heads. (Like Coligny, most potential candidates were accompanied by groups of gentlemen as staff and bodyguards; so each killing of a leader could have been expected to involve killing these as well.) 

Shortly after this decision, the municipal authorities of Paris were summoned. They were ordered to shut the city gates and arm the citizenry to prevent any attempt at a Protestant uprising. The king's [[Swiss Guard]] was given the task of killing a list of leading Protestants. It is difficult today to determine the exact chronology of events and to know the moment the killing began. It seems probable that a signal was given by ringing bells for [[matins]] (between midnight and dawn) at the church of [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]], near the Louvre, which was the parish church of the kings of France. The Swiss guards expelled the Protestant nobles from the Louvre castle and then slaughtered them in the streets.

A group led by Guise in person dragged Admiral Coligny from his bed, killed him, and threw his body out of a window. Huguenot nobles in the building first put up a fight, as they were terrified for the life of their leader,&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 364. The site is now 144 [[Rue de Rivoli]], with a plaque commemorating the event, though both building and street layout postdate the 16th century. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A04E4DD1739E233A25752C2A9609C94669FD7CF New York Times on the plaque]&lt;/ref&gt; but Coligny himself seemed unperturbed. One of Coligny's murderers recognized this calm regarding his fate by stating that "he never saw anyone less afraid in so great a peril, nor die more steadfastly" (Dethou).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Thou|first1=Jacques- Auguste|title=Histoire des choses arrivees de son temps|publisher=Boston: Ginn and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tension that had been building since the Peace of St. Germain now exploded in a wave of popular violence. The common people began to hunt Protestants throughout the city, including women and children. Chains were used to block streets so that Protestants could not escape from their houses. The bodies of the dead were collected in carts and thrown into the [[Seine]]. The massacre in Paris lasted three days despite the king's attempts to stop it. Holt concludes that "while the general massacre might have been prevented, there is no evidence that it was intended by any of the elites at court", listing a number of cases where Catholic courtiers intervened to save individual Protestants who were not in the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 edn), pp. 88-91 (quotation from p. 91)&lt;/ref&gt;

The two leading Huguenot princes, Henry of Navarre and his cousin the [[Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Prince of Condé]] (respectively aged 19 and 20), were spared as they pledged to convert to Catholicism; both renounced their conversions after they escaped Paris.&lt;ref name="Dyer1861"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dyer |first=Thomas Henry |authorlink=Thomas Henry Dyer |title=The history of modern Europe: from the fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the war in the Crimea in 1857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ErgyAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=28 March 2011|year=1861|publisher=John Murray|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some interpretations, the survival of these princes was a key point in Catherine's overall scheme, to prevent the House of Guise from becoming too powerful.

On August 26, the king and court established the official version of events by going to the [[Paris Parlement]]. "Holding a [[lit de justice]], Charles declared that he had ordered the massacre in order to thwart a Huguenot plot against the royal family."&lt;ref name="Lincoln98"&gt;Lincoln, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; A jubilee celebration, including a procession, was then held, while the killings continued in parts of the city.&lt;ref name="Lincoln98"/&gt;

===In the provinces===
Although Charles had dispatched orders to his provincial governors on August 24 to prevent violence and maintain the terms of the 1570 edict,&lt;ref name="Holt91"&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; from August to October, similar massacres of Huguenots took place in a total of twelve other cities: [[Toulouse]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lyon]], [[Bourges]], [[Rouen]],&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Philip (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=N4hwtKRfj8UC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=%22St+Bartholomew%27s+day+Massacre%22+deaths&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA127,M1 ''Rouen During the Wars of Religion''], Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-54797-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-54797-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Orléans]], [[Meaux]], [[Angers]], [[La Charité]], [[Saumur]], [[Gaillac]] and [[Troyes]].&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), p. 91. The dates are in Garrison, p. 139, who adds [[Albi]] to the 12 in Holt. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfFDhvXCS90C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=St.+Bartholomew%27s+Day+massacre+Auger+Bordeaux&amp;as_brr=3#PPA139,M1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In most of them, the killings swiftly followed the arrival of the news of the Paris massacre, but in some places there was a delay of more than a month. According to Mack P. Holt: "All twelve cities where provincial massacres occurred had one striking feature in common; they were all cities with Catholic majorities where there had once been ''significant'' Protestant minorities.... All of them had also experienced serious religious division... during the first three civil wars... Moreover seven of them shared a previous experience ... [they] had actually been taken over by Protestant minorities during the first civil war..."&lt;ref name="Holt91"/&gt;

[[File:Le Siege de La Rochelle par le Duc d Anjou en 1573.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of La Rochelle (1572–1573)]] began soon after the St. Bartholomew massacre.]]
In several cases the Catholic party in the city believed they had received orders from the king to begin the massacre, some conveyed by visitors to the city, and in other cases apparently coming from a local nobleman or his agent.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), pp. 93-94, and Benedict (2004), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; It seems unlikely any such orders came from the king, although the Guise faction may have desired the massacres.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict (2004), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently genuine letters from the [[Henry III of France|Duke of Anjou]], the king's younger brother, did urge massacres in the king's name; in [[Nantes]] the mayor fortunately held on to his without publicising it until a week later when contrary orders from the king had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities the massacres were led by the mob, while the city authorities tried to suppress them, and in others small groups of soldiers and officials began rounding up Protestants with little mob involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 368, though see Holt (2005), pp. 93-95 for a different emphasis&lt;/ref&gt; In Bordeaux the inflammatory sermon on September 29 of a [[Jesuit]], Edmond Auger, encouraged the massacre that was to occur a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;("Emond" or "Edmond"). Garrison, pp. 144-45, who rejects the view that this "met le feu au poudres" (lit the powder) in Bordeaux. See also: Pearl, Jonathan L. (1998), ''The Crime of Crimes: Demonology and Politics in France, 1560-1620'', Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, p. 70, {{ISBN|978-0-88920-296-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=2TJeVkAMz5sC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=St.+Bartholomew%27s+Day+massacre+Auger+Bordeaux&amp;as_brr=3#PPA70,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cities affected the loss to the Huguenot communities after the massacres was numerically far larger than those actually killed; in the following weeks there were mass conversions to Catholicism, apparently in response to the threatening atmosphere for Huguenots in these cities. In Rouen, where some hundreds were killed, the Huguenot community shrank from 16,500 to fewer than 3,000 mainly as a result of conversions and emigration to safer cities or countries. Some cities unaffected by the violence nevertheless witnessed a sharp decline in their Huguenot population.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005 ed.), p. 95, citing Benedict (2004), pp. 127-132&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been claimed that the Huguenot community represented as much as 10% of the French population on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, declining to 7-8% by the end of the 16th century, and further after heavy persecution began once again during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], culminating with the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans J. Hillerbrand in his ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism: 4-volume Set''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward both sides prepared for a [[French Wars of Religion#The 'fourth' war (1572–73)|fourth civil war]], which began before the end of the year.

The [[Politique]]s, those Catholics who placed national unity above sectarian interests, were horrified, but many Catholics inside and outside France initially regarded the massacres as deliverance from an imminent Huguenot [[coup d'etat]]. The severed head of Coligny was apparently dispatched to [[Pope Gregory XIII]], though it got no further than Lyon, and the pope sent the king a [[Golden Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[H. A. L.

"The massacre was interpreted as an act of [[divine retribution]]; Coligny was considered a threat to [[Christendom]] and thus Pope Gregory XIII designated 11 September 1572 as a joint commemoration of the Battle of Lepanto and the massacre of the Huguenots."&lt;ref&gt;Howe, E.

Although these formal acts of rejoicing in Rome were not repudiated publicly, misgivings in the papal curia grew as the true nature of the killings gradually became better known.

The author of the ''Lettre de Pierre Charpentier'' (1572) was not only "a Protestant of sorts, and thus, apparently, writing with inside knowledge", but also "an extreme apologist for the massacre ... in his view ... a well-merited punishment for years of civil disobedience [and] secret sedition..."&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; A strand of Catholic writing, especially by Italian authors, broke from the official French line to applaud the massacre as precisely a brilliant stratagem, deliberately planned from various points beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 253ff&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme of these writers was Camilo Capilupi, a papal secretary, whose work insisted that the whole series of events since 1570 had been a masterly plan conceived by Charles IX, and carried through by frequently misleading his mother and ministers as to his true intentions. The Venetian government refused to allow the work to be printed there, and it was eventually published in Rome in 1574, and in the same year quickly reprinted in Geneva in the original Italian and a French translation.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, pp. 254-65&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this context that the massacre came to be seen as a product of [[Machiavellianism]], a view greatly influenced by the Huguenot [[:fr:Innocent Gentillet|Innocent Gentillet]], who published his ''Discours contre Machievel'' in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 283, see also the whole chapter&lt;/ref&gt; Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that [[Machiavelli]]'s "books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized courtiers" (in the words of his first English translation), and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) "at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholemew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers".&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, and not very much after, until Gentillet's own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism that so infuriates scholars of his actual thought.&lt;ref&gt;Anglo, Chapters 10 and 11; p. 328 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; It also gave added impetus to the strong anti-Italian feelings already present in Huguenot polemic.

[[Christopher Marlowe]] was one of many Elizabethan writers who were enthusiastic proponents of these ideas. In the ''[[Jew of Malta]]'' (1589–90) "Machievel" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming to not be dead, but to have possessed the soul of (the Duke of) Guise, "And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends" (Prologue, lines 3-4)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/901/901-h/901-h.htm Project Gutenberg] ''Jew of Malta'' text.&lt;/ref&gt; His last play, ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with Guise and Catherine both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1913 was still ready to endorse a version of this view, describing the massacres as "an entirely political act committed in the name of the immoral principles of Machiavellianism" and blaming "the pagan theories of a certain [[raison d'état]] according to which [[Consequentialism|the end justified the means]]".&lt;ref name="cathen" /&gt;

The French 18th-century historian [[Louis-Pierre Anquetil]], in his ''Esprit de la Ligue'' of 1767, was among the first to begin impartial historical investigation, emphasizing the lack of premeditation (before the attempt on Coligny) in the massacre and that Catholic mob violence had a history of uncontrollable escalation.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Barbara (1994), "Revising the Revisionists," in: ''Politics, Ideology, and the Law in Early Modern Europe: Essays in Honor of J.H.M.

The question of whether the massacre had long been premeditated was not entirely settled until the late 19th century; [[Lord Acton]] changed his mind on the matter twice, finally concluding that it was not.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Butterfield's chapter, referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
===Role of the royal family===
[[File:Catherine de Medicis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Catherine de Medici]], Charles IX's mother]]
Over the centuries, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre has inevitably aroused a great deal of controversy. Modern historians are still divided over the responsibility of the royal family:

*The traditional interpretation makes Catherine de Medici and her Catholic advisers the principal culprits in the execution of the principal military leaders. They forced the hand of a hesitant and weak-willed king in the decision of that particular execution. This traditional interpretation has been largely abandoned by modern historians including, among others, Janine Garrisson. However, in a more recent work than his history of the period, Holt concludes: "The ringleaders of the conspiracy appear to have been a group of four men: Henry, duke of Anjou; [[René de Birague|Chancellor Birague]]; the [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers|duke of Nevers]], and the comte de Retz" (Gondi).&lt;ref&gt;Holt, Mack P. (2002), ''The Duke of Anjou and the Politique Struggle During the Wars of Religion'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-89278-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-89278-0}}
[https://books.google.com/books?id=-OJscrcxTLsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Elizabeth+Bartholomew%27s+Day+Massacre&amp;as_brr=3#PPA20,M1 p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Anjou, the others were all Italian advisors at the French court.

*According to [[Denis Crouzet]], Charles IX feared a Protestant uprising, and chose to strangle it at birth to protect his power. The execution decision was therefore his own, and not Catherine de' Medici's.&lt;ref&gt;Crouzet, Denis (1994), ''La Nuit de la Saint-Barthélemy: Un rêve perdu de la Renaissance'', Fayard, coll. " Chroniques ", {{ISBN|2-213-59216-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[:fr:Jean-Louis Bourgeon|Jean-Louis Bourgeon]], the violently anti-Huguenot city of Paris was really responsible. He stresses that the city was on the verge of revolt. The Guises, who were highly popular, exploited this situation to put pressure on the King and the Queen Mother. Charles IX was thus forced to head off the potential riot, which was the work of the Guises, the city militia and the common people.&lt;ref&gt;Bourgeon, Jean-Louis (1992), ''L'assassinat de Coligny'', Genève: Droz&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to [[:fr:Thierry Wanegffelen|Thierry Wanegffelen]], the member of the royal family with the most responsibility in this affair is Henry, Duke of Anjou, the king's ambitious younger brother. Following the failed assassination attack against the Admiral de Coligny (which Wanegffelen attributes to the Guise family and Spain), the Italian advisers of Catherine de Medici undoubtedly recommended in the royal Council the execution of about fifty Protestant leaders. These Italians stood to benefit from the occasion by eliminating the Huguenot danger. Despite the firm opposition of the Queen Mother and the King, Anjou, Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, present at this meeting of the Council, could see a good occasion to make a name for himself with the government. He contacted the Parisian authorities and another ambitious young man, running out of authority and power, Duke Henri de Guise (whose uncle, the clear-sighted Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, was then detained in Rome). The Parisian St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre resulted from this conjunction of interests, and this offers a much better explanation as to why the men of the Duke of Anjou acted in the name of the Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, consistent with the thinking of the time, rather than in the name of the King. One can also understand why, the day after the start of the massacre, Catherine de Medici, through royal declaration of Charles IX, condemned the crimes, and threatened the Guise family with royal justice. But when Charles IX and his mother learned of the involvement of the duke of Anjou, and being so dependent on his support, they issued a second royal declaration, which while asking for an end to the massacres, credited the initiative with the desire of Charles IX to prevent a Protestant plot. Initially the ''coup d'état'' of the duke of Anjou was a success, but Catherine de Medici went out of her way to deprive him from any power in France: she sent him with the royal army to remain in front of La Rochelle and then had him elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Wanegffelen, Thierry (2005), ''Catherine de Médicis: Le pouvoir au féminin'', Payot {{ISBN|2228900184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the religious factions===
Traditional histories have tended to focus more on the roles of the political notables whose machinations began the massacre than the mindset of those who actually did the killing. Ordinary lay Catholics were involved in the mass killings; they believed they were executing the wishes of the king and of God. At this time, in an age before mass media, "the pulpit remained probably the most effective means of mass communication".&lt;ref&gt;Atkin, N. &amp; Tallett, F. (2003) ''Priests, Prelates &amp; People: A History of European Catholicism Since 1750'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-521987-2}} hardback, p. 9;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the large numbers of pamphlets and [[broadsheet]]s in circulation, literacy rates were still poor. Thus, some modern historians have stressed the critical and incendiary role that militant preachers played in shaping ordinary lay beliefs, both Catholic and Protestant.

Historian [[Barbara B. Diefendorf]], Professor of History at [[Boston University]], wrote that [[Simon Vigor]] had "said if the King ordered the Admiral (Coligny) killed, 'it would be wicked not to kill him'. With these words, the most popular preacher in Paris legitimised in advance the events of St. Bartholomew's Day".&lt;ref&gt;Diefendorf, B.B. (1991) ''Beneath The Cross: Catholics &amp; Huguenots in Sixteenth Century Paris'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-1950-7013-5}} paperback, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Diefendorf says that when the head of the murdered Coligny was shown to the Paris mob by a member of the nobility, with the claim that it was the King's will, the die was cast. Another historian Mack P. Holt, Professor at [[George Mason University]], agrees that Vigor, "the best known preacher in Paris," preached sermons that were full of references to the evils that would befall the capital should the Protestants seize control.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, M. P. (1995) ''The French Wars of Religion 1562 – 1629'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-35359-9}} hardback, pp. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also partly supported by Cunningham and Grell (2000) who explained that "militant sermons by priests such as Simon Vigor served to raise the religious and eschatological temperature on the eve of the Massacre".&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A. &amp; Grell, O. P. (2000) ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Religion, War, Famine &amp; Death in Reformation Europe'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-46701-2}} paperback, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians cite the extreme tension and bitterness that led to the powder-keg atmosphere of Paris in August 1572.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, (1995), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous ten years there had already been three outbreaks of civil war, and attempts by Protestant nobles to seize power in France.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, (1995), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Some blame the complete esteem with which the sovereign's office was held, justified by prominent French Roman Catholic theologians, and that the special powers of French Kings "...were accompanied by explicit responsibilities, the foremost of which was combating heresy."&lt;ref&gt;Holt (1995 ed.), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt, notable for re-emphasising the importance of religious issues, as opposed to political/dynastic power struggles or socio-economic tensions, in explaining the French Wars of Religion, also re-emphasised the role of religion in the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre. He noted that the extra violence inflicted on many of the corpses "was not random at all, but patterned after the rites of the Catholic culture that had given birth to it." "Many Protestant houses were burned, invoking the traditional purification by fire of all heretics. Many victims were also thrown into the Seine, invoking the purification by water of Catholic baptism".&lt;ref name="Holt87"&gt;Holt (1995 ed.), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as a threat to the social and political order, Holt argues that "Huguenots not only had to be exterminated – that is, killed – they also had to be humiliated, dishonoured, and shamed as the inhuman beasts they were perceived to be."&lt;ref name="Holt87"/&gt;

However Raymond Mentzer points out that Protestants "could be as bloodthirsty as Catholics. Earlier Huguenot rage at Nimes (in 1567) led to... the massacre of a hundred or so Catholics, mostly priests and prominent laymen, at the hands of their Protestant neighbours. Few towns escaped the episodic violence and some suffered repeatedly from both sides. Neither faith had a monopoly on cruelty and misguided fervour".&lt;ref&gt;Mentzer, Raymond A., ''The French Wars of Religion'' in ''The Reformation World'', Ed. Andrew Pettegree, Routledge, (2000), {{ISBN|0-415-16357-9}}, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, like Leonie Frieda, emphasise the element within the mob violence of the "haves" being "killed by the 'have-nots'". Many Protestants were nobles or bourgeois and Frieda adds that "a number of bourgeois Catholic Parisians had suffered the same fate as the Protestants; many financial debts were wiped clean with the death of creditors and moneylenders that night".&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, L. (2003) ''Catherine de Medici'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|0-7538-2039-0}}, pp. 314-16&lt;/ref&gt; At least one Huguenot was able to buy off his would-be murderers.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2001), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian H.G. Koenigsberger (who until his retirement in 1984 was Professor of History at King's College, [[University of London]]) wrote that the Massacre was deeply disturbing because "it was Christians massacring other Christians who were not foreign enemies but their neighbours with which they and their forebears had lived in a Christian community, and under the same ruler, for a thousand years".&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, H. G. (1987) ''Early Modern Europe 1500 – 1789'', Longman, Harlow, {{ISBN|0-582-49401-X}} paperback, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the historical importance of the Massacre "lies not so much in the appalling tragedies involved as their demonstration of the power of sectarian passion to break down the barriers of civilisation, community and accepted morality".&lt;ref&gt;Koenigsberger, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

An explanation of this may lie in the analysis of the massacre in terms of [[social anthropology]] by the religious historian [[Bruce Lincoln]], who describes how the religious divide, which gave the Huguenots different patterns of dress, eating and pastimes, as well as the obvious differences of religion and (very often) class, had become a social schism or cleavage. The rituals around the royal marriage had only intensified this cleavage, contrary to its intentions, and the "sentiments of estrangement – radical otherness – [had come] to prevail over sentiments of affinity between Catholics and Protestants".&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, chapter 6, pp. 89-102, quotation from p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 1997, [[Pope John Paul II]], who was in Paris for the 12th World Youth Day, issued a statement on the Massacre. He stayed in Paris for three days and made eleven speeches. According to Reuters and the Associated Press, at a late-night vigil, with the hundreds of thousands of young people who were in Paris for the celebrations, he made the following comments: "On the eve of Aug. 24, we cannot forget the sad massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, an event of very obscure causes in the political and religious history of France. ... Christians did things which the Gospel condemns. I am convinced that only forgiveness, offered and received, leads little by little to a fruitful dialogue, which will in turn ensure a fully Christian reconciliation. ... Belonging to different religious traditions must not constitute today a source of opposition and tension. On the contrary, our common love for Christ impels us to seek tirelessly the path of full unity."&lt;ref&gt;https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/travels/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_23081997_vigil.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Christopher Marlowe]] knew the story well from the Huguenot literature translated into English, and probably from French refugees who had sought refuge in his native [[Canterbury]]. He wrote a strongly anti-Catholic and anti-French play based on the events entitled '[[The Massacre at Paris]]'. Also, in his biography ''The World of Christopher Marlowe'', David Riggs claims the incident remained with the playwright, and massacres are incorporated into the final acts of three of his early plays, ''1'' and ''2 Tamburlaine'' and ''The Jew of Malta'' – see above for Marlowe and Machiavellism.

The story was also taken up in 1772 by [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] in his play ''Jean Hennuyer, Bishop of Lizieux'', unperformed until the [[French Revolution]].  This play was translated into English, with some adaptations, as ''The Massacre'' by the actress and playwright [[Elizabeth Inchbald]] in 1792. Inchbald kept the historical setting, but ''The Massacre'', completed by February 1792, also reflected events in the recent French Revolution, though not the [[September Massacres]] of 1792, which coincided with its printing.&lt;ref&gt;Burdett, Sarah, Sarah Burdett, "'Feminine Virtues Violated’ Motherhood, Female Militancy and 
Revolutionary Violence in Elizabeth Inchbald's ''The Massacre'', p. 3, ''Dandelion'', 5.1 (Summer 2014), [http://dandelionjournal.org/index.php/dandelion/article/viewFile/194/176 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Chénier]]'s play ''Charles IX'' was a huge success during the French Revolution, drawing strongly anti-monarchical and anti-religious lessons from the massacre. Chénier was able to put his principles into practice as a politician, voting for the execution of [[Louis XVI]] and many others, perhaps including his brother [[André Chénier]]. However, before the collapse of the Revolution he became suspected of moderation, and in some danger himself.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan, Susan (2005), ''Revolutionary Acts: Theater, Democracy, and the French Revolution'', Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-8125-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8125-1}}

[[File:They seemed but dark shadows they sli along te walls (cropped).jpg|thumb|"They seemed but dark shadows as they slid along the walls", illustration from an English ''History of France'', c. 1912]]
 
The story was fictionalised by [[Prosper Mérimée]] in his ''Chronique du règne de Charles IX'' (1829), and by [[Alexandre Dumas, père]] in ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|La Reine Margot]]'', an 1845 novel that fills in the history as it was then seen with romance and adventure. That novel has been translated into English and was made first into a commercially successful [[French film]] in 1954, "[[La Reine Margot (1954 film)|La reine Margot]]" (US title "A Woman of Evil"), starring [[Jeanne Moreau]]. It was remade in 1994 as ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (later as ''Queen Margot'', and subtitled, in English-language markets), starring [[Isabelle Adjani]].

[[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (1836), very loosely based on the events of the massacre, was one of the most popular and spectacular examples of French [[grand opera]].

The [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[John Everett Millais]] managed to create a sentimental moment in the massacre in his painting ''[[A Huguenot|A Huguenot on St. Bartholomew's Day]]'' (1852), which depicts a Catholic woman attempting to convince her Huguenot lover to wear the white scarf badge of the Catholics and protect himself. The man, true to his beliefs, gently refuses her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=c&amp;a=p&amp;ID=216|title=A Huguenot on St Bartholomew's Day|accessdate=2007-04-19|publisher=Humanities Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millais was inspired to create the painting after seeing Meyerbeer's ''Les Huguenots''.

[[Mark Twain]] described the massacre in "From the Manuscript of 'A Tramp Abroad' (1879): The French and the Comanches," an essay about "partly civilized races." He wrote in part, "St. Bartholomew's was unquestionably the finest thing of the kind ever devised and accomplished in the world. All the best people took a hand in it, the King and the Queen Mother included."&lt;ref&gt;Letters from Earth. Ostara publications. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre and the events surrounding it were incorporated into [[D.W. Griffith]]'s film ''[[Intolerance (movie)|Intolerance]]'' (1916). The film follows [[Catherine de' Medici]] ([[Josephine Crowell]]) plotting the massacre, coercing her son King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (Frank Bennett) to sanction it. Incidental characters include Henri of Navarre, [[Marguerite de Valois]] ([[Constance Talmadge]]), [[Admiral Coligny]] ([[Joseph Henabery]]) and the Duke of Anjou, who is portrayed as homosexual. These historic scenes are depicted alongside a fictional plot in which a Huguenot family is caught among the events.

Another novel depicting this massacre is ''[[Queen Jezebel (novel)|Queen Jezebel]]'', by [[Jean Plaidy]] (1953).  In the third episode of the [[BBC]] miniseries ''[[Elizabeth R]]'' (1971), starring [[Glenda Jackson]] as Queen Elizabeth I of England, the English court's reaction to the massacre and its effect on England's relations with France is addressed in depth.

A 1966 serial in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' entitled ''[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]'' is set during the events leading up to the Paris massacre. [[Leonard Sachs]] appeared as Admiral Coligny and Joan Young played Catherine de Medici. This serial is [[Doctor Who missing episodes|missing from the BBC archives]] and survives only in audio form.

The St Bartholomew's Day Massacre is the setting for [[Tim Willocks]]' historical novel, ''The Twelve Children of Paris'' (Matthias Tannhauser Trilogy:2) (2013), and  [[Ken Follett]]'s book [[A Column of Fire]], published in 2017. Follett gives several of the book's main characters a role in the massacre and the events leading up to it.

No [[society]], [[religious community]] or [[World view|worldview]] is immune to violent extremism.&lt;ref name="Living Safe Together Home"/&gt; Though “[[radicalization]]” is a contested term to some, it has come to be used to define the process through which an individual or a group considers violence as a legitimate and a desirable means of action. Radical thought that does not condone the exercise of violence to further political goals may be seen as normal and acceptable, and be promoted by groups working within the boundaries of the law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002446/244676e.pdf|title=A Teacher’s  Guide on the Prevention of Violent Extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used as a [[code name]] for [[Islamic terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/obama-violent-extremism-radical-islam/385700/|title=The Real Reason Obama Avoids the Phrase 'Radical Islam'|first=Peter|last=Beinart|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American military domain, the term "violent extremist organizations" or VEO is now used. The [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration defines VEO as groups of "individuals who support or commit ideologically motivated violence to further political goals".&lt;ref&gt;The White House, ''Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Office of the President, 2011), available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/sipfinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These groups include both ideologically-motivated international terrorist organizations (ITO) and homegrown violent extremists (HVE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raugh|first=David|date=June 2016|title=Is the Hybrid Threat a True Threat?|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/jss/vol9/iss2/2|journal=Journal of Strategic Security|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1–13|doi=10.5038/1944-0472.9.2.1507|issn=1944-0464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single profile or pathway for radicalization, or even speed at which it happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Lynn|title=Educating against Extremism: Towards a Critical Politicisation of Young People|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ830767|journal=International Review of Education|language=en|volume=55|pages=183–203|doi=10.1007/s11159-008-9126-8|issn=0020-8566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does the level of education seem to be a reliable predictor of vulnerability to radicalization. It is however established that there are [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and institutional factors that lead to violent extremism. Specialists group these factors into three main categories, push factors, pull factors and contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA929.pdf|title=USAID Summary of Factors Effecting Violent Extremism|last=|first=|date=|website=USAID|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://apo.org.au/resource/countering-violent-extremism-developing-evidence-base-policy-and-practice|title=Countering violent extremism: developing an evidence-base for policy and practice|last=Younis|first=Sara Zeiger, Anne Aly, Peter R.

=== Push factors ===
“Push Factors” drive individuals to violent extremism, such as: [[marginalization]], inequality, [[discrimination]], [[persecution]] or the perception thereof; limited access to quality and relevant education; the denial of rights and civil liberties; and other environmental, historical and [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] grievances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pull factors ===
“Pull Factors” nurture the appeal of violent extremism, for example: the existence of well-organized violent extremist groups with compelling discourses and effective programmes that are providing services, revenue and/or employment in exchange for membership. Groups can also lure new members by providing outlets for grievances and promise of adventure and freedom. Furthermore, these groups appear to offer spiritual comfort, “a place to belong” and a supportive social network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Contextual factors ===
Contextual factors that provide a favourable terrain to the emergence of violent extremist groups, such as: fragile states, the lack of [[rule of law]], [[corruption]] and [[Crime|criminality]].

The following behaviours in combination have been identified as signs of potential radicalization:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stop-djihadisme.gouv.fr/|title=Stop-Djihadisme|website=Stop-Djihadisme|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sudden break with the family and long-standing friendships.
* Sudden drop-out of school and conflicts with the school.
* Change in behaviour relating to food, clothing, language or finances.
* Changes in attitudes and behaviour towards others: antisocial comments, rejection of authority, refusal to interact socially, signs of withdrawal and isolation.
* Regular viewing of internet sites and participation in social media networks that condone radical or extremist views.
* Reference to apocalyptic and conspiracy theories.

== Prevention of radicalisation and deradicalisation ==

=== Education ===
[[File:Key dimensions of preventing Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Key dimensions of preventing violent extremism]]
The role of [[education]] in preventing violent extremism and de-radicalizing young people has only recently gained global acceptance. An important step in this direction was the launch, in December 2015, of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]]’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism which recognizes the importance of quality education to address the drivers of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/ctc/docs/2015/SCR%202178_2014_EN.pdf|title=Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. Report of the Secretary-General|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council]] also emphasized this point in its Resolutions 2178 and 2250, which notably highlights the need for “quality education for peace that equips youth with the ability to engage constructively in civic structures and inclusive political processes” and called on “ all relevant actors to consider instituting mechanisms to promote a culture of peace, tolerance, intercultural and interreligious dialogue that involve youth and discourage their participation in acts of violence, terrorism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unoy.org/wp-content/uploads/SCR-2250.pdf|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2250, adopted in December 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has been identified as preventing radicalisation through:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Developing the [[communication]] and [[interpersonal skills]] they need to dialogue, face [[disagreement]] and learn peaceful approaches to change.
* Developing [[critical thinking]] to investigate claims, verify [[Rumor|rumours]] and question the legitimacy and appeal of extremist beliefs.
* Developing resilience to resist extremist narratives and acquire the social-emotional skills they need to overcome their doubts and engage constructively in society without having to resort to violence.
* Fostering critically informed citizens able to constructively engage in peaceful collective action.

[[UNESCO]] has emphasised [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as an emerging approach to education that focuses on developing learners’ knowledge, skills, values and attitudes in view of their active participation in the peaceful and sustainable development of their societies. GCED aims to instill respect for [[human rights]], [[social justice]], [[gender equality]] and [[environmental sustainability]], which are fundamental values that help raise the defences of peace against violent extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global  Citizenship Education – Topics and Learning Objectives|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002277/227729e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education - Preparing learners for the challenges of the twenty-first century|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sabaoon Project, Pakistan ===
[[File:Sabaoons deradicalisation Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Sabaoon’s deradicalisation and rehabilitation model]]
The Sabaoon Project, initiated by the [[Pakistan Army]] and run by the Social Welfare Academics and Training organization (SWAaT) since 2009, has been implemented to deradicalize and rehabilitate former militant youth who were involved in violent extremist activities and apprehended by the army in [[Swat District|Swat]] and the surrounding areas in Pakistan. Based on an individualized approach and intervention, the project follows a three-step model (see image).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247764e.pdf|title=Preventing violent extremism through education: A guide for policy makers|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100215-1|location=|pages=24, 36, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kenya’s initiatives to address radicalization of youth in educational institutions ===
To tackle the issue of violent extremism and radicalization in schools, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Kenya launched a new national strategy targeting youth in 2014, entitled Initiatives to Address Radicalization of the Youth in Educational Institutions in the Republic of Kenya. The Strategy adopted measures that service the students’ interests and well-being. For example, it includes efforts to create child-friendly school environments and encourages students to participate in “talent academies” to pursue an area of their own interest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Strategy also includes the discontinuation of ranking schools based on academic performance. This was to lessen the overemphasis on examinations and to reduce student pressure, incorporating other indicators of student achievement, such as abilities in sport and artistic talent. The purpose is to reduce the stress of students’ lives at home and in school that may be vented through escape tactics, including joining outlawed groups. The Strategy also employs other effective means to prevent violent extremism, including the integration of Preventing of Violent Extremism through Education (PVE-E) in curricula and school programmes; adopting a multi- sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach; encouraging student participation through student governance processes and peer-to-peer education; and the involvement of media as a stakeholder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Gender disparity ==
While it is being increasingly reported that women play an active role in violent extremist organizations and attacks as assailants and supporters, men are still more often the perpetrators of violent extremist acts and therefore the targets of recruitment campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;B.

==Arrest and trial==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jordanian Special Forces with the G36C.jpg|thumb|71st Special Battalion]] --&gt;

He was captured by Jordanian [[71st Counter Terrorism Battalion]] with the aid of [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|Jordanian intelligence]] officers in May 2006, and accused of being [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]'s assistant which Karbouly denied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamestown.org/programs/tm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=785&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=239&amp;no_cache=1#.Vk9A9HZrjIU&lt;/ref&gt; Karbouly told the tribunal that he was “innocent”. He also disputed the prosecution’s version that he was captured inside Iraq in a joint operation of the Jordanian army and intelligence on 10 May. He told the tribunal that he was instead kidnapped “from Lebanon on May 6.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/289262|title=Al-Qaeda’s Leader Denies Terror Charges in Jordan|work=arabnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2006, he admitted that he had abducted and killed citizens from Jordan and Iraq, and had abducted two Moroccans in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-05/24/content_4590937.htm|title=Xinhua – English|work=xinhuanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/05/23/iraqi-customs-agent-arrested-in-jordan-confesses-to-al-qaeda-killings/|title=Iraqi Customs Agent Arrested in Jordan Confesses to Al Qaeda Killings|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
