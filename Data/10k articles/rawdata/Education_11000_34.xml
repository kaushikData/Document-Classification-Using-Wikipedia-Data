'''AGH Rostrum Club Changi''' was a [[Australian Rostrum|Rostrum]] Club formed during [[World War II]] at the [[Prisoner of War]] camp at [[Singapore]]'s [[Changi Prison]]. The club was formed by members of the [[Australian Army]]'s 13th Australian General Hospital, 8th Division AIF and probably included other allied servicemen.

== Background ==
The AGH Rostrum Club at Changi was formed on much the same principles as the Rostrum Club in Manchester and the [[Australian Rostrum]] Clubs. It held to an education aim and was non-sectarian and non-political as espoused by the Rostrum founder, [[Sidney F. Wicks]].  It was formed at a time of a great deprivation for the prisoners of war. During this time Changi POW camp was being used to supply men into work camps in [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Thailand]], [[Burma]] and [[Sandakan camp|Sandakan]]. leading to churn in members.

The 13th Australian General Hospital (AGH) was hurriedly formed on 11 August 1941 at the [[Caulfield, Victoria|Caulfield]] Racecourse, in response to the need for a second Australian military medical team in Malaya. They departed for Singapore on 2 September 1941, on [[MS_Wanganella#Hospital_ship|His Majesty's Australian Hospital Ship (H.M.A.H.S.) Wanganella]].  The strength of the 13th Australian General Hospital medical team was 18 Officers, 1 Chaplain, 20 Warrant Officers and Sergeants, 44 nurses, 3 Masseuses, and 126 Other Ranks – 212 people in total.&lt;ref name="pows-of-japan.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pows-of-japan.net/articles/AUSTRALIAN_GENERAL_HOSPITAL.pdf |title=The Story of the 13th Australian General Hospital |last=Arthurson |first=Lex |date=May 2009 |website= pows-of-japan.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After setting up hospitals in Singapore, [[Tampoi, Johor|Tampoi]] in Johore Bahru, Malaya and then when pushed back by the advancing [[Japanese people|Japanese]], again in Singapore, they were taken prisoner on 15 February 1942, within 6 months of departing Australia.  They, and all other allied personnel, were then sent to Changi Prison and the AGH team soon became an annex of the British medical team in Roberts Barracks, part of the Changi POW Prison.

A painting by Murray Griffin, Roberts Hospital Changi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C175803|title=Roberts Hospital, Changi|website=www.awm.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1943, now held in the Australian War Memorial illustrates the dire conditions for both patients and the AGH staff. Seriously ill battle casualties, many minus a limb, were quartered on the ground floor, the ambulant on the upper floors. The sewerage system was damaged and there was no water to flush anyway. Men with dysentery had to stagger down several flights of stairs to an outside latrine. This was a nightmare for those in the dysentery ward.

== Club formation ==

[[File:AGH Rostrum Constitution Changi 2.jpg|thumb|AGH Rostrum Constitution - Page 2]]

AGH Rostrum at Changi was formed at a public meeting of POWs on 18 May 1943 when the privations of their captivity was harming the health and morale of the POWs .  A constitution was agreed, President, Secretary, Committeeman and Critics were elected and it was agreed to meet weekly on Mondays. Meetings were to be held alternatively in the Men's, Sergeant's and Officer's Messes. The Constitution was used a number of elements of the Constitution of Australian Rostrum Clubs but was shorter and appropriate to their situation.

Club members military ranks ranged from [[Lieutenant Colonel]] at the top to [[Private (rank)|Private]] at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Private Records of T H (Bill) Hadden held at the Australian War Memorial (AWM) https://www.awm.gov.au/advanced-search?query=hadden+rostrum&amp;collection=true&amp;facet_type=Private+Record&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club operation ==
[[File:AGH Rostrum Changi - Program 24 May to 16 August 1943.jpg|thumb|AGH Rostrum's First Speaking Program]]
The club developed a speaking program on a diverse range of topics including:
* The importance of increasing leisure;
* That the British Empire is disintegrating;
* Is the use of alcohol as a Beverage a constricting factor to the happiness of the human race;
* Preservation of Fauna in Australia.

As Rostrum is an organisation that promotes learning and building confidence in a supportive environment, the clubs executive roles were initially rotated very three months.  This was later changed to every four months.

The initial meeting elected two Critics. However this was later struck out and the membership record seems to indicate that this became a rotating role as occurs in Rostrum Clubs in Australia.

In March 1944 the second of the clubs's objects relating to being non-political and non-sectarian, was deleted from the Constitution.

=== Change with time ===

While there are only a few records of the clubs activities, there are noticeable changes in the scope and tenor of the minutes.

Initially all members names are recorded, prefixed by they rank, and proceedings seemed more formal.  There is a significant change in later meeting minutes where all members are recorded a Mister (Mr.) irrespective of rank.  The other notable change is that minutes became briefer, with closer writing and use both sides of old military forms to maximise the use of available paper which was in short supply.

While the club was active, at least in 1943 and 1944, only a few sets of meeting minutes and programs have survived.

Club numbers were depleted as people where sent off with work parties to Malaya, Thailand and Burma. Visitors and new members are recorded over the period.

There is no record of the normal Rostrum Club maximum membership of 35 members being imposed at AGH Rostrum. While meeting attendance in the minutes we have was typically about 30 people, over 70 people are recorded as having some association with the club.

== AGH Rostrum Club records ==
The AGH Rostrum Club records displayed here were kept by T H (Bill) Hadden ( Service Number VX61667) and lodged with the Australian War Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/advanced-search?query=hadden+rostrum&amp;collection=true&amp;facet_type=Private+Record|title=Advanced Search - The Australian War Memorial|website=www.awm.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is one of very few of the 15,000 Australian POWs at Changi who have material lodged with the Australian War Memorial.

Rostrum Clubs have advertised in veteran's magazines over the years for additional records of the AGH Rostrum Club but none have been found.

== Membership ==
[[File:AGH Rostrum Changi Membership.001.jpg|thumb|Members of AGH Rostrum Club at Changi showing roles performed, Ch = Chairman, S = Speaker, Cr = Critic]]

The founding members of the AGH Rostrum Club are:

''Rank...  Name...      Military Number...       '''Rostrum Role'''...                 Role / Company''
* Lieut Colonel Cotter-Harvey      '''[[President]]'''                       Senior physician

+ These members are referred to in "POWs of Japan" article on the 13th Australian General Hospital.&lt;ref name="pows-of-japan.net"/&gt;

In the limited set of minutes, programs and the membership list, that are available over 70 different people are recorded as participating in meetings.

The club may have had a civilian amongst its members.  In the Membership list, a Mr. C Guest is listed amongst all the other members who have their rank prefixing their name.  While it would be unusual to have a civilian in this part of the POW camp, it is possible a civilian was associated with the Roberts Hospital and was able to attend the AGH Rostrum meetings.  While military rank was dropped in favour of "Mr" at club meetings this seems to have been done after this Membership list was compiled.

== Closure of AGH Rostrum Changi ==

It is not clear when AGH Rostrum Changi closed as there are no minutes or other information available to document the closure.

There are several dates that can be considered possible closure dates.  These are:
* latest date for its closure would be the date of evacuation of POWs which took place on 13 September 1945 on the HMAHS Manunda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C220403|title=SINGAPORE. 1945-09-13. PRISONERS OF WAR (POWS) RELEASED FROM CHANGI PRISON CAMP WERE EVACUATED ...|website=www.awm.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the earliest date may be indicated by last meeting minutes we have for AGH Rostrum is from 31 March 1944. While this could be the last meeting, it seems unlikely as there were 27 members present, apologies from 7 people and one new member, Mr Wyatt, was welcomed.  The lack of later records may be a result of the Japanese confiscating paper, writing material and diaries in late 1944.
* some time between March 1944 and the surrender of Japan which was announced on 15 August and signed on 2 September. It could be imagined that with anticipation of going home in a short time that there was much preparation work to be done and there might not have been time for club meetings.

The use of POWs on work parties for the Japanese would have had an impact of AGH Rostrum members, some of which have been traced to work gangs on the notorious Thai-Burma Railway.  POWs were dispatched to work camps in Malaya, Thailand, Burma and Sandakan.  The initial group of 15,000 Australian POWs in 1942 was reduced to 2,500 by mid 1943, and grew to 5,000 by mid 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobkelsey.net/changi.html|title=Kelsey: Changi Prison|website=www.bobkelsey.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: the POW Changi University operated for the duration of the war although it was at times severely constrained by available staff and students, the demand for people at the work camp, the smaller and smaller food rations as the war went on and a crack down by the Japanese guards who in late 1944 confiscated all paper and pencils. A number of diaries and other documents were saved by being buried in tin cans. Some documents held by the Australian War Memorial and in private hands have a musty smell as a result.  This confiscation of documents also probably happened to the records of AGH Rostrum Club.

In [[Japan]], each school has a different grading system. Many universities use the following set of categories:

{|class="wikitable"
!Grade in Japanese (Kanji)
!English translation
!Corresponding percentage
!4-scale university
|-
|shū (秀)
|Exemplary, excellent
|S (90–100%), rarely given
|
|-
|yū (優)
|Very good
|A (80–89%)
|A (80–100%)
|-
|ryō (良)
|Good
|B (70–79%)
|B (70–79%)
|-
|ka (可)
|Average, pass
|C (60–69%)
|C (60–69%)
|-
|nin (認){{efn|Nin or gou (合) is sometimes used when you pass without grading for some reason , for example when you used credit transfer or adopting grade scale is not suitable for the class.}}
|Approved, acceptable
|D/F (50–59%), not common
|D/F (50–59%), not common
|-
|fuka (不可)
|Unacceptable, failed
|F (0–59% or 0–49%)
|F (0–59% or 0–49%)
|}

[[State school|Public schooling]] below the [[high school]] level is classified as {{nihongo|compulsory education|義務教育|gimu-kyōiku}}, and every Japanese child is required to attend school until they pass [[middle school]]. An interesting phenomenon is that even if an individual student fails a course, they may pass with their class regardless of grades on tests. The grades on tests have no effect on schooling until taking entrance exams to get into high school.

Parents often send their children to {{nihongo|cram schools|塾|[[Juku]]}} or [[private school]]s, for test training purposes.

Most national universities employ a 4-scale grading system (only with A, B, C and F). Below-average students are given an F, and are encouraged to retake the same subject(s) in the following semesters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">'''Censorship of student media''' pertains to the suppression of free speech by school administrative bodies of student-run news operations. Typically this involves interfering with the operation and final publishing authority of a [[school newspaper]], radio, television or other electronic online content generated by students. 

While this has typically consisted of schools enforcing their authority to control the funding and distribution of publications, sometimes forms of censorship extend to expression not funded by or under the official auspices of the school system or college (for example, confiscating independently produced "underground" publications or imposing discipline for material posted on off-campus websites).

==United States==
The states of Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts and Oregon have all passed legislation fortifying student journalists' right to free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Student Press Law Center |url=http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/law_library.asp |title=Student Press Law center - Law Library |publisher=SPLC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nonprofit [[Student Press Law Center]] tracks and provides pro-bono legal aid to student-run media organizations in the U.S.

Some notable cases in the [[United States]] include:
* [[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]],1988- A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that held that public school curricular student newspapers that have not been established as forums for student expression are subject to a lower level of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection than independent student expression or newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1987/86-836&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]], 1969&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/21&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia]], 1995&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1994/94-329&lt;/ref&gt;
* Papish v. Board of Curators of University of Missouri - A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that the University of Missouri could not discipline a college student for profanity and "indecent" sexual references in an "underground" publication that she funded and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;"Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri, 410 U.S. 667 (1973)." [http://media.okstate.edu/faculty/jsenat/jb3163/papish.html Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri], 410 U.S. 667 (1973). Accessed October 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Morse v. Frederick]], 2007- A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in the case of 18-year-old Joseph Frederick, punished for displaying a banner reading "BONG HiTS 4 JESUS" across the street from a school during the 2002 Olympic Torch Relay, concluding that speech promoting illegal drug use during school-sanctioned events is unprotected. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/06-278&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[higher education in Canada]], [[Nigeria]] and the [[Higher education in the United States of America|United States]], a '''course''' is a unit of teaching that typically lasts one [[academic term]], is led by one or more instructors ([[teacher]]s or [[professor]]s), and has a fixed roster of [[student]]s. A course is usually an individual subject.  Students may receive a [[grade (education)|grade]] and academic [[Credit (education)|credit]] after completion of the course.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/course "course"] in ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''. Retrieved 15 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Singapore]], as well as parts of [[Canada]], a '''course''' is the entire programme of studies required to complete a [[university]] degree, and the word "unit" or "module" would be used to refer to an academic course as it is referred to in other parts of the world, for example [[North America]] and the rest of [[Europe]].

In between the two, in South Africa, a course officially is the collection of all courses (in the American sense, these are often called "modules") over a year or semester, though the American usage is common.  In the Philippines, a course can be an individual subject (usually referred to by faculty and school officials) or the entire programme (usually referred to by students and outsiders).

Courses are time-limited in most universities worldwide, lasting anywhere between several weeks to several semesters. They can either be compulsory material or "elective". An elective is usually not a required course, but there are a certain number of non-specific electives that are required for certain majors.

==Types of courses==
Courses are made up of individual sessions, typically on a fixed weekly schedule.

There are different formats of course in universities:

*the [[lecture]] course, where the instructor gives lectures with minimal interaction;
*the [[seminar]], where students prepare and present their original written work for discussion and critique;
*the [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquium]] or reading course, where the instructor assigns readings for each session which are then discussed by the members;
*the [[tutorial]] course, where one or a small number of students work on a topic and meet with the instructor weekly for discussion and guidance.
*the [[Directed Individual Study]] course, where a student requests to create and title an area of study for themselves which is more concentrated and in-depth than a standard course. It is directed under a [[tenure]]d faculty member and approved by a [[professor|department chair]] or possibly the [[dean (education)|dean]] within that specific college;
*the [[laboratory]] course, where most work takes place in a laboratory.

Many courses combine these formats.  Lecture courses often include weekly [[discussion section]]s with smaller groups of students led by the principal instructor, another instructor, or [[teaching assistant]].  Laboratory courses often combine lectures, discussion sections, and laboratory sessions.

Students are expected to do various kinds of work for a course:

*Attending course sessions.
*Reading and studying course readings assigned in the course [[syllabus]].
*Discussing material they have read.
*Writing short and long [[essay|paper]]s based on assigned reading and their own [[library]] [[research]].
*Completing homework or problem sets.
*Completing laboratory exercises.
*Taking quizzes and [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s.

The exact work required depends on the discipline, the course, and the particular instructor.  Unlike most European university courses, grades are generally determined by all of these kinds of work, not only the final examination.

==Elective and required courses==
An elective course is one chosen by a student from a number of optional subjects or courses in a curriculum, as opposed to a required course which the student must take. While required courses (sometimes called "core courses" or "general education courses") are deemed essential for an academic degree, elective courses tend to be more specialized. Elective courses usually have fewer students than the required courses.

The term [[Elective (medical)|elective]] is also used for a period of [[medicine|medical]] study conducted away from the student's home [[medical school]], often abroad. Motivations for choosing such a program include a wish to experience other cultures, and to learn how to work in the clinical situations in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.bmj.com/issues/05/02/editorials/47.php A guide for electives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, North American universities require students to achieve both breadth of knowledge across disciplines and depth of knowledge in a particular chosen subject area, known as a major. Thus, students of the Arts or Humanities are required to take some science courses, and vice versa. Normally, students are free to choose their particular electives from among a wide range of courses offered by their university, as long as the students possess the prerequisite knowledge to understand the subject matter being taught. An English major, for example, might also study one or two years of chemistry, biology or physics as well as mathematics and a foreign language.

Elective courses are also offered in the third and fourth years of university, though the choice is more restrictive and will depend upon the particular major the student has chosen. For example, at the [[University of British Columbia]], students intending to specialize in [[Sanskrit]] as part of a major in Asian language and culture will usually have to complete several Sanskrit and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] or [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] courses during the first two years of university, as well as additional courses in other languages of India in the third and fourth years of study. In addition to these required courses, however, students would choose among several third- and fourth-year elective courses on topics not directly related to India, such as the history and culture of [[China]], [[Japan]] or [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="ubcasia"&gt;[http://www.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=12,197,282,62#1382 Major in Asian Language and Culture], ''UBC Calendar 2009/10''. Retrieved 2009-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course numbering system==

In the United States, most universities implement a course numbering system where each course is identified by the name of the [[Major (academic)|major]] (or an abbreviation thereof) followed by a 3- or 4-digit number − for example, [[Computer science|CS]] 123. This common numbering system was designed to make transfer between colleges easier. In theory, any numbered course in one academic institution should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Higher education in the United States: an encyclopedia |author = Forest, J.J.F. |year = 2002 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sFFX9OIkF2IC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=course%20numbering%20systems&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page = 73 |publisher = ABC-CLIO |isbn = 1-57607-248-7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first digit of the course number is related to its level, or relative difficulty, of the course,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bulletins.psu.edu/undergrad/courses/ |title = University Course Descriptions |work = University Bulletin |publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://handbook.psu.edu/content/course-numbering-system |title = Course Numbering System |work = University Undergraduate Advising Handbook |publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can roughly correspond the year of study in which the course is likely to be taken. It's common for the second digit to represent the subfield in the department within which the course is offered − for example, in a Physics department, all courses numbered PHYS 47xx may be about magnetism, while all PHYS 48xx courses may be about optics. The attribution of the third and fourth digits is less standardized, but in general, sequences of related courses tend to have consecutive course numbers, with gaps between such sequences to signal different sets of courses.

The [[101 (topic)|course number 101]] is often used for an introductory course at a beginner's level in a department's subject area.

The '''Education Act 1994''' is an act passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] under [[John Major]]'s government in 1994, which primarily established the Teacher Training Agency and allowed students to opt out of students' unions.


==Part I==
{{expand-section|date=May 2018}}
Part I relates to teacher training and includes the establishment of the [[Teacher Training Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Teacher Training Agency and Successors|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATID=361&amp;CATLN=1&amp;accessmethod=5&amp;j=1|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part II==
Part II of the Education Act gave effect to students' freedom of association by mandating that students must be permitted to opt out of any [[students' union]] without being unfairly disadvantaged; this provision has not proven nearly as damaging to students' unions as was expected at the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This Part also places further restrictions on Students' Unions by requiring that affiliation to external organizations must be voted on at referendum in 5% of the membership requests a referendum and restricts the time a [[sabbatical officer]] can serve to two years. It also stipulates that a students' union must be governed democratically and must be accountable for its finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1994 Education Act|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/30/part/II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various other clauses about the finances and external affiliations of students' unions.

Section 22 of the Act requires that "the procedure for allocating resources to groups or clubs should be fair and should be set down in writing and freely accessible to all students". This has generated some controversy because of the way it can be interpreted. Some assert that it requires all university societies that draw on students' union funding to be open to membership by all students, whilst others assert that this does not explicitly prevent a society of a students' union from restricting its membership to those who share the aims and purposes of the society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7612">[[New York (state)|New York State]]'s '''Excelsior Scholarship''' program provides certain residents with free tuition for full-time study at its state universities: [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) and [[City University of New York]] (CUNY). On April 11, 2017, New York became the first American state to make four-year public colleges tuition-free for those under an earnings threshold.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/08/pf/college/new-york-free-tuition/index.html?iid=EL&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship ==

[[New York State]]'s Excelsior Scholarship provides in-state, public college tuition for residents whose families earn below a set annual income cap: $100,000 in 2017. This amounts to an annual savings between $4,000 and $6,500, depending on whether the student attends a community college or a four-year school. As the scholarship only covers tuition, students bear the additional cost of fees and [[room and board]], which can cost up to $14,000 annually. To maintain the scholarship, Excelsior students must maintain 30 annual class credits at a state college: [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) or [[City University of New York]] (CUNY).&lt;ref name="CNN: need to know"/&gt; There will also be a GPA requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2017/04/08/new-york-will-make-historic-investment-in-free-college-tuition-part-of-budget-deal-reached-friday-night/|title=New York will make historic investment in free college tuition, part of budget deal reached Friday night {{!}} Chalkbeat|website=www.chalkbeat.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, Excelsior students must live and work in New York for as many years as they received the scholarship.&lt;ref name="CNN: need to know"/&gt;

The annual income cap will increase as the Excelsior program is phased in (to $110,000 in 2018, and $125,000 in 2019). By the time the program is fully implemented, an estimated 200,000 will be eligible.&lt;ref name="CNN: need to know"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Excelsior Scholarship requires graduates to live and work in New York state for the number of years that they received the scholarship, which [[Sara Goldrick-Rab|Sara Goldrick-Raab]], among others, say will cost New York and scholarship recipients money and is fundamentally unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@saragoldrickrab/dear-jimmy-making-free-college-pay-in-new-york-f6ba6696e430|title=Dear Jimmy: Making "Free College" Pay in New York|date=2017-04-11|website=Sara Goldrick-Rab|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] praised the program as an example of the free college programs he supports but some in the free college movement say that it falls into the same trap as existing scholarship programs in being complicated and trapping recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2017/04/10/tuition_free_college_cuomo.php|title=Cuomo's Tuition-Free College Plan Has A Big Catch, Critics Say|work=Gothamist|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-US|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419072614/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/10/tuition_free_college_cuomo.php|archivedate=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Excelsior Scholarship pays for only tuition and so has been assailed for not helping poorer students who can't afford books or living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://shakingnews.com/blog/2017/04/13/free-college-whats-catch-excelsior-scholarship/|title=Free College? What's the Catch with the Excelsior Scholarship? - ShakingNews|date=2017-04-13|work=ShakingNews|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Excelsior Scholarship is a "last dollar" scholarship, meaning that Federal aid and grants will be applied first, with the Excelsior Scholarship being applied to the remaining balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/04/11/523290884/here-s-the-fine-print-on-the-countrys-biggest-ever-free-college-plan|title=Here's The Fine Print On The Country's Biggest-Ever Free College Plan|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marc J Cohen]] and the [[Student Assembly of the State University of New York]] have commended the program as one which will provide greater access to an affordable higher education, but have also articulated concerns that there are many other associated costs to higher education which must be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wben.com/articles/suny-student-leaders-applaud-excelsior-tuition-scholarship&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, only 25.9% of [[City University of New York|CUNY]] students graduate with a bachelors within 4 years, as required by the Excelsior Scholarship, according to the CUNY Office of Institutional Research and Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cuny.edu/irdatabook/rpts2_AY_current/RTGS_0007_FT_FTFR_BACC_UNIV_TOT.rpt.pdf |title=System Retention and Graduation Rates of Full-time First-time Freshmen in Baccalaureate Programs by Year of Entry           - Office of Institutional Research -     CUNY|last=York|first=The City University of New|website=www.cuny.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48.9% of [[State University of New York]] students graduate with a bachelors within 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.suny.edu/about/fast-facts/|title=Fast Facts - SUNY|last=SUNY|website=www.suny.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If students do not fulfill the work requirements, or fail to meet academic requirements the amount of scholarship funding they received will be converted into a loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/nys-grants-scholarships-awards/the-excelsior-scholarship.html|title=NYS Higher Education Services Corporation - The Excelsior Scholarship|website=www.hesc.ny.gov|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' estimated that the program's requirement for finishing in two to four years, depending on the degree, would make more than 90% of community college students and 60% of four-year college students ineligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/nyregion/new-yorks-free-tuition-program-will-help-traditional-but-not-typical-students.html|title=New York’s Free-Tuition Program Will Help Traditional, but Not Typical, Students|last=Chen|first=David W.|date=2017-04-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-25|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fifth grade''' (called '''Grade 5''' in some regions) is a year of [[education]] in many nations. In the United States, the fifth grade is the fifth and last school year of [[elementary school]] in most schools. It depends on the school district, the grade may be the second to last or last year of elementary school, the first year of middle school or the first year of intermediate school. Students are usually 10-11 years old unless the child has been held back.  In England and Wales, the equivalent is [[Year 6]]. In Ireland the equivalent is 5th class.

'''GRIN Campaign''', '''G'''lobal '''R'''espect '''i'''n Educatio'''n''', is a transatlantic non-profit organisation and [[advocacy group]] which campaigns primarily for [[lesbian]] [[gay]] [[bisexual]] [[transgender]] and [[queer]]/[[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] ([[LGBT]]Q) people's social and political equality in education.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="two"&gt;"Teens from Sussex School Go Public with Their GRIN Photo Campaign to Combat Bulling of Gays in Schools", ''UK Gay News'', December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"On the Show from 9 January 2011- School Students' Global Respect IN Education (GRIN) Campaign &amp; Whitehawk &amp; Manor Farm History Society Book", ''RadioReverb'' (97.2 FM - East Sussex), 9 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to end [[discrimination]], [[harassment]], and [[bullying]] based on [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and [[gender expression]] in all educational institutes with an underlying message that "being different was 'cool'".&lt;ref&gt;"Online anti-bullying campaign launched", ''Petersford Post'', 18 March 2011, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the first campaigns of its kind to originate outside the United States, be run by students and intentionally international.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Tom C.

== History ==
It was inaugurated in response to a rash of widely publicized [[Bullycide|bullying-related suicides]] of juvenile, particularly, LGBTQ youth, school students in the last half of 2010 both [[homophobic]] and [[transphobic]], including that of [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]].&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Diviesti, "The GRIN Campaign, bringing respect for the LGBT community to our schools", ''Twenty Ten'', December 14, 2010. (audio interview version at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA8KuhAlIOo])&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established as a UK and US alternative to other, older LGBT civil rights advocacy organizations, which do not place as much emphasis on education, and focus only on the United States.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; The campaign hopes to build awareness in the same spirit as the [[Day of Silence]], [[It Gets Better Project]], [[No on 8]] campaigns and efforts to repeal [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]].&lt;ref&gt;"Teenager Launches Global Respect in Education", ''Gay UK News'', 3 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign coordinated with [[Spirit Day]] (October 20) when people are encouraged to wear purple symbolic of spirit from the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]].&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

In 2011 the campaign worked to add "amendments to the [[Education and Inspections Act 2006|UK’s Educational White Paper]], started developing anti-bullying and LGBT rights lesson plans, and wrote letters to corporations in the UK that they believed were being homophobic or transphobic."&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; In the summer of 2012 the campaign received a grant to travel to [[San Francisco]] in the United States to teach their lesson plans about discrimination based bullying and utilize the RESPECT photographic campaign.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;

In 2013 the campaign started a petition to add the word 'transphobia' to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and the dictionary lexicon of [[Microsoft Office]]. The petition was hosted on the website [[Change.org]] and gained nearly 10,000 signatures. By June, both Microsoft and the Oxford English Dictionary had added the word 'transphobia' to their dictionary lexicons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anna Peirano |url=http://dot429.com/articles/2486-transphobic-officially-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary |title="Transphobic" officially added to Oxford English Dictionary &amp;#124; Articles |publisher=dot429 |date=2013-06-24 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/the-oxford-english-dictionary-and-microsoft-office-will-officially-recognize-transphobia-20130624/#comments |title=The Oxford English Dictionary And Microsoft Office Will Officially Recognize "Transphobia" / Queerty |publisher=Queerty.com |date=2013-06-24 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2013-update/new-words-list-june-2013/ |title=New words list June 2013 |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101160359/http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/june-2013-update/new-words-list-june-2013/ |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerald Holton''' is an American physicist, historian of science, and educator, whose professional interests also include philosophy of science and the fostering of careers of young men and women. He is Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Professor of History of Science, Em, at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, Gerald J. "United States Public Records Inde". See also: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://holton.physics.harvard.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions range from physical science and its history to their professional and public understanding, from studies on gender problems and ethics in science careers to those on the role of immigrants. These have been acknowledged by an unusually wide spectrum of appointments and honors, from physics to initiatives in education and other national, societal issues, to contributions for which he was selected, as the first scientist, to give the tenth annual Jefferson Lecture that the National Endowment for the Humanities describes as, “the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished achievement in the humanities”.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture&lt;/nowiki&gt;. See also: Gerald Holton, Advancement of Science, and its Burdens (1986), Chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his life story is also punctuated by improbable rescues during the dark time of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Holton was born on May 23, 1922 in Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;Holton, Gerald J. "United States Public Records Inde".&lt;/ref&gt; when Germany was in turmoil and sliding toward disaster. In June, the Foreign Minister, Walter Rathenau, was one of the more than 350 politicians and intellectuals assassinated by fascist gangs that already commanded the streets.&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia for Walther Rathenau: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_Rathenau&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Albert Einstein was told he was next on the list, so he fled the country.

Holton's parents were Austrians: Emanuel, an Attorney-at-Law specializing in International Law, and Regina, a physiotherapist. Forced by the rise of fascism in Germany, and one physical attack on the young family, they returned early to Vienna. Growing up in Vienna, Holton received his education through most of the Humanistische Gymnasium. Family life was typically that of professionals enamored of Germanic Kultur; indeed, his parents had met first in a Poetry Club.

But in 1938, the annexation of Austria by Germany made life for Jews there also life-threatening, as was widely understood after the nationwide Pogrom of November 8–9.&lt;ref&gt;Only 7% of the targeted children in Nazi Europe survived. See: Tec, N. (1993). A Historical Perspective: Tracing the History of the Hidden-Child Experience. In Marks, J., The Hidden Children: The Secret Survivors of the Holocaust, New York: Fawcett Columbine, 273-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, soon thereafter he and his younger brother, Edgar, were luckily granted a place on the British Quakers' Kindertransport,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kindertransport.org/&lt;/ref&gt; to flee to England. There, Holton studied at the School of Technology, City of Oxford, receiving the Certificate of Electrical Engineering in June 1940. At that point, he was able to leave for America with his luckily rejoined family, just days before having to report for incarceration for the duration, as was required for all male adult German refugees, by Prime Minister Churchill’s directive.

Shortly after arriving in the U.S., out of the blue, Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT offered Holton a place as a refugee from Europe (as many American Colleges and University did similarly &lt;ref&gt;See Holton, G. and Sonnert, G., “The Grand Wake for Harvard Indifference: How Harvard and Radcliffe students aided young refugees from the Nazis.” Harvard Magazine., Sept.-Oct. 2006. 50-55.&lt;/ref&gt;). At Wesleyan, studying under his mentor, Professor Walter G. Cady, he received a B.A. in 1941 and an M.A. in 1942. From the outbreak of the war he found himself officially among the “Enemy Aliens”, as marked by President Roosevelt’s directive for all holders of German passports. Yet, he was asked to join the Harvard-based war-time research unit, the Electric-Acoustic Laboratory, OSRD, and also was Teaching Assistant on the staff to train Naval Officers in the use and repair of Radar equipment.

Upon the end of WWII, he enrolled as a graduate student at Harvard. In 1947 he received his Ph.D. for research on the structure of matter at high pressure, as a student under Professor Percy Williams Bridgman, who in 1946 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his remarkable research in the field he effectively founded. Upon Holton's graduation he was asked to remain at Harvard as Instructor in the Physics Department. His academic professional life had begun, and his association with Harvard has lasted for over 70 years. So has also his marriage to Nina, a sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;See Holton, Nina. “Sculpture,” in Leonardo, vol. 8, 2. (Great Britain: Pergamon Press, 1975), 133-135. and also Holton, Nina. “My Clay Sculpture Series”, in Leonardo, vol. 14, 2. (Great Britain: Pergamon Press, 1981), 125-127.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have two sons, Thomas and Stephan.

==Career==
Holton went through various faculty ranks at Harvard, starting in 1947, and was tenured in 1952 at age 30. For 30 years, starting from his thesis, he ran a high-pressure laboratory, specializing on the structure of liquids, and having the usual flow-through of research students and publications.

Among the courses he taught in the Physics Department was an unusual one – an introduction to Physics seen as part of a cultural tapestry that included astronomy, chemistry and technology as well as history and philosophy of science. It resulted in his publication of his first book, Introduction to Concepts and Theories of Physical Science (Addison Wesley: 1952, and later editions and adaptations), which has been called a seminal work. Its approach and structure was later incorporated in the National Curriculum Project requested by the NSF, called The Project Physics Course.&lt;ref&gt;The entire collection of texts from the Project Physics Course can be accessed and downloaded for free at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection&lt;/nowiki&gt;. See also the dissertation by Meshoulam, David. Teaching Physics as One of the Humanities: The History of (Harvard) Project Physics, 1961-1970, (University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; He headed it with colleagues F. James Rutherford and Fletcher Watson. It was also adapted in a number of foreign countries.

In these, as in Holton’s other educational opportunities, he has been guided by the advice of Alfred North Whitehead, that “In the conditions of modern life, the rule is absolute, the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed”. As well, he is based on his firm belief that in education a multi-cultural approach is necessary, both to help immunize against the seduction of narrowness, and to obey the moral imperative to foster a liberal education. For the same reason, Holton wrote extensively against the destructive excesses of Structuralists and Postmodernists in their writings against science.&lt;ref&gt;See Holton, Gerald James, Science and anti-science. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1993. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL:19365133&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Chapters 5 and 6. Also Journal of the History of Jdeas, v.61.2 (2000), 327-341).&lt;/ref&gt;

Holton's service at Harvard included chairmanship of the Concentration on Physics and Chemistry, of the initial General Education Course, membership on the Faculty Council, and on the Advisory Board of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. From 1976 to 1982 he was concurrently Visiting Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a founding faculty member of the Program on Science, Technology and Society. At various times he was visiting professor (or similar title) at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton; New York University; Leningrad University; Imperial College, London; University of Rome; CNRS-Paris; and invited lecturer in China and Japan.

Here it is appropriate to mention two of Holton's other educational efforts. In 1956, having been elected as Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H". American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; he was asked to be its Editor. For a couple of years before, the Academy had been publishing an experimental, annual, in-house volume called Daedalus, distributed to its members. But Holton realized the opportunity to change Daedalus to a publicly, widely available, quarterly journal. As he put it in his first issue (Winter 1958),&lt;ref&gt;Later issued also as a book - Science and the Modern Mind. (Boston: Beacon Press), 1958 - as were most of his issues.&lt;/ref&gt; the new journal aimed "to give the intellectual community a strong voice of its own", and to lift each of us above our individual cell in the labyrinth, so as "to see the entire structure".

In addition for the journal serving as a sort of Adult Education, several issues looked ahead at problems that were coming over the horizon and had an effect on public policy—such as those on "Arms Control and Disarmament" (Fall 1960), on "The Woman in America" (Spring 1964), on African Americans (Fall 1965, with a Foreword by President L.B Johnson), and on "Ethical Aspects of Experimentation with Human Subjects" (Spring 1969).

In 1955, another unexpected event occurred, one which caused Holton to make an important turn in his studies. When Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, Professor Philipp Frank, Holton's colleague in the Physics Department and proponent of the American continuation of the Vienna Circle philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Holton, Gerald. “On the Vienna Circle in Exile: An Eyewitness Report,” in The Foundation Debate, (Kluwer Academic: 1995), 269-292.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that a memorial occasion should be arranged, and that as one part Holton should present the history of Einstein's achievements. But Holton found that apart from Einstein's own essays there was then still little solid scholarship on this topic.

With Professor Frank's recommendation, Holton went to the Institute of Advanced Study, where Einstein's enormous and largely unstudied correspondence and manuscripts were kept, still under the supervision of Einstein's long-time secretary, Helen Dukas.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, Gerald. “The Woman in Einstein’ s Shadow”,  Chapter 2  in Victory and Vexation in Science: Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg and Others. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This excursion resulted in Holton, on and off for two years, helping to make the haphazard collection into an Archive usable by scholars, while he, reading through the collection, was learning from it how to see its historical value. Over the years that followed, Holton's researches on Einstein have occupied a large part of his publications.&lt;ref&gt;One of Holton’s early indications of his findings in the Einstein collection was published in “Continuity and Originality in Einstein’s Special Relativity Theory,” in Actes du IX Congrès International d’Histoire des Sciences, September 1959, vol. 1. ( an “abbreviated version”). Also relevant are: Holton, Gerald. “Einstein, Michelson, and the “Crucial” Experiment” in Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought: Kepler to Einstein (Cambridge: Harvard University Press), 1988. Chapter 8., as well as Holton, Gerald. “Einstein’s model for constructing a scientific theory””. “Einstein and the cultural roots of modern science,” and “Einstein and the shaping of our imagination” , all in The Advancement of Science and Its Burdens. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, this initiative helped launch an academic industry, analogous to the ones concerned with Newton and Darwin. But as the scholar in this field, Tesu Hiroshige, wrote, someone had to take a "first step".&lt;ref&gt;Holton, The Advancement of Science, xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

While studying the rich contents of Einstein’s collection, Holton came to realize a fact that led to a new and fruitful part of his researches on this and other scientists. As shown in Einstein’s work, Einstein brilliantly but silently drew again and again from a set of fundamental guiding  concepts that were neither verifiable nor falsifiable. These concepts included, in his theory construction, the primacy of the search for unity; invariance; formal rather than materialistic explanation; logical parsimony; symmetry; the continuum, causality, and completeness. In addition, their contraries held by other scientists, such as acausality and uncertainty, were strongly opposed.

Holton called all such motivating concepts Themata (sing. Thema). He found these crucial, style-defining and differing thematic sets to be also at the core of research of many other scientists, from antiquity to Johann Kepler to Niels Bohr.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, “The Roots of Complementarity,” in ''Thematic Origins'', 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; This insight was later used as well by other historians of science, and by scholars in other fields.&lt;ref&gt;Holton, “Postscript to the Revised Edition” in Thematic Origins, 1988, 473-481.&lt;/ref&gt; His findings led Holton to the publication of his book, The Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought (Harvard University Press, 1973, revised edition 1988).

Different sets of themata were and are being held by individual scientist so inclined, as their subjects advanced over time. In that respect, this concept differs profoundly from the idea of a series of incommensurable, non-progressive, so-called “paradigms”. Each of those, in turn, was said to infect the whole social group of scientists at a given time and in the same way—as is disproved even by the famous mutual oppositions between contemporaries such as Einstein, Schroedinger, and Heisenberg.

Occasionally, a public issue became so important that Holton felt he could contribute to its deeper understanding and amelioration. One of these was the general realization that among working scientists in most fields, women were underrepresented and often not sufficiently valued. Therefore, with his colleague Dr. Gerhard Sonnert, a sociologist of science, he initiated a long-term research effort, called Project Access. It yielded two books, Who Succeeds in Science?:  The Gender Dimension (Rutgers University Press, 1995), and Gender Differences in Science Careers: The Project Access Study (Rutgers University Press, 1995, with a Foreword by Robert K. Merton).

A second occasion for engaging in a thorough study arose when it became of general interest to explore what immigrants can bring to the betterment of society in the U.S.A. Dr. Sonnert and Holton committed to a several-years study, called Second Wave, to determine, by questionnaires and face-to-face interviews, what was achieved by a particular group—immigrants who had come as children to the U.S.A. as refugees from Nazi persecution—compared to American-borns. The startling results were published by them in a book, What Happened to the Children Who Fled Nazi Persecution (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006, with a Preface by Bernard Bailyn; German translation, Was geschah mit den Kindern, Lit Verlag, Muenster, 2008). Noting that the findings in that book appeared to have applications for immigrants to the U.S. in our time, Dr. Sonnert and Holton published another book, Helping Young Refugees and Immigrants Succeed (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).

A selection of Holton's books and essays can be downloaded on DASH (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard). Among the essays are those in which Holton called for the wider adoption of what he called Jeffersonian Research—one with the double purpose of serving both basic investigation and the needs of society, as Thomas Jefferson had done repeatedly.

Holton also engaged in considerable editorial work apart from Daedalus. It included, as General Editor, the series of books on history of science by the Arno Press, and another, called Classics of Science, by Dover Publications, Inc. He also served for some years, from its beginning, on the Editorial Advisory Board and Editorial Committee of The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein (Princeton University Press, 1987 ff.). In 1972 he founded the Newsletter on Science, Technology, and Human Values, known since 1976 as the journal Science, Technology and Human Values.

== Professional Memberships, Fellowships, and Other Honors ==
While his professional memberships are collected below, one such service required a great deal of time and energy: the Presidency of the History of Science Society (1983-1984), after two years as Vice President. This Society, founded by George Sarton, was highly distinguished in its essential mission; but he found on election that a great deal of work, managerially and financially, had to be done.&lt;ref&gt;See his  “1984 Presidential Address,” in History of Science Society Newsletter, v. 14, 2, April 1985, and “Some Lessons from History in the History of Science,” in Isis, Journal of the History of Science Society, v. 90, 52, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graduate Medical Program (GMP)''' or sometimes also known as '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Program (GEP)]]''' or '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM)]]''' are terms generally used outside of the United States to refer to medical programs usually of 4-years duration where applicants are [[university]] graduates who have taken aptitude tests such as the [[GAMSAT]], [[UKCAT]] or [[MCAT]]. These tests are not to be confused with tests such as the [[UMAT]] since tests such as the [[UMAT]] are designed for high school graduates. Medical programs in the United States technically do not require the completion of a previous degree, but do require the completion of 2–3 years of pre-medical sciences at the university level and so are thus classified as [[Second entry degree]]s. However, since in places such as [[Australia]] medical applicants were historically generally high school graduates and only recently have medical schools changed to requiring the completion of a previous [[bachelor's degree]], the terms '''Graduate Medical Program''' and '''Graduate Entry Medicine''' arose to differentiate the new courses.

Born in [[Whanganui|Wanganui]], New Zealand, she lived most of her life in England and moved to Australia after her retirement. She arrived in England in 1936, and by 1938 she had founded a dance school bearing her name in London's West End, which (as of 2006) is still operating as the Central London Dance. During [[World War II]] she worked by day as a [[WRVS|WVS]] nurse and by night continued to run classes, even during [[strategic bombing|air raids]]. Gwenethe simply turned up the music and the dancing continued!&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;Janet Clark [https://web.archive.org/web/20050405235150/http://www.istd.org/latin/facultynews/march2005/gwenethwalsheprofile.html  Profile of Miss Gwenethe Walshe], retrieved 2007-08-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Taught [[latin dance]] by the leading experts of the day, [[Monsieur Pierre]] (Pierre Zurcher-Margolle) and [[Doris Lavelle]], Gwenethe and her partner [[Dimitri Petrides]] won the first Latin dance competitions. Gwenethe went on to become a key member of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]]. In particular, she helped to develop the technique of latin dancing and the framework for its teaching and competition assessment.&lt;ref name="ISTD Obituary" /&gt;

:"The Latin American Faculty was formed in 1946 by Monsieur Pierre, his partner Doris Lavelle, and colleague, Doris Nichols. They were later joined by Gwenethe Walshe and Dimitri Petrides.

==Career==
From January 1871 until 1873, Straight became a science teacher as well as the second [[University president|president]] (referred to as principal at the time) of [[Peru State College|Peru Normal School]] in [[Peru, Nebraska]], establishing the reputation for the young college that was only opened six years earlier in 1865.&lt;ref name="nebraskahistory"/&gt; He took over as president from the College's first president, John M.

In 1873, he joined the Science Department of [[University of Central Missouri|Central Missouri Normal School]] in [[Warrensburg, Missouri|Warrensburg]] along with his wife, Emma, also an educator. In the summer of 1873, Henry and Emma attended the inaugural program at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory|Anderson School of Natural History]] on [[Penikese Island]], a school for naturalists and science teachers ran by distinguished Swiss naturalist [[Louis Agassiz]].&lt;ref name="Bardeen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardeen|first1=Charles William|title=A dictionary of educational biography: portraits and sketches of persons prominent in educational work|date=1901|publisher=C.W.

Henry worked at the College until 1875, when he and Emma both resigned.&lt;ref name="nebraskahistory"/&gt; In 1874, he returned to the Pekinese and in 1875, he embarked on a [[Geology of North America|geological expedition]] in the mountains of Carolina and Kentucky with Harvard professor and director of [[Kentucky Geological Survey]], [[Nathaniel Shaler]].&lt;ref name="Regents"/&gt;

From 1876 until 1883, he taught at the [[State University of New York at Oswego|Oswego Normal School]] in [[Oswego, New York]] where he was the chair of [[Natural Sciences]] department. In 1880, he became chair of the [[Oswego Movement|Practice School]] and in 1882, he was also given charge of [[Psychology]] and the History of Education departments.&lt;ref name="OswegoHistory"/&gt;

In the spring of 1883, he taught at [[Cook County Normal School]] in [[Chicago]]&lt;ref name="nebraskahistory"/&gt; over Col. [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis W. Parker]], a pioneer of the [[progressive education|progressive school movement]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Regents"/&gt;

From 1883 to 1884, he in charge of [[Applied science|Industrial Science]] and [[Pedagogy]] at the Martha's Vineyard Summer Institute.&lt;ref name="Regents"/&gt;

In the fall of 1885, his health began declining from [[tuberculosis]] and he moved to Florida to recover, moving again to [[Pasadena, California]]&lt;ref name="Jackman"/&gt; in the spring of the following year.&lt;ref name="Regents"/&gt;

===Legacy===
According to the [[Nebraska State Historical Society]]:&lt;ref name="nebraskahistory"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The success of Straight's career does not lie in his publications or even in the large number of students he influenced. Rather he was significant because he influenced other persons who themselves became educational leaders."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Annual Report of the [[State University of New York|Regents of the University]], to the [[New York State Legislature|Legislature of the State of New York]], Straight was described as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"His great aim during mature years was to bring science to the people, through which he believed better thinking and better living could be secured; hence he chose to work in normal schools, rejecting higher salaries and more honored positions in other educational institutions, hoping thus to train teachers who in turn would train the children and youth of our land."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Imperial College Act 1997''' is a [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|local Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It is a minor piece of legislation that enabled [[Imperial College London]] to take over the [[Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School]], the [[National Heart and Lung Institute]] and the [[Royal Postgraduate Medical School]].

In 1988, Imperial College had already taken over [[St Mary's Hospital Medical School]], creating the [[Imperial College School of Medicine]] (now the college's Faculty of Medicine), into which these additional medical schools were merged.

The act itself transferred all the property, powers, rights and obligations of the three medical schools to Imperial College. It dissolved the three schools, revoked the charter of the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and repealed the [[Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School Act 1984]]. It also restricted the use of the names of the three medical schools: for the 25 years from the passing of the act, only those permitted by Imperial College may use the names.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">There are a number of [[loan]] repayment options available to U.S. federal [[student loan]] borrowers, including some that are based on the borrower’s [[income]]. Income-sensitive repayment lets [[Federal Family Education Loan Program]] (FFELP) borrowers decide what percentage of their income their loan payment will be. Income-sensitive repayment (ISR) is one such option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asa.org/repay/options/isr/default.aspx American Student Assistance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507181905/http://www.asa.org/repay/options/isr/default.aspx |date=2010-05-07 }} Retrieved on June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
The borrower selects a monthly payment amount between 4–25% of his or her monthly income. The payment must be greater than or equal to the [[interest]] accruing on the loan. The borrower must reapply for this schedule every year. It is available for up to 5 years.

After 5 years, the borrower will need to choose another [[repayment schedule]]. The borrower may have up to 10 additional years under a new schedule.

Income-sensitive repayment extends the [[repayment period]]. As a result, the total amount paid in interest may be greater than what the borrower would pay under standard repayment.

'''[[Language policy]] in Ukraine''' is based on its [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]], international obligations, and from 2012 until February 2018 on the law "On the principles of the state language policy" (before 2012, the 1989 law "On the languages in the Ukrainian SSR" was in force).

The [[Ukrainian language]] is the state language of [[Ukraine]]. According to the article 10 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], the State has to ensure the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine.
Other languages spoken in Ukraine are guaranteed constitutional protection. Russian is recognized as the language of a national minority.&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm#r1|title=Constitution of Ukraine: General Principles: Article 10|date=28 June 1996|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521190059/http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm|archivedate=21 May 2011}} of the Constitution says: "The state language of Ukraine is the Ukrainian language. The State ensures the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. In Ukraine, the free development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine, is guaranteed."&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 law, called the law "On the principles of the state language policy" gave the status of [[regional language]] to Russian and other minority languages. It allowed the use of minority languages in courts, schools and other government institutions in areas of Ukraine where the national minorities exceed 10% of the population.&lt;ref name="Lsaid24812"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/lytvyn-program-for-development-of-ukrainian-language-should-be-adopted-before-elections-312012.html |title=Lytvyn: Program for development of Ukrainian language should be adopted before elections |date=2012-08-24 |work=[[KyivPost]] |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012/&gt; The law was used mostly in Ukraine's southern and eastern regions, where predominant or significant parts of the population speak Russian as their first language.&lt;ref name="Guardian4Jul2012" /&gt; Three minor settlements did the same for [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].&lt;ref name="NewUklang2892012" /&gt; Ukrainian remained the only official country-wide language.&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/04/ukrainians-protest-russian-language-law |title=Ukrainians protest against Russian language law |last=Elder |first=Miriam |date=2012-07-04 |work=theguardian.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduction of the law was supported by the governing [[Party of regions]] and opposed by the opposition parties. According to its opponents the law undermined and supplanted the role of the Ukrainian language, and violated Article 10 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Ukrainian Constitution]].&lt;ref name=Committeerada&gt;[http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=41018 Висновок Комітету Верховної Ради України з питань культури і духовності], rada.gov.ua&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientistssaid&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/uk/article/podrobici/naukovci-ocinyuyut-zakon-pro-zasadi-movnoyi-politiki Науковці оцінюють закон про засади мовної політики], www.day.kiev.ua&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Riabchuksaid&gt;[https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/mykola-riabchuk/playing-with-ambiguities-ukraine%E2%80%99s-language-law Playing with ambiguities: Ukraine’s language law], Mykola Riabchuk  (28 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was adopted amid fistfights in the [[Verkhovna Rada building|Ukrainian Parliament building]] on 3 July 2012, and the opposition said that the procedure of adopting the law was not respected.&lt;ref name=Tsn13072012&gt;[http://tsn.ua/politika/opoziciya-virishila-borotis-z-movnim-zakonom-goloduvannyam.html 1+1 ТСН Опозиція вирішила боротись з "бандитським" законом про мови голодуванням]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UkrPrStenograma&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/07/5/6968170/ УП Мовний законопроект ухвалений із порушенням процедури - стенограма]&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into force on 10 August 2012.&lt;ref name=Lsaid24812/&gt; Since then various cities and regions of Ukraine declared Russian a regional language in their jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=UkrCRdecRusregL/&gt; Other cities and regions declared their opposition to this law.&lt;ref name=GalInfo1yearDetails&gt;[http://galinfo.com.ua/news/136936.html Річниця "мовного закону" - galinfo.com.ua]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], on 23 February 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament voted to repeal the law. This decision was vetoed by the acting President [[Oleksandr Turchynov]], who instead ordered drafting of a new law to "accommodate the interests of both eastern and western Ukraine and of all ethnic groups and minorities."&lt;ref name=lenta223 /&gt;&lt;ref name=itar301&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/721537|title=Ukraine's parliament-appointed acting president says language law to stay effective|date=2014-03-01|publisher=[[ITAR-TASS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2014 the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] started reviewing the constitutionality of the law,&lt;ref name=KSU10117/&gt; and on 28 February 2018 it ruled the law unconstitutional.&lt;ref name =KSU10ZZ117&gt;[https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/2412584-constitutional-court-declares-unconstitutional-language-law-of-kivalovkolesnichenko.html Constitutional Court declares unconstitutional language law of Kivalov-Kolesnichenko], [[Ukrinform]] (28 February 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{see also|Russification of Ukraine}}
[[File:Ukraine census 2001 Russian.svg|thumb|Percentage of native speakers of Russian from the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]].  Russian is a regional language in 13 [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|regions]] ''(shaded)'' with 10% or higher.&lt;ref name="itar301" /&gt;]]
Since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] and the independence of [[Ukraine]], the [[Russian language]] has dwindled, but remains one of the two most used languages for business, legal proceedings, science, artistry, and many other spheres of everyday life. According to the 2001 census, 67.5% of the citizens of Ukraine regard Ukrainian as their native language, with Russian being considered the native language for another 29.6%. Various other languages constitute the remaining 2.9%.&lt;ref&gt;http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/&lt;/ref&gt; During the Soviet era, both Russian and Ukrainian had official status as state languages of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name=oflangUSSR&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn3xDTiL0PQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=official+languages+Soviet+Union&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22official%20language%22&amp;f=false Language Policy in the Soviet Union] by [[L.A. Grenoble]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the bill argued it would make life easier for [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian-speaking Ukrainians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/rushed-law-on-russian-provokes-ukraine-fury-1-2391004 |title=Rushed law on Russian provokes Ukraine fury |date=4 July 2012 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents fear adoption of Russian as a minority language could spread rapidly, challenging Ukrainian and causing splits between eastern and western Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/98ab721e-c5eb-11e1-a3d5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1zgBJy1GX Language law triggers violence in Ukraine], [[Financial Times]] (4 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In practice Russian is already used widely{{specify|date=August 2012}} in official establishments in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18702759 Ukraine police clash with Kiev crowd over language law], [[BBC News]] (4 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article #27 (2nd part) it is necessary to translate Ukrainian place names into other languages using only Ukrainian [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] (the transcription of the [[Official language|state language]]).

On 9 February 2013  the authors of the 2012 language law, [[Serhiy Kivalov]] and [[Vadym Kolesnichenko]], were awarded the "[[Medal of Pushkin]]" by [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] for "great contribution to the preservation and promotion of the [[Russian language]] and [[Russian culture|culture]] abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://tsn.ua/politika/putin-nagorodiv-avtoriv-movnogo-zakonu-kivalova-ta-kolesnichenka-282799.html Регіонали удостоїлися медалі Пушкіна ''Regionals were awarded medal Pushkin''], [[TSN.ua]] (19 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill "On the principles of the state language policy"==

===Analysis===
V. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, refers to its support from various higher education bodies, scientists and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}Колесніченко B. [http://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/kolesnichenko/4fb618767dc8f/ В Київському Національному університеті ім. Тараса Шевченка підтримали необхідність прийняття законопроекту "Про засади державної мовної політики"] 18 травня 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that the bill contradicts the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], violates the [[Budget Code of Ukraine|Budget Code]], and aims to annihilate the [[Ukrainian language]]. It suffered a criticism in the conclusions of state authorities and their departments: the Main Scientific-Expert Bureau of the Ukrainian Parliament (23 May 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=41018 rada.gov.ua - Conclusions of the Main Scientific-Expert Bureau of the Ukrainian Parliament (23 May 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Parliamentary Committee on Culture and Spirituality (September 23, 2011), the Parliamentary Committee on Budget (3 November 2011), [[Ministry of Finance (Ukraine)|Ministry of Finance]] (9 September 2011), the [[Ministry of Justice (Ukraine)|Ministry of Justice]] (27 September 2011).&lt;ref name="maidan"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://maidan.org.ua/2012/07/67-instytutsij-hromadyanskoho-suspilstva-arhumentovano-zaklykaly-deputativ-ne-holosuvaty-za-pryjnyattya-zakonoproektu-pro-zasady-derzhavnoji-movnoji-polityky/ 67 institutions of public society reasonably urged deputies not to vote for adoption of the Bill on the principles of the state language policy]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also failed to obtain the support of the specialized institutions of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]: the Linguistics Institute, the Institute of the Ukrainian Language, the Institute of political and ethno-national researches, the Shevchenko Institute of Literature, the Institute of State and Law, the Ukrainian linguistic-informational Fund, the Philology Institute of [[Kiev University]], and the Academy of Sciences of the High School of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="maidan"/&gt;

===Opinion adopted by the Venice Commission===
In December 2011 the [[Venice Commission]] of the Council of Europe issued its Opinion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2011)047-e Opinion no.651/2011, European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), 19 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; on the draft law. According to [[Ukrayinska Pravda]], the [[Venice Commission]] did not notice in the draft law of Kolesnichenko any guarantees of the protection of the [[Ukrainian language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2011/12/17/6845714/ Венеціанська комісія не побачила у мовному законопроекті гарантій захисту української]&lt;/ref&gt; and later came to a decision that the bill is another "pre-election tool" for the [[Party of Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2011/12/20/6851586/ Венеціанська комісія звинуватила "регіоналів" у передвиборчих провокаціях]{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; V. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, claimed the 2011 analysis of the Venice Commission was "generally supportive".&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} В. Колесниченко [http://www.r-u.org.ua/akt/6409-news.html «Венецианская комиссия» впервые одобрила проект закона Украины «Об основах государственной языковой политики» (текст выводов)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703045852/http://www.r-u.org.ua/akt/6409-news.html |date=3 July 2012 }} [[Russian-speaking Ukraine]] 2011{{unreliable source?|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opponents noted that the analysis contained strong criticism, specifically about the failure to protect the role of Ukrainian as the State language.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.unian.ua/politics/584073-u-zakoni-pro-movnu-politiku-ne-garantovaniy-zahist-ukrajinskoji-movi.html unian.ua : У законі про мовну політику не гарантований захист української мови]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://glavcom.ua/articles/5666.html Скандальний висновок Венеціанської комісії щодо мови. Документ (glavcom.ua)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its Opinion, the [[Venice Commission]] stated, among other theses:

"It seems questionable to the Venice Commission that the parallel use of the State language and regional and minority languages, and in practice mostly the Russian language in large spheres of public life and not only on a local level, can still be considered to be in compliance with article 10 of the Constitution, as clarified by the Constitutional Court."

"the present draft does no longer formally focus on the Russian language, as the references to this language are almost always replaced by a reference to "the regional or minority language". This equalization of the treatment of the Russian language to the treatment of the regional or minority languages appears to be beneficial, in certain areas of public life, to other regional or minority languages" (Para. 64)

"…the question remains whether... there are sufficient guarantees, in the current Draft Law, for the consolidation of the Ukrainian language as the sole State language, and of the role it has to play in the Ukrainian multilinguistic society. The Venice Commission can only reiterate its call... for a fair balance between the protection of the rights of minorities, on the one hand, and the preservation of the State language as a tool for integration within society, on the other hand." (Para. 66)

"The recognition of linguistic freedom in the media and in the cultural area could moreover, due to market considerations, result in the dominance of the Russian language."

The Opinion also made other observations and proposals of change. It was of the view that "further improvements, increased guarantees and more substantial changes to the normative content of the Draft should be introduced..."

===Fight in parliament===
Prior to 24 May 2012 there were rumours that a revision of the legislation on languages would take place in parliament (the [[Verkhovna Rada]]) and that the Secretary of National Security and Defense would attend the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965229/ КЛЮЄВ ПРИЇХАВ ДО РАДИ ЛАМАТИ ДЕПУТАТІВ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some 1,000 protesters gathered just outside the [[Verkhovna Rada building]] setting up another tent city.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965236/ Під Радою ставитимуть намети]&lt;/ref&gt; State law enforcement warned the protesters not to establish a tent city.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965250/ Міліція попередила, що краще не ставити намети під Радою]&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters were yelling in Ukrainian "Get busy with work, not a tongue" (implying the law draft on languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} {{YouTube|-ef149IYT1M|Video footage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some posters carried the slogan: "The problem is in poverty, not in language".&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} {{YouTube|VrzdsndKTOc|Video footage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the evening session the parliamentary opposition in the Verkhovna Rada ([[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko|BYuT]] and Our Ukraine) blocked the main tribune in parliament as some representatives from the [[Party of Regions]] surrounded the [[presidium]]. The speaker was forced to announce a break in the session. After the break Member of Parliament [[Vyacheslav Kyrylenko]] read a statement of the united opposition not to conduct any hearings regarding language issues. After the law draft #10154 "On the state language of Ukraine" was not adopted onto the daily agenda, Kyrylenko withdrew his draft #9059 "Prohibition of narrowing the sphere of use of Ukrainian language" from a revision, while Kolesnichenko gave a presentation on his draft #9073. The head of the Committee On Issues of Culture and Spirituality [[Volodymyr Yavorivsky]] disclosed the decision of the committee to reject the bill #9073 as it was the decision of the committee's majority. He pointed to the fact that the law draft in fact will introduce a bilingual situation in number of regions. However, after a review the bill was supported by the parliamentary majority which showed its support in adopting two state languages: Ukrainian and Russian. The parliamentary minority and the deputy group "Reforms for the Future" stayed in opposition to the bill. Parliament speaker [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] was forced to hastily close&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965233/ ЛИТВИН ЗАКРИВ ЗАСІДАННЯ РАДИ НА ПІВСЛОВІ]&lt;/ref&gt; the session as further discussion descended into another scandalous fight&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965251/ Єфремов упевнений, що Колесніченко потрапив в історію]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving some members of parliament injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965235/ БЮТІВЦЯ ПОБИЛИ ДО КРОВІ.

The [[Party of Regions]] released a statement to the press where it accused the opposition of denying the adaptation of a bill that protects some constitutional rights of millions of citizens of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965255/ "Регіони" запевняють, що "шабаш" не завадить їм "захистити мову"]&lt;/ref&gt; PoR leader in parliament Yefremov promised to revisit the issue once everything is stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965246/ Лідер "Регіоналів" обіцяє, що мовою ще займуться]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The bill was to come into force only after it was signed by [[President of Ukraine|Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|Chairman of Parliament]].&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012/&gt; But the Chairman of Parliament [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] tendered his resignation on 4 July 2012.&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012/&gt; However, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] twice held votes of confidence in the speaker, and did not accept his resignation.&lt;ref name=Lytsign/&gt; On 31 July Lytvyn signed the law.&lt;ref name=Lytsign&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/language-law-comes-into-force-in-ukraine-311340.html Language law comes into force in Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (10 August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed by President Yanukovych on 8 August 2012.&lt;ref name=Pessignedit&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/24960.html Президент подписал Закон и поручил Правительству создать рабочую группу] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121222070356/www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/24960.html |date=22 December 2012 }} 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into force on 10 August 2012.&lt;ref name=Lsaid24812/&gt; Since then various Ukrainian cities and regions have declared Russian a regional language in their jurisdictions,&lt;ref name=UkrCRdecRusregL&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/hot/language-bill/ See here for further information and news] by [[Kyiv Post]]&lt;/ref&gt; these being the municipalities of [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Kherson]], [[Mykolaiv]], [[Zaporizhia]], [[Sevastopol]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Luhansk]] and [[Krasnyi Luch|Krasny Luch]]; and the [[Oblasts of Ukraine|Oblasts]] of [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa]], [[Zaporizhia Oblast|Zaporizhia]], [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]].&lt;ref name="NewUklang2892012"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/romanian-becomes-regional-language-in-bila-tserkva-in-zakarpattia-region-313373.html |title=Romanian becomes regional language in Bila Tserkva in Zakarpattia region |date=2012-09-24 |work=Kyiv Post |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] has been made a regional language in the town of [[Berehove]] in [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] in the village of [[Tarasivtsi]] ([[Chernivtsi Oblast]]),&lt;ref name=NewUklang2892012/&gt; and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in the village of [[Rakhiv Raion|Bila Tserkva]]; also in Zakarpattia Oblast.&lt;ref name=NewUklang2892012/&gt; These languages will now be used in city/Oblast administrative office work and documents.&lt;ref name=NewUklang2892012/&gt; As of September 2012 there were no plans for such bilingualism in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/popov-no-bilingualism-in-kyiv-313178.html |title=Popov: No bilingualism in Kyiv |date=2012-09-19 |work=Kyiv Post |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chairmen of the Supreme Council of Crimea]] [[Volodomyr Konstantinov]] stated in March 2013 that the August 2012 law had changed nothing in [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/03/27/6986562/ "Мовний" закон Колесніченка-Ківалова нічого не дав Криму ''"Language" law Kolesnichenko-Kivalov gave Crimea nothing''], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (27 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2014, the second day after the flight of [[Viktor Yanukovich]], while in a parliamentary session, a deputy from the "[[Batkivshchina]]" party, [[Vyacheslav Kyrylenko]], moved to include in the agenda a bill to repeal the 2012 law "On the principles of the state language policy". The motion was carried with 86% of the votes in favour—232 deputies in favour vs 37 opposed against the required minimum of 226 of 334 votes. The bill was included in the agenda, immediately put to a vote with no debate and approved with the same 232 voting in favour. The bill would have made Ukrainian the sole state language at all levels.&lt;ref name=lenta223&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/23/language/ |title=На Украине отменили закон о региональном статусе русского языка |publisher=Lenta.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCRLLout&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26312008 |title=Ukraine: Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov named interim president |date=2014-02-23 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, all the minority languages (including Russian) remain explicitly protected under article 10 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Ukrainian Constitution]]. The repeal would also bring back into force the previous law on languages, which was in place in Ukraine for 23 years before July 2012 and was regulating the use of the minority languages. According to Uilleam Blacker, the repeal bill contained no specific threat to the Russian language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/uilleam-blacker/no-real-threat-to-ukraine%E2%80%99s-russian-speakers-language-law-ban No real threat to Ukraine's Russian speakers], Uilleam Blacker, 4 March 2014, opendemocracy.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euromaidanpr.com/2014/05/25/ukrainian-vs-russian-the-ban-that-never-was/ Ukrainian Vs Russian: The Ban That Never Was]&lt;/ref&gt;

However the move to repeal the 2012 law "On the principles of the state language policy" provoked negative reactions in [[Crimea]] and in some regions of [[Southern Ukraine|Southern]] and [[Eastern Ukraine]]. It became one of the topics of the protests against the new government approved by the parliament after the flight of [[Viktor Yanukovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.newsru.com/world/26feb2014/ukr_russian.html Новости NEWSru.com :: На Украине протестуют против начатой новыми властями борьбы с русским языком&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the next major development was the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]].

Passage of the repeal bill was met with regret by the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.dw.de/%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%8B-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB-%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D1%8E%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2/a-17470453?maca=rus-rss-ru-all-1126-xml-mrss Совет Европы призвал Киев соблюдать права нацменьшинств] [[Deutsche Welle]]&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities expressed concern over possible further unrest.

'''Learning development''' describes work with students and staff to develop academic practices, with a main focus on students developing academic practices in [[higher education]]. Learning developers are [[Faculty (academic staff)|academic professionals]] who: teach, advise and facilitate students to develop their academic practices; create academic development learning resources; and reflect on their own academic practices through a [[community of practice]].

Hilsdon (2011: 14) defines learning development as,
"a complex set of multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary academic roles and functions, involving teaching, tutoring, research, and the design and production of learning materials, as well as involvement in staff development, policy-making and other consultative activities."&lt;ref name="hilsdon1"&gt;Hilsdon, J. (2011). What is Learning Development? In P. Hartley, J. Hilsdon, C. Keenan, S. Sinfield &amp; M. Verity, eds. ''Learning Development in Higher Education''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 13-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning development is a term used mainly within UK and Australian academia, with some overlap with [[academic advising]] in the [[Higher education in the United States|USA]]. The learning development movement in the UK has aligned itself closely with the UK Educational Development movement&lt;ref name="gosling1"&gt;Gosling, D. (2008) ''Educational Development in the United Kingdom''. Heads of Educational Development Group. Available at: http://www.hedg.ac.uk/documents/HEDG_Report_final.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [Accessed 20 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; in light of its developmental work with academic staff. However, the primary objective of learning development remains the development of student learning.

==History==

The learning development movement began with the recognition of a new direction of practice emerging by founding and early members of an email discussion forum Community in 2002, which was transferred to the documented [[JISCMail]] Listserv Community LDHEN in 2003.&lt;ref name="ald_ldhenpage"&gt;Association for Learning Development in Higher Education (2012) Learning Development in Higher Education Network (LDHEN) [accessed 16/06/13]. Available from http://www.aldinhe.ac.uk/ldhen.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Early members were all involved in the provision of study skills support, but recognised the limitations of a purely study-skills approach.&lt;ref name="posLeaStreet"&gt;Possibly influenced by understandings reflected in Lea, M. &amp; Street, B. (1998) Student Writing in Higher Education: An Academic Literacies Approach, ''Studies in Higher Education'', 29(6), pp. 157-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005 onward, the establishment of the LearnHigher [[Higher Education Funding Council for England#CELT|CETL (Centre of Excellence in Teaching and Learning)]] contributed greatly to the volume of [[Open access|publicly available]] learning development resources. The LearnHigher CELT was funded by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|Higher Education Funding Council]] and comprised a consortium of teams from 16 universities, led by [[Liverpool Hope University]] to develop learning resources in 20 areas of study. LearnHigher aimed to develop and maintain a bank of open access materials for self-access by students. The CETL later referred to their work as learning development.
&lt;!-- which universities? what areas?--&gt;
&lt;!-- This history of learning development is incomplete--&gt;

The LDHEN later restructured and formed the Association of Learning Development in Higher Education (ALDinHE), who published the first [[Academic journal|peer reviewed journal]] dedicated to learning development, ''The Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education''. This organisation have also organised a themed national [[Academic conference|conference]] since 2003 and annually since 2005, contributing greatly to the development of learning development as distinct area of practice. The Staff and Educational Development Association (SEDA)have also provided space for ideas in learning development to develop, as have other student-focused organisations and conferences.
&lt;!-- Any other initiatives and organisations who have contributed to the development of this movement should be added --&gt;

Some observers may identify strong learning development themes in conferences in allied areas, such as Writing Development (e.g. ''Writing Development in Higher Education (WDHE)'' conferences and ''[[Eataw|EATAW]]''), Mathematics Support (e.g. the ''[http://www.sigma-network.ac.uk/ Sigma Network]'' and the [[Maths, Stats &amp; OR Network|CETL-MSOR]] conferences) or even Educational Development (e.g. ''[http://www.seda.ac.uk/ SEDA]''). Likewise, the [[Higher Education Academy|HEA's]] ''What Works?'' conferences and the ''Improving Student Learning'' annual symposiums have strongly tangential themes. However, these organisations/conferences rarely use the term ''learning development'' to describe their activities.

==Allied areas of practice==

===Writing development===
'''Writing development''' is administratively subsumed within learning development at a number of UK universities, where practices may be merged locally. However, writing development has rich tradition of research and practice, established before learning development and representing a distinct field.
&lt;!-- This is poorly written. Revision welcome --&gt;

===Information literacy===
[[Information literacy]] is sometimes seen as learning development, but also has its own distinct body of practice and literature.

According to the [[SCONUL]] Working Group on Information Literacy (2011: 3),&lt;ref name="sconul1"&gt;SCONUL Working Group on Information Literacy (2011) ''The SCONUL Seven Pillars of information literacy: Core model for higher education''. [pdf] Available at: http://www.sconul.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/coremodel.pdf [Accessed 20 June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; Information Literacy is, "an umbrella term which encompasses concepts such as digital, visual and media literacies, academic literacy, information handling, information skills, data curation and data management."

SCONUL's seven pillars of information literacy are:&lt;ref name=sconul1 /&gt;
* Identify: Able to identify a personal need for information
* Scope: Can assess current knowledge and identify gaps
* Plan: Can construct strategies for locating information and data
* Gather: Can locate and access the information and data they need
* Evaluate: Can review the research process and compare and evaluate information and data
* Manage: Can organise information professionally and ethically
* Present: Can apply the knowledge gained: presenting the results of their research, synthesising new and old information and data to create new knowledge and disseminating it in a variety of ways

===Mathematics support===
Learning development in numeracy, mathematics and statistics, commonly referred to as "mathematics support",&lt;ref&gt;MacGillivray, H. and Croft, A.C. (2011) Understanding evaluation of learning support in mathematics and statistics, ''International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology'', 42(2), pp. 189–212.&lt;/ref&gt; works with students and staff to develop mathematical practice in the disciplines. Mathematics Support ranges from basic adult numeracy&lt;ref&gt;Coben, D., Colwell, D., Macrae, S., Boaler, J., Brown, M. and Rhodes, V. (2003) ''Adult numeracy: Review of research and related literature''. London: National Research and Development Centre for Adult Literacy and Numeracy.&lt;/ref&gt; to advanced support for second and third year undergraduate mathematics students.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, A. C., and Grove, M. (2006) Mathematics Support: Support for the specialist mathematician and the more able student, ''MSOR Connections'', 6(2), pp. 39-43.&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is commonly provided via a mathematics (learning) support centre.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, D.A., Croft, A.C. and Halpin, M. (2003) ''Good practice in the provision of mathematics support centres''. 2nd edn. Birmingham: LTSN Maths, Stats and OR Network. Available at: http://newukmlsc.lboro.ac.uk/resources/Good%20Practice%20Guide/goodpractice2E.pdf [Accessed: 20 June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK mathematics support movement is seen to have begun in 1993 with a conference held at the University of Luton and was influenced by the Minnesota model of developmental mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, I. (1993) ''The Minnesota Model of Developmental Maths''. Available at: http://www.sigma-cetl.ac.uk/index.php?action=download_resource&amp;id=322&amp;module=resourcesmodule&amp;src=%40random4b8fd8fe5704c [Accessed 20 June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; and may be considered as a sub-movement, separate and tangential to learning development.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, P. C. (2013) Promoting Learning Development as an Academic Discipline, ''Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education'', 5, available at: http://www.aldinhe.ac.uk/ojs/index.php?journal=jldhe&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=146 [Accessed 20 June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent survey of mathematics support in the UK identified 88 out of 103 responding higher education institutions offering some form of mathematics support.&lt;ref&gt;Perkin, G., Lawson, D. A. &amp; Croft, A. C. (2012) ''Mathematics learning support in UK Higher Education: the extent of provision in 2012''. [pdf] Birmingham: National HE STEM Programme. Available at: http://www.sigma-network.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/MathematicsLearningSupportProvision2012.pdf [Accessed 21 June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics support centres and services are also present in Australia&lt;ref&gt;MacGillivray, H. (2008) ''Learning Support in Mathematics and Statistics in Australian Universities: A Guide for the University Sector''. Sydney: Australian Learning and Teaching Council.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, O., O’Donoghue, J. and Johnson, P. (2008) ''An Audit of Mathematical Support Provisions in Irish Third Level Institutes''. Limerick: CEMTL, University of Limerick.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics support for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students is often provided via a statistics advisory service.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. and Gadsden, R. (2006) Sigma SAS rescuing projects, In ''CETL MSOR Conference 2006'', Loughborough University (ed. D. Green), pp. 149-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of learning development==

Many learning developers resist categorising their practice into distinct subjects. For example, the use of statistics, encouraged by learning development, is cross-disciplinary, however, resources such as study guides are often categorised into distinct subjects. The following areas of learning development are taken from the LearnHigher website
* [[Academic writing]] refers to the practice of writing in the style used in academic documents, such as academic books, journal articles and conference papers. It tends to be formal and objective in tone but it should also be clear and concise.
* Assessment
* Business and commercial awareness
* [[Critical thinking]] and reflection. According to Ennis (n.d.),&lt;ref&gt;Ennis, R. H. (no date) ''Critical thinking definition and Conceptualization''. Available at: http://faculty.ed.uiuc.edu/rhennis/ConceptCT.html [Accessed 21 June 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; critical thinking involves: being as clear as possible; focusing on a single question or issue; trying to take into account the whole problem; considering all relevant alternatives; trying to be well-informed; seeking as much precision as possible; being aware of your biases and assumptions; being open-minded and taking a position if you have enough basis, or otherwise withholding judgment.

When critical thinking is applied to external sources it is called critical analysis. Critical analysis is sometimes seen as the 'holy grail' of academic writing or a 'rite of passage' for students to become accepted members of their academic community of practice. There are several different approaches to critical analysis: critically analysing a single source using a premise, argument, conclusion, application approach; moving from descriptive writing to analytical writing to evaluative writing; comparing and contrasting two different opinions using a discursive argumentation format; moving from summarising, to making simple inferences, to critiquing according to objective criteria and bringing in a personal interpretation; and using a questioning approach (who, what, where, why, etc.) to brainstorm an issue.
* [[Research methods|Doing research]] involves identifying a research aim or question, planning, deciding on a theoretical framework, deciding on a method, obtaining information (primary or secondary data or a combination of the two), describing and analysing the data obtained and drawing conclusions.
* Group work
* Information literacy
* Listening and interpersonal skills
* Note making
* Numeracy, mathematics and statistics
* Oral communication
* Reading
* [[Citation|Referencing]] is the process of properly attributing secondary material to the correct authors. It commonly involves citing sources and creating a reference list at the end of a document. Failure to reference correctly can lead to [[plagiarism]].
* Report writing is similar to academic writing but it relates to more structured documents, such as technical reports and dissertations. These documents normally contain chapters which may be divided into sections or subsections, etc. There is often a specific genre for writing individual chapters within a report.
* Time management

The learning development movement emphasises learner development from any prior level of ability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} This view is generally opposed to [[study skills]] that represent [[remedial education]] - aiming to bring weaker students up to a set standard.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} However, accepting that support may be the most developmental approach in some circumstances, study skills remain a feature of learning development..{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Provision for strongly performing students and the extent to which a broader base of students should engage with learning development are both currently debated issues..{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
&lt;!-- an introduction to the developmental model should go here --&gt;

The characteristics of embedded provision, one-to-one provision and resource provision are each underpinned by the developmental model adopted by learning development.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Embedding===
Teaching with learning objectives is also an effective way of integrating 'learning development' into the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Wingate, U. (2006). Doing away with ‘study skills’. ''Teaching in Higher Education'', 11(4), 457-469.&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic is usually referred to as embedding.

===One-to-one provision===
Learning development practices have remained committed to provision one-to-one with academic staff.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. (2010) The Case for One-to-One Academic Advice for Students. Hartley, P., Hilsdon, J., Sinfield, S., Keenan, C., &amp; Verity, M. (Eds.). (2010). "Learning development in higher education". Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provision of resources===

==Influences==
[[Research-informed teaching|Research-informed practice]] in learning development has drawn on various [[Discipline (academia)|traditions of research]]. Some key examples are provided below.

===Academic literacies===

===Transitions into higher education===

===The student experience===

===Student attainment===

===Assessment criteria===

Lea and Street&lt;ref&gt;Lea, M. &amp; Street, B. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; have demonstrated that university staff in various disciplines have varying expectations of students in [[Educational assessment|assignments]]. Rust ''et al'' advocate explicating assessment criteria to augment success not only in the short term, but also to better facilitate learning for the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Rust, P. Price, M. &amp; O’Donovan, B. (2003) Improving students' learning by developing their understanding of assessment criteria and processes. ''Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education'', 28(2), pp147-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick summarise converging literature suggesting that internal feedback and student self-regulation are only possible with a good conception of the criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, D. J. &amp; Macfarlane-Dick, D. (2006) Formative assessment and self-regulated learning: a model and seven principles of good feedback practice. ''Studies in Higher Education'', 31(2), pp199-218. {{cite web |url=http://www.mmiweb.org.uk/hull/site/pt/downloads/nicol_formass.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714195552/http://www.mmiweb.org.uk/hull/site/pt/downloads/nicol_formass.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has prompted learning developers to work centrally to explicate or negotiate assessment criteria. This ranges from resources providing disciplinary definitions of keywords, to one-to-one practice to negotiate student understandings of assessment criteria with reference to assignment drafts.

The '''Lebeha Drumming Center''' was established in 2002 by Jabbar Lambey and Dorothy Pettersen, in [[Hopkins, Belize]].  Hopkins is a small coastal Garifuna community in the Stann Creek District of southern Belize.  The center exists with the goals of keeping [[Garifuna music]] alive, passing traditional music along to young people in the community, and sharing music with visitors to Hopkins.  The center’s focus is on traditional percussion music, though guitars have been donated and are also played.  

The young people who play and take lessons at the drumming center perform regularly, and in 2006, they recorded a CD entitled ''Traditional Garifuna Music'' played by Youth from Hopkins, Belize, published by [[Innova Recordings]].  The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Traditional Music category.

== Garifuna instruments ==
Traditional Garifuna drums, or ''garaones'', are handmade of mahogany wood and deer hide.  The drumhead is secured to the wooden body with cordage that is laced around the head and attached through holes at the bottom of the drum.  These are tension drums; they are tuned by way of wooden pegs attached to the cordage that can be wound to tighten or loosen the drumhead.  Additionally, these drums often have a thin wire or piece of fishing line stretched across the head in order to create a buzzing sound, an aesthetic which is common in much Central and West African music, and has been preserved in Garifuna music.  The drums at Lebeha are crafted by master drum-maker Austin Rodriguez, whose workshop is located in Dangriga, Belize.

There are two main types of drums used in Garifuna music: ''Primero'' and ''Segunda''.  The primera (or ''lanigi'', “heart-drum”, in Garifuna) is the higher-pitched of the two, and serves to accent dancers’ movements.  The segunda, or ''lufarugu'' (“shadow-drum”), which provides the beat for dancers.  Sometimes a third drum, the tercera, or luruwahn (“third drum”) is the lowest-pitched of the three and serves as a bass drum.  The presence of the tercera allows the Segunda to play more syncopated rhythms.

== Traditional Garifuna music ==
[[Punta]] is a traditional Belizean music and dance, often performed during festivals.  This is the genre that has influenced the evolution of the popular music style punta rock.  
Paranda refers to both a Garifuna rhythm, and a musical genre that features Garifuna drumming, guitar, and singing.  Lyrics in this genre are often nostalgic, and paranda is usually performed by men.  One can hear the Latin/Spanish influence in this style of music.

== Popular Garifuna music ==
Belize's most well-known popular musical style is [[Punta rock]], a style of dance music that combines traditional Garifuna rhythms with western popular music elements, including electric and bass guitars and  keyboard.

[[File:MOOC poster mathplourde.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Poster, entitled "MOOC, every letter is negotiable", exploring the meaning of the words "Massive Open Online Course"]]
A '''massive open online course''' ('''MOOC''' {{IPAc-en|m|uː|k}}) is an [[online course]] aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the [[World Wide Web|web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael |year=2016 |title=Higher education and the digital revolution: About MOOCs, SPOCs, social media, and the Cookie Monster |journal=Business Horizons |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=441–50 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2016.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and [[problem set]]s, many MOOCs provide [[interactive course]]s with user forums to support community interactions among students, professors, and [[teaching assistant]]s (TAs) as well as immediate feedback to quick quizzes and assignments. MOOCs are a recent and widely researched development in [[distance education]] which were first introduced in 2006 and emerged as a popular mode of learning in 2012.&lt;ref name=pappano/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes030613&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|title=Universities Abroad Join Partnerships on the Web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/education/universities-abroad-join-mooc-course-projects.html|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early MOOCs often emphasized open-access features, such as [[Open content|open licensing]] of content, structure and learning goals, to promote the reuse and remixing of resources.  Some later MOOCs use closed licenses for their course materials while maintaining free access for students.&lt;ref name="MOOC Misnomer"&gt;Wiley, David.

== History ==
[[File:What is a MOOC.ogv|thumb|What is a MOOC?, December 2010]]

=== Precursors ===
{{main|Distance learning}}

Before the [[Digital Age]], [[distance learning]] appeared in the form of [[correspondence courses]] in the 1890s–1920s and later radio and television broadcast of courses and early forms of [[e-learning]]. Typically fewer than five percent of the students would complete a course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saettler|first=L. Paul |year=1968 |title=A History of Instructional Technology |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AN47AAAAIAAJ}}|isbn=0070544107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000s saw changes in [[E-learning|online, or e-learning]] and distance education, with increasing online presence, open learning opportunities, and the development of MOOCs.&lt;ref name="blogs.cetis.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cetis.org.uk/cetisli/2015/05/11/moocs-and-open-education-timeline-updated/|title=MOOCs and Open Education Timeline (updated 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 audiences for the most popular college courses such as "Justice" with [[Michael J. Sandel]] and "Human Anatomy" with [[Marian Diamond]] were reaching millions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18opentop10-t.html"What They're Watching"],"The New York Times",03/07/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The first MOOCs emerged from the [[open educational resources]] (OER) movement, and from work by researchers who pointed out that class size and learning outcomes had no established connection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/does-class-size-matter&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''MOOC'' was coined in 2008 by Dave Cormier of the [[University of Prince Edward Island]] in response to a course called ''Connectivism and Connective Knowledge'' (also known as ''CCK08''). CCK08, which was led by [[George Siemens]] of [[Athabasca University]] and [[Stephen Downes]] of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], consisted of 25 tuition-paying students in [[continuing education|Extended Education]] at the [[University of Manitoba]], as well as over 2200 online students from the general public who paid nothing.&lt;ref name="THE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parr|first=Chris|title=Mooc creators criticise courses’ lack of creativity|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/mooc-creators-criticise-courses-lack-of-creativity/2008180.article|accessdate=1 June 2015|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All course content was available through [[RSS]] feeds, and online students could participate through collaborative tools, including blog posts, threaded discussions in [[Moodle]], and [[Second Life]] meetings.&lt;ref name="downes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sites.google.com/site/themoocguide/3-cck08---the-distributed-course | title=CCK08 - The Distributed Course | work=The MOOC Guide | year=2008 | accessdate=11 September 2013 | author=Downes, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAVwQ7RJWqg | title=Attention les MOOC!?!

Other cMOOCs were then developed; for example, Jim Groom from The [[University of Mary Washington]] and Michael Branson Smith of [[York College, City University of New York]] hosted MOOCs through several universities starting with 2011's 'Digital Storytelling' (ds106) MOOC.&lt;ref name="GROOM"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/04/24/open-course-digital-storytelling-enjoys-modest-success | title=Proto-MOOC Stays the Course | publisher=Inside Higher Ed | date=24 April 2012 | accessdate=29 April 2015 | author=Kolowich, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOOCs from private, non-profit institutions&lt;!-- public schools and for-profits did not? --&gt; emphasized prominent faculty members and expanded existing distance learning offerings (e.g., podcasts) into free and open online courses.&lt;ref&gt;The College of St. Scholastica, "[http://go.css.edu/learn Massive Open Online Courses]", (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the development of these open courses, other E-learning platforms emerged — such as [[Khan Academy]], [[Peer-to-Peer University]] (P2PU), [[Udemy]], and [[ALISON (company)|ALISON]] — which are viewed as similar to MOOCs and work outside the university system or emphasize individual self-paced lessons.&lt;ref name="CETIS78"&gt;Yuan, Li, and Stephen Powell.

=== cMOOCs and xMOOCs ===

[[File:Timeline of MOOC and open education development with organisational efforts in the areas.png|thumb|left || upright=1.6|MOOCs and Open Education Timeline (updated 2015 version)&lt;ref name="blogs.cetis.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openeducationeuropa.eu/en/article/Innovation-entrepreneurship-and-education-In-Depth-41-3?paper=169497|title=Partnership Model for Entrepreneurial Innovation in Open Online Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As MOOCs developed with time, multiple conceptions of the platform seem to have emerged. Mostly two different types can be differentiated: those that emphasize a connectivist philosophy, and those that resemble more traditional courses. To distinguish the two, several early adopters of the platform proposed the terms "cMOOC" and "xMOOC".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siemens|first=George |url=http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2012/07/25/moocs-are-really-a-platform/ |title=MOOCs are really a platform |publisher=Elearnspace |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prpić|first1=John|last2=Melton|first2=James|last3=Taeihagh|first3=Araz|last4=Anderson|first4=Terry|title=MOOCs and crowdsourcing: Massive courses and massive resources|journal=First Monday|date=16 December 2015|volume=20|issue=12|doi=10.5210/fm.v20i12.6143|arxiv=1702.05002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

cMOOCs are based on principles from [[Connectivism|connectivist pedagogy]] indicating that material should be ''aggregated'' (rather than pre-selected), ''[[Remix#Broader context|remixable]]'', ''re-purposable'', and ''feeding forward'' (i.e. evolving materials should be targeted at future learning).&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Stephen [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-downes/connectivism-and-connecti_b_804653.html "'Connectivism' and Connective Knowledge"], Huffpost Education, 5 January 2011, accessed 27 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kop, Rita [http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/882 "The challenges to connectivist learning on open online networks: Learning experiences during a massive open online course"], International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, Volume 12, Number 3, 2011, accessed 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Frances [http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/902/1664 "Connectivism: Its Place in Theory-Informed Research and Innovation in Technology-Enabled Learning"], International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, Volume 12, Number 3, 2011, accessed 31 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Stephen. [http://it.coe.uga.edu/itforum/paper92/paper92.html "Learning networks and connective knowledge"], Instructional Technology Forum, 2006, accessed 31 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  cMOOC instructional design approaches attempt to connect learners to each other to answer questions or collaborate on joint projects. This may include emphasizing collaborative development of the MOOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|VMfipxhT_Co|title=George Siemens on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ravenscroft of the London Metropolitan University claimed that connectivist MOOCs better support collaborative dialogue and knowledge building.&lt;ref name="Ravenscroft"&gt;Dialogue and Connectivism: A New Approach to Understanding and Promoting Dialogue-Rich Networked Learning [http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/934] Andrew Ravenscroft International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning Vol. 12.3 March – 2011, Learning Technology Research Institute (LTRI), London Metropolitan University, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mak Williams Mackness"&gt;S.F.

xMOOCs have a much more traditional course structure. They are characterized by a specified aim of completing the course obtaining certain knowledge certification of the subject matter. They are presented typically with a clearly specified syllabus of recorded lectures and self-test problems. However, some providers require paid subscriptions for acquiring graded materials and certificates. They employ elements of the original MOOC, but are, in some effect, branded IT platforms that offer content distribution partnerships to institutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   The instructor is the expert provider of knowledge, and student interactions are usually limited to asking for assistance and advising each other on difficult points.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2012 became "the year of the MOOC" as several well-financed providers, associated with top universities, emerged, including [[Coursera]], [[Udacity]], and [[edX]].&lt;ref name=pappano&gt;{{cite news|last=Pappano|first=Laura|title=The Year of the MOOC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gartner Hype Cycle.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Dennis Yang, President of MOOC provider [[Udemy]] suggested in 2013 that MOOCs were in the midst of a [[hype cycle]], with expectations undergoing a wild swing.&lt;ref name="MOOCd out"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yang|first=Dennis|title=Are We MOOC'd Out?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-yang/post_4496_b_2877799.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=5 April 2013|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

During a presentation at SXSWedu in early 2013, Instructure CEO Josh Coates suggested that MOOCs are in the midst of a hype cycle, with expectations undergoing wild swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zH7gzPU5Moo|title=SXSWedu 2013 - MOOCS: Hype or Hope?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Yang, President of MOOC provider Udemy, later made the point in an article for the ''[[Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Yang|first = Dennis|title = Are We MOOC'd Out?|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-yang/post_4496_b_2877799.html|work = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities scrambled to join in the "next big thing", as did more established [[online education]] service providers such as [[Blackboard Inc]], in what has been called a "stampede." Dozens of universities in Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia have announced partnerships with the large American MOOC providers.&lt;ref name=NYT022013/&gt;&lt;ref name="moocyear"&gt;Laura Pappano. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?pagewanted=1 The Year of the MOOC – The New York Times]. 2 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2013, questions emerged about whether academia was "MOOC'd out."&lt;ref name="MOOCd out"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FT032013&gt;{{cite news|last=Skapinker|first=Michael|title=Open web courses are massively overhyped|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/84f6cd3e-8a50-11e2-bf79-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PcHimOzr|accessdate=5 April 2013|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was later confirmed in continuing analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-mooc-fades-in-3-charts/55701 The MOOC Hype Fades] Chronicle of Higher Education. Retrieved March 6, 2015."&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry has an unusual structure, consisting of linked groups including MOOC providers, the larger non-profit sector, universities, related companies and [[venture capitalist]]s. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' lists the major providers as the non-profits Khan Academy and edX, and the for-profits Udacity and Coursera.&lt;ref name="Major players"&gt;{{cite web|title = Major Players in the MOOC Universe|url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-Major-Players-in-the-MOOC/138817/#id=overview|work = chronicle.com|accessdate = 29 April 2013|date = 29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger non-profit organizations include the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[American Council on Education]]. University pioneers include [[Stanford]], [[Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[University of California at Berkeley]], and [[San Jose State University]].&lt;ref name="Major players"/&gt; Related companies investing in MOOCs include [[Google]] and educational publisher [[Pearson PLC]]. Venture capitalists include [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], [[New Enterprise Associates]] and [[Andreessen Horowitz]].&lt;ref name="Major players"/&gt;

In the fall of 2011 Stanford University launched three courses.&lt;ref name="NYT71712"&gt;{{cite news |title = Top universities test the online appeal of free|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/education/top-universities-test-the-online-appeal-of-free.html|accessdate = 18 July 2012|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = 17 July 2012|author = Richard Pérez-Peña}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of those courses was ''Introduction Into AI'', launched by [[Sebastian Thrun]] and [[Peter Norvig]]. Enrollment quickly reached 160,000 students. The announcement was followed within weeks by the launch of two more MOOCs, by [[Andrew Ng]] and [[Jennifer Widom]]. Following the publicity and high enrollment numbers of these courses, Thrun started a company he named Udacity and [[Daphne Koller]] and Andrew Ng launched Coursera. Coursera subsequently announced university partnerships with University of Pennsylvania, [[Princeton University]], [[Stanford University]] and [[The University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Kow|first1 = Petrina|title = Speak To Influence: Perform Powerfully at Work|url = https://twofold.asia/courses/personal-development/communication/speak-to-influence-perform-powerfully-at-work|accessdate = 2 May 2015|publisher = twofold.asia}}{{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Udacity launched its first MOOCs-for-credit, in collaboration with San Jose State University. In May 2013 the company announced the first entirely MOOC-based master's degree, a collaboration between Udacity, [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], costing $7,000, a fraction of its normal tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/troyonink/2013/05/15/georgia-tech-udacity-shock-higher-ed-with-7000-degree/ |title=Georgia Tech, Udacity Shock Higher Ed With $7,000 Degree |work=Forbes |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned about the commercialization of online education, in 2012 MIT created the not-for-profit MITx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = MITx on edX (MOOCs)|url = http://odl.mit.edu/beyond-campus/mitx-edx-moocs|publisher = [[MIT]] Office of Digital Learning|accessdate = 2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural course, 6.002x, launched in March 2012. Harvard joined the group, renamed edX, that spring, and [[University of California, Berkeley]] joined in the summer. The initiative then added the [[University of Texas System]], [[Wellesley College]] and [[Georgetown University]].

In September 2013, edX announced a partnership with Google to develop MOOC.org, a site for non-[[xConsortium]] groups to build and host courses. Google will work on the core platform development with edX partners. In addition, Google and edX will collaborate on research into how students learn and how technology can transform learning and teaching. MOOC.org will adopt Google's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/alert/edx-announces-partnership-google/1115 |title=Announces Partnership with Google to Expand Open Source Platform |publisher=edX |date=10 September 2013 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese [[Tsinghua University]] MOOC platform XuetangX.com (launched Oct. 2013) uses the Open edX platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/blog/deeper-partnership-xuetangx-increase|title=A deeper partnership with XuetangX to increase quality education for Chinese students|work=edX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2013 each MOOC tended to develop its own delivery platform. EdX in April 2013 joined with Stanford University, which previously had its own platform called Class2Go, to work on [[XBlock]] SDK, a joint open-source platform. It is available to the public under the [[Affero GPL]] open source license, which requires that all improvements to the platform be publicly posted and made available under the same license.&lt;ref name=edXPressRelease&gt;{{cite web|title=edX Takes First Step toward Open Source Vision by Releasing XBlock SDK |url=https://www.edx.org/press/edx-takes-first-step-toward-open-source|work=www.edx.org|publisher=edX|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford Vice Provost John Mitchell said that the goal was to provide the "[[Linux]] of online learning."&lt;ref name="Open Source"&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Jeffrey R.|title=Stanford U. and edX Will Jointly Build Open-Source Software to Deliver MOOCs|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/stanford-u-and-edx-will-jointly-build-open-source-software-to-deliver-moocs/43301|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unlike companies such as Coursera that have developed their own platform.&lt;ref name="courserastack"&gt;{{cite web|title = What is Coursera's Stack?|url = http://www.quora.com/Coursera/What-is-Courseras-stack|publisher = Qoura|accessdate = 8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2013, EdX offered 94 courses from 29 institutions around the world. During its first 13 months of operation (ending March 2013), Coursera offered about 325 courses, with 30% in the sciences, 28% in arts and humanities, 23% in information technology, 13% in business and 6% in mathematics.&lt;ref name="SA31313" /&gt; Udacity offered 26 courses. The number of courses offered has since increased dramatically: As of January 2016, Edx offers 820 courses, Coursera offers 1580 courses and Udacity offers more than 120 courses. According to FutureLearn, the British Council's Understanding IELTS: Techniques for English Language Tests has an enrollment of over 440,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FutureLearn delivers the largest MOOC ever as more than 440,000 learners convene for English language learning|url=https://about.futurelearn.com/press-releases/futurelearn-delivers-the-largest-mooc-ever-as-nearly-400000-learners-convene-for-english-language-learning/|website=Future Learn|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of innovative courses ===
Early cMOOCs such as CCK08 and ds106 used innovative pedagogy, with distributed learning materials rather than a video-lecture format, and a focus on education and learning, and digital storytelling respectively&lt;ref name="THE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="downes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GROOM"/&gt;

Following the 2011 launch of three stanford xMOOCs, including ''Introduction Into AI'', launched by Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig&lt;ref name="NYT71712"/&gt; a number of other innovative courses have emerged. As of May 2014, more than 900 MOOCs are offered by US universities and colleges. As of February 2013 dozens of universities had affiliated with MOOCs, including many international institutions.&lt;ref name="NYT022013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Universities Abroad Join Partnerships on the Web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/education/universities-abroad-join-mooc-course-projects.html|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 February 2013|author=Tamar Lewin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHE022113&gt;{{cite news|title=Competing MOOC Providers Expand into New Territory—and Each Other's|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/competing-mooc-providers-expand-into-new-territory-and-each-others/42463|accessdate=21 February 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 February 2013|author=Steve Kolowich|format=blog by expert journalist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some organisations operate their own MOOCs – including Google's Power Search.

A range of courses have emerged; "There was a real question of whether this would work for humanities and social science", said Ng. However, psychology and philosophy courses are among Coursera's most popular. Student feedback and completion rates suggest that they are as successful as math and science courses &lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt; even though the corresponding completion rates are lower.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL"/&gt; 
 
In January 2012, University of Helsinki launched a Finnish MOOC in programming. The MOOC is used as a way to offer high-schools the opportunity to provide programming courses for their students, even if no local premises or faculty that can organize such courses exist.&lt;ref name="VihavainenMOOC2012"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/2380552.2380603| chapter = Multi-faceted support for MOOC in programming| title = Proceedings of the 13th annual conference on Information technology education - SIGITE '12| page = 171| year = 2012| last1 = Vihavainen | first1 = A. | last2 = Luukkainen | first2 = M. | last3 = Kurhila | first3 = J. | isbn = 9781450314640}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course has been offered recurringly, and the top-performing students are admitted to a BSc and MSc program in Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.&lt;ref name="VihavainenMOOC2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOOC dot Fi - Massive Open Online Courses|url=http://mooc.fi|publisher=mooc.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting on E-Learning and MOOCs, Jaakko Kurhila, Head of studies for University of Helsinki, Department of Computer Science, claimed that to date, there has been over 8000 participants in their MOOCs altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kurhila|first1=Jaakko|title=Experiences from running a programming MOOC in Finland|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/events/digi_breakfast_on-e-learning_and_moocs/|publisher=Aalto University|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2012 more than 1.5 million people had registered for classes through Coursera, Udacity or edX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/11/experts-speculate-possible-business-models-mooc-providers |title=Experts speculate on possible business models for MOOC providers |author=Steve Kolowich |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=11 June 2012| accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. the first 3 minutes of the video {{cite web|title=Daphne Koller: What we're learning from online education |url=https://www.ted.com/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |accessdate=23 April 2013 |date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the range of students registered appears to be broad, diverse and non-traditional, but concentrated among English-speakers in rich countries.

A course billed as "Asia's first MOOC" given by the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] through Coursera starting in April 2013 registered 17,000 students. About 60% were from "rich countries" with many of the rest from middle-income countries in Asia, South Africa, Brazil or Mexico. Fewer students enrolled from areas with more limited access to the internet, and students from the People's Republic of China may have been discouraged by Chinese government policies.&lt;ref name="HK MOOC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Yojana|title=Hong Kong MOOC Draws Students from Around the World|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Hong-Kong-MOOC-Draws-Students/138723/|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=22 April 2013}} reprinted from ''University World News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Koller stated in May 2013 that a majority of the people taking Coursera courses had already earned college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Kolowich, [http://chronicle.com/article/In-Deals-With-10-Public/139533/?cid=at "In Deals With 10 Public Universities, Coursera Bids for Role in Credit Courses", ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' 30 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Stanford University study of a more general group of students "active learners" – anybody who participated beyond just registering – found that 64% of high school active learners were male and 88% were male for undergraduate- and graduate-level courses.&lt;ref name="lytics"/&gt;

A study from Stanford University's Learning Analytics group identified four types of students: auditors, who watched video throughout the course, but took few quizzes or exams; completers, who viewed most lectures and took part in most assessments; disengaged learners, who quickly dropped the course; and sampling learners, who might only occasionally watch lectures.&lt;ref name="lytics"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacKay|first=R.F.|title=Learning analytics at Stanford takes huge leap forward with MOOCs|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/april/online-learning-analytics-041113.html|work=Stanford Report|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified the following percentages in each group:&lt;ref name="Decon Diseng"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deconstructing Disengagement: Analyzing Learner Subpopulations in Massive Open Online Courses|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/papers/deconstructingDisengagement.pdf|work=LAK conference presentation|accessdate=22 April 2013|author=René F.

Jonathan Haber focused on questions of what students are learning and student demographics. About half the students taking US courses are from other countries and do not speak English as their first language. He found some courses to be meaningful, especially about reading comprehension. Video lectures followed by multiple choice questions can be challenging since they are often the "right questions." Smaller discussion boards paradoxically offer the best conversations. Larger discussions can be "really, really thoughtful and really, really misguided", with long discussions becoming rehashes or "the same old stale left/right debate."&lt;ref name="BG Haber"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bombardieri|first=Marcella|title=Can you MOOC your way through college in one year?|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/04/13/can-you-mooc-your-way-through-college-one-year-can-you-mooc-your-way-through-college-one-year/lAPwwe2OYNLbP9EHitgc3L/story.html|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT and Stanford University offered initial MOOCs in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Since engineering courses need prerequisites so at the outset upper-level engineering courses were nearly absent from the MOOC list. Now several universities are presenting undergraduate and advanced-level engineering courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Adopting MOOCs for quality engineering education in India. |last= Phatak|first=D.

=== Educator experience ===
In 2013, the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] surveyed 103 professors who had taught MOOCs. "Typically a professor spent over 100 hours on his MOOC before it even started, by recording online lecture videos and doing other preparation", though some instructors' pre-class preparation was "a few dozen hours." The professors then spent 8–10 hours per week on the course, including participation in discussion forums.&lt;ref name="Chron survey"/&gt;

The medians were: 33,000 students enrollees; 2,600 passing; and 1 teaching assistant helping with the class. 74% of the classes used automated grading, and 34% used peer grading. 97% of the instructors used original videos, 75% used open educational resources and 27% used other resources. 9% of the classes required a physical textbook and 5% required an e-book.&lt;ref name="Chron survey"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolowich|first=Steven|title=The Professors Who Make the MOOCs|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Professors-Behind-the-MOOC/137905/#id=overview|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="additional results"&gt;{{cite news|title=Additional Results From The Chronicle's Survey|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Professors-Behind-the-MOOC/137905/#id=results|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike traditional courses, MOOCs require additional skills, provided by videographers, instructional designers, IT specialists and platform specialists. Georgia Tech professor Karen Head reports that 19 people work on their MOOCs and that more are needed.&lt;ref name=GTech&gt;{{cite news|last=Head|first=Karen|title=Sweating the Details of a MOOC in Progress|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/sweating-the-details-of-a-mooc-in-progress/43315|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platforms have availability requirements similar to media/content sharing websites, due to the large number of enrollees. MOOCs typically use [[cloud computing]] and are often created with    [[authoring system]]s. Authoring tools for the creation of MOOCs are specialized packages of [[educational software]] like [[Elicitus]], [[IMC Content Studio]] and [[Lectora]] that are easy-to-use and support e-learning standards like [[SCORM]] and [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]].

=== Completion rates ===

Despite their potential to support learning and education, MOOCs have a major concern related to attrition rates and course drop out. Even though the number of learners who enroll in the courses tends to be in the thousands range, only a very small portion of the enrolled learners complete the course. According to the visualizations and analysis conducted by Katy Jordan (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html|title=MOOC completion rates|website=www.katyjordan.com|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investigated MOOCs have a typical enrollment of 25,000, even though enrollment has reached a value up to ~230,000. Jordan reports that the average completion rate for such MOOCs is approximately 15%. Early data from Coursera suggest a completion rate of 7%–9%.&lt;ref name="KatW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=3109|title=MOOCs on the Move: How Coursera Is Disrupting the Traditional Classroom|date=7 November 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|format=text and video|work=Knowledge @ Wharton|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffrin et al.

(2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Diyi|last2=Sinha|first2=Tanmay|last3=Adamson|first3=David|last4=Rose|first4=Carolyn|title="Turn on, Tune in, Drop out": Anticipating student dropouts in Massive Open Online Courses|url=http://lytics.stanford.edu/datadriveneducation/papers/yangetal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that even though there is a large proportion of students who drop out early on due to a variety of reasons, there is a significant proportion of the students who remain in the course and drop out later, thus causing attrition to happen over time.

Before analyzing some factors which is related to attrition rates and course drop out, one important thing should be keep in mind is that average completion rate for MOOCs is not a good indicator. Completion rate can not reflect the overall view of every student because different students have diverse purposes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hew|first=Khe Foon|date=May 2016|title=Promoting engagement in online courses: What strategies can we learn from three highly rated MOOCS|url=|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=47|pages=320–341|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Khe&amp;nbsp;Foon&amp;nbsp;Hew (2016)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; indicates that some students take part in the MOOCs just for interest or finding extrinsic value of course. They drop the course if the course can not satisfy their purpose. However, completion rate is objective enough to reflect engagement of students.

Much research has investigated why students drop out of MOOC courses or what factors could contribute to them dropping out. For example, Rosé et al. (2014)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosé|first=Carolyn Penstein|last2=Carlson|first2=Ryan|last3=Yang|first3=Diyi|last4=Wen|first4=Miaomiao|last5=Resnick|first5=Lauren|last6=Goldman|first6=Pam|last7=Sherer|first7=Jennifer|date=1 January 2014|title=Social Factors That Contribute to Attrition in MOOCs|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2556325.2567879|journal=Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference|series=L@S '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=197–198|doi=10.1145/2556325.2567879|isbn=9781450326698}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigate how three social factors make predictions on student attrition, for students who participated in the course discussion forum. The authors found that students who serve as authorities in the community seem to be more committed to the community and thus less inclined to drop out the course. In addition, students who actively participated in the course since the first week were 35% less likely to drop out of the course, compared with the average population. Lastly, the analysis of the patterns of attrition in a sub community showed that attrition was related to the engagement of the particular students with one another. One interpretation of this finding according to Rosé et al. (2014)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is that while participating in MOOCs, students create virtual cohorts who progress and engage with the material in similar ways. Thus, if students start dropping out, then that might cause other students to drop out as they might perceive the environment as less supportive or engaging without their peers.

Other studies focus on exploring how motivation and self-regulated learning could be related to MOOC dropout and attrition. Carson (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Hendricks|first=Carson, Elaine|title=Self-directed learning and academic achievement in secondary online students|date=1 January 2012|publisher=University of Tennessee at Chattanooga|url=http://scholar.utc.edu/theses/11/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigated characteristics of self-directed learning in students of grades 8–12 who took online courses through a statewide online program. Two of the hypothesis that the study explored were whether there exist underlying distinct classes (categories) of self-regulated learners and if the membership in these classes was associated with measures such significantly different online course completion, online final grade, or GPA. The results show that there exist different latent classes of self-regulated learning within the population of online students, designated as high, moderate, and low self-directed learning. In addition, the results support the hypothesis that there is an association between the self-directed learning class the student belongs to with the significantly different course completion rate or course achievement (course achievement was measured by the completion of the online courses, the final online course grade and the cumulative GPA). In other words, course completion and self-directed learning in students were found to be significantly related.

One online survey published a "top ten" list of reasons for dropping out of a MOOC.&lt;ref name="Open culture 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=MOOC Interrupted: Top 10 Reasons Our Readers Didn’t Finish a Massive Open Online Course|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/04/10_reasons_you_didnt_complete_a_mooc.html|work=Open Culture|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list involved reasons such as the course required too much time, or was too difficult or too basic. Reasons related to poor course design included "lecture fatigue" from courses that were just lecture videos, lack of a proper introduction to course technology and format, clunky technology and abuse on discussion boards. Hidden costs were cited, including required readings from expensive textbooks written by the instructor that also significantly limited students' access to learning material.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL" /&gt; Other non-completers were "just shopping around" when they registered, or were participating for knowledge rather than a credential. Other reasons for the poor completion rates include the workload, length and difficulty of a course.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL" /&gt; In addition, some participants participate peripherally ("lurk"). For example, one of the first MOOCs in 2008 had 2200 registered members, of whom 150 actively interacted at various times.&lt;ref&gt;Mackness, Jenny, Mak, Sui Fai John, and Williams, Roy [http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/organisations/netlc/past/nlc2010/abstracts/PDFs/Mackness.pdf "The Ideals and Reality of Participating in a MOOC"], Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Networked Learning 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides those factors cause the low completion rate in MOOCs, the inequality on receiving knowledge affected by different characters of individual also has huge influence on the consequence of completion rate. Actually, MOOC is not as fair as we expected. Russian researchers Semenova, T.V. and Rudakova, L.M (2016), indicate that MOOC is designed to decrease the unequal access to getting knowledge, but that doesn't mean every individual can enjoy the same equality in course completion rate. From their research, there are three main factors cause the inequality, which are degree of education, experience of MOOCs and gender. The survey shows that 18% high-education students complete the course while only 3% low-education students complete. To be more visualized, 84–88% students who have completed the course are high-educational. What's more, among students who have completed the course, 65–80% students have at least one experience of using online learning platform comparing to 6–31% students who have no experience . Gender also influence the completion rate, in general, 6%–7% more men than women complete the course because women are supposed to do household in many countries, which distract women's attention in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Semenova|first=T.V.|last2=Rudakova|first2=L.M.|date=May 2016|title=Barriers to Taking Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).|url=|journal=Russian Education &amp; Society|volume=58|pages=228–245|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of MOOCs is an open question as completion rates are substantially less than traditional online education courses.&lt;ref name="Yousef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Khaled M 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alraimi|first1=Khaled M.|last2=Zo|first2=Hangjung|last3=Ciganek|first3=Andrew P.|title=Understanding the MOOCs continuance: The role of openness and reputation|journal=Computers &amp; Education|date=January 2015|volume=80|pages=28–38|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alraimi et al. (2015) explained in their research model a substantial percentage of the variance for the intention to continue using MOOCs, which is significantly influenced by perceived reputation, perceived openness, perceived usefulness, and perceived user satisfaction. Perceived reputation and perceived openness were the strongest predictors and have not previously been examined in the context of MOOCs

However research indicates that completion rates is not the right metric to measure success of MOOCs. Alternate metrics are proposed to measure effectiveness of MOOCs and online learning.&lt;ref name="Khaled M 2014"/&gt;

This approach, he said, dispels 'the medieval set of myths' guiding teacher efficacy and student outcomes, and replaces it with evidence-based, 'modern, data-driven' educational methodologies that may be the instruments responsible for a 'fundamental transformation of education' itself".&lt;ref name="Librarians and the Era of the MOOC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Librarians and the Era of the MOOC|url=http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/librarians-and-the-era-of-the-mooc/|accessdate=11 May 2013|work=SciLogs|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some view the videos and other material produced by the MOOC as the next form of the textbook. "MOOC is the new textbook", according to David Finegold of [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffrey R.|title=The Object Formerly Known as the Textbook|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Dont-Call-Them-Textbooks/136835/|publisher=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of edX student habits found that certificate-earning students generally stop watching videos longer than 6 to 9 minutes. They viewed the first 4.4 minutes (median) of 12- to 15-minute videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holmes|first1=Lindsay|title=An Early Report Card on Massive Open Online Courses|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303759604579093400834738972|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditional schools blend online and offline learning, sometimes called flipped classrooms. Students watch lectures online at home and work on projects and interact with faculty while in class. Such hybrids can even improve student performance in traditional in-person classes. One fall 2012 test by San Jose State and edX found that incorporating content from an online course into a for-credit campus-based course increased pass rates to 91% from as low as 55% without the online component. "We do not recommend selecting an online-only experience over a blended learning experience", says Coursera's Andrew Ng.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt;

Because of massive enrollments, MOOCs require instructional design that facilitates large-scale feedback and interaction. The two basic approaches are:

* Peer-review and group collaboration

So-called connectivist MOOCs rely on the former approach; broadcast MOOCs rely more on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Steve. "[http://tofp.wordpress.com/2012/07/23/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-automated-assessment/ What we talk about when we talk about automated assessment]" 23 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a key distinction between [[Massive open online course#Connectivist design|cMOOCs]]  where the 'C' stands for 'connectivist', and xMOOCs where the x stands for extended (as in TEDx, edX) and represents that the MOOC is designed to be in addition to something else (university courses for example).&lt;ref name="xMOOC def"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://plus.google.com/109526159908242471749/posts/LEwaKxL2MaM | title=What the 'x' in 'xMOOC' stands for | date=9 April 2013 | accessdate=17 May 2014 | author=Downes, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessment can be the most difficult activity to conduct online, and online assessments can be quite different from the bricks-and-mortar version.&lt;ref name="DoF 1"&gt;[http://degreeoffreedom.org/mooc-components-assessment/ Degree of Freedom – an adventure in online learning], ''MOOC Components – Assessment'', 22 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Special attention has been devoted to proctoring and cheating.&lt;ref name=NYT030212&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisenberg|first=Anne|title=Keeping an Eye on Online Test-Takers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/technology/new-technologies-aim-to-foil-online-course-cheating.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer review is often based upon sample answers or [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]], which guide the grader on how many points to award different answers. These rubrics cannot be as complex for peer grading as for teaching assistants. Students are expected to learn via grading others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong|first=Michael|title=Online Peer Assessment in MOOCs: Students Learning from Students|url=http://ctlt.ubc.ca/2013/03/28/online-peer-assessment-in-moocs-students-learning-from-students/|work=Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology Newsletter|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=20 April 2013|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and become more engaged with the course.&lt;ref name="in AIS Electronic Library AISeL"/&gt; Exams may be proctored at regional testing centers. Other methods, including "eavesdropping technologies worthy of the C.I.A." allow testing at home or office, by using webcams, or monitoring mouse clicks and typing styles.&lt;ref name=NYT030212/&gt; Special techniques such as [[Computerized adaptive testing|adaptive testing]] may be used, where the test tailors itself given the student's previous answers, giving harder or easier questions accordingly.

"The most important thing that helps students succeed in an online course is interpersonal interaction and support", says Shanna Smith Jaggars, assistant director of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Community College Research Center]]. Her research compared online-only and face-to-face learning in studies of community-college students and faculty in Virginia and Washington state. Among her findings: In Virginia, 32% of students failed or withdrew from for-credit online courses, compared with 19% for equivalent in-person courses.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt;

Assigning mentors to students is another interaction-enhancing technique.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt; In 2013 Harvard offered a popular class, ''The Ancient Greek Hero'', instructed by [[Gregory Nagy]] and taken by thousands of Harvard students over prior decades. It appealed to alumni to volunteer as online mentors and discussion group managers. About 10 former teaching fellows also volunteered. The task of the volunteers, which required 3–5 hours per week, was to focus online class discussion.  The edX course registered 27,000 students.&lt;ref name=NYT032513&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard Asks Graduates to Donate Time to Free Online Humanities Class By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA Published:|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/education/harvard-asks-alumni-to-donate-time-to-free-online-course.html|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 March 2013|author=Richard Perez-Pena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques for maintaining connection with students include adding audio comments on assignments instead of writing them, participating with students in the discussion forums, asking brief questions in the middle of the lecture, updating weekly videos about the course and sending congratulatory emails on prior accomplishments to students who are slightly behind.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt; Grading by peer review has had mixed results. In one example, three fellow students grade one assignment for each assignment that they submit. The grading key or rubric tends to focus the grading, but discourages more creative writing.&lt;ref name="BG Haber"/&gt;

[[A. J. Jacobs]] in an op-ed in the ''[[New York Times]]'' graded his experience in 11 MOOC classes overall as a "B".&lt;ref name=AJJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=A.J.|title=Two Cheers for Web U!|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/opinion/sunday/grading-the-mooc-university.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times, Sunday Review|date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rated his professors as '"B+", despite "a couple of clunkers", even comparing them to pop stars and "A-list celebrity professors." Nevertheless, he rated teacher-to-student interaction as a "D" since he had almost no contact with the professors. The highest rated ("A") aspect of Jacobs' experience was the ability to watch videos at any time. Student-to-student interaction and assignments both received "B-". Study groups that didn't meet, [[Troll (Internet)|trolls]] on message boards and the relative slowness of online vs. personal conversations lowered that rating. Assignments included multiple choice quizzes and exams as well as essays and projects. He found the multiple choice tests stressful and peer graded essays painful. He completed only 2 of the 11 classes.&lt;ref name=AJJ/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR AJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Making the most of MOOCs: the ins and outs of e-learning|url=https://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=178623872&amp;m=178623848|work=Talk of the Nation|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=23 April 2013|format=Radio interview and call-in|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information architecture ==
When searching for the desired course the courses are usually organized by "most popular" or a "topical scheme". Courses planned for synchronous learning are structured as an exact organizational scheme called a [[Chronological organization scheme|chronological scheme,]] &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=information architecture for the web and beyond|last=Rosenfeld|first=Louis|publisher=O'Reilly|year=2015|isbn=978-1-491-91168-6|location=United States of America|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses planned for [[asynchronous learning]]&amp;nbsp;are also presented as a chronological scheme, but the order the information is learned as a hybrid scheme. In this way it can be harder to understand the course content and complete, because they are not based on an existing [[mental model]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Industry ==

MOOCs are widely seen as a major part of a larger [[disruptive innovation]] taking place in higher education.&lt;ref name="avalanche"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Michael|title=An Avalanche is Coming; Higher Education and the Revolution Ahead|publisher=[[Institute for Public Policy Research]] |location=London|page=71 |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/FINAL%20Embargoed%20Avalanche%20Paper%20130306%20(1).pdf|authorlink=Sir Michael Barber |author2=Katelyn Donnelly |author3=Saad Rizvi |accessdate=14 March 2013|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times HE"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parr|first=Chris|title=Fund ‘pick-and-mix’ MOOC generation, ex-wonk advises|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/fund-pick-and-mix-mooc-generation-ex-wonk-advises/2002535.article|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education (London)|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watters|first=Audrey|title=Unbundling and Unmooring: Technology and the Higher Ed Tsunami|url=http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/unbundling-and-unmooring-technology-and-higher-ed-tsunami|work=Educause Review|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the many services offered under traditional university business models are predicted to become [[unbundling|unbundled]] and sold to students individually or in newly formed bundles.&lt;ref name=KCarey&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey|first=Kevin|title=Into the Future With MOOC's|date=3 September 2012|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Into-the-Future-With-MOOCs/134080/|publisher=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHarden&gt;{{cite web|last=Harden|first=Nathan|title=The End of the University as We Know It|url=http://the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=1352|publisher=The American Interest|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services include research, curriculum design, content generation (such as textbooks), teaching, assessment and certification (such as granting degrees) and student placement. MOOCs threaten existing business models by potentially selling teaching, assessment, or placement separately from the current package of services.&lt;ref name="avalanche"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhu&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhu|first=Alex|title=Massive Open Online Courses – A Threat Or Opportunity To Universities?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2012/09/06/massive-open-online-course-a-threat-or-opportunity-to-universities/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shirky&gt;{{cite news|last=Shirky|first=Clay|title=Higher education: our MP3 is the mooc|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/dec/17/moocs-higher-education-transformation|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] has cited recent developments, including the online learning innovations at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Arizona State University]] and Georgia Institute of Technology, as having potential to reduce the rising costs of higher education.&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse&gt;{{cite news|title=Remarks by the President on College Affordability – Buffalo, NY|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/08/22/president-obama-speaks-college-affordability#transcript|accessdate=22 August 2013|newspaper=[[The White House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Mazoue, Director of Online Programs at [[Wayne State University]] describes one possible innovation:
{{Quote|The next disruptor will likely mark a tipping point: an entirely free online curriculum leading to a degree from an accredited institution. With this new business model, students might still have to pay to certify their credentials, but not for the process leading to their acquisition.

But how universities will benefit by "giving our product away free online" is unclear.&lt;ref name=NYT010613/&gt;
{{quote|No one's got the model that's going to work yet. I expect all the current ventures to fail, because the expectations are too high. People think something will catch on like wildfire.

=== Fee opportunities ===

In the [[freemium]] business model the basic product – the course content – is given away free. "Charging for content would be a tragedy", said Andrew Ng. But "premium" services such as certification or placement would be charged a fee – however financial aids are given in some cases.&lt;ref name=SA31313&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=M. Mitchell|author2=Nature magazine|title=Massive Open Online Courses, aka MOOCs, Transform Higher Education and Science|journal=Scientific American|date=13 March 2013|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=massive-open-online-courses-transform-higher-education-and-science|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Course developers could charge licensing fees for educational institutions that use its materials. Introductory or "gateway" courses and some remedial courses may earn the most fees. Free introductory courses may attract new students to follow-on fee-charging classes. Blended courses supplement MOOC material with face-to-face instruction. Providers can charge employers for recruiting its students. Students may be able to pay to take a proctored exam to earn transfer credit at a degree-granting university, or for certificates of completion.&lt;ref name=NYT010613/&gt; Udemy allows teachers to sell online courses, with the course creators keeping 70–85% of the proceeds and [[intellectual property rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carey |first=Kevin |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Revenge-of-the-Underpaid/131919/ |title=Revenge of the Underpaid Professors |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coursera found that students who paid $30 to $90 were substantially more likely to finish the course. The fee was ostensibly for the company's identity-verification program, which confirms that they took and passed a course.&lt;ref name=wsj1013/&gt;

In February 2013 the American Council on Education (ACE) recommended that its members provide transfer credit from a few MOOC courses, though even the universities who deliver the courses had said that they would not.&lt;ref name=WSJ020713&gt;{{cite news|last=Korn|first=Melissa|title=Big MOOC Coursera Moves Closer to Academic Acceptance|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324906004578288341039095024|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Wisconsin]] offered multiple, [[Competency-based learning|competency-based]] [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|master's]] degrees starting Fall 2013, the first public university to do so on a system-wide basis. The university encouraged students to take online-courses such as MOOCs and complete assessment tests at the university to receive credit.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} As of 2013 few students had applied for college credit for MOOC classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Colorado State University-Global Campus]] received no applications in the year after they offered the option.&lt;ref name="no takers"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolowich|first=Steve|title=A University's Offer of Credit for a MOOC Gets No Takers|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Universitys-Offer-of-Credit/140131/|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=8 July 2013}} Udacity, which is offering an online master's degree in computer science in partnership with Georgia Tech, reported in October 2013 that applications for the term starting in January 2014 were more than double the number of applications that Georgia Tech receives for its traditional program. {{cite web|last=Belkin|first=douglas|title= First-of-Its-Kind Online Master’s Draws Wave of Applicants|url=http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-368104/|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic Partnerships is a company that helps public universities move their courses online. According to its chairman, Randy Best, "We started it, frankly, as a campaign to grow enrollment. But 72 to 84 percent of those who did the first course came back and paid to take the second course."&lt;ref name=NYT012313&gt;Tamar Lewin.

== Benefits ==

=== Improving access to Higher Education ===
MOOCs are regarded by many as an important tool to widen access to Higher Education (HE) for millions of people, including those in the [[Developing country|developing world]], and ultimately enhance their quality of life. MOOCs may be regarded as contributing to the democratisation of HE, not only locally or regionally but globally as well. MOOCs can help democratise content and make knowledge reachable for everyone. Students are able to access complete courses offered by universities all over the world, something previously unattainable. With the availability of affordable technologies, MOOCs increase access to an extraordinary number of courses offered by world-renowned institutions and teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=17–18, 21–22, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Providing an affordable alternative to formal education ===
The costs of tertiary education continue to increase because institutions tend to bundle too many services. With MOOCs, some of these services can be transferred to other suitable players in the public or private sector.&amp;nbsp;MOOCs are for large numbers of participants, can be accessed by anyone anywhere as long as they have an Internet connection, are open to everyone without entry qualifications and offer a full/complete course experience online for free.&lt;ref&gt;Mulder, F., &amp; Jansen. D. (2015). ''MOOCs for opening up education and the OpenupEd initiative''. In C. J. Bonk, M. M. Lee, T. C. Reeves, &amp; T. H. Reynolds (Eds.), MOOCs and open education around the world. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sustainable Development Goals ===
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goals}}

MOOCs can be seen as a form of open education offered for free through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs is to open up quality Higher Education to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Offers a Flexible Learning Schedule ===
Certain lectures, videos, and tests through MOOCs can be accessed at any time compared to scheduled class times. By allowing learners to complete their coursework in their own time, this provides flexibility to learners based on their own personal schedules.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samuel |first1=Alexandra |title=Collaborating Online Is Sometimes Better than Face-to-Face |url=https://hbr.org/2015/04/collaborating-online-is-sometimes-better-than-face-to-face |website=Harvard Business Review |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Online Collaboration ===
The learning environments of MOOCs make it easier for learners across the globe to work together on common goals. Instead of having to physically meet one another, online collaboration creates partnerships among learners. While time zones may have an effect on the hours that learners communicate, projects, assignments, and more can be completed to incorporate the skills and resources that different learners offer no matter where they are located.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges and criticisms ==

The MOOC Guide&lt;ref name="MoocGuide"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moocguide.wikispaces.com/2.+Benefits+and+challenges+of+a+MOOC | title=Benefits and Challenges of a MOOC | publisher=MoocGuide | date=7 July 2011&lt;!-- 11:27&amp;nbsp;pm --&gt;| accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests six possible challenges for cMOOCs:
# Relying on user-generated content can create a chaotic learning environment
# [[Digital literacy]] is necessary to make use of the online materials
# The time and effort required from participants may exceed what students are willing to commit to a free online course
# Once the course is released, content will be reshaped and reinterpreted by the massive student body, making the course trajectory difficult for instructors to control
# Participants must self-regulate and set their own goals
#Language and translation barriers

These general challenges in effective MOOC development are accompanied by criticism by journalists and academics.

[[Robert Zemsky]] (2014) argues that they have passed their peak: "They came; they conquered very little; and now they face substantially diminished prospects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zemsky | first1 = Robert | year = 2014 | title = With a MOOC MOOC here and a MOOC MOOC there, here a MOOC, there a MOOC, everywhere a MOOC MOOC | jstor = 10.5325/jgeneeduc.63.4.0237 | journal = Journal of General Education | volume = 63 | issue = 4| pages = 237–243 | doi=10.1353/jge.2014.0029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed to a backlash arising from the tiny completion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What Are MOOCs Good For?|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/533406/what-are-moocs-good-for/|first=Pope|last=Justin|date=15 Dec 2014|publisher=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=February 2017}} dispute that the "territorial" dimensions of MOOCs&lt;ref name="TerritorialDimensions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/globalhighered/territorial-dimensions-moocs | title=On the territorial dimensions of MOOCs | publisher=Inside Higher Ed | date=3 December 2012 | accessdate=4 February 2013 | author=Olds, Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt; have received insufficient discussion or data-backed analysis, namely: 1. the true geographical diversity of enrolls in/completes courses; 2. the implications of courses scaling across country borders, and potential difficulties with relevance and knowledge transfer; and 3. the need for territory-specific study of locally relevant issues and needs.

Other features associated with early MOOCs, such as open licensing of content, open structure and learning goals, and community-centeredness, may not be present in all MOOC projects.&lt;ref name="MOOC Misnomer"/&gt;

Effects on the structure of higher education were lamented, for example, by [[Moshe Y. Vardi]], who finds an "absence of serious pedagogy in MOOCs", and indeed in all of higher education. He criticized the format of "short, unsophisticated video chunks, interleaved with online quizzes, and accompanied by social networking."{{clarify|reason=Reads like a description rather than a critique.|date=October 2013}} An underlying reason is simple cost-cutting pressures, which could hamstring the higher education industry.&lt;ref name=Vardi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Moshe Y.|title=Will MOOCs destroy academia?|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=November 2012|volume=55|issue=11|page=5|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/11/156587-will-moocs-destroy-academia/fulltext|accessdate=23 April 2013|doi=10.1145/2366316.2366317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes predicted from MOOCs generated objections in some quarters. The San Jose State University philosophy faculty wrote in an open letter to Harvard University professor and MOOC teacher [[Michael Sandel]]:

{{Quote|Should one-size-fits-all vendor-designed blended courses become the norm, we fear two classes of universities will be created: one, well-funded colleges and universities in which privileged students get their own real professor; the other, financially stressed private and public universities in which students watch a bunch of video-taped lectures.&lt;ref name="Dear Sandel"&gt;{{cite news|title=San Jose State to Michael Sandel: Keep your MOOC off our campus|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2013/05/san_jose_state.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Cary Nelson]], former president of the [[American Association of University Professors]] claimed that MOOCs are not a reliable means of supplying credentials, stating that "It’s fine to put lectures online, but this plan only degrades degree programs if it plans to substitute for them." Sandra Schroeder, chair of the Higher Education Program and Policy Council for the [[American Federation of Teachers]] expressed concern that "These students are not likely to succeed without the structure of a strong and sequenced academic program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basu |first=Kaustuv |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/05/23/faculty-groups-consider-how-respond-moocs |title=Faculty groups consider how to respond to MOOCs |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=23 May 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a 60% majority, the [[Amherst College]] faculty rejected the opportunity to work with edX based on a perceived incompatibility with their seminar-style classes and personalized feedback. Some were concerned about issues such as the "information dispensing" teaching model of lectures followed by exams, the use of multiple-choice exams and peer-grading. The [[Duke University]] faculty took a similar stance in the spring of 2013. The effect of MOOCs on second- and third-tier institutions and of creating a professorial "star system" were among other concerns.&lt;ref name="IHE 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivard|first=Ry|title=EdX Rejected|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/04/19/despite-courtship-amherst-decides-shy-away-star-mooc-provider|publisher=Inside Higher Education|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one alternative to MOOCs has advocates: [[Distributed open collaborative courses]] ([[DOCC]]) challenge the roles of the instructor, hierarchy, money and massiveness. DOCC recognizes that the pursuit of knowledge may be achieved better by not using a centralized singular syllabus, that expertise is distributed throughout all the participants and does not just reside with one or two individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/19/feminist-professors-create-alternative-moocs#ixzz2duFJIkrX "Feminist Anti-MOOC"], Inside Higher Ed, 19 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative to MOOCs is the [[Self-Paced Online Course (SPOC)]] which provides a high degree of flexibility. Students can decide on their own pace and with which session they would like to begin their studies. According to a report by [[Class Central]] founder Dhawal Shah, more than 800 self-paced courses have been available in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shah|first1=Dhawal|title=MOOCs in 2015: Breaking Down the Numbers|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-12-28-moocs-in-2015-breaking-down-the-numbers|accessdate=28 December 2015|publisher=edSurge|date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the purpose of MOOCs is ultimately to educate more people, recent criticisms include accessibility and a Westernized curriculum that lead to a failure to reach the same audiences marginalised by traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gais|first1=Hannah|title=Is the developing world ‘MOOC’d out’?|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/7/mooc-education-developingworldivyleave.html|accessdate=19 July 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOOCs have been criticized for a perceived lack of academic rigor as well as the monetization strategies adopted by providers. In ''MOOCs: A University Qualification in 24 Hours?'' Michael Shea writes "By offering courses that are near-impossible to fail and charging up front fees for worthless certificates, Coursera is simply running a high-tech version of the kind of scams that have been run by correspondence colleges for decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Michael|title=MOOCs: A university qualification in 24 hours?|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/tech/features/moocs|accessdate=16 October 2015|publisher=The Skinny|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The experience of English Language Learners (ELLs) in MOOCs ===
Language of instruction is one of the major barriers that ELLs face in MOOCs. In recent estimates, almost 75% of MOOC courses are presented in the English language, however, native English speakers are a minority among the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uchidiuno|first=Judith|last2=Ogan|first2=Amy|last3=Koedinger|first3=Kenneth R.|last4=Yarzebinski|first4=Evelyn|last5=Hammer|first5=Jessica|date=1 January 2016|title=Browser Language Preferences As a Metric for Identifying ESL Speakers in MOOCs|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2876034.2893433|journal=Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale|series=L@S '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=277–280|doi=10.1145/2876034.2893433|isbn=9781450337267}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is mediated by the increasing popularity of English as a global language, and therefore has more second language speakers than any other language in the world. This barrier has encouraged content developers and other MOOC stakeholders to develop content in other popular languages to increase MOOC access. However, research studies show that some ELLs prefer to take MOOCs in English, despite the language challenges, as it promotes their goals of Economic, Social, and Geographic mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uchidiuno|first=Judith|last2=Ogan|first2=Amy|last3=Yarzebinski|first3=Evelyn|last4=Hammer|first4=Jessica|date=1 January 2016|title=Understanding ESL Students' Motivations to Increase MOOC Accessibility|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2876034.2893398|journal=Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale|series=L@S '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=169–172|doi=10.1145/2876034.2893398|isbn=9781450337267}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasizes the need to not only provide MOOC content in other languages, but also to develop English language interventions for ELLs who participate in English MOOCs.

Areas that ELLs particularly struggle with in English MOOCs include MOOC content without corresponding visual supporting materials&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uchidiuno|first=Judith|last2=Hammer|first2=Jessica|last3=Yarzebinski|first3=Evelyn|last4=Koedinger|first4=Kenneth R.|last5=Ogan|first5=Amy|date=1 January 2017|title=Characterizing ELL Students' Behavior During MOOC Videos Using Content Type|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3051457.3053981|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth (2017) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale|series=L@S '17|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=185–188|doi=10.1145/3051457.3053981|isbn=9781450344500}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., an instructor narrating instruction without text support in the background), or their hesitation to participate in MOOC discussion forums.&lt;ref name="Kulkarni 1116–1128"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulkarni|first=Chinmay|last2=Cambre|first2=Julia|last3=Kotturi|first3=Yasmine|last4=Bernstein|first4=Michael S.|last5=Klemmer|first5=Scott R.|date=1 January 2015|title=Talkabout: Making Distance Matter with Small Groups in Massive Classes|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2675133.2675166|journal=Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work &amp; Social Computing|series=CSCW '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1116–1128|doi=10.1145/2675133.2675166|isbn=9781450329224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active participation in MOOC discussion forums has been found to improve students grades, their engagement, and leads to lower dropout rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.|first=Wang, Xu{{!}}Yang, Diyi{{!}}Wen, Miaomiao{{!}}Koedinger, Kenneth{{!}}Rosé, Carolyn|title=Investigating How Student's Cognitive Behavior in MOOC Discussion Forums Affect Learning Gains.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED560568|journal=International Educational Data Mining Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, ELLs are more likely to be spectators than active contributors in discussion forums.&lt;ref name="Kulkarni 1116–1128"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Researching studies show a “complex mix of affective, socio-cultural, and educational factors” that are inhibitors to their active participation in discussion forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Jane|date=1 March 2002|title=Reticence in second language case discussions: anxiety and aspirations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X01000513|journal=System|volume=30|issue=1|pages=65–84|doi=10.1016/S0346-251X(01)00051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, English as the language of communication poses both linguistic and cultural challenges for ELLs, and they may not be confident in their English language communication abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=T.

'''Matthew Robert Glozier''' (born 1972 {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}) is an Australian-based historian and history teacher.

==Early life and education==

Glozier was born in [[Sydney, Australia]], in 1972. He attended the [[University of Sydney]] and obtained a BA (Hons) degree (1990–93) and an [[MPhil]] in History (1997). He was awarded a Commonwealth Research Scholarship to complete a PhD at the [[University of Western Sydney]], entitled Scottish Soldiers in France and The Netherlands, 1660–1692 (conferred 2002).

==Academic career==
Glozier has written works on expatriate soldier groups of French [[Huguenot]] and Scottish extraction. As Official Historian of the [[Australian Air Force Cadets]] he is currently preparing for publication a history of Australian Air Force cadets, 1941-2016, for the 75th anniversary diamond jubilee of the AAFC. He is also slowly compiling a volume of biographical reference relating to French refugee soldiers serving in armies across Europe circa 1685–1713. The project grew out of his earlier
[[prosopography|prosopographical]] research into the Huguenot military support lent to [[William III of England|William of Orange]] during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This is the subject of his monograph, published by Sussex Academic Press in 2002. A second book, ''Scottish Soldiers in France in the Reign of the Sun King: Nursery for Men of Honour History of Warfare'': 24 (Brill Academic Publishers), based on his doctoral thesis, appeared in 2004. 

He has written and revised nine articles for the [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] and his most recent biography is the first scholarly long study of [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Friedrich Hermann von Schomberg]] to be written in English based on new research:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sussex-academic.co.uk/sa/titles/history/glozierSchomberg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401234149/http://www.sussex-academic.co.uk/sa/titles/history/glozierSchomberg.htm |archivedate=1 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marshal Schomberg, 1615–1690: ‘the ablest soldier of his age’: International soldiering and the formation of state armies in seventeenth–century Europe'' (Sussex Academic Press, 2005). The book has been called an "accessible study" that should "do much to rescue its subject's life and career from undeserved neglect".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/27866933/Marshal-Schomberg-16151690-The-Ablest-Soldier-of-His-Age-international-Soldiering-and-the-Formation-of-State-Armies-in-SeventeenthCentury-Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

Glozier’s most recent work is a book on Huguenot [[soldiers]] in armies across Europe, co-edited with Dr David Onnekink (Utrecht University) – ''War, religion and service: Huguenot soldiering, 1685–1713'' (Ashgate Academic Publishers, 2007). A foreword to the book was contributed by [[Peter de la Billière]] who claimed ‘it is the first study of its kind to treat consistently the military contribution made by the Huguenots to armies outside France at the high point of their historical importance as a historical group.’.&lt;ref&gt;pp. xiv, Glozier &amp; Onnekink (eds), ''War, religion and service: Huguenot soldiering, 1685–1713. Politics and Culture in North-West Europe 1650-1720.'' Aldershot: Ashgate Academic Publishers, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection deals with areas of Huguenot studies often neglected by Anglophone research. 

Glozier is widely published as a [[military historian]], interested in military, social and religious aspects; he analyses migration streams and the social and religious stratification of soldier [[refugee]] groups, in volumes that appeal to academic and to interested general readers&lt;ref&gt;http://repositories.tdl.org/tdl/handle/2249.1/5160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calctitle=1&amp;pageSubject=3672&amp;pagecount=1&amp;title_id=6914&amp;edition_id=8873&lt;/ref&gt; and whose international scope is useful for those seeking to explore the nexus of British and European military and political history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sussex-academic.co.uk/sa/titles/history/glozier.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070330102444/http://www.sussex-academic.co.uk/sa/titles/history/glozier.htm |archivedate=30 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He explores the rise of [[nationalism]], the transition from contract-based military service to the reliance on standing forces, and [[religion]] as a chief motivation for many soldiers. 

Matthew is a co–founder of the Huguenot Society of Australia (begun in 2002) and a Fellow of the Huguenot Society of Great Britain and Ireland. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2009. He was appointed Official Historian of the Australian Air Force Cadets organization in 2013.
Matthew is an Honorary Associate of the Medieval and Early Modern Studies Centre (University of Sydney), President of the Sydney Society for Scottish History, and a History Master at Sydney Grammar School.

==Personal life==
Matthew is married to Francesca and they have two children, Max and Charlotte. He coaches and writes about [[fencing]], a sport he has enjoyed since he was at school. He is currently researching Classical Fencing. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} He is a volunteer Officer of Cadets in the Australian Air Force Cadets and an enthusiastic owner of German Shorthaired Pointer dogs.

Martí was driven in an armored BMW with a bodyguard to the [[British American School (State of Mexico)|British American School]] on June 4, 2008, when he was stopped at a roadblock by officers wearing uniforms of Mexico's [[Federal Investigations Agency]], the equivalent of the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Iliff | first= Laurence | title= Calderón proposes life sentence for police involved in kidnappings in Mexico | url= http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/mexico/stories/DN-kidnap_08int.ART.State.Edition2.4dddd5f.html | work= Dallas Morning News | date= 2008-08-08 | accessdate= 2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver was tortured by having his teeth pulled out and later killed, and the bodyguard was choked. The bodyguard survived and later implicated [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], including Jose Luis Romero, commander of the detective unit at [[Mexico City International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Althaus | first= Dudley | title= Kidnap-slaying spurs calls for police reforms / Two Mexico City officers accused in death of boy, 14 | url= http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2008_4607022 | work= Houston Chronicle | page= A10 | date= 2008-08-06 | accessdate= 2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, 2008, the ransom of 5,135,000 pesos (about US$404.3K) was agreed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad/91563.htmlo{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but  initially the official information was that a total of US$6 million was paid by all the Marti family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/161440.html&lt;/ref&gt; After several days of waiting on August 1, 2008, the body of Fernando Marti was found inside the trunk of a car that was left abandoned in the city. The case prompted public outrage in Mexico, and there has growing pressure to reintroduce [[capital punishment]].

==Criminal Investigation==
On June 17, 2009, the Subprocuraduría de Investigación Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), which specializes on criminal organized gangs, initiated an investigation for organized delinquency and kidnapping against the organization of La Flor (The Flower), thought to be responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Fernando Marti Haik.

On October 18, 2010, Alejandro Marti, now president of [[Mexico SOS]], published photos of the alleged criminals. By the time he did so, the "[[Procuraduria General de la Republica]]" (PGR) announced that $15,000,000 (about US$1,181,000) would be paid as a reward anyone who could provide reliable and useful information that contributes to the location, arrest or detention of these criminals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=281624&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC&lt;/ref&gt; Alejandro Marti declared:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/10/18/alejandro-marti-publica-las-fotos-de-los-presuntos-asesinos-de-su-hijo | work=CNN | title=Alejandro Martí publica las fotos de los presuntos asesinos de su hijo | date=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Conservatory of Music of America''' was an institution for higher education in music founded in 1885 in [[New York City]] by [[Jeannette Thurber|Jeannette Meyers Thurber]]. The conservatory  was officially declared defunct by the state of New York in 1952, although for all practical pedagogical purposes, it had ceased to function much earlier than that; however, between its founding and about 1920 the conservatory played an important part in the education and training of musicians in the United States. A number of prominent names are associated with the institution, including that of [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]], director of the conservatory from Sep. 27, 1892 to 1895.&lt;ref name=Finck1916&gt;{{cite book|last=Finck|first=Henry Theophilus|title=Thirty Years of the National Conservatory of Music of America|year=1916|publisher=NCMA}} 34pp. Dvorak was compensated $15,000/year.&lt;/ref&gt; (It was at the conservatory that Dvořák composed his famous [[E minor]] Symphony and subtitled it, at Thurber’s suggestion, ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|From the New World]]''.)&lt;ref name="Rubin1990"&gt;{{cite journal

==Active years==
The idea of federally funded national conservatory in the United States had been a dream of Thurber's, who had studied at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatory]] in her teens. In the early 1880s she convinced a number of philanthropists, including [[Andrew Carnegie]]. to sponsor the founding of such an institution. The idea was to model the institution after that of Paris in order to create a “national musical spirit.” &lt;ref name="Rubin1990" /&gt;  The conservatory  (originally the "American School of Opera")&lt;ref&gt;Rubin 1997, p.142&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated in the state of New York on September 21, 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Finck 1916, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The first director was Belgian baritone, [[Jacques Bouhy]]. Among the faculty was also [[Emma Fursh-Madi]], one of the great sopranos of the day. There were 84 students when the conservatory started operations, operating out of two converted homes near [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] at 126-128 East 17th St. in New York City.&lt;ref name="Finck 1916, p.5"&gt;Finck 1916, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin (above) indicates that the school was called the National School of Opera when it opened in the fall of 1885. In early 1886, the name was officially changed to the National Conservatory of Music in America. At the same time, a number of newspaper sources from 1886 and 1887 show the birth, short life and demise of another of Jeanette Thurber's projects, the [[American Opera Company]], which was founded in February 1886 in New York, changed its name to the National Opera Company in December, 1886, and finally went into bankruptcy and receivership in February, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear from sources exactly how much it cost to attend the conservatory or how scholarships were awarded. Some sources claim that no tuition was charged at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Juilliard: a history|last= Olmstead|first= Andrea|year= 1999|publisher= University of Illinois Press|location= Urbana, Illinois|isbn= 0-252-02487-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Finck, an NCMA music history lecturer for decades, wrote "It was not organized as a money-making institution, but as a musical high school ... for a merely nominal sum, or, if talented, without any charge for tuition.... [It was intended for those seeking a profession but] also for amateurs, for whom there are special courses."&lt;ref&gt;Finck 1916, p.4-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Its mission included "seeking out and encouraging female, minority and physically disabled students".&lt;ref&gt;Rubin 1997, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;  In any event, the cost of operations was originally met by Mrs. Thurber and others. After three years of existence, the conservatory petitioned the US congress for $200,000 to support the institution, saying that “…hundreds of candidates have had to be rejected from lack of room to accommodate them and of funds to increase the staff of Professors which would be required by their admittance….” &lt;ref&gt;”A Music Subsidy Asked” in ''The New York Times'', Feb. 21, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;  The petition failed. Thurber changed strategy and then proposed moving the conservatory to the nation’s capital, [[Washington D.C.]]. A bill to that effect was passed in congress and signed into law by President [[Benjamin Harrison]] in March, 1891.

A site for the new “national conservatory” in the District of Columbia was never selected, much less built. The school continued to function in New York City, existing solely from philanthropy. The school awarded substantial prizes to four composers after their works were judged at a March 30, 1893 concert at Madison Square Garden.&lt;ref&gt;Finck 1916, pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; In that year Dvořák and Thurber insisted that the Conservatory be "thrown open free of charge" to black students. "In the negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music," Dvořák wrote.&lt;ref name=MitU-Tick&gt;{{cite book|title=Music in the USA : A Documentary Companion|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=308–316|editor=Judith Tick|chapter=Late Nineteenth-Century Cultural Nationalism:The Paradigm of Dvorak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
By 1900, the school had educated about 3,000 students. After that date and after a rapidly changing series of directors, the National Conservatory of Music of America started to fade, not from a single catastrophic failure such as bankruptcy, but more through the declining energies of its driving force, Mrs. Thurber, herself. Additionally, there was increasing competition from other institutions in the area, including The Institute of Musical Art of the City of New York, founded in 1904 and then becoming the [[Juilliard School]] of Music in 1924. As well there were concerns from many private institutions that a federally funded national conservatory on the European model would reduce their own schools to the role of a “feeder system.” &lt;ref name="Rubin1990" /&gt;

In 1913 the school attempted to hire German composer [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] as director, but although he signed a contract, the Prussian government refused him permission.&lt;ref&gt;Finck 1916, p.21. NCMA offered Humperdinck $25,000 for 8 months.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1916 the school had moved to 126-128 West 79th Street.&lt;ref name="Finck 1916, p.5"/&gt;   By the 1920s, Mrs. Thurber’s National Conservatory of Music of America had faded to such obscurity that proposals from other quarters to fund a “national conservatory” were made in apparent ignorance that such an institution already existed. As late as 1928, Mrs. Thurber was still making her case that &lt;blockquote&gt;“At no time more than the present has the necessity for a national conservatory of music been so evident…the National Conservatory of Music, which was founded in 1885 and has been in existence for over 40 years, is the only institution of its kind which in scope and in organization is in conformity with the old established models…From its inception the plan…has been to establish a national conservatory of music in Washington with branches….” &lt;ref&gt;Thurber, Jeannette Meyers. Letter to the editor in ''The New York Times'', Jan. 21, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent [[Great Depression]] dried up monies from many philanthropic sources and spelled the end of conservatory. There is no record of operations after 1930.

==Legacy==
Musically, the National Conservatory of Music of America was a brief but bright light in the cultural life of the United States. It aimed to provide affordable musical education for all-comers, including the physically handicapped and African Americans. Its prestige was greatly enhanced by the directorship of Dvořák, and it offered a yearly prize in the area of “American music,” a competition that led to the recognition of a number of young composers from the United States.

[[File:NOLS Logo.tif|thumbnail|right]]
The '''National Outdoor Leadership School''' ('''NOLS''') is a non-profit [[outdoor education]] school based in the [[United States]] dedicated to teaching [[environmental ethics]], technical outdoors skills, wilderness medicine, risk management and judgment, and [[leadership]] on extended wilderness expeditions and in traditional classrooms. The NOLS mission is to be the leading source and teacher of wilderness skills and leadership that serve people and the environment. NOLS runs courses on six continents, with courses in a variety of [[wilderness]] environments and for almost any age group.

Courses feature both leadership and technical outdoor skills, which include [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[canoeing]], [[whitewater kayaking]], [[packraft]]ing, [[caving]], [[rock climbing]], [[fly fishing]], [[Packhorse|horse-packing]], [[sea kayaking]], [[mountaineering]], [[rafting]], [[sailing]], [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], and [[Wilderness medicine (practice)|wilderness medicine]]. NOLS has trained more than 280,000 students. Academic credit is available for all courses, through either the [[University of Utah]], [[Western State Colorado University]], or [[Central Wyoming College]]. NOLS also has direct credit agreements with many colleges and universities. NOLS is headquartered in [[Lander, Wyoming]].

==History==

===Early years===
NOLS was founded in 1965 by [[Paul Petzoldt]], a world-famous [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] and a member of the [[United States Army|Army]]'s [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], with the backing of three affluent Lander residents (Ed Breece, legislator and Petzoldt's brother-in-law; Jack Nicholas, legislator; and William Ericson, physician).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.humankinetics.com/products/all-products/teaching-adventure-education | title=Teaching Adventure Education Theory: Best Practices | publisher=Human Kinetics | date=2009 |author1=Stremba, Robert  |author2=Bisson, Christian A |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breece, Nicholas, and Ericson formed the nucleus of the early board of trustees. Petzoldt was also an early [[Outward Bound]] Chief Instructor, and he wanted to establish a school which promoted concentrating on refining outdoor leadership skills.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Henry|title=NOLS History|url=http://www.nols.edu/about/history/nols_history.shtml|publisher=National Outdoor Leadership School|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first facility opened in 1965 in [[Lander, Wyoming|Lander]], [[Wyoming]] at [[Sinks Canyon State Park|Sinks Canyon]].  June 8, 1965 marks the date of the founding and the first trip beginning at the trailhead of Hidden Valley Ranch where 100 male students went into the Wind River Range.  In the beginning, NOLS struggled with finances to provide necessities for outdoor trips, so Petzoldt and his early team developed the “uniform” made of Salvation Army donations.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt; The school began to grow in the early years and in 1966, women were allowed to enroll. In 1967, the Adventure Courses began for young boys aged 13–15.

In 1971, the administrative offices were moved to downtown [[Lander, Wyoming]], where NOLS is still based today. NOLS has facilities in [[Alaska]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Idaho]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]], [[Tanzania]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[India]]. It also runs wilderness medicine courses in a variety of other locations around the world.

==="30 Days to Survival"===
NOLS grew enormously during the 1970s, due to the publicity gained by an appearance on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Alcoa Hour]]''. The episode, titled "30 Days to Survival," followed a NOLS course as they traveled through the [[Wind River Range]].&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt; The school's focus became more [[ecology|ecological]]; [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[conservation movement|preservation]] began to rank with leadership training in terms of emphasis. As a result of the airing, the school’s enrollment grew from 250 students in 1969 to over 750 in 1970. The school also gained publicity in December 1969 from the Life magazine article, “Last Mountain Man? Not If He Can Help It," which featured the school and [[Paul Petzoldt]]. The school's growth continued; by the end of 1976, NOLS had 40 instructors and from 1976 to 1977, had enrolled 1,523 students.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

===1980s to Today===

During the 1980s, NOLS continued to evolve. NOLS partnered with the [[University of Utah]] to offer college credit for courses, and helped create the U.S. [[leave no trace|Leave No Trace]] program. In 1989, NOLS adopted an [[outcome-based education]] model. In 1999, NOLS acquired the [[Wilderness Medicine Institute]], one of the nation's foremost trainers of wilderness medicine. NOLS also began to offer professional training to corporate and institutional clients, including NASA.

In the summer of 2001, the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|space shuttle Columbia]] completed a 12-day, 50-mile expedition in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming with [http://www.nols.edu/nolspro/ NOLS Professional Training]. These same seven crewmembers were the crew on the space shuttle Columbia that broke up upon returning to Earth on February 1, 2003.  When on the course, the crewmembers commented on the group cohesion the course helped them develop, as well as the similarities to space flight: “we spent a whole lot of time together as a team solving problems without any other outside influences, which is similar to the way that it will be in space,” said crewmember Laurel Clark. NOLS has continued to train NASA astronauts.

In the summer of 2013, NOLS designed, developed, and led [http://expeditiondenali.nols.edu/ Expedition Denali], the first team of African Americans to attempt to climb [[Denali]] (Mt. McKinley), the United States’ highest peak at 20,320 feet. The summit attempt was not successful due to weather conditions, but the outreach work that NOLS and Expedition Denali members did before and after the expedition expanded the awareness of organizations and individuals about people of color engaging in the outdoors and in providing youth of color with role models to pursue their own outdoor interests. A film, [http://www.anamericanascent.com/ An American Ascent], was made throughout the expedition and has been shown in film festivals and schools around the country as well as the White House on July 3, 2015. Author James Edward Mills wrote [http://joytripproject.com/the-adventure-gap/ The Adventure Gap], a book chronicling the expedition as well as the history of African Americans in the outdoors in the United States.

==Curriculum==

===Leave No Trace===

The Leave No Trace National Program began in the 1960s as the [[United States Forest Service|USDA Forest Service]] looked for ways to help people take care of the public lands they were visiting in increasing numbers. In the early 1990s NOLS partnered with the Forest Service on the program. 1994 marks the founding of the [[Leave No Trace|Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics]], a non-profit organization.&lt;ref name="NOLS LNT page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leave No Trace Overview|url=http://www.nols.edu/lnt/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principles of [[Leave No Trace]] concern minimizing the social and environmental impacts which have led to ecological degradation. The program serves as an education tool to provide guidance for how to behave while camping in the backcountry. The [https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles seven principles] are: 
# Plan ahead and prepare.
# Travel and camp on durable surfaces.
# Dispose of waste properly.
# Leave what you find.
# Minimize campfire impacts.
# Respect wildlife.
# Be considerate of other visitors.”&lt;ref name="Confer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Confer|first=John J.|title=Magazines as Wilderness Information Sources: Assessing Users’ General Wilderness Knowledge and Specific Leave No Trace Knowledge|url=http://wilderness.net/library/documents/science1999/Volume4/Confer_4-26.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NOLS Wilderness Medicine===
Founded by Melissa Gray and Buck Tilton in Pitkin, Colorado in 1990, the Wilderness Medicine Institute (WMI) was purchased by NOLS in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOLS Timeline|url=https://www.nols.edu/en/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now known as NOLS Wilderness Medicine, it is one of the leading wilderness medicine training organizations in both the United States and internationally.

The school maintained its headquarters in Pitkin, Colorado until the summer of 2002, at which point the offices and administrative staff moved to Lander, WY and into the newly finished NOLS international headquarters. In January 2007, WMI entered into a partnership with Landmark Learning of Cullowhee, NC in order to provide wilderness medicine courses in the American southeast. Then, in 2010 WMI entered into a partnership with REI, Inc. to offer wilderness medicine courses through the REI Outdoor School. In addition, more than 350 organizations sponsor courses each year. 

NOLS WIlderness Medicine provides [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/wilderness-first-aid-WFA/ Wilderness First Aid] (WFA), [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/wilderness-advanced-first-aid-WAFA/ Wilderness Advanced First Aid] (WAFA), [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/wilderness-first-responder-WFR/ Wilderness First Responder] (WFR), [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/wilderness-upgrade-for-medical-professionals-WUMP/ Wilderness Upgrade for Medical Professionals] (WUMP), [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/wilderness-emt-WEMT/ Wilderness Emergency Medical Technician] (WEMT), [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/wilderness-medicine-professional-practitioner/ Wilderness Medicine for the Professional Practitioner] (WMPP), [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/wilderness-first-responder-recertification-WFRR/ Wilderness First Responder Recertification] (WFRR) and [https://www.nols.edu/en/courses/courses/hybrid-wilderness-first-responder-recertification-HWRR/ Hybrid Wilderness First Responder Recertification] (HWRR) courses. NOLS Wilderness Medicine also provides a [https://www.nols.edu/en/coursefinder/courses/wilderness-medicine-and-rescue-semester-WMR/ Wilderness Medicine and Rescue semester], custom courses, courses for medical students and physicians, and combination courses in conjunction with NOLS Custom Education and NOLS Expeditions. NOLS Wilderness Medicine runs over 950 courses each year and educated 21,935 students in 2017. It is the largest provider of pre-hospital wilderness medicine training in the world.

===Leadership===

Leadership education is the hallmark of NOLS' curriculum. NOLS uses four roles and seven skills as a framework to define ideal leadership characteristics. The curriculum's goal is to push students to use leadership skills and teamwork to rise up to challenges faced while on remote, backcountry excursions. The four roles of leadership are: designated leadership, active [[followership]], peer leadership, and self leadership. The seven skills of leadership are: expedition behavior, vision and action, communication, judgement and decision-making, self-awareness, tolerance for adversity, and competence.

Expedition behavior refers to having a positive attitude, respect for others, an awareness of the needs of other group members, and a willingness to place group needs above individual ones. NOLS teaches that it is only through good expedition behavior that groups can successfully collaborate to achieve goals that would be impossible for an individual to achieve on his or her own. All NOLS courses rely on expedition behavior as the underlying basis for successful cooperation.

Competence is the mastering of wilderness skills and potential for personal growth and to gain more knowledge. Communication involves effectively communicating interpersonally and with the group on both verbal and nonverbal levels. Judgment and decision-making involve making decisions that benefit the group, given unique circumstances, both externally and internally to the group. Tolerance for adversity and uncertainty refers to being flexible to various challenges, and being able to respond in a calm, concise, effective manner. Leadership should keep the positive attitude and work through the issues in a responsible manner. Self-awareness is defined as the skill to realize, interpret, and respond to one's own personal needs, as well as recognizing strengths and weaknesses, and compensating for them accordingly. This skill is imperative in the backcountry because it empowers the individual to take responsibility for his or her health. Taking care of their safety and health is important to being able to function properly and making strong decisions. Vision and action refers to having the initiative to lead a group and seeing the possibilities for moving the group toward a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Gookin, John. "Chapter Eight: Teaching Leadership."

===Outdoor Skills===

Skills taught on NOLS courses include [[backpacking (travel)|backpacking]], [[canoeing]], [[caving]], [[climbing]], [[fly-fishing]], horsepacking, [[mountaineering]], [[rafting]], [[river kayaking]], [[sailing]], [[sea kayaking]], [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], etc. Students gain insight into how to choose equipment, clothing, and how to feed themselves in the outdoors. They learn that proper hygiene is essential to prevent illnesses. [[Leave No Trace]] principles show students how to travel in the outdoors with minimum impact.&lt;ref name=Curriculum/&gt;

===Environmental studies===

Throughout the courses students learn about [[Leave No Trace]] principles and practice them. Students gain insight into the history of their location by reading about and discussing the plants, animals, geology, etc. of their surroundings. Students delve into the environmental issues around the area and humans' environmental ethics regarding the topics.&lt;ref name=Curriculum/&gt;

===Risk management===

Risk management is a part of the curriculum and plays a large role in how the school approaches new course areas and course types. In the field, risk management revolves around self-care, preventing injury, and handling risky situations. Students learn about proper foot care and body temperature regulation. Judgment and group decision making is taught through experience leading daily travel and through targeted classes. Classes include a framework for classifying objective and subjective risks encountered in the wilderness with an emphasis on making thoughtful decisions. Emergency procedures are put into place and taught to all students in case a student or staff member is injured or lost.&lt;ref name=Curriculum/&gt;

Additionally NOLS, along with [[Outward Bound USA]] and the [[Student Conservation Association]], sponsors the [[Wilderness Risk Management Conference]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3070">'''Nativ College Leadership Program''' is the [[gap year]] program in [[Israel]], run by [[United Synagogue Youth]]. It includes an academic component in fall semester, travel, and a community service component in spring semester. It is associated with [[Conservative Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Nativ.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forward.com/articles/9209/&lt;/ref&gt;

The program had a record enrollment of 106 participants in 2007, which was prior to the recent recession in the United States. This came at a time of increased enrollment for several gap year programs in Israel, which was attributed by Keith Berman of [[Young Judaea]]'s Year Course to calm in Israel. Others cited growth in financial aid, and growing acceptance of gap years in general in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/post-high-school-year-in-israel-gains-traction-1.229049&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativ numbers fell 30% with the North American recession in 2008–2009 along with other gap year programs, but recovered in 2009–2010 from 80 to 95 students. David Keren of United Synagogue Youth said that people were getting used to the financial crisis and that Nativ conducted aggressive marketing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/gap-year-israel-program-numbers-begin-to-rebound-1.300878&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tracks==
Each student who goes on Nativ gets to choose from different options for their academic semester (fall) and community service semester (spring). All participants are based in Jerusalem, near the city center, during the first semester, their options include: attending the Rothberg International School at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] on Mount Scopus, learning at the [[Conservative Yeshiva]], or taking Ulpan classes in the broader Jerusalem community. For the spring semester Naitv-ers have traditionally been able to choose from either a kibbutz or city track. For many years Kibbutz Saad, and then Kibbutz Ein Tzurim, hosted Nativ participants for the spring semester. Recently, due to security issues with the kibbutz's location close to the border with Gaza, the kibbutz option has been moved to [[Kfar Hasidim]] a youth village in the north of Israel near [[Haifa]]. Another option for participants is to move into a developing community in either [[Yeruham]] or [[Karmiel]] and volunteer within the community there. Possible service options are teaching English in local high schools and yeshivot, joining the [[Magen David Adom]] ambulance corps, volunteering in kindergartens and preschools, as well as other opportunities that might change year to year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nativ.org/the-nativ-program.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preschool education|Preschool]] programs, which are less formal and usually not mandated by law, are generally not considered part of primary education. The first year of primary education is commonly referred to as ''[[kindergarten]]'' and begins at or around age&amp;nbsp;5 or 6. Subsequent years are usually numbered being referred to as ''first grade'', ''second grade'', and so forth. Elementary schools normally continue through sixth grade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqc_Ga282FwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=middle%20school%20typically%20span%20grade%207-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiesNmgkKLPAhUq_4MKHTjFAH84ChDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=middle%20school%20typically%20span%20grade%207-8&amp;f=false|title=The Condition of Education 2013|first1=Susan|last1=Aud|first2=National Center for Education|last2=Statistics|first3=Institute of Education Sciences|last3=(U.S.)|first4=Thomas|last4=Nachazel|first5=Sidney|last5=Wilkinson-Flicker|first6=Allison|last6=Dziuba|date=18 November 2013|publisher=Government Printing Office|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the students normally complete when they are age 11 or 12. Some elementary schools graduate after the 4th or 5th grade and transition students into a [[middle school]].

In 2001, there were 92,858 elementary schools (68,173 public, 24,685 private) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372 |title=Fast Facts |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elementary school (Kindergarten through grade 1/2/3/4/5)==
{{Main|Elementary school (United States)}}

Students may attend either a 5-year 6-year or 7-year public or private elementary school. [[Elementary school (United States)|Elementary school]] usually runs from [[kindergarten]] or 1st grade through either 5th or 6th, depending on the region. Upon successful completion of their elementary education students then proceed to [[middle school]], ([[High School in the UK]]) also known as junior high school.  Depending on the school district, some students attend separate middle schools, beginning at 6th grade and then completing at 8th grade before they transition to high school. Additionally, students may have the option of attending elementary schools that include all eight primary grades. In this case, the student will directly proceed to High School.

In most U.S. [[elementary schools]], students have all their core classes from one or two homeroom teachers (as opposed to middle and high schools that typically have students rotate from one specialized teacher to the next throughout the day). In some elementary schools, when funding and supplies are adequate, additional teachers are hired to instruct students in areas such as art and music.

'''Stella Jane Reekie,''' (29 July 1922 - 28 September 1982) was a missionary and inter-faith worker who worked with refugees during World War II and later, set up the [[Church of Scotland]]'s International Flat in Glasgow for refugees and immigrants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/367680960|title=The biographical dictionary of Scottish women : from the earliest times to 2004|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Ewan, Elizabeth., Innes, Sue., Reynolds, Sian.|year=|isbn=9780748626601|location=Edinburgh|pages=300|oclc=367680960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life ==
Reekie was born in Gravesend on 29 July 1922.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was the daughter of Arthur Reekie and Jane Reekie and was the youngest of eight siblings. She attended the Bronte Villas School and then Gravesend Country School for Girls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Working Life ==
=== Early career ===
While working in the nursery at [[Cadby Hall]] during [[World War II]], Reekie visited the Greek Embassy and watched a film shown by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] detailing the wartime conditions and deprivation in Europe, and the need for relief workers. While continuing to work, Reekie trained with the Red Cross to work overseas with refugees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.gov.scot/improvement/documents/rme10-interfaith.pdf|title=Beliefs and Values: Interfaith Issues|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bergen Belsen ===
[[File:S J Reekie, a British trained nurse.jpg|thumb|Stella Jane Reekie working with orphans after the liberation of [[Bergen Belsen]] in June 1945]]
As a British nurse and childcare specialist who trained with the Red Cross, in 1945 Reekie sailed with a group of other workers to Belgium. [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen Belsen concentration camp]] was discovered on April 15, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006188|title=The 11th Armoured Division (Great Britain)|website=www.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a civilian, Reekie worked within the Polish School at Bergen Belsen catering for the physical needs of nearly 500 children between the ages of 7 and 16.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Following the closure of Bergen Belsen, Reekie oversaw the Children's Block of the British Red Cross Hospital for T.B. displaced persons at [[Bad Rehburg]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Pakistan ===
From 1949-1951, Stella studied to become a missionary at [[St Colm's College]] in Edinburgh. In 1951 a group of missionaries, including Reekie, sailed from Liverpool on the S.S. Cilicia for Karachi and Bombay. Reekie worked at the Welfare Centre in the Sialkot district of Karachi, where training was given to local midwives and clinics were organised for mothers and babies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Reekie visited villages on foot helping women in many practical ways such as delivering relief food and clothing, and promoting and supervising women's sewing; defending their work against the traditional views of men and missionary wives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The International Flat ===
In 1968 Reekie returned to Scotland and was appointed by the Home Board of the [[Church of Scotland]] to work three days a week in Glasgow with displaced people and those in need.  Suitable accommodation was required as a safe place for the refugees.  Originally Reekie used her own tenement flat and in 1972 the Church of Scotland bought a flat at 20 Glasgow Street which became known as the International Flat where refugees, immigrants and their families were welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Glasgow Herald|last=Sanctuary in a City Tenement|first=|date=20 April 1981|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 28 September 1982 Reekie died after suffering from cancer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk|title=Home|website=www.saltiresociety.org.uk|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8792">'''Student–teacher ratio''' or '''student–faculty ratio''' is the number of students who attend a [[school]] or [[university]] divided by the number of teachers in the institution. For example, a student–teacher ratio of 10:1 indicates that there are 10 students for every one teacher. The term can also be reversed to create a teacher–student ratio.

The ratio is often used as a proxy for [[class size]], although various factors can lead to class size varying independently of student–teacher ratio (and vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBZCxM1-Pg8C&amp;pg=PA46|pages=45–46|title=Does Measurement Measure Up?: How Numbers Reveal and Conceal the Truth|first=John M.|last=Henshaw|isbn=9780801883750|year=2006|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, the student–teacher ratio will be significantly lower than the average class size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZXSTgRueeMC&amp;pg=PA37|page=37|title=Multilevel Modeling of Social Problems: A Causal Perspective|first=Robert B |last=Smith|isbn=9789048198559|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student–teacher ratios vary widely among developed countries.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}} In [[primary education]], the average student–teacher ratio among members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] is just below 16, but ranges from 40 in Brazil to 28 in Mexico to 11 in Hungary and Luxembourg.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}}

==Relationship to class size==

Factors that can affect the relationship between student–teacher ratio and class size include the number of teachers with non-teaching duties, the number of classes per teacher, and the number of teachers per class. In addition, if there are small classes for a small number of students, for example for [[special education]] or [[second language]] learners, the student–teacher ratio for the institution will be misleadingly low relative to the average student's experience.{{sfn|Henshaw|2006|p=46}}

An example of this variation is that both Israel and the United States have an average student–faculty ratio of 15, but the average class size is 21 in the United States but 27 in Israel.{{sfn|OECD|2014|p=447}}

== Background ==

A low student–teacher ratio is often used as a [[marketing|selling point]] to those choosing schools for [[tertiary education]]. On the other hand, high student–teacher ratio is often cited for criticizing proportionately underfunded schools or school systems, or as evidence of the need for legislative change or more funding for education.

In the [[United States]], some states have enacted [[legislation]] mandating a maximum student–teacher ratio for specific grade levels, particularly [[kindergarten]]. When such figures are stated for schools, they often represent averages ([[mean]]s) and thus are vulnerable to [[Skewness|skewing]]. For example, figures may be biased as follows: if one classroom has a 30:1 ratio and another has a 10:1 ratio, the school could thus claim to have a 20:1 ratio overall. In schools, such ratios are indicative of possible staff changes. If the student–teacher ratio is 50:1, the school will probably consider hiring a few teachers. If the ratio is very low, classes could be combined and teachers fired. In extreme cases, the school may close, due to its apparent redundancy.

Classes with too many students are often disrupting to education. Also, too many students in a class results in a diverse field of students, with varying degrees of learning ability. Consequently, the class will spend time for less academic students to assimilate the information, when that time could be better spent progressing through the [[curriculum]]. In this way, student–teacher ratios are compelling arguments for advanced or honors classes.

== Arguments ==

Numerous sources argue that lower student–teacher ratios are better at teaching students complex subjects, such as physics, mathematics and chemistry, than those with a higher ratio of students to teachers. Commonly, the schools with lower student–teacher ratios are more exclusive, have a higher attendance of whites and are in non-inner urban areas and/or fee-paying (non-government) institutions.&lt;ref name="Brookings"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Card |authorlink=David Card |author2=Alan B. Krueger |author2-link=Alan B. Krueger  |chapter=School Quality and the Return to Education |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3UIwF9P1WUC&amp;pg=PA118 |editor=Gary Burtless |editor-link=Gary Burtless |title=Does money matter?: the effect of school resources on student achievement and adult success |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |year=1996 |pages=118–119 |isbn=0-8157-1274-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifold arguments and controversies of funding and student–teacher ratios have been the basis for a multitude of studies and debates. One view is illustrated below:
{{quotation|Many analysts have found that extra school resources play a negligible role in improving student achievement while children are in school. Yet many economists have gathered data showing that students who attend well-endowed schools grow up to enjoy better job market success than children whose education takes place in schools where resources are limited. For example, children who attend schools with a lower pupil–teacher ratio and a better educated teaching staff appear to earn higher wages as adults than children who attend poorer schools.&lt;ref name="Brookings" /&gt;}}

Smaller classes are widely believed to benefit all pupils because of individual attention from teachers, and low-attaining pupils are seen to benefit more at the [[secondary school]] level, where the content level is more challenging. Pupils in large classes drift off task because of too much instruction from the teacher to the whole class instead of individual attention, and low-attaining students are most affected.&lt;ref name="Blachford 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Peter | last = Blatchford | first2 = Paul | last2 = Bassett | first3 = Penelope | last3 = Brown | year = 2011 | title = Examining the effect of class size on classroom engagement and teacher—pupil interaction: Differences in relation to pupil prior attainment and primary vs. secondary schools | journal = Learning and Instruction | volume = 21 | pages = 715–30 | doi = 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.04.001 | url = http://www.classsizematters.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Examining-the-effect-of-class-size-on-classroom-engagement-and-Teacher-pupil-interaction-Differences-in-relation-to-pupil-prior-attainment-and-primary-vs.-secondary-schools.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students benefit in later grades from being in small classes during early grades. Longer periods in small classes resulted in more increases in achievement in later grades for all students. In reading and science, low achievers benefit more from being in small classes. The benefits of small class sizes reduce the student achievement gap in reading and science in later grades.&lt;ref name="Konstantopoulos 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Konstantopoulos | first = Spyros | last2 = Chung | first2 = Vicki | year = 2009 | title = What Are the Long-Term Effects of Small Classes on the Achievement Gap?

'''Technothlon''' is an international school championship organized by the students of [[Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati|IIT Guwahati]].  Technothlon began in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Technothlon [http://studentcompetitions.com/competitions/technothlon  began its journey in 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; with an aim to ‘Inspire Young Minds’. Starting on its journey with a participation of 200 students confined to the city of [[Guwahati]], over the next 12 years Technothlon has expanded its reach to over 300 cities all over India and various centers abroad.

The contest is organized over 2 rounds: a written preliminary examination, Prelims (which takes place in numerous schools all over India in July) and Mains - which is conducted at IIT Guwahati, among the top 100 students from each IX-X(Junior Squad) and XI-XII(Hauts Squad) class students. It is a team-based event -- two students participate as a team, attempting the paper together and also participate in the Mains event as a team.

==Aim==
Through a series of events involving mental aptitude, logic, and dexterity, it seeks to provide school students a platform to build fundamental experience and knowledge, to exercise co-ordination skills, and to think out of the box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technothlon.techniche.org/about    About page] of official Technothlon website&lt;/ref&gt; As its preliminary round is conducted through several centers in India, it is a competitive test of critical thinking. Its final round is conducted in IIT-Guwahati during Techniche, &lt;ref&gt;[http://techniche.org/techniche15/index.php#about About page] of official Techniche website&lt;/ref&gt; the annual Techno-Management festival of IIT Guwahati.

==History==
'''Technothlon 2004''' - started from a small room in the campus of IIT Guwahati with a participation of 200.

'''Technothlon 2005''' - took its first step forward; Science Exhibitions are conducted in Local Schools of Guwahati. Participation increased to 350.

'''Technothlon 2006''' covers [[Seven Sister States|the seven sisters]]. Participation went over 700.

'''Technothlon 2007''' reached [[Hyderabad]]. Participation reached the three figures.

'''Technothlon 2008''' became National. Participation reached four figures.

It was this year which has witnessed a manifold increase in the reach of '''Technothlon 2009''' with tie-up with nearly 1000 KV schools.  Over 60 nationwide media articles were published and it was conducted in 50+ centers all over India.

'''Technothlon 2010'''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/iit-guwahati-holds-technothlon/648459/  IIT Guwahati holds Technothlon]" - Indian express. July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=mar3011/city06  IITG Technothlon prelims on July 17]" - Assam tribune. March 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  went International. For the first time Technothlon was conducted abroad in the cities of Singapore and Dubai. Moreover, Technothlon also reached another milestone at the National level with the tie up with nearly 600 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas. This time the exam was held in 75+ cities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Technothlon-2010-preliminary-exam-to-be-held-on-July-18/articleshow/6128399.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the participation increased to around 120 cities and was held in about 150 centers. [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] – Nobel Laureate, Nobel Peace Prize 2007 &amp; Chairman of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change impressed the participants of the Mains round with his lectures in '''Technothlon 2011'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/techniche11-at-iit-guwahati/article2291129.ece "Techniche'11 at IIT Guwahati"] - ''The Hindu''. July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was witnessed by nearly 150 cities and around 200 centers, which included almost all the big states of India. Dr. Udaya Kumar, the maker of the Rupee symbol graced the event as the chief guest and also as a judge for "Final Showdown", Hauts during [[Techniche]].

During Mains, the participants were introduced to the very new and mystical world of Astronomy by the renowned Kepler Mission Manager at NASA Ames Research Center, Roger Hunter. Not only this, the students alsogot a chance to attend an exciting workshop on Humanoids by A-Set. Dr. Gautam Barua, Former Director (2003–2013), IIT Guwahati motivated the participants during the crucial nerve-racking hours of Final Showdown, Hauts.

'''Technothlon 2014''' expanded its reach to a whooping 200 cities, with almost 300 centres across India, making it the largest Technothlon then. And also, for the first time, the examination was also conducted with the question paper printed in Hindi. Technothlon also launched its own initiative - LED (Learn Experience Discover) - which involved the Technothlon organizers reaching out to the under-privileged students and demonstrating small science experiments, thus taking a step in introducing scientific temperament in the children. The top 50 teams, who made it to IIT Guwahati for the Mains got an amazing opportunity to interact with [[Christer Fuglesang]], Swedish physicist and ESA Astronaut, during which he shared with the participants the dazzling experiences of the space.

'''Technothlon 2015''' got even bigger and better, thanks to tie up with Kendriya Vidyalayas &amp; Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, bringing in huge participation, and which helped widening the reach quite remote places of the country (Eg. Naxalite affected Dantewada, Chhattisgarh) bringing in participation of 12000 students from these KVs and JNVs. The reach expanded to 350 examination centers across 250 cities in the country. Technothlon also launched its own blog, on which it followed some of the behind-the-scenes activity of the Technothlon team as well as an informative blog. And the highlight was a tie-up with [[UNICEF]] in inspiring young minds. During the Mains, the participants interacted with [[Claude Nicollier]], Swiss ESA and Professor at [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]].

==Eligibility and participant selection process==
Technothlon is conducted for students of class IX to XII. There are two squads for which the examination is held. The first is the Junior squad and the second is the Hauts squad. For a student to appear in the Junior squad examination, he/she must be VIII class passed and must not have appeared for the X boards i.e. The students should be studying in IX or X STD. For a student to be appearing for the Hauts squad examination, he/she must have passed the X board examination and not appeared for the XII board examination.
The members can belong to the same class or as well as different class. For example: a team consisting of one member from class IX and one of class X is perfectly acceptable. 
The basic requirements for team formation is that they should consist of exactly two members from the same squad and the same school.

===Modes of registration===
The interested students can register themselves for the examination online or offline. Technothlon is conducted over various cities and centers with the help of city representatives. The city representatives are responsible for collecting the registrations offline. Participating schools can collect the registration fees themselves and then prepare a demand draft to be handed over to the city representatives.

==Structure==

===Examination===
Students participate in teams of two. There are two squads:
:# Junior Squad – Students of classes 9th and 10th
:# Hauts Squad – Students of classes 11th and 12th
Technothlon is held in two stages:
:# Prelims: Generally held on 2nd or 3rd Sundays of July every Year
:# Mains: To be held at [[Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati|IIT Guwahati]] during [[Techniche]]- Held in 1st week of Sept every year

Prelims is in general an objective written exam. It involves no syllabus or general knowledge requirement and relies solely on the student’s logical and analytic thinking abilities. The exam is generally of 2 and ½ hour length. The question paper will have various sections like maths, puzzles, code crunchers etc. Each section has its own unique marking scheme.
It is held nationwide, at selected cities on the 3rd Sunday of the month of July.

Mains is an event based competition. The selected teams compete against each other of the same squad to complete the events. Each team will have to face 3 events from which top 5 teams from each squad will be selected for the Final Showdown. The events, like Prelims, do not require any prerequisite knowledge and students will be taught any extra knowledge they require. The events will vary every year. In addition to these, students can attend the workshops and fun events to spend the night.
Mains is conducted during "Techniche", the Techno-Management Festival of IIT Guwahati, held during the first week of September. Other than events, the students can witness the competitions of Techniche, attend the Lecture Series of famous personalities and watch laser shows and Nite performances.

===Technopedia and Techno Coup D'œil===
Technopedia is the online module of Technothlon providing the participants an exclusive experience before they give the preliminary exam, with monthly quizzes and the various articles which are added to the module regularly. It aims at increasing the thinking capabilities and analytical reasoning and also helping them prepare for Prelims.&lt;ref&gt;technothlon.techniche.org/technopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Technopedia generally consists of 10 questions divided into 10 levels. A higher level gets unlocked only after answering the questions in the preceding level correctly. It is updated on a monthly basis for about 6 months before the preliminary examination of Technothlon. Only the students who have registered for prelims may log onto Technopedia using the provided ID and password. Participants who are consistent in clearing Technopedia monthly may expect a SURPRISE gift during Techniche.

Techno Coup D'œil is a series of questions published on the official Facebook page of Technothlon, giving the followers of the page a feel of what the actual paper might be like.

===Selection process===
# Top 50 teams of each squad are selected on basis of their score in the Prelims examination.
# Top teams, which perform excellently from each of these squads are selected from the Events in Mains for the Final Showdown
# The winner of the Final Showdown is declared the Technothlon Champion.

===Rewards===
Other than the top 50 participants which are selected for mains in each squad; the next 200 participants in both the squads are awarded  Silver certificates from Techniche, IIT Guwahati. All the participants of the Mains will be served with accommodation for the four days during their stay at IIT Guwahati. All the teams attending the Mains events at IITG will also be given Gold certificates from Techniche, IITG. 

===Fees===
Technothlon and [[Techniche]], being non-profit organizations charge only an amount of Rs. 150 per team (of two students) as registration fees for the Prelims Examination conducted all over India which covers the examination conduction expenses.

'''The DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center''' is based at the [[University of Washington|University of Washington (UW)]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Founded in 1992, DO-IT’s mission is to increase the successful participation of [[people with disabilities]] in [[postsecondary education]] and careers, in [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] ([[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], [[mathematics]]) fields and careers, and in [[computing]] fields and careers throughout the U.S.  It directs the national AccessSTEM program, and co-directs the national AccessComputing Alliance focused on engaging people with disabilities in computing fields.

The Center is a unit of Accessible Technology Services of UW-IT at the University of Washington, a collaboration between the College of Engineering, the College of Education and UW-IT.  Primary funding for DO-IT and its projects is provided by the [[National Science Foundation]], the State of Washington, and the [[U.S. Department of Education]].
It promotes [[accessibility]] and [[universal design]] in [[learning]] environments and instruction, including [[Web accessibility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendels|first=Pamela|title=Barriers Online for Those With Disabilities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/11/cyber/articles/04disability.html|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the online Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) and by creating, collecting and distributing publications, training materials, and tutorials for use by educators and faculty throughout the U.S.

The Center works with international institutions and organizations to adapt its practices and programs for international application.  For example, the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]] has been replicated in [[Japan]] as DO-IT Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://doit-japan.org/ DO-IT Japan] Retrieved 2013-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt; a summer program hosted by the [[University of Tokyo]]. [[South Korea]], through the leadership of [[Seoul National University]] and [[Korea Nazarene University]], also hosts a similar summer study program in collaboration with the DO-IT Center.

==History==

The DO-IT Center was founded at the University of Washington in 1992 by Dr. Sheryl Burgstahler with a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). Since its inception, DO-IT's mission has been to increase the successful participation of people with disabilities in postsecondary education and careers at local, regional, national (within the United States) and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, S, [http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Programs/ar93.html "DO-IT Center Annual Report 1992 - 1993"], DO-IT Center, 1993. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, with funding from NSF, DO-IT launched the first [[DO-IT Scholars Program]]. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) funded the DO-IT Prof project, which created professional development materials and trained faculty and academic administrators in the U.S. to more fully include students with disabilities in their courses.&lt;ref name="doit funding overivew"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/access_college.html "AccessCollege: Systemic Change for Postsecondary Institutions"], DO-IT Center. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, OPE and the NSF funded DO-IT’s AccessCollege project.&lt;ref name="doit funding overivew"/&gt; AccessCollege staff worked with a team of faculty and administrators representing twenty-three two- and four-year institutions in the U.S.; the project included creation of the web-based Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE), publication of the book ''Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burgstahler | first = Sheryl |author2=Burgstahler, S. |author3=Cory, R. | year = 2008 | title = Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TUEmAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice&amp;dq=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice | publisher  = Harvard Education Press | isbn = 9781891792915}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the training manual ''Building Capacity for a Welcoming and Accessible Postsecondary Institution''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/cbiN/index_pdf.html "Building Capacity for a Welcoming and Accessible Postsecondary Institution"], DO-IT Center. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
In 2006, with funding from the NSF, the DO-IT Center partnered with [[University of Washington|University of Washington's]] Department of Computer Science and Engineering to launch the AccessComputing Alliance, a nationwide program to increase the participation of people with disabilities in computing fields. In 2006, AccessComputing partners included [[Gallaudet University]] in Washington, D.C., [[Microsoft]], the NSF Regional Alliances for Persons with Disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (hosted by the [[University of Southern Maine]], [[New Mexico State University]] and University of Washington), and American Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Accessible Computing. As of 2013, 32 postsecondary institutions and organizations are partnered with AccessComputing.&lt;ref name="accesscomputing"/&gt;
The program provides summer research programs and internships open to all U.S. students.&lt;ref name="accesscomputing"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/ AccessComputing], DO-IT Center. Retrieved 2013-02-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The DO-IT Center's programs are centered on the concept of identifying the "critical junctures" students with disabilities face on their path to postsecondary education and careers, and providing resources, projects and programs to help students successfully navigate these critical junctures (e.g., projects to develop STEM interests in students with disabilities at the "critical juncture" between high school and the transition to a four- or two-year postsecondary institution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Rachel|title=UW offers deaf, hard of hearing chance to excel at computer academy|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/UW-offers-deaf-hard-of-hearing-chance-to-excel-1243067.php|accessdate=8 March 2013|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   DO-IT programs for students include AccessComputing, AccessSTEM, the [[DO-IT Scholars Program]] (for Washington State students), postsecondary preparation activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindblom|first=Mike|title=They've A Mind To Excel -- UW's Do-It Program Prepares Disabled Students For College Science Studies|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980814&amp;slug=2766540|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=August 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work-based experiences and internships.

'''''The Emergence of the American University''''' is a non-fiction book in the [[history of education]] by [[Laurence Veysey]], published in the 1965 by [[University of Chicago Press]]. It "trac[es] the development of the modern American university during its formative years from 1865 to 1910".&lt;ref&gt;
Braeman, John. (1967). [http://doi.org/10.2307/1979274 Review of ''The Emergence of the American University'']. The Journal of Higher Education, 38(3), 172–174.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on and shortened from Veysey's doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Hangartner, Carl A. (1966) Veysey, Laurence R. ''The Emergence of the American University'' (Book Review) Manuscripta, 10(3):185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

Deemed "a major contribution to the history and sociology of American education" when first published,&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph, Frederick, (1966) review of ''The Emergence of the American University'', [[Journal of American History]], 53 (3):616–617.&lt;/ref&gt; the book continues to garner attention decades after its publication.

'''''Two Point Hospital''''' is a 2018 business [[simulation game]] developed by [[Two Point Studios]] and published by [[Sega]] for [[Linux]], [[MacOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. A [[spiritual successor]] to [[Bullfrog Productions]]' 1997 game ''[[Theme Hospital]]'', ''Two Point Hospital'' puts players in the role of a hospital administrator tasked with constructing and operating a hospital (and, by extension, an empire of hospitals in the fictional Two Point County, where the game is set) with the goal of curing patients of fictitious, comical ailments. The game was designed and developed by some of the creators of ''Theme Hospital'', including [[Mark Webley]] and [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]]. They made use of their expertise in developing games such as ''Theme Hospital'' and ''[[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]]'' and wanted players to be confident in using the menus. The use of humour was deemed important because visiting real hospitals is unpopular.

''Two Point Hospital'' was released to a positive reception from critics, who acclaimed it for its style, humour and its faithfulness to ''Theme Hospital'''s aesthetics, but the game was criticised for its repetitiveness and lack of challenge.

After they left Bullfrog, Webley and Carr continued to discuss a follow-up to ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Their first attempt was ''ER Tycoon'', which was planned during Carr's time at Mucky Foot Productions but was cancelled because they could not find a publisher for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints |title=Footprints: The rise and fall of Mucky Foot |accessdate=10 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322084411/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints |archivedate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mucky Foot closed in 2003 and Carr joined Lionhead; however, ongoing projects did not permit the continuation of the ''Theme'' concept. In 2015, Carr left Lionhead, which was closed by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] the following year. Webley had left the studio in 2013. They designed to found [[Two Point Studios]] to follow up on the ''Theme'' idea. Webley stated, "Gary and I have been talking about this project for a number of years and are really excited to be announcing Two Point Studios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/16/theme-hospital-creators-announce-two-point-hospital-7234494/ |title=Theme Hospital creators announce Two Point Hospital |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=16 January 2018 |accessdate=17 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116191605/http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/16/theme-hospital-creators-announce-two-point-hospital-7234494/ |archivedate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VentureBeat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; 

The timing of a ''Theme Hospital''-style game was also apt: Art director Mark Smart said making a hospital-simulation game "felt right" and that there was "a lot of love for Theme Hospital", while studio co-founder and technical director Ben Hymers said players had been wanting a sequel to ''Theme Hospital'' for years.&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; According to Webley and Carr, ''Two Point Hospital'' is a completely new game, rather than a reapplication of new assets to an existing game.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Carr said "I wanted to work on something like Theme Hospital again, appealing to a broader range of people".&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; The game was developed by envisioning fictional symptoms, often based on word play, and the means for the player to cure them, and determining which ones most attracted the attention of the development team.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Webley and Carr also wanted to develop a graphics style that would remain "future-proof" relative to changes in graphics rendering technology, and opted to use [[claymation]]-like effects, which they found made it easy for players to observe on-screen situations and would not become dated.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt;

Online features were an early target of the design of ''Two Point Hospital''; Webley and Carr recognised that players of management games tend to prefer single-player experiences. They designed the online elements of the game to be opt-in and to feature asynchronous gameplay elements, including multiplayer challenges. Players would be tasked with achieving objectives such as curing patients within a set number of months and their scores would be placed on online leaderboards. Players would be able to view their  progress compared to that of friends and other players during the challenge from these leaderboards, an approach Webley and Carr took from [[ghost (video gaming)|ghosts]] that are used in some arcade racing games.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; ''Theme Hospital'' was recognised as one of the first games with support for [[mod (video gaming)|mods]]; Webley and Carr said ''Two Point Hospital'' would feature mod support, which will not be available at launch.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt;

To produce the game, Webley and Carr considered a few approaches to developing the game before signing with Sega. They originally considered [[crowdfunding]] the development through [[Kickstarter]]; they spoke to Playtonic Games, which had used Kickstarter to revive a 1990s property ''[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|Banjo-Kazooie]]'' for ''[[Yooka-Laylee]]''. Shortly afterwards, however, they found video game development via Kickstarter was waning and decided this approach was too risky.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; They also considered taking an [[early access]] approach.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt; Hymers suggested they approach Sega as a publisher, which was fortuitous because Sega wanted to expand their profile with games similar to ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt; While they were in negotiations with Sega, they selected a number of [[Lionhead Studios]] developers to help with ''Two Point Hospital''{{'}}s development, but Microsoft closed Lionhead in April 2016 before the Sega deal was complete and they had to quickly choose their staff on limited funds, building the team more quickly than they had planned.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt;

According to Hymers, the developers used their experience in making games including ''Theme Hospital'', ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', and ''[[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]]'' to make ''Two Point Hospital'', which ''GamesTM'' described as "engrossing time-vacuum gameplay".&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; Smart said the team wanted the game to be accessible and not throw players in at the deep end, and that they wanted players to have confidence when examining the sub-menus and realising the level of strategy involved. Smart also said people do not like to visit hospitals and that using humour makes a difference. According to Smart, the ailments were concocted backwards; someone would decide that they wanted something and the team worked from that, or that they worked on them from "terrible puns".&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt;

Hymers said queues of patients and their movement along corridors was difficult to produce because the game is in 3D, which raised questions about wall thickness and cell width. He compared these elements with their counterparts in ''Theme Hospital'' and believed it was much easier in that game, which is 2D with graphics made from [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and that people were drawn in front of the walls. He also stated that making people avoid each other was tricky.&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; The game was developed using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=“We want to build out a world of sim games” &lt;br&gt; How Two Point Hospital is a step toward bringing Bullfrog-era sim games back from the dead |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/16/theme-park-sequel-details/ |website=Rock Paper Shotgun |accessdate=18 July 2018 |date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712122348/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/16/theme-park-sequel-details/ |archive-date=12 July 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later patch for the game featured character customisation, and a "[[copy and paste]]" rooms feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/535930/announcements/detail/2694733067859957921?utm|title=Coming This Week: Customisation Update!|publisher=[[Two Point Studios]]|website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Two Point Hospital'' received critical acclaim. Media review aggregation website [[Metacritic]] summarised the game as garnering "Generally favorable reviews".{{efn|name=mc}}&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt;

The game received praise for its nostalgia compared with that of ''Theme Hospital'' and its improvements over it. Rachel Weber of ''[[Games Radar]]'' was positive about the game's use of nostalgia, stating that the game had "taken the funny bones" from the original and transplanted them into ''Two Point Hospital''.&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; Weber also praised other aspects of the game, calling it a "delight".&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; Johnny Chiodini of ''[[EuroGamer]]'' stated that the game "stays true to the spirit of its sort-of predecessor" in ''Theme Hospital'', and that it was a "modernised successor".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; Chiodini also called the game a "welcome reinvention of a childhood classic".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; The game's similarity to ''Theme Hospital'' was also praised by ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', who said it "extends beyond its predecessor both in terms of detail and scope" and that ''Theme Hospital'' had been replaced by "something better".&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; ''[[GamesTM]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "Theme Hospital 2.0" and "A modern take on a beloved title", but also believed that it could have distanced itself from it more.&lt;ref name=GamesTMRev /&gt; Similar compliments about the game's similarities to ''Theme Hospital'' were given by [[Jeuxvideo.com]] and James Ide of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name=JVRev /&gt;&lt;ref name=MirrorRev /&gt; Even before release, Dominic Tarason of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "Theme Hospital 2 in all but name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dominic Tarason |title=A longer peek behind the curtain at Two Point Hospital |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/26/a-longer-peek-behind-the-curtain-at-two-point-hospital/ |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by ''[[Bit-Tech]]''{{'}}s Rick Lane, who described ''Two Point Hospital'' as ''Theme Hospital''{{'}}s "sequel in all but name".&lt;ref name=BTRev /&gt; Jacob Bukacek of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' was of the opinion that ''Two Point Hospital'' used ''Theme Hospital'' as a base for improvement and remarked that it "isn’t Theme Hospital remade; It’s Theme Hospital improved".&lt;ref name=HCGRev /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Ben Reeves thought that [[Two Point Studios]] had done "a remarkable job reviving Theme Hospital".&lt;ref name=gameinformer /&gt; ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "the perfect cure" for "Bullfrog deficiency" and said it is precisely what ''Theme Hospital'' fans wanted it to be.&lt;ref name=GMRev /&gt;

Critics also praised the game's humorous content. UK newspaper ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' regarded the "amusing script and visual humour" of ''Two Point Hospital'' as one of its best features, calling it "endearing".&lt;ref name=MetroRev&gt;{{Cite web |title=Game review: Two Point Hospital creates a healthy obsession |author= |work=Metro |access-date=3 September 2018 |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/31/two-point-hospital-review-healthy-obsession-7899066/ |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904224617/https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/31/two-point-hospital-review-healthy-obsession-7899066/ |archive-date=4 September 2018 |dead-url=no  |date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nic Rueben of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' also commented on the game's humour, writing; "it’s not that any individual element is hilarious – it’s more of an infinite dads pulling infinite crackers sort of scenario. It just feels comfy, goofy and pleasant&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="RPS" /&gt; ''GamesTM'' believed the humour was taken from Bullfrog and praised its balance, saying the game is not "trying too hard" and keeps it light-hearted.&lt;ref name=GamesTMRev /&gt; Jason Coles of the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' also liked the game's "Good sense of humour" and abundance of puns.&lt;ref name=DailyStarRev /&gt; James Swinbanks of ''[[GameSpot]]'' echoed these sentiments by describing the game's "British" sense of humour as the game's "overwhelming charm",&lt;ref name=GSRev /&gt; as did Paul Tamburro of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' with his description of the game as "delightfully lighthearted",&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt; and ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Rachel Weber's concurrence with Swinbanks about the humour's Britishness.&lt;ref name=GRadar /&gt; ''[[Shacknews]]'''s Chris Jarrard compared the game's "outstanding" radio station to ''[[SimCity 2000]]''{{'}}s (which he described as "nonsensical") news system.&lt;ref name=SNRev /&gt;

Jose Cabrera of ''[[IGN|IGN Spain]]'' was positive about gameplay but critiqued its lack of challenge (an opinion shared by Tamburro&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt;).&lt;ref name="IGN Spain" /&gt; Cabrera referred to the game as being "fun and casual", but was well put together. Cabrera also called the game a "perfectly balanced simulation" that is based on the nostalgia of ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="IGN Spain" /&gt; TJ Hafer believed ''Two Point Hospital'' "revitalizes the business management genre".&lt;ref name=IGNRev /&gt; Fraser Brown of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' magazine was positive about the game's release, calling it a "brilliant management game regardless of nostalgia".&lt;ref name="PCGamer" /&gt; Brown, however, was critical of the game's balance, saying some "missions bleed together" and only a few levels are noticeably distinct.&lt;ref name="PCGamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGamerUK"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[PC Gamer UK]]|author=Fraser Brown|title=Infectious|date=November 2018|pages=76-79|publisher=[[Future plc]]|ISSN=1470-1693|issue=323|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include the game basics being too similar to those of ''Theme Hospital'',&lt;ref name=MetroRev /&gt; repetition,&lt;ref name=MetroRev /&gt; the lack of an ability to copy rooms,&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; and the lack of a sandbox mode.&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4625">The '''UK educational evidence portal (eep)''' is an online resource providing easy access to published research and evidence-based guidance across all areas of education, and related aspects of children’s services. It was developed through collaboration between organisations to make research evidence more widely available to a range of audiences, including educational professionals, practitioners, policy makers and the research community.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, L. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=D1-ucxFCAVYC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22educational+evidence+portal%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22educational%20evidence%20portal%22&amp;f=false Educational Research and Policy-Making: Exploring the Border Country Between Research and Policy]. Routledge, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portal went live in September 2007 and is funded by a number of organisations, including [[CfBT Education Trust]], [[Department for Children, Schools and Families|DCSF]], [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|BIS]], [[Training and Development Agency for Schools|TDA]], [[Becta]] and [[National College for School Leadership|The National College]]. It is hosted by the [[EPPI-Centre]] at the [[Institute of Education]], [[University of London]] and managed by a Development Group which meets approximately bi-monthly. A subset of this group meets as the Editorial Group which manages the content of the portal. CfBT Education Trust provides overall leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eep.ac.uk/dnn2/Abouteep/tabid/54/Default.aspx About eep (eep web site)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The portal has been cited as a useful information resource by various academic and Government sources in the UK and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, G.

'''Visionlearning'''&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.visionlearning.com", accessed 10 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  is a free, [[web-based]] resource for [[student]]s and [[educator]]s in the [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]] (STEM) disciplines. Geared toward those studying at [[high school]] and [[undergraduate]] levels, Visionlearning takes advantage of recent advances in [[new media]] to provide students and educators with learning and teaching materials. Research by project personnel has shown that this peer-reviewed and [[bilingual]] content improves student understanding of science and facilitates multidisciplinary teaching. The project also strives to build community around improving STEM education.&lt;ref&gt;Carpi, A. and Mikhailova, Y. The Visionlearning Project: Evaluating the Design and Effectiveness of Interdisciplinary Science Web Content. Journal of College Science Teaching. Sept/Oct 2003 pp. 2-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[U.S. Department of Education]], Visionlearning provides educational content that not only explores specific STEM concepts, but examines how we know these things. Project leaders believe that an important facet of succeeding in these [[discipline]]s is understanding their respective histories, as well as engaging with the process of discovery.

==History==
In 1998, Dr. Anthony Carpi, an [[Environmental chemistry|environmental chemist]] and then-assistant professor at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice|John Jay College]] of the [[City University of New York]], designed and launched a prototype [[Internet learning]] resource for science students, called The Natural Science Pages. This was in part a response to the growing evidence that poor [[textbook]] content and deficient teaching materials contribute to inadequate [[science education]].&lt;ref&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). 2000. Heavy Books Light on Learning. Washington, D.C.: Project 2061.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the [[prototype]] was to see if presenting important course information in a new form would improve what students understood, what information they remembered, and how well they performed in their class overall.&lt;ref&gt;Carpi, A. 2001. Improvements in undergraduate science education using web-based instructional modules: The natural science pages. Journal of chemical Education 78(12): 1709.&lt;/ref&gt;

What this research showed, through [[Standardized examination|standardized exam]] scores and student retention data, was that using the prototype significantly improved science comprehension and performance in the targeted [[natural science]] course.&lt;ref&gt;Carpi, A. 2001. Improvements in undergraduate science education using web-based instructional modules: The natural science pages. Journal of chemical Education 78(12): 1709.&lt;/ref&gt; Further evaluations also showed that the prototype helped improve [[communication]] skills and [[student engagement]] with the course.

In response to the success of The Natural Science Pages prototype and with support of the NSF,&lt;ref&gt;DUE#0088851 Visionlearning: An Education Web Portal CUNY John Jay College Awarded 12/06/2000 06/06/2000 $75,000.00 and DUE 0127246 Visionlearning: An Interdisciplinary Science Education Web Portal CUNY John Jay College Awarded 02/14/2002 06/06/2001 $499,784.00&lt;/ref&gt; Carpi developed the Visionlearning project, which brought on a group of [[scientist]]s and educators to create content and became a [[website]] open to students and educators worldwide. In the last decade, Visionlearning has evolved into a more comprehensive website that provides free educational materials to support the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, with [[translation]]s into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. These materials include independent learning modules that focus on distinct topics within STEM disciplines, teaching resources, a MyClassroom tool (similar to [[Moodle]] or [[WebCT]]) that allows educators to customize and maintain a [[virtual learning environment]] for their students, and new media elements to benefit multiple learning styles. A key feature of all of Visionlearning’s material is an emphasis on the process of science and discovery.

==The Process of Science: A Philosophy for Teaching and Learning==
Throughout the development of the learning modules and [[multimedia]] tools, Visionlearning has emphasized an importance on teaching science as a process, rather than “a simple set of facts and terms to be memorized.”&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.visionlearning.com/process_science.php"&lt;/ref&gt; This comes from an organizational [[ideology]] that understanding how scientific knowledge evolves better prepares students to engage with the process of discovery and helps to dispel common [[Scientific misconceptions|misconceptions]] about science. The underlying notion is that students will develop independent, objective thinking skills regardless of whether they pursue a career in STEM disciplines, and understand that science is far more than simply conducting experiments in a lab and working with complex [[mathematical formula]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, Anne. Why Should I Teach the Process of Science? "http://serc.carleton.edu/sp/process_of_science/why_process_science.html"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
As of 2009, Visionlearning has developed 70 independent learning modules in nine subject areas, including [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[earth science]], and the process of science. Scientist and author [[Nathan H. Lents]] has been a longtime contributor and module reviewer for Visionlearning and currently serves as life science editor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visionlearning.com/en/about/authors&lt;/ref&gt; Visionlearning modules are organized into concise, relevant topic areas, grouped by discipline. Each module can be used independently, or in conjunction with others, and intentionally concentrates on core concepts to help direct learning. Supplementary materials such as [[quiz]]zes, links to reviewed sources, and [[Biography|biographies]] are also provided for additional exploration. These modules are directed toward undergraduate and high school learning and have been written by experts in the relevant disciplines. Every module is peer reviewed for quality and accuracy, and includes historical context and contemporary relevance.

==MyClassroom==
As part of its dedication to supporting educators, Visionlearning has developed a teaching portal called MyClassroom. Similar to other virtual teaching tools (such as [[Blackboard Learning System|Blackboard]], Moodle, and WebCT), MyClassroom allows educators to create a course customized to their needs. They are able to add learning modules from Visionlearning’s library into their classroom, annotate any of these modules, and create their own modules for access by students enrolled in the course. Having this material accessible to students via the [[Internet]] allows for 24-hour access to the learning materials, without cost, and aids Spanish bi-lingual students with translations.

==New media==
As Visionlearning has expanded over the years, the project has embraced and integrated new media with the use of [[flash animation]]s, [[simulation]]s, high resolution graphics, and more recently [[iPod]] apps. To further embrace developments in technology and become more [[Americans with Disabilities Act|ADA]] compliant, the site administrators are developing additional media resources for users, such as [[podcast]]s and scripts for animations. Like many corporations today, they are also exploring the use of [[blog]]s and [[social networking]] sites, such as [[Facebook]], to build awareness and a user base. In 2017, Visionlearning launched a podcast entitled "This World of Humans," hosted by [[Nathan H. Lents]]. This podcast focuses on new research in biology and social science and includes teaching guides on the podcast website to help science educators incorporate the podcast and its featured research articles into their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;This World of Humans podcast homepage: www.visionlearning.com/en/twoh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position statements==
Visionlearning does not subscribe to any [[political party]] or affiliation. The project is dedicated to providing impartial information in the STEM disciplines and encouraging learning in the process of science. One important goal of the project is to provide an understanding of scientific concepts while emphasizing how the scientific community has arrived at these conclusions. The intention is that, through teaching about the process of scientific discovery, students will look at science not as factual elements, but as a way of knowing about the world.&lt;ref&gt;Egger, Anne. Why Teach the Process of Science? "http://serc.carleton.edu/sp/process_of_science/why_process_science.html"&lt;/ref&gt;

The project does not subscribe to the belief that the Internet and new media are replacing more traditional forms or communication, but that through proper integration of all the [[technology]] available students will have a greater chance of success in STEM learning.
