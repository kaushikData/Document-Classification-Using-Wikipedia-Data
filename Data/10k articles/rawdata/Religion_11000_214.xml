'''Abotani''', or '''Abu Tani''', is considered the primal ancestor of the [[Tani (tribes)]] group of people in [[Arunachal Pradesh]],{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} such as the Apatani, the Nyishi, The Adi-Misings,The Galos and Tagin. They follow the [[Donyi-Polo]] religion and consider Abotani as the one who firstly introduced the technique of [[rice cultivation]].

The following story is told orally through priests (''Miri'') among the [[Adi people]]:{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In older time Abo Tani (Abo or Abu: ''father'', Tani: ''human'') has wandered in forest for want of food. Once he went to Takar-Taji's place (''Tatar-Taji'') marriage ceremony where a [[bos frontalis]] (sebbe) was sacrificed. Due to a trick of Aabhu Thanyi, Takar-Taji could sacrifice only one gaur, which was meagre for distribution to the guest. Aabhu Tani's dog (''Kipung'') and the deer (''Dumpo'') shared a packet of rotten soya seeds (staple food in olden days, as the use of rice millet and maize was unknown in those days). This led to quarrel between Kipung and Dumpo. Dumpo the deer kicked the soya seed packet and ran away. Angry, Kipung the dog chased the deer. Abotani had to follow both them. After many days Dumpu the deer landed in the world of [[Digo Ane]] ("Keeper of Land"; ''digo'' "land", ''Ane'' "mother") where people were scattering the rice powder set on sun for drying. Duumpoo the deer was caught by these people; Kiipu the dog followed and was caught; Abotani followed them and was also caught by the peoples of Digo Ane. The three were imprisoned. After many days Abotani played a trick: he put a dead mole rat in his armpit and acted as if he were dying. This worried the Digo Ane people, lest the act may anger the Takar-Taji people, and they freed Abotani and granted him the gift of rice, millet and maize seed.

Many other legends between the Tanii people speak about Abotani's stories: a woman in the Digo Ane region told him how to cultivate the rice seeds;&lt;ref&gt;http://wakling.com/abotani-and-the-quest-for-rice{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aabhu Thanyi had a lot of success in his rice cultivation thanks to his wise wife Aio Diiliang Diibiu;&lt;ref&gt;http://arunachalipr.gov.in/StateFestival_Dree.htm&lt;/ref&gt; however, he divorced from her to marry another woman, and this brought disgrace to his wealth because the new wife was too much after leisures&lt;ref&gt;http://arunachaldiary.blogspot.com/2008/05/myoko-celebration-of-apatanis-photo.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}}; when Abotani realized this, he left also the second wife and continued the cultivation on his own, but still he had to ask for the help of his sister to be saved from the danger of falling from the top of a high tree where he had climbed (http://arunachalipr.gov.in/StateFestival_Dree.htm). Events in the legendary life of Aabhu Tani and in his quest for rice are part of the traditions of the Tani people and are celebrated in different periods of the year (following the rice cultivation season). Aabhu Tani is a symbol of the struggle of humankind for food and prosperity though in difficult situations, and of the need for harmony between man and woman to bring wealth to the family.

In the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', '''Ammon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ə|n}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «ăm´un»&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Mulekite]] descendant and leader of a [[Nephite]] expedition from [[Zarahemla]], sent to discover the fate of [[Zeniff]] and his people (who had not been in contact for 75 years). Zeniff and his followers left Zarahemla and travelled to Nephi, their ancestral home, which was then in the possession of the Lamanites.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=7|verse=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have contributed to his expedition, not knowing the actual route to Nephi.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=7|verse=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammon and his men discover the descendants of the people of Zeniff, who had successfully colonized Nephi but were then enslaved by the Lamanites. Zeniff's grandson [[Limhi]] rules under the Lamanites and initially imprisons Ammon. Upon learning who Ammon is, he releases him and rejoice his arrival. Ammon teaches the people of Limhi the famous sermon of [[King Benjamin]] and helps convert them to the gospel. However, he refuses to baptize the converts, "considering himself an unworthy servant".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=21|verse=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for his apprehension is not given, and the people wait until they reach Zarahemla to be baptised by [[Alma the Elder]]. Ammon, [[Gideon (Book of Mormon)|Gideon]], and King Limhi conspire to escape from the Lamanites by making the guards drunk. The plan is successful and Ammon escorts them to Zarahemla.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=22|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AncientJudaism.jpg|thumb|First English translation&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]])]]
'''''Ancient Judaism''''' ({{lang-de|Das antike Judentum}}), is a [[book]] written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]], in early the 20th century. The original edition was in German - the [[essay]]s on Ancient [[Judaism]] appeared originally in the 1917–1919 issues of the ''[[w:de:Das antike Judentum|Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialforschung]]''. [[Marianne Weber]], his wife, published the essays as Part Three of his ''Gesammelte Aufsatze zur Religionssoziologie''' in 1920–1921. An English [[translation]] was made in 1952 and several editions were released since then.

It was his fourth and last major work on the [[sociology of religion]], after ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' and ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]''. In this work he attempts to explain the factors that were responsible for the early differences between [[Oriental]] and [[western culture|Occidental]] [[religiosity]].&lt;ref name=rb200&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially visible when the [[asceticism]] developed by Western [[Christianity]] is contrasted to mystical contemplation developed in India.&lt;ref name=rb200/&gt; Weber's premature death in 1920 prevented him from following Ancient Judaism with his planned analysis of [[Psalm]]s, Book of Job, [[Talmudic]] Jewry, early [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

Weber wrote that 
{{quote|Anyone who is heir to traditions of modern European civilization will approach problems of universal history with a set of questions, which to him appear both inevitable and legitimate. These questions will turn on the combination of circumstances which has brought about the cultural phenomena that are uniquely Western and that have at the same time (...) a universal cultural significance&lt;ref name=rb200/&gt;}}

Weber notes that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of modern [[Western world|Western]] state, as its influence were as important to those of [[Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures.

==Types of asceticism and the significance of ancient Judaism==

Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, instead of withdrawing from its imperfections. This fundamental distinctiveness of Christianity (when compared to [[Far East]] religions) stems originally from ancient [[Jew]]ish [[prophecy]]. Weber stated his reasons for investigating ancient [[Judaism]]:

{{cquote|For the Jew (...) the social order of the world was conceived to have been turned into the opposite of the one promised for the future, but in the future it was to be overturned so that Jewry could be once again dominant. The world was conceived as neither eternal nor unchangeable, but rather as being created. Its present structure was a product of man's actions, above all those of the Jews, and of God's reaction to them. Hence the world was a historical product designed to give way to the truly God-ordained order '' [...] There existed in addition a highly rational religious ethic of social conduct; it was free of magic and all forms of irrational quest for salvation; it was inwardly worlds apart from the path of salvation offered by Asiatic religions. To a large extent this ethic still underlies contemporary Middle Eastern and European ethics. World-historical interest in Jewry rests upon this fact. [...] Thus, in considering the conditions of Jewry's evolution, we stand at a turning point of the whole cultural development of the West and the Middle East&lt;ref name=rb204&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.204&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==History and social organization of Ancient Israel==

Weber analysed the interaction between the [[Bedouins]], the cities, the herdsmen and the peasants, the conflicts between them, and the rise and fall of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]]. The brief time of United Monarchy divided the period of [[confederation|confederacy]] since the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] and the settlement of the [[Israelite]]s in [[Canaan]] from the period of political decline following the [[divided monarchy|Division of the Monarchy]].&lt;ref name=rb213&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.213&lt;/ref&gt; Weber discusses the organisation of the early confederacy, the unique qualities of Israelite relations to the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]], the influence of foreign cults, types of religious ecstasy and the struggle of the priests against ecstasy and idol worship. Later he describes the times of the Division of the Monarchy, social aspects of Biblical prophecy, social orientation of the prophets, demagogues and pamphleteers, ecstasy and politics, ethic and theodicity of the Prophets.

Those periods were significant for religious history, as the basic doctrines of Judaism that left their mark on Western civilisation arose during those times.&lt;ref name=rb213/&gt;

[[Reinhard Bendix]] summarising Weber's work writes:

{{cquote|...free of magic and esoteric speculations, devoted to the study of law, vigiliant in the effort to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord in the hope of a better future, the prophets established a religion of faith that subjected man's daily life to the imperatives of a divinely ordained moral law. In this way, ancient Judaism helped create the moral rationalism of Western civilisation&lt;ref name=rb256&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh''' refers to increased attacks since 2013 on a number of [[secularist]] and [[atheist]] writers, bloggers, and publishers in [[Bangladesh]] and foreigners, and religious minorities such as [[Hindu]]s, [[Buddhist]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Shia Islam|Shias]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news |date=7 August 2015 |title=Fourth secular Bangladesh blogger hacked to death|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/fourth-secular-bangladesh-blogger-hacked-death-150807102408712.html |work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/motion-timeline-29-militant-killings-4-years-1217401 |title=Motion Timeline: 29 killings in 4 years |journal=thedailystar.net |date=2 May 2016 |accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks have been largely blamed on extremist groups such as [[Ansarullah Bangla Team]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Bangladeshi government was criticized for its responses to the attacks, which included charging and jailing some of the secularist bloggers for allegedly defaming religious groups{{snd}}a strategy seen as pandering to hard line elements within Bangladesh's majority Muslim population (about 89% of the population). The government's eventual crackdown in June 2016 was also criticized for its heavy-handedness, as more than 11,000 people were arrested in little more than a week (as of 18{{nbsp}}June 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Round up the usual suspects: A spate of assassinations provokes a heavy-handed response |journal=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21700669-spate-assassinations-provokes-heavy-handed-response-round-up-usual-suspects |date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2 July 2016, a total of 48 people, including 20 foreign nationals, were killed in such attacks.

== Background ==
In 2010 the government of Bangladesh, headed by the secularist [[Awami League]], established a [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|war crimes tribunal]] to investigate war crimes perpetrated during Bangladesh{{'s}} bloody 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|War of Independence]] from [[Pakistan]]. In February 2013 [[Abdul Quader Molla]], a leader of the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]] party (a small Islamist party within the opposition coalition), was sentenced to life imprisonment by the tribunal. The sentence was condemned by Bangladesh's secularist bloggers and writers, who helped organize the [[2013 Shahbag protests]] in response, calling for the death penalty for Molla. The protestors quickly expanded their demands to include outlawing the Jamaat-e-Islami party itself for its role in the 1971 war.&lt;ref name=nyt_3mar2013&gt;{{cite news |author1=Julfikar Ali Manik |author2=Jim Yardley |date= 3 March 2013 |title= At Least 19 Killed as Unrest Persists in Bangladesh |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/world/asia/bangladesh-sees-deadly-day-as-protests-persist.html |newspaper= The New York Times |access-date= 29 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the first [[Shahbag]] protests, counter-demonstrations, which quickly degenerated into violence, were organized by Islamist groups. Islamist leaders denounced the war crimes tribunal as political and called for an end to the prosecution of Jamaat-e-Islami leaders;&lt;ref name=nyt_3mar2013/&gt; they demanded instead the death penalty for secularist bloggers, denouncing them as "atheists" and accusing them of [[blasphemy]].&lt;ref name=heroes_mohiuddin&gt;{{cite web |url= http://heroes.rsf.org/en/asif-mohiuddin/ |title= 100 Information Heroes: Asif Mohiuddin |website= Reporters Without Borders |access-date= 29 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508130737/http://heroes.rsf.org/en/asif-mohiuddin/ |archive-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday_6apr2013&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/04/06/hardline-muslims-rally-bangladesh/2058851/|title=Hardline Muslims rally in Bangladesh amid shutdown|date=6 April 2013|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the secularist bloggers, [[Imran H Sarker|Imran Sarker]], stated that the hostility directed toward them by Islamists is due primarily to the bloggers' growing political influence in Bangladesh, which represents a major obstacle to the Islamist goal of a religious state.&lt;ref name=dw_30mar2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Arun |last2=Shams |first2=Shamil |date=30 March 2015 |title=Bangladeshi bloggers pay the price of upholding secularism |url=http://www.dw.de/bangladeshi-bloggers-pay-the-price-of-upholding-secularism/a-18349725 |work=Deutsche Welle |access-date = 16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were occasional attacks on secularists prior to the 2013 Shahbag protests, the frequency of attacks has increased since. [[Reporters Without Borders]] noted that in 2014 a group calling itself "Defenders of Islam" published a "hit list" of 84 Bangladeshis, mostly secularists, of whom nine have already reportedly been killed and others attacked.&lt;ref name=cnn_13may2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ahmed |first1=Saeed |date=13 May 2015 |title=Ananta Bijoy Das: Yet another Bangladeshi blogger hacked to death |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/12/asia/bangladesh-blogger-killed/ |work=[[CNN]] |access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsibility for many of the attacks has been claimed by [[Ansarullah Bangla Team]],&lt;ref name="4-arrested-attempted-murder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/4-held-over-attempt-to-kill-blogger/|title=4 held over attempt to kill blogger|work=The Daily Star|publisher=Transcom Group|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ansar Bangla-7 claims Avijit killing responsibility|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/59777/Ansar-Bangla-7-claims-Avijit-killing|work=Prothom Alo|publisher=Transcom Group|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/secular-blogger-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh-month-after-almost-identical-murder-of-idol-10143498.html|author=Lizzie Dearden|title=An atheist blogger has been hacked to death in Bangladesh for the second time this year|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Digital News and Media|date=30 March 2015|accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bdnews24_16nov2014&gt;{{cite news |date=16 November 2014 |title=Islamist group claim responsibility of RU teacher murder |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/11/16/islamist-group-claim-responsibility-of-ru-teacher-murder |newspaper=bdnews24.com |access-date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group that, according to police, has links with both the youth wing of Jamaat-e-Islami and [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blogger Rajib’s ‘killers’ linked to al-Qaeda: DB|work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|publisher=Transcom Group|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/blogger-rajibs-killers-linked-to-al-qaeda-db/|date=15 March 2013|access-date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has since been banned by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 2015|title=Bangladesh bans Islamist group accused of blogger attacks |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32879662 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attacks appear to have been perpetrated by more obscure groups.

While police have arrested a number of suspects in the killings, and some bloggers have received police protection, the Bangladesh government has also responded by arresting and jailing a number of secularist bloggers for "defaming Islam" and by shutting down several websites.&lt;ref name=guardian_28feb2015&gt;{{cite news |date=27 February 2015 |title=American atheist blogger hacked to death in Bangladesh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/27/american-atheist-blogger-hacked-to-death-in-bangladesh |work=[[The Guardian]] |agency=Agence France-Presse |access-date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarker, "[T]he government has taken this easy route to appease a handful of mullahs whose support they need to win the upcoming election."&lt;ref name=iheu_4apr2013&gt;{{cite web |url= http://iheu.org/arrests-atheist-bloggers-shows-bangladesh-authorities-are-walking-trap-set-fundamentalists/ |title= Arrests of 'atheist bloggers' shows Bangladesh authorities are "walking into a trap set by fundamentalists" |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt; |date= 4 April 2013 |website= International Humanist and Ethical Union |access-date= 2 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of non-governmental organisations ([[NGO]]s), including [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], [[Reporters without Borders]], [[PEN International]], [[PEN Canada]] and the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] have criticized the government for failing to protect its citizens and for not condemning the attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.amnesty.ca/news/bangladesh-authorities-must-act-another-secular-activist-hacked-death |title=Bangladesh: Authorities must act as another secular activist hacked to death |date=April 7, 2016 |publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have condemned the imprisonment of bloggers as an attack on free speech, which they say is contributing to a climate of fear for Bangladeshi journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Bangladesh: Crackdown on Bloggers, Editors Escalates | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/15/bangladesh-crackdown-bloggers-editors-escalates| date = 15 April 2013}} "[T]he government is abandoning any serious claim that it is committed to free speech," said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA13/007/2013/en/|title=Bangladesh: Further information: Detained editor alleges torture|quote=Blogger Asif Mohiudeen, arrested on 3&amp;nbsp;April for allegedly posting blasphemous comments online, remains in detention and at risk of torture|publisher=Amnesty International|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/bangladesh-call-for-detained-blogger-s-11-04-2013,44367.html |title=Call for detained blogger's immediate release|publisher=Reporters without Borders|date=11 April 2013 |quote=Reporters Without Borders condemns the baseless judicial proceedings brought against the detained blogger Asif Mohiuddin, who could be tried and convicted on a charge of blasphemy and "hurting religious sentiments" at his next hearing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpj2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cpj.org/2014/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2013-bangladesh.php|title=Attacks on the Press – Bangladesh|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a petition published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 22{{nbsp}}May 2015, 150 authors, including [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Margaret Atwood]], and [[Yann Martell]], called on the government of Bangladesh to put an end to the deadly attacks on bloggers, urging the Prime Minister and government "to do all in their power to ensure that the tragic events of the last three months are not repeated, and to bring the perpetrators to justice."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |date=22 May 2015 |title=Top authors including Salam Rushdie urge Bangladesh govt to halt blogger attacks |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/world/top-authors-urge-bangladesh-govt-halt-blogger-attacks-85669 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |access-date = 22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2016 Bangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan alleged that the main opposition party [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] has links to the attacks, and that these attacks are part of a wider conspiracy that also involved [[Mossad]], the national intelligence agency of [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/bangladeshi-minister-blames-israel-for-string-of-gruesome-murders/|title=Bangladeshi minister blames Israel for string of gruesome murders|website=[[The Times of Israel]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jerusalem later rejected the allegation in a statement and termed the accusation of the Bangladeshi Home Minister as "utter drivel".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein]], expressed concern on behalf of the United Nations on 13{{nbsp}}June 2016 by saying, "I am very concerned about the dramatic increase in number{{sic}} of brutal murders in Bangladesh that target freethinkers, liberals, religious minorities and LGBT activists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/un-concerned-over-bangladesh-killings-1238938|title=UN concerned over Bangladesh killings|date=2016-06-13|website=The Daily Star|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shafiul Islam ===
On 15 November 2014 a teacher in the [[Rajshahi University]] sociology department named Shafiul Islam, a follower of the [[Bauls|Baul community]], was struck with sharp weapons by several youths on his way home in Rajshahi city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/7551|title=Crisis in Bangladesh: Secularists Killed by Extremists and Under Legal Threat from Government|website=www.secularhumanism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died after being taken to Rajshahi Medical College and Hospital. A fundamentalist Islamist militant group named '[[Ansarullah Bangla Team|Ansar al Islam Bangladesh-2]]' claimed responsibility for the attack. On a social media website, the group declared: "Our Mujahideens [fighters] executed a 'Murtad' [apostate] today in Rajshahi who had prohibited female students in his department to wear '[[burqa|Burka]]' [veil]."&lt;ref name=bdnews24_16nov2014/&gt; The website also quoted a 2010 article from a newspaper affiliated with Jamaat-e-Islami stating that "Professor Shafiul Islam, while being the chair of the sociology department, recruited teachers on condition of being clean-shaved and not wearing kurta-pajamas. He barred female students from wearing burka in classes. This led to many students abandoning burka against their will."&lt;ref name=bdnews24_16nov2014/&gt;

According to one of Shafiul Islam's colleagues, the victim was not anti-Islam but had prohibited female students from wearing full-face veils in his classes as he believed they could be used to cheat in exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh professor who pushed for ban on full-face veils hacked to death: police |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/bangladesh-professor-who-pushed-for-ban-on-full-face-veils-hacked-to-death-police |work=The Straits Times |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy was a naturalized U.S. citizen and founder of the influential Bangladeshi blog ''[[Mukto-Mona]]'' ("Freethinkers").

He was the author of ten books, the best known of which was a critique of religious extremism, ''Virus of Faith''.&lt;ref name=guardian_28feb2015/&gt; A group calling itself Ansar Bangla{{nbsp}}7 claimed responsibility for the attack, describing Roy's writings as a "crime against Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alam |first1=Julhas |date=27 February 2015 |title=American blogger, secular activist hacked to death with meat cleavers in Bangladesh |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/american-blogger-secular-activist-hacked-to-death-with-meat-cleavers-in-bangladesh |work=National Post |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that he was targeted as a U.S. citizen in retaliation for U.S. bombing of ISIS militants in Syria.&lt;ref name=dailymail_1mar2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Corcoran |first1=Kieran |last2=Matthew |first2=Sam |date=27 February 2015 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2971508/American-blogger-spoke-against-religious-extremism-hacked-death-Muslim-militant-group-Bangladeshi-street-walked-wife.html |title=Moment Avijit Roy's wife was left next to her husband's body after he was hacked to death |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahfuz Anam]], editor of [[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|''The Daily Star'']], wrote that the death "is a spine-chilling warning to us all that we all can be targets. All that needs to happen for any of us to be killed is that some fanatic somewhere in the country, decides that someone or anyone, needs to be killed." Anam stated: {{quote|We believe that diversity, tolerance and freedom of conscience – fundamental to our existence&amp;nbsp;– are being challenged here...

=== Washiqur Rahman ===
On 30 March 2015 another blogger, Washiqur Rahman, was killed in the Tejgaon neighborhood of Dhaka in an attack similar to that perpetrated on Avijit Roy. The police arrested two suspects near the scene and recovered [[meat cleaver]]s from them. The suspects said they killed Raman because of his anti-Islamic articles. Raman was reportedly known for criticizing "irrational religious beliefs".&lt;ref name=Oyasiqur&gt;{{cite news |title=Knife attack kills Bangladesh blogger Washiqur Rahman |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32112433 |work=BBC News |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspects informed the police that they are also members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team and had trained for fifteen days before killing the blogger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 April 2015 |title=Ansarullah behind Wasiq murder: DMP |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/04/02/81400.php |location=Dhaka |newspaper=The Daily Observer |access-date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imran Sarker told reporters that, unlike Roy, Raman was not a high-profile blogger, but "was targeted because open-minded and progressive bloggers are being targeted in general. They are killing those who are easy to access, when they get the opportunity... The main attempt is to create fear among bloggers."&lt;ref name=dw_30mar2015/&gt; According to Sarker, Raman's murder was part of a "struggle between those who are promoting political Islam to turn Bangladesh into a fundamentalist, religious state and the secular political forces ... That is why [the bloggers] have become the main target, and the political parties who are supposed to prevent such attacks and provide security to them seem unable to do so. The main problem is that even mainstream political parties prefer to compromise with these radical groups to remain in power".&lt;ref name=dw_30mar2015/&gt;

The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] issued a press release stating that Raman's death occurred in a climate of "official harassment of journalists in Bangladesh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cpj.org/2015/04/cpj-concerned-by-arrest-of-bangladeshi-journalist-.php |title=CPJ concerned by arrest of Bangladeshi journalist and his treatment in custody |date=1 April 2015 |website=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ananta Das was invited by the Swedish PEN to discuss the persecution of writers in Bangladesh, but the Swedish government refused him a visa on the grounds that he might not return to Bangladesh after his visit.&lt;ref name=guardianeditorial/&gt;

Lawyer Sara Hossain said of Roy and Das, "They've always believed and written very vocally in support of free expression and they've very explicitly written about not following any religion themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 May 2015 |title=Bangladesh blogger Ananta Bijoy Das hacked to death |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32701001 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia director of [[Human Rights Watch]] Brad Adams said of Ananta's killing, "This pattern of vicious attacks on secular and atheist writers not only silences the victims but also sends a chilling message to all in Bangladesh who espouse independent views on religious issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/05/12/bangladesh-killing-blogger-blow-free-speech |title=Bangladesh: Killing of Blogger Blow to Free Speech |website=Human Rights Watch |access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated: "Like [[Raif Badawi]], imprisoned and flogged in [[Saudi Arabia]], the brave men who have been murdered are guilty of nothing more than honesty and integrity.

=== Taslima Nasrin ===
In the 1990s author Taslima Nasrin achieved notoriety in Bangladesh for "her bold use of sexual imagery in her poetry, her self-declared atheism, and her iconoclastic lifestyle".&lt;ref name="literature"/&gt; In her newspaper columns and books, she criticized rising religious fundamentalism and government inaction. In early 1992 mobs began attacking book stores stocking her work. The same year she was assaulted at a book fair and her passport was confiscated. In July 1993 her novel ''[[Lajja]]'' was banned by the government for allegedly creating "misunderstanding among communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Bangladesh Teacher arrested for having a copy of a book by Taslima Nasrin,  – Asia News|url = http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Teacher-arrested-for-having-a-copy-of-a-book-by-Taslima-Nasrin,-23622.html|website = asianews.it|accessdate = 16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23{{nbsp}}September 1993 a [[fatwa]] was issued for her death.

The '''Australian Family Movement''' was a minor [[Australia]]n political party formed in 1974 and active throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It originally came out of a group created to oppose the stage show ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' in [[Adelaide]] (this group was successful in convincing the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] state government to ban the show).

The party generally stood for conservative [[Christian]] principles, and was particularly opposed to [[homosexuality]], [[transvestism]] and [[androgyny]], believing them "contrary to the natural order"; and to [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]], placing emphasis on the "dignity and sanctity of all human life, especially at its beginning and at its end".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to the Australian Electoral Commission, the Australian Family Movement was registered on 9 August 1984 and deregistered on 25 May 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/afm.htm |title=Deregistered Parties / Australian Family Movement |accessdate=16 July 2012 |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] division, the '''Family Team''', won a seat in the [[Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly]] in 1979, with party leader [[Bev Cains]] entering the House. She was joined by [[Betty Hocking]] in 1982, who served one term. Cains held her seat until the abolition of the House of Assembly, when she was defeated in an attempt to transfer to the new [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]].

Brinkman first gained widespread media attention for his one-man show "The Rap Canterbury Tales," devised as a means of re-telling Chaucer's iconic stories for a modern audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts-reviews/the-rap-canterbury-tales/2007/10/04/1191091243627.html Melbourne Age Article “The Rap Canterbury Tales Review”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/25/entertainment/et-chaucer25 Los Angeles Times Article “Yo, just call him Chaucer’s homie”]&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 2004, and the following year Brinkman was sponsored by [[Cambridge University]] to perform the show in British secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4721073.stm BBC News Article “Chaucer’s Tales Become Rap Songs]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rap Canterbury Tales was published as an illustrated paperback by Talon Books in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talonbooks.com/books/the-rap-canterbury-tales Talon Books Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinkman's 2010 follow-up show, "Rapconteur," premiered at the Edinburgh [[Free Fringe]] and featured hip hop adaptations of [[Beowulf]], the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], and the Finnish [[Kalevala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bababrinkman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rapconteur-Review-The-Scotsman.pdf Scotsman Article “Rapconteur Review”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwaybaby.com/shows/rapconteur/21051 Broadway Baby Article “Rapconteur Review”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/edinburgh-theatre/reviews/08-2010/rapconteur_12076.html What’s On Stage Article “Rapconteur Review”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Brinkman premiered "The Canterbury Tales Remixed" at the Soho Playhouse in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.backstage.com/review/ny-theater/off-broadway/the-canterbury-tales-remixed/ Backstage Article “Canterbury Tales Remixed Review”]&lt;/ref&gt; The show combined material from Rapconteur with new adaptations of [[The Merchant's Tale]], [[The Pardoner's Tale]], and [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] and was released as a full-length album in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laughingsquid.com/the-canterbury-tales-remixed-album-released/ Laughing Squid Article “The Canterbury Tales Remixed Album has Been Released”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his interest in merging hip-hop and classic literature, Brinkman has referred to his style of rap as "[[Lit Hop]]," which was also the title of his 2006 solo rap album.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thetyee.ca/Music/2007/03/01/MusicPicks/ The Tyee Article “Listen to This!”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science Rap ==

In 2008, Brinkman was commissioned to write a new rap show about [[evolution]] by Professor [[Mark Pallen]], [[microbiologist]] and author of The [[Rough Guides|Rough Guide]] to Evolution. The result was "The Rap Guide to Evolution," a hip hop homage to [[Charles Darwin]] which Brinkman first performed in Britain for the Darwin [[Anniversary|bicentennial]] in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/origins/2009/02/rapping-with-darwin-and-dawkin.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because the lyrics were fact-checked for scientific accuracy, Professor Pallen calls it "the first [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] rap".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/science/28rap.html?_r=2&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkman cites [[Richard Dawkins]], [[David Sloan Wilson]], [[Jared Diamond]], [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]], and [[E. O. Wilson]] as his influences in writing the show.

The Rap Guide to Evolution premiered at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, winning a Fringe First Award from [[The Scotsman]] for best new theatre writing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgh-festivals.com/viewpreview.aspx?id=670&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the UK's largest biomedical charity, the [[Wellcome Trust]], provided grant funding for Brinkman to make a series of educational music videos based on the show, as a resource for biology teachers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/2011/News/WTVM051468.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Rap Guide to Evolution completed a five-month [[Off-Broadway]] theatre run in November 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/theater/reviews/baba-brinkman-in-rap-guide-at-soho-playhouse-review.html&lt;/ref&gt; for which Brinkman received a 2012 [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show|Outstanding Solo Performance]], losing to Irish actor [[Cillian Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dramadeskawards.com/2012-nominees.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816020115/http://www.dramadeskawards.com/2012-nominees.html |archivedate=2012-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinkman has performed selections from The Rap Guide to Evolution on [[The Rachel Maddow Show]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37449161/ns/msnbc-rachel_maddow_show/t/rachel-maddow-show-friday-may-th/&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Seattle Science Festival, sharing the stage with [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] palaeontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] and British physicist [[Stephen Hawking]].&lt;ref&gt;http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/thearts/2018385919_science09.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Brinkman produced a "Rationalist Anthem" called "Off That," attacking various forms of [[pseudoscience]]. The song was inspired by the [[Jay Z]] track of the same name, which is featured on [[The Blueprint 3]] album. The video for Brinkman's unauthorized remix was released as part of an online science music festival called [[Geek Pop]]&lt;ref&gt;http://geekpop.co.uk/2010/03/20/off-that-video-exclusive-from-baba-brinkman/&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular with atheist blogs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2010/03/20/off-that-the-rationalist-anthem/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://40yearoldatheist.com/baba-brinkman-rationalizn-darwin-testifyin-make-ya-think-bout-evolutionizn-rapper/2010/05/&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinkman followed up his Darwin tribute with a sequel show specifically about [[evolutionary psychology]], "The Rap Guide to Human Nature," which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2010/r/18278/the_rap_guide_to_human_nature/review&lt;/ref&gt; The album features "peer review" phone messages from [[David Buss]], [[Olivia Judson]], and [[David Sloan Wilson]] commenting on the science content in Brinkman's lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;http://music.bababrinkman.com/album/the-rap-guide-to-human-nature&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 "Human Nature" was adapted into a theatre production, "Ingenious Nature," which ran off-Broadway from November 2012 through January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/review-dj-baba-brinkman-mixes-darwin-and-dating&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Brinkman was announced as a songwriter-in-residence at the [[National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis]] (NIMBioS) and spent a month at the [[University of Tennessee Knoxville]] as a guest of the Institute, along with DJ and music producer [[Jamie Simmonds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimbios.org/wordpress/2012/03/23/nimbios-announces-new-songwriter-in-residence-baba-brinkman/ NIMBioS “Baba Brinkman Announced as Songwriter-in-Residence]&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkman later released "The Infomatic EP," a collection of hip-hop songs inspired by [[computational biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcmusicianmag.com/baba-brinkman-bcs-raconteur/ BC Musician Magazine Article “Baba Brinkman – BC’s Raconteur”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinkman's next play, "Rap Guide to Religion," premiered at the 2014 Edinburgh Fringe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/baba-brinkman-gilded-balloon-10540 British Theatre Guide “The Rap Guide to Religion”]&lt;/ref&gt; before transferring to the Soho Playhouse for an off-Broadway run in October 2014. The production ran for seven months and was a Time Out New York&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/the-rap-guide-to-religion&lt;/ref&gt; and New York Times Critics' Pick, as well as receiving a 2015 Drama Desk Award nomination in the category "[[Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience|Unique Theatrical Experience]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/theater/review-rap-guide-to-religion-examines-why-humanity-created-god.html?_r=0 New York Times Article “Rap Guide to Religion”]&lt;/ref&gt; The show explores theories from the [[cognitive science of religion]] and promotes [[religious naturalism]], prompting [[American Humanist Association]] magazine to refer to Brinkman as "atheism's best salesman".&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehumanist.com/arts_entertainment/theater/atheisms-best-salesman The Humanist Article “Atheism’s Best Salesman”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Brinkman was commissioned by [[Arizona State University]] and [[Randolph M. Nesse|Dr. Randolph Nesse]] to write and produce an album entitled "The Rap Guide to Medicine", which communicates themes from [[evolutionary medicine]]. Dr. Nesse said of the finished project: "This is amazing. I won't need to teach my course, I'll just have students listen to the album!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://evmed.asu.edu/news/center-evolution-medicine-partners-artist-produce-peer-reviewed-rap ASU Center for Evolution and Medicine Article “Peer Reviewed Rap”]&lt;/ref&gt; The album includes songs about [[Mendelian disease]], [[parasitology]], [[somatic evolution in cancer]], [[mismatch theory]], and [[senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rapguidetomedicine.com Baba Brinkman “The Rap Guide to Medicine”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2016, Brinkman attended the [[Toward a Science of Consciousness|Science of Consciousness]] conference in Tucson, AZ, performing a "Rap Up" or daily rap summary of the conference talks on [[Neuroscience]] and [[Philosophy of Mind]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/science/science-of-consciousness-conference-raw-data.html New York Times Article “Science of Consciousness Conference”]&lt;/ref&gt; Computational neuroscientist [[Anil Seth]] saw Brinkman's performances and proposed they collaborate on a new show about the neuroscience of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/40168 University of Sussex Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; Brinkman premiered "Rap Guide to Consciousness" at the 2017 [[Brighton Fringe]], [[Winnipeg Fringe]] and Edinburgh Fringe to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/theatre/fringe-interview-baba-brinkman-on-the-canadian-fringe-circuit-1-4506768 The Scotsman Fringe Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/arts/baba-brinkman-comedy-review-comedy-hip-hop-and-neuroscience-will-make-your-brain-buzz-a3623511.html Evening Standard Review of Rap Guide to Consciousness]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwaybaby.com/shows/baba-brinkmans-rap-guide-to-consciousness/719920 Broadway Baby Review of Rap Guide to Consciousness]&lt;/ref&gt; The show explores several neurobiological theories of consciousness, including [[Global Workspace Theory]], [[Integrated Information Theory]], and [[Predictive Coding]], as well as the [[Philosophical Zombie]], [[Free Will]], [[Materialism]], and [[Memetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.bababrinkman.com/album/the-rap-guide-to-consciousness Baba Brinkman “The Rap Guide to Consciousness”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environment and Ecology Rap ==

Brinkman was commissioned by the [[WILD Foundation]] to produce "The Rap Guide to Wilderness" in 2014. The album was critically acclaimed and features songs about [[biodiversity]], [[extinction]], [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[habitat loss]] and [[trophic cascade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.bababrinkman.com/album/the-rap-guide-to-wilderness Baba Brinkman “The Rap Guide to Wilderness”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wild.org/blog/the-rap-guide-to-wilderness-connecting-people-to-nature-with-music/ Wild Foundation Article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.audubon.org/news/review-rap-guide-wilderness Audubon Article “Rap Guide to Wilderness Review”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technicianonline.com/features/article_4c6f0db2-9a18-11e4-af9f-bba6b16570b9.html Technician Online Article “The Rap Guide to Wilderness]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/rap-guide-to-wilderness-gives-advocacy-a-new-beat#ixzz3M4aaAtKi Mother Nature Network Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Brinkman's play "Rap Guide to Climate Chaos" premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/rap-guide-climate-chaos/ The Stage “Climate Chaos” Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wow247.co.uk/2015/08/24/theatre-review-rap-guide-to-climate-chaos/ Scotsman “Climate Chaos” Theatre Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theskinny.co.uk/festivals/edinburgh-fringe/comedy/george-egg-rap-guide-climate-chaos-review The Skinny “Climate Chaos” Review]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by performances at the [[COP21]] United Nations Climate Change Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.com/2016/01/meet-the-guy-raising-awareness-about-climate-change-through-hip-hop/ New York Observer “Meet the Guy Raising Awareness About Climate Change Through Hip Hop]&lt;/ref&gt; "Climate Chaos" went on to play off-Broadway for six months in 2016, and featured [[Michael E.

In 2016, after the election of [[Donald Trump]], Brinkman worked with [[Wesleyan University]] professor [[Gary Yohe]], a senior contributor to the [[IPCC]] and co-recipient along with [[Al Gore]] of the 2007 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], to produce a new song and video entitled "Erosion", summarizing data from the [[National Climate Assessment]] on the US-based physical impacts of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2017/01/20/rapguidetoclimatechaos/ Wesleyan Newsletter on Gary Yohe and Baba Brinkman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/defiant/this-canadian-rapper-schooled-trump-on-climate-science-3600ce0cd72a Medium Article “This Canadian Rapper Schooled Trump on Climate Science”]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science Comedy ==

Brinkman and his wife, the neuroscientist Dr. Heather Berlin, co-wrote and performed in a science comedy variety show entitled "Off The Top" at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014, 2015, and 2017 about the neuroscience of improvisation and freestyle rap.&lt;ref&gt;http://mumblecomedy.net/2015/08/18/baba-brinkman-and-heather-berlin-off-the-top/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsawardvoice.com/magazine/reviews/Off-The-Top&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadwaybaby.com/shows/off-the-top/707288&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

The Rap Guide to Evolution won the National Center for Science Education's 2013 Friend of Darwin Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncse.com/evolution/rap-artist-education-advisor-extraordinaire-master-scientist&lt;/ref&gt; The show is controversial primarily for its open criticism of creationism and the essentialist elements of its discussion of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;http://williamsrecord.com/2013/02/13/baba-brinkman-entertains-but-not-without-discomfort/&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers have also expressed concern about Brinkman's use of strong language and anti-religious sentiments in his educational performances and videos.&lt;ref&gt;http://rapguidetoevolution.co.uk/concerned-teachers&lt;/ref&gt;

Brinkman himself has been described as an "evangelical atheist"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgh-festivals.com/viewpreview.aspx?id=1842&lt;/ref&gt; and has blogged about his encounters with creationists, both in educational settings&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bababrinkman.com/tennessee-monkey-trials/&lt;/ref&gt; and within his own family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bababrinkman.com/communicating-evolution-via-creationist-cousins/&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed in support of the [[Military Association of Atheists &amp; Freethinkers]] "Rock Beyond Belief" concert alongside Richard Dawkins at Fort Bragg, NC in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://rockbeyondbelief.com/2011/02/08/rapper-baba-brinkman-joins-lineup-supports-foxhole-atheists/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingenious Nature was reviewed unfavourably, and Brinkman received criticism for "singling out women in the audience, pointing at them, and rapping about their ovulation cycles," among other things.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.backstage.com/review/ny-theater/off-broadway/baba-brinkman-ingenious-nature-soho-playhouse/&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Tranquility Bank" from The Rap Guide to Wilderness received a hostile response from some environmentalists because of its assertion that urban living is better for the environment than [[back-to-the-land movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samaritanmag.com/musicians/baba-brinkman-offends-some-people-rap-guide-wilderness&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the region==

=== Community of Ashgabat===
[[File:Ashkabad Temple Bahai.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The first Bahá'í House of Worship was built in [[Ashgabat]].]]
The Bahá'í community of [[Ashgabat]] (also spelled `Ishqábád, Ashkhabad) was founded in about 1884, mostly from religious refugees from Persia.&lt;ref name="ashg"&gt;{{Cite book

A short time after moving there, the assassination of one of the Bahá'ís there, [[Haji Muhammad Rida Isfahani]] occurred and Gulpaygani helped the Bahá'í community to respond to this event and later he was the spokesman for the Bahá'ís at the trial of the assassins. This event established the independence of the Bahá'í Faith from [[Islam]] both for the Russian government and for the people of Ashgabat.&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Momen |first=Moojan |title=Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani, Mirza |work=Draft for "A Short Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith" |publisher=Scholar's Official Website of Articles |url=http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/abulfadl.htm |accessdate=2008-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090142/http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/abulfadl.htm |archivedate=13 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the protection and freedom given by the Russian authorities, the number of Bahá'ís in the community rose to 4,000 (1,000 children) by 1918 and for the first time anywhere in the world a true Bahá'í community was established, with its own  hospitals, schools, workshops, newspapers,&lt;ref name="azer"&gt;{{Citation|last=Balci |first=Bayram |last2=Jafarov |first2=Azer |title=The Baha’is of the Caucasus: From Russian Tolerance to Soviet Repression {2/3} |newspaper=Caucaz.com |pages= |date=21 February 2007 |url=http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524000119/http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEV"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Shining example Cradle of Faith |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1987|pages=8–11| url = | issue = 675| issn = 0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; cemetery, and House of Worship.&lt;ref name="momen"/&gt; The city population was between 44 and 50 thousand at this time.&lt;ref name="ashg"/&gt;

This first [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] was constructed inside the city of Ashgabat. The design of the building was started in 1902, and the construction was completed in 1908; it was supervised by [[Vakílu'd-Dawlih]],&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Bahai temples | first = V. | last = Rafati |author2=Sahba, F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; another Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh.

===Community of Merv===
The city of [[Merv]] (also spelled Marv, Mary) had a Bahá'í community, while it was far smaller and less developed. The Bahá'í community in the city received permission to build a House of Worship which they did on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name="turkm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEV"/&gt;

===Soviet period===
By the time the effects of the [[October Revolution]] began to spread across the Russian Empire transforming it into the [[Soviet Union]], Bahá'ís had spread&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; east through [[Central Asia]] and [[Caucasus]], and also north into [[Moscow]], [[Leningrad]], [[Tbilisi]]&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{Cite web|author=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Azerbaijan |title=Baha'i Faith History in Azerbaijan |work= |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Azerbaijan |url=http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml |doi= |accessdate=2008-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219032306/http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml |archivedate=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kazan]] with the community of Ashgabat alone numbering about 3000 adults. After the October Revolution the Ashgabat Bahá'í community was progressively severed from the rest of the worldwide Bahá'í community.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; In 1924 Bahá'ís in Merv had schools and a special committee for the advancement of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Foreign Bahá'í News |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July–August 1925 | page =7| url = | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the religion still grew in organization when the election of the regional National Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Caucasus and Turkistan in 1925.&lt;ref name="hassall-Rus"&gt;{{Cite journal

However, the Bahá'í House of Worship was expropriated by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities in 1928, the Bahá'í schools had been closed in 1930,&lt;ref name="DEV"/&gt; and the House of Worship was leased back to the Bahá'ís until 1938 when it was fully secularized by the communist government and turned into an [[art museum|art gallery]]. The records of events shows an increasing hostility to the Bahá'is between 1928 and 1938.&lt;ref name="events"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Survey of Current Baha'i Activities in the East and West: Persecution and Deportation of the Baha'is of Caucasus and Turkistan | journal = The Baha'i World |volume =  VIII | issue = 1938–40 | pages = 87–90 | publisher = Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Committee | year = 1942 | url = | doi = | id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1928 free rent was set for five years, and the Bahá'ís were asked to make certain repairs, which they did. But in 1933, before the five-year rent agreement expired the government suddenly decided expensive renovations would be required. These unexpected requirements were accomplished, but in 1934 complaints about the condition of the building were again laid. Inquires from abroad silenced the complaints. In 1936 escalated demands were made beyond the resources of the local community. The Bahá'ís of Turkistan and the Caucasus rallied and were able to sustain the construction requested. Then the government made moves to confiscate the main gardens of the property to provide for a playground of a school (the school itself being confiscated from the Bahá'ís originally) which would wall off the grounds from the Bahá'ís &amp;mdash; leaving only an entrance to the temple through a side entrance rather than the main entrance facing the front of the property. Protests lead to the abandonment of this plan; then in 1938 all pretexts came to an end.&lt;ref name="events"/&gt;

The [[1948 Ashgabat earthquake]] seriously damaged the building and rendered it unsafe; the heavy rains of the following years weakened the structure. It was demolished in 1963 and the site converted into a public park.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; With the Soviet ban on religion, the Bahá'ís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and its properties were nationalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh | publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition | date = 11 March 1936 | location = Haifa, Palestine | pages = 64–67 | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-34.html#pg64| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, with the [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) and the [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|policy of religious oppression]] most Bahá'ís were sent to prisons and camps or abroad; Bahá'í communities in 38 cities ceased to exist. In the case of Ashgabat, Bahá'í sources indicate&lt;ref name="events"/&gt; on 5 February the members of the assembly, leaders of the community and some general members of the community to a total of 500 people were arrested, homes were searched and all records and literature were confiscated (claiming they were working for the advantage of foreigners), and sometimes forced to dig their own graves as part of the interrogation. It is believed one woman set fire to herself and died later in a hospital. The women and children were largely exiled to Iran. In 1953 Bahá'ís started to move to the [[Soviet Republics]] in Asia, after the head of the religion at the time, [[Shoghi Effendi]], initiated a plan called the [[Ten Year Crusade]]. The Bahá'ís who moved to Turkmenistan found some individual Bahá'ís living there though the religion remained unorganized.&lt;ref name="russia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = Citadel of Faith | publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1980 third printing | orig-year = collected letters from 1947-57 | location = Haifa, Palestine |page=107 | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/CF/cf-9.html#pg107 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1978-9 civil war in [[Afghanistan]] some Bahá'ís fled to Turkmenistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in the Soviet Union was elected in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, when conditions permitted it in 1989; 61 Bahá'ís were listed as eligible for election. The Local Spiritual Assembly was officially registered by the city council of Ashgabat on 31 January 1990. Through the rest of 1990 several Local Spiritual Assemblies formed across the Soviet Union including [[Moscow]], [[Ulan-Ude]], [[Kazan]], [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]], [[Leningrad]], and [[Murmansk]].&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt; In September 1990, 26 Baha'is gathered together for the election of the first Local Spiritual Assembly of [[Merv]].&lt;ref name="turkm"/&gt; By September 1991, there were some 800 known Baha'is and 23 Local Spiritual Assemblies across the dissolving Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="russia"/&gt; while in Turkmenistan there were about 125 Bahá'ís with two Local Assemblies and two groups (in [[Balakhanih]] and [[Bayranali]]). When the National Spiritual Assembly of the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1992, a regional National Spiritual Assembly for the whole of Central Asia (Turkmenistan, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kirgizia]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]) was formed with its seat in Ashgabat. Most of these countries went on to form their own National Spiritual Assembly,&lt;ref name="turkm"/&gt; and their communities went on to flourish (see [[Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan]].)

==Banned community==

World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. As the environment of [[Perestroika]] took hold across the Soviet Block, the Bahá'í community of Ashgabat was the first to re-form its Local Spiritual Assembly following the oppressive decades of Soviet rule, had doubled its numbers from 1989 to 1991, and had successfully registered with the city government of Ashgabat.

However, the nation of Turkmenistan revised its religious registration laws such that, in 1995, 500 adult religious adherent citizens were required in each locality for a religious community to be registered.&lt;ref name="turk"/&gt; Thus by 1997 the Bahá'ís were unregistered by the government along with several other religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The '''banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal''' was part of a government campaign to suppress the resurgence of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Nepal]] in the early decades of the 20th century. There were two deportations of [[bhikkhu|monks]] from [[Kathmandu]], in 1926 and 1944.

The exiled monks were the first group of monks to be seen in Nepal since the [[14th century]]. They were at the forefront of a movement to revive [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], which had disappeared from the country more than five hundred years ago. The tyrannical [[Rana dynasty]] disapproved of Buddhism and the [[Newar language]]. It saw the activities of the monks and their growing following as a threat. When police harassment and imprisonment failed to deter the monks, all of whom were [[Newars]], they were deported.

Among the charges made against them were preaching a new faith, converting [[Hindu]]s, encouraging women to renounce and thereby undermining family life and writing books in Newari.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

==Expulsion of 1926==

In 1926, five monks along with their Tibetan guru Tsering Norbu were expelled from the country. These five monks, whose [[Dharma name]]s were [[Bauddha Rishi Mahapragya]], Mahaviryya, Mahachandra, Mahakhanti and Mahagnana, had been ordained under the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition.

The government objected to Mahapragya, who was born a [[Hindu]], converting to [[Buddhism]] and the monks making alms rounds in Kathmandu. The police arrested the monks and jailed and questioned them. The case went up to the prime minister, [[Chandra Shumsher JBR]], who ordered their banishment. They were given a few days to beg for provisions under the condition that they return to the police station to sleep. Then they were marched to the Indian border under police escort. The five monks and their teacher first went to [[Bodh Gaya]], [[India]], from where they scattered, some of them going to [[Burma]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich |first=Angela |title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution |url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=17 March 2011 |newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods |year=1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001124156/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |archivedate=1 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion of 1944==

In 1944, another group of eight monks were sent into exile. Their [[Dharma name]]s were [[Pragyananda Mahasthavir]], [[Dhammalok Mahasthavir]], [[Subodhananda|Subhodhananda]], Pragyarashmi, Pragyarasa, Ratnajyoti, Agga Dhamma and [[Kumar Kashyap Mahasthavir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lumbini.org.uk/bd_n_thera_t.html |title=Theravada Buddhism in Modern Nepal |publisher=Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK)|accessdate=15 May 2013|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This time they were accused of encouraging women to renounce and writing in [[Newar language|Newari.]] The monks were summoned before the prime minister [[Juddha Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Juddha Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] and ordered to sign a pledge that they would stop their activities. When they refused, they were ordered out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|title=The monks in yellow robes

The monks went to [[Kushinagar]] and then [[Sarnath]] in India. There they founded Dharmodaya Sabha (Society for the Rise of the Teaching) which worked to promote Buddhism and published religious literature from exile. Some of the monks remained in [[India]] while others went to [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hilker |first= DS Kansakar |title= Syamukapu: The Lhasa Newars of Kalimpong and Kathmandu |url= |accessdate= |year=2005 |publisher= Vajra Publications |location= Kathmandu |isbn=99946-644-6-8 |page=58|chapter= Expulsion of Buddhist monks from Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhaju Ratna Kansakar]], a Nepalese merchant based in [[Kalimpong]], was one of their largest supporters in exile.

==Return from exile==

In 1946, a [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] goodwill mission visited [[Kathmandu]] and interceded on behalf of the monks. The delegation emphasized that Nepal was the birthplace of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and that his followers should be free to practice their faith in the country where he was born.

{{Campaignbox Early Mughal-Sikh Wars}}

The '''Battle of Rohilla''' was a 1621 campaign by the [[Mughal Empire]] against the growing influence of the Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaques|first=Tony.|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbMFCZyAcnQC|accessdate=31 July 2010|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33536-5|page=860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of historic persecution from the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Guru Hargobind]] had militarized the Sikhs which resulted in increased political and military power. Thus he was attacked by a group of local jagirdars under the command of Abdul Khan.  Local jagidar got killed by Rao Mandan Rathore and the rest of the army fled the field of battle resulting in a decisive Sikh victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaques|first=Tony.|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbMFCZyAcnQC|accessdate=31 July 2010|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33536-5|page=860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Book_of_Wonders_folio_7b.jpg|thumb|[[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] or al-Saratan, one of the signs of the Zodiac depicted in the book]]
The '''''Kitab al-Bulhan''''' كتاب البلهان, or '''''Book of Wonders''''', or '''''Book of Surprises''''',{{sfn|Carboni|loc=La Trobe Journal|p=22}} is a mainly 14th century Arabic manuscript compiled, and possibly illustrated,{{sfn|Carboni|loc=La Trobe Journal|p=34}} by [[Abd al-Hasan Al-Isfahani]].  The [[codex]] was probably bound during the reign of [[Ahmad Jalayir|Jalayirid Sultan Ahmad]] (1382-1410) at [[Baghdad]], and includes texts on [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[geomancy]] and a section of full-page illustrated plates dedicated to each discourse topic, e.g. a folktale, a sign of the zodiac, a prophet, etc.{{sfn|Carboni|2007|p=295}}{{sfn|Isfahani (al-), Kitab al-Bulhan|1390}}

==History of Manuscript==

The [[calligrapher]], copiest and compiler, ʿAbd al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn ʿAli ibn al-Hasan al-Isfahani, whose family came from [[Isfahan]] in [[Iran]] was a native of [[Baghdad]] where he studied the Aristotelic ‘demonstrative’ (burhan) sciences.{{sfn|Carboni|loc=La Trobe Journal|p=24}} It seems  the Kitab al-Bulhan was commissioned by, or the idea of, Shaykh al-Diya Husayn al-Irbili’{{mdash}}originally of [[Irbil]] near [[Mosul]] in northern [[Iraq]] {{mdash}} who sold it to Haydar ibn al-Hajji ʿAbd al-Karim ibn Muhammad in Dec 1409 - Jan 1410.  The original codex comprised a series of treatises, which came apart and when sections were reassembled and some lost, it became jumbled and incoherent.  The work includes extracts copied from the ''Kitab al-mawalid'' or ‘Book of Nativities’ of the [[astronomer]] and [[neo-Platonist]] [[Abu Maʿshar|Abu Maʿshar al-Balkhi]] (787-886 CE) of Balkh (modern-day [[Mazar-i Sharif]]) in northern [[Afghanistan]].{{sfn|Carboni|loc=La Trobe Journal|p=24}}

==Manuscript Copies==

In the late C. 16th two Turkish copies were made from the original for the two daughters of the [[Ottoman sultan]] [[Murad III]] (r. 1574–95.), one for Aysha Sultan, (c. 1582), the other for Fatma Sultan.  These manuscripts are complete and establish the original order of the treatises of the Kitab al-Bulhan.  The codices are now held at the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]], [[New York City]] and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliotèque Nationale]], [[Paris]].{{sfn|Carboni|loc=La Trobe Journal|p=25}}

'''Das Granthi'''(ਦਸ ਗ੍ਰੰਥੀ) is a small religious booklet containing only few selected compositions from [[Dasam Granth]], the second scripture of [[Sikh]]s. Das stands for ''Ten'' and Granthi stands for ''booklet''. It means Booklet of 10th Guru of Sikhism.
This booklet was created for beginners and lay readers for reading these compositions in daily liturgy for proper understanding. &lt;ref&gt;Page 330,Punjab District and State Gazetteers: Compiled and published under the authority of the Punjab government, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 62, Struggle of the Sikhs for Sovereignty, Surjit Singh Gandhi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 180, The Guru Consorts, Mahindara Kaura Gilla, Radha Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no standardization of this booklet and various sects in Sikhism have their own version of Das Granthi. [[SGPC]] contains eight texts namely, Japu, Bachitra Natak, Chandi Charitra I, Shabad Patshahi 10, Akal Ustati, Chandi Charitra 2, Gian Prabodh and Chandi di Var.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/scriptures/sri-guru-granth-sahib-and-guru-gobind-singhs-bani/das-granthi The Sikh Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolpe has led numerous missions to Israel.  The first, in June 2002, was a solidarity mission at the height of the [[Second Intifada]] that broke out after the [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David peace talks]].  The second, in May 2005, was a mission of gratitude to pick up the [[Torah]] commissioned in honor of his recovery from brain surgery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/searchview.php?id=11757&lt;/ref&gt;  The third, in July 2006, at the height of the [[2006 Israel-Hezbollah War]], was another solidarity mission that covered [[Jerusalem]], [[Haifa]], and [[Sderot]]. In the midst of the second intifada, Wolpe raised three million dollars for victims of terror in a single morning at his [[synagogue]].  Wolpe also led the largest American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) delegation ever assembled from one synagogue to the AIPAC conference in Washington in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 with numbers ranging from 230-300 delegates.  Wolpe also traveled to Haiti to help his friend [[Mitch Albom]] ''([[Tuesdays with Morrie]])'' rebuild an orphanage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/christian_charity_in_haiti_is_the_jewish_thing_to_do_20110119/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historicity of the Exodus==
{{Further|Historicity of the Bible}}
On [[Passover]] 2001, Wolpe told his congregation that "the way the Bible describes the Exodus is not the way it happened, if it happened at all." Casting doubt on the historicity of [[the Exodus]] during the [[holiday]] that commemorates it brought condemnation from congregants and several rabbis (especially [[Orthodox Rabbi]]s).  The ensuing theological debate included whole issues of Jewish newspapers such as the ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]'' in Los Angeles and editorials in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', as well as an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.  Critics asserted that Wolpe was attacking Jewish [[oral history]], the significance of Passover and even the [[Ten Commandments|First Commandment]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Wolpe asserted that he was arguing that the historicity of the events should not matter, since he believes [[faith]] is not determined by the same criteria as empirical [[truth]].  Wolpe argues that his views are based on the fact that no archeological digs have produced evidence of the Jews wandering the Sinai Desert for forty years, and that excavations in Israel consistently show settlement patterns at variance with the Biblical account of a sudden influx of Jews from Egypt.

In March 2010, Wolpe expounded on his views saying that it was possible that a small group of people left Egypt, came to Canaan, and influenced the native Canaanites with their traditions.  He added that the controversy of 2001 stemmed from the fact that [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] congregations have been slow to accept and embrace [[biblical criticism]]. Conservative rabbis, on the other hand, are taught biblical criticism in rabbinical school.&lt;ref&gt;Q&amp;A following [http://www.sinaitemple.org/programs/031710Dayan.mp3 a lecture on the Exodus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129150509/http://sinaitemple.org/programs/031710Dayan.mp3 |date=2010-11-29 }} given at Sinai Temple, March 17, 2010.  Begin listening at 00:58:53 until 01:02:31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covenantal Judaism==
On November 10, 2005, Rabbi Wolpe addressed the Jewish Theological Seminary and proposed that the name of Conservative Judaism be changed to "Covenantal Judaism," to better encompass the view that rabbinic law is both binding and evolving.

==Vegetarianism==
Wolpe is a committed [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Rob Eshman suggests that Wolpe "leans [[Veganism|vegan]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishjournal.com/foodaism/item/friday_the_rabbi_eats_tofu_20100305/&lt;/ref&gt; Wolpe serves on the Rabbinic Council of Jewish Vegetarians of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishveg.com/content/about-us-20 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111190338/http://www.jewishveg.com/content/about-us-20 |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Delosperma cooperi''''' ([[synonymy|syn.]] ''Mesembryanthemum cooperi''; common names '''Trailing Iceplant''', Hardy Iceplant, or "Pink Carpet") is a dwarf [[perennial plant]], native to [[South Africa]]. It forms a dense lawn with abundant, long-lasting flowering. It will reach sizes of approximately {{convert|10|–|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} tall, with fleshy leaves and a trailing stem that hangs down.

The flowers are the most brilliant aspect of this plant, with the production of a great quantity of vermillion, magenta or pink flowers that will often cover the entire site, hence the popular name "pink carpet". The plant contains ramified stems that are spread out, carrying sheets opposed, and are long and narrow, with the end of the stems increasing into a quantity of isolated small flowers, with diameters ranging from {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. These abundant and long-lasting flowers will remain in bloom from July through September.{{Where|date=May 2012}} The plant is sun-loving, and thrives well in very dry and hot environments. While it adapts well to various soil types, it will suffer under [[water stagnation]], and thus prefers well drained soils, or even rocky terrain.

According to the New Mexico State University extension, the common name, "ice plant" is because "they have bladder-like hairs on the leaf surface that reflect and refract light in a manner to make it appear that they sparkle like ice crystals" (or tiny glass beads). However, many other species of succulent so-called "ice plant" ground covers have smooth and hairless leaves.

==Cultivation and uses==
It can be cultivated in a wide range of areas with a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Unlike many ice plants, this species is hardy to {{convert|-20|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, successfully overwintering at locations such as Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois. The leaves turn red in cold winter temperatures. Due to the low need for maintenance, it is suitable for urban environments and high temperature regions. It can often be found in large, extensive patches. The trailing stems also make it suitable for flowerpots and terraces.

Propagation can be accomplished by taking a flowerless cutting, stripping a couple of bottom leaves off, and then replanting in the same soil.

The plant contains the halucinogen chemicals [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[5-MeO-DMT]], which can be extracted from the leaves. The content of these chemicals varies over the year. The content of 5-MeO-DMT rises during the summer and the content of DMT instead rises during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://troutsnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SoS_2004_Trout.pdf|title=Trout’s  Notes  on Some Other Succulents|journal=Sacred Cacti Third Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ZenBuddhism}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Denkōroku'''''|伝光録||''Record of the Transmission of the Light''}} is a [[kōan]] collection written in 1300 by [[Keizan]] Jokin Zenji, the Great Patriarch of [[Sōtō|Sōtō Zen]] [[Buddhism]], based on approximately a year of his [[Dharma talk]]s.

The book includes 53 [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] stories covering 1600 or more years based on the traditional legendary accounts of [[Dharma transmission]] in the Sōtō lineage. Successive masters and disciples in the book are [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni Buddha]] circa 360 to 440 BCE in India, to Zen master [[Koun Ejō|Ejō]] in about 1230 or 1240 in Japan.

While other translations are available as of 2012, this article was developed for the most part from the introduction and translator's note by Francis Dojun Cook.

==Synopsis==
===Contents===
Dharma transmissions covered 28 ancestors from [[India]] and 23 from [[China]], followed by [[Dōgen]] and Ejō in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Daido Loori]], in Cook, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of modesty and his sense of propriety,  Keizan, the 54th ancestor, omitted himself and [[Tettsu Gikai]], one of his teachers who was a student of Ejō and was still alive in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Each chapter is a few pages, except in a couple cases where the author wants to explain a point.

The format for each koan account is in four parts: (1) the main koan case that is the enlightenment encounter between master and disciple,&lt;ref name=Loori /&gt; (2) a brief biographical account on the life of the disciple including context for the encounter,&lt;ref name=Loori /&gt; (3) Keizan's ''[[Buddhist_terms_and_concepts#T|teisho]]'' or commentary on the koan,&lt;ref name=Loori /&gt; and (4) a verse written by Keizan summarizing the point, following the Zen tradition of understanding presented by the master or disciple in [[poetry]].&lt;ref name=Loori&gt;Loori, in Cook, pp. xiii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is not true in a strictly historical sense: for example, [[Bodhidharma]] is probably a mythical figure, the Sixth Patriarch was probably not [[Huineng]], and someone else probably wrote the ''[[Platform Sutra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead ''Denkōroku'' may be read as true in the sense that great novels like ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' or ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' are true.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keizan included fantastical or magical details from the lives of some ancestors, especially those in India, which audiences in times past may have appreciated but which today might be met with skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following summary is taken from the Cook translation table of contents, with names according to [[Thomas Cleary]] in parentheses.

===India===
Keizan begins with [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni]], the historical Buddha, followed by his disciple [[Mahākāśyapa|Mahākāśhyapa]] (Kasyapa&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), and then [[Ananda]], both of whom knew Buddha before he died.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, pp. 32, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Following are [[Shanavasa]], [[Upagupta]], Dhritaka (Dhrtaka&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Micchaka, [[Vasumitra]], Buddhanandi, Buddhamitra (Punyamitra&lt;ref name=ClearyContents&gt;Cleary, Contents pp. v-vii.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Parshva]], Punyayashas, [[Ashvaghosa]] (Ashvaghosha&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), and Kapimala. Then comes [[Nagarjuna]], [[Kanadeva]], Rahulata, Sanghanandi, Gayashata (Jayashata&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Kumarata, Jayata, [[Vasubandhu]], Manorhita (Manora&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Haklenayashas (Haklena&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Aryasimha (Sinha&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Basiasita (Vashashita&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Punyamitra, and [[Prajnatara]]. Finally, [[Bodhidharma]] was the 28th ancestor from India.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=CookContents&gt;Cook, Contents pp. vii-ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Following Bodhidharma, [[Dazu Huike]] (Huike [Shenguang]&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;) was the 29th ancestor, the 2nd in China.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Following are [[Jianzhi Sengcan]] (Sengcan&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Dayi Daoxin]] (Daoxin&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Daman Hongren]] (Hongren&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Huineng|Dajian Huineng]] (Huineng&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Qingyuan Xingsi]] (Qingyuan&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Shitou Xiqian]] (Shitou&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Yaoshan Weiyan]] (Yaoshan&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Yunyan Tansheng]] (Yunyan&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (Dongshan&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Yunhju Daoying (Yunju&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Tongan Daopi]] (Daopi&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Tongan Guanzhi]] (Tongan&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Liangshan Yuanguan]] (Liangshan&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Dayang Jingxuan]] (Dayang&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Touzi Yiqing]] (Touzi&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Furong Daokai]] (Daokai&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Danxia Zichun]] (Danxia&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Zhenxie Qingliao]] (Wukong&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), [[Tiantong Zongjue]] (Zongjue&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), Xuedou Zhijian (Zhijian&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;), and [[Rujing|Tiantong Rujing]] (Rujing&lt;ref name=ClearyContents /&gt;).&lt;ref name=CookContents /&gt;

===Japan===
The 51st ancestor was [[Dōgen|Eihei Dogen]] who traveled from Japan to China and back.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, pp. 255, 258, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The 52nd ancestor was his student, [[Koun Ejō]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CookContents /&gt;

==Authorship==
[[File:Keizan-SotoZen-Net.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Waist high view of man with shaved head|[[Keizan]] is generally held to be the author.]]
Keizan originally gave this series of 53 Dharma talks to the monks of the [[Daijō-ji]] monastery during spring and the following winter ''[[ango]]'' practice periods. Keizan was 36 years old at the time.&lt;ref name="Cook, p. 22"/&gt;

According to one translator, Francis Cook, there is some controversy and "uneasiness" about authorship.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the work was hidden from the public eye for nearly 600 years. A monk named Sen'ei was the first to publish it, in 1857, or 557 years after it was written.&lt;ref name=Cook23&gt;Cook, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1886, Yoshida Gizan published an annotated edition in Kyoto.&lt;ref name=Cook23 /&gt; In 1885, [[Sōji-ji]] published what is called the Honzan edition, based on a manuscript copy owned by a private collector.&lt;ref name=Cook23 /&gt; The oldest existing manuscript copy was found in 1959.&lt;ref name=Cook23 /&gt; It is thought to have been copied during the late to mid-15th century.&lt;ref name=Cook23 /&gt; [[Komazawa University]] published a catalog in 1962, which listed 11 copies.&lt;ref name=Cook23 /&gt; By 1976, 19 copies were known—some of them verified and some not.&lt;ref name=Cook23 /&gt; Some of these copies were known to no longer exist.&lt;ref name=Cook23 /&gt; Okubo Doshu, a noted Dogen scholar, doubted the work's author for a number of reasons, including discrepancies in the last two chapters, along with the absence of a historical record attributing what is a major work to Keizan. But neither he nor any other scholar has ever come out to say that Keizan is ''not'' the author, so the consensus remains to attribute the work to Keizan.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
While [[Dōgen]] is held to be the school's founder, Keizan was in large part responsible for the flourishing of Sōtō Zen. He resisted the purist approach taken by Dōgen who preferred to teach and write; he took care to serve his congregation who might have dead or dying relatives; he founded new monasteries and temples; and he attracted followers like Gashau and Meiho who became his successors.&lt;ref name="Cook, p. 22"&gt;Cook, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Today Sōtō Zen remains one of the largest Buddhist organizations in Japan.

==Reaction==
One translator, Cleary, writes:
{{quote|One of the proverbial guidelines for Zen study is: "First awaken on your own, then see someone else." As a handbook of method, ''Transmission of Light'' is a classic guide to "awakening on your own." As a collection of criteria, it is a way to "see someone else."&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Disputatio nova contra mulieres, qua probatur eas homines non esse''''' (English translation:  ''A new argument against women, in which it is demonstrated that they are not human beings'') is a [[satirical]] [[misogynistic]] [[Latin|Latin-language]] treatise first published in 1595 and subsequently reprinted several times, particularly throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. ''Disputatio'' was written [[anonymously]], although it has been attributed to [[Valens Acidalius]], a 16th-century German critic.

Despite the fact that the treatise was meant to parody the [[Socinianism|Socinian Anabaptist]] belief that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] was not [[divine]], several [[anti-feminist]]s utilized a literal interpretation of the tract to support their views.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} ''Disputatio'' proved to be unusually provocative in its time for a publication of its size, which eventually led to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Holy See]] listing the manuscript in its ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (''List of Prohibited Books'') on multiple occasions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28659">The '''districts of the Church of the Brethren''' are 23 regional divisions that serve to administer the 1,035 congregations&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brethren.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cob_dirSearch&amp;searchChurch=&amp;searchDistrict=&amp;searchCity=&amp;searchState=PR&amp;searchZip=&amp;dir_search=Search |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110811151912/http://www.brethren.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cob_dirSearch&amp;searchChurch=&amp;searchDistrict=&amp;searchCity=&amp;searchState=PR&amp;searchZip=&amp;dir_search=Search |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-08-11 |title=Church directory |publisher=Church of the Brethren |accessdate=2010-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Church of the Brethren]] in the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. Districts are divided along state and county lines with membership and geographic scope varying widely. The Church of the Brethren is present in 34 states, Puerto Rico, and [[Washington, D. C.]] in addition to their overseas missions.

==History and purpose==
The district system has existed amongst [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] since 1856—prior to the 1881–1883 split—and served the administrative purpose of determining delegates to the Annual Conference who could represent the interests of various communities and report back to them the proceedings.&lt;ref name="vine"&gt;{{Citation |last=Durnbaugh |first=Donald F. |title=Fruit of the Vine: A History of the Brethren 1708–1995 |format=Hardback |year=1997 |publisher=[[Brethren Press]] |location=[[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]] |isbn=0-87178-003-8 |page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of the Brethren is governed by a [[Congregationalist polity|Congregationalist]] model of church polity, so most decisions are made locally by individual congregations without interference from any hierarchical structure. Delegates from districts serve the purpose of raising issues at Annual Conferences (called "queries") which affect the Church of the Brethren at large or which have a scope greater than that of a single congregation or locality—e.g. the [[ordination of women]] or how to regulate funds for [[Missionary|missions activities]]. Due to the increase in queries presented to the Annual Conference, in 1856, the Brethren approved the establishment of districts of no less than five churches that would answer queries that had a local scope.&lt;ref name="dev103"&gt;*{{Citation |last=Stoffer |first=Dale R. |editor=William R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4440">The '''Edfu project''' is being undertaken with the primary goal of translations of inscriptions of an ancient temple of [[Edfu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfu-projekt.gwdg.de/Project5.html description] introductory statement&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1986, Professor Dr. Dieter Kurth of [[Hamburg University]] initiated a long-term project that is devoted to a complete translation of the hieroglyphic inscriptions of the [[Temple of Edfu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfu-projekt.gwdg.de/Project.html  brief details of temple] retrieved 18/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edfu-projekt.gwdg.de/Temple.html temple plan and photographic] retrieved 18/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Upper [[Egypt]] (Temple of [[Horus]]) that meets the requirement of both linguistics and literary studies.
In addition, the research comprises all internal parallels, relevant literature and an analysis of the systematics behind the decoration. Comprehensive analytical indices – which are useful for researchers of related disciplines – and a grammar of [[Graeco-Roman]] temple inscriptions are compiled, too. Situated at the [[University of Hamburg]], the Edfu project was financed by the "[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]]" until 2001. Since 2002, the Academy of Sciences of Göttingen is in charge of the Edfu project, which is now financed by the "Academies' Programme". The research unit works still at Hamburg University.
A translation of the inscriptions of the pylon (gate) including transcriptions and a commentary was published in 1998 (Edfou VIII). In 2004, it was followed by a translation of the inscriptions of the outer girdle wall (Edfou VII) some of which had not been published before. The most recent publication, released in 2014, provides a translation of the inscriptions of the inner side of the girdle wall (Edfou VI). Inscriptions of the open court and its columns (Chassinat, Edfou V-VI) are available in preliminary translation.

'''Esther Shalev-Gerz''' (born Gilinsky) is a [[contemporary artist]]. She lives and works in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[New York City]].

==Biography==

Esther Shalev-Gerz was born in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]. In 1957, she moved with her family to [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].

From 1975 to 1979 she studied [[Fine arts]] at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] where she got her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]]. She then lived in New York City for one year (1980/81).

From 1981 she participated in collective exhibitions in institutions such as the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem and the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].

In 1983 she produced her first work in public space: ''Oil on Stone'', a permanent installation in [[Tel Hai]], Israel, for the Tel Hai Contemporary Art Meeting.

In 1984 the artist moved to Paris and started working through Europe and Canada.

In 1990 she got an artistic residency from the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] and moved to Berlin for one year.

In 2002 she stayed at the [[IASPIS]] residency in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

From 2003 to 2014 she taught the Master of Fine Arts students in [[Valand Academy]], [[University of Gothenburg]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/?page_id=78 Shalev-Gerz's biography on her website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her latest major exhibitions were ''Ton Image me Regarde?!'', 2010, in the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], Paris, in which ten of her installations were displayed&lt;ref&gt;''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, {{ISBN|978-2-84975-187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeudepaume.org/index.php?page=article&amp;idArt=1124&amp;lieu=7  Jeu de Paume website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Jones, ''I Saw It'', frieze, UK, March, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Matheson, "Esther Shalev-Gerz Ton image me regarde!?", Ciel Variable n°86, Canada, September, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and her retrospective entitled ''Between Telling and Listening'', 2012, in the [[Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] where she presented 15 of her installations. Besides, her work was the subject of an itinerary personal exhibition in Canada between 2012 and 2014, firstly in the [[Kamloops]] Art Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kag.bc.ca/2012.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; then in the [[Research#Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery|Belkin Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belkin.ubc.ca/past/esther-shalev-gerz]&lt;/ref&gt; UBC, [[Vancouver]] and finally in the Galerie de l'UQAM, Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://galerie.uqam.ca/en/exhibitions/past/2014.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 she received a three-year grant  from the [[Swedish Research Council]] for her [[Research#Artistic research|Artistic Research]] project ''Trust and the Unfolding Dialogue''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valand.gu.se/english/research/ Valand website, Artistic Research page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 was released the illustrated anthology ''Esther Shalev-Gerz, The Contemporary Art of Trusting Uncertainties and Unfolding Dialogues''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideabooks.nl/9789198087475-esther-shalev-gerz-the-contemporary-art-of-trusting-uncertainties-and-unfolding-dialogues]&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Jason E. Bowman]] that gathers new texts around Shalev-Gerz's work and the notion of Trust as well as formerly published texts on her art. Among the authors are [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Georges Didi-Huberman]], [[Jacqueline Rose]], [[James E. Young]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]].

In 2014 her team is one of the six finalists of the competition for the design of the Canadian National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa, with the teams of [[Yael Bartana]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]], [[David Adjaye]] or [[Gilles Saucier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/six-finalist-teams-for-national-holocaust-monument-announced/1002679111/?&amp;er=NA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Fonds municipal d'art contemporain of the city of [[Geneva]] acquired the artwork ''Les Inséparables'', 2000-2010, a monumental double-clock installed as a permanent work in public space.

==Work overview==

Esther Shalev-Gerz questions the perpetual construction of the relationship between an experience and the telling one gives of it. She analyses portraiture, which she understands as the reflection of a person, place or event. Her work invites the spectator to an opening to the ambiguities and multiplicities acting in the collective memory. Her installations, photography, video and public sculpture are developed through dialogue, consultation and negotiation with people whose participation provides an emphasis to their individual and collective memories, accounts, opinions and experiences. Constantly inquiring into transitional qualities of time and space and the correlative transformation of identities, locales and (hi)stories Esther Shalev-Gerz has produced a body of work that simultaneously records, critiques, and contributes to the understandings of the societal roles and value of artistic practice.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Shalev-Gerz, ''Listening Voices: On Actualizing Memories'' in ''Cultures and Globalization: Heritage, Memory and Identity'' by Helmut Anheir and Raj Isar, SAGE publications Ltd, London, United Kingdom, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In her text entitled ''The Perpetual Movement of Memory'', Shalev-Gerz describes her practice: "In my works in the public realm, a space is constructed for memories activated by participation, that is to say, the moment when the supposed spectator becomes a participant by writing his name, using his voice or sending in his photo. Thanks to the traces left during this acts, these participants keep the memory of their own participation in the work’s procedure, which also bears witness to their responsibility to their own times."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Geht dein Bild mich an?/Does Your Image Reflect Me?'', Sprengel-Museum, Hannover, Germany, 2002, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Marta Gili]], director of the Jeu de Paume, Shalev-Gerz adds: "I try to enter the space that opens between listening and telling in order to get away from the logic of discourse, that is to say, to accede to another kind of space and consider it artistically. It’s a kind of "reveal" of the intelligibility of the sensible/sensitive or of a memory that differs from the one constructed by words, akin to concepts that traverse the body, able to be picked up by the gaze."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

And also: "As an artist, it is very important for me to trust the participants – whom I approach (right away) as equals, and whose contributions are an element of the project. I think that this is what makes it possible to produce the work: trust in the other person’s intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

In his text entitled ''The Image of the Other'', in the catalogue of the exhibition ''Does Your Image Reflect Me?'' [[Ulrich Krempel]] provides his understanding of Shalev-Gerz’ work: "One thing is certain: only by talking and listening, passing on first-hand experience, images, emotional glances and moments, can we bring ourselves to the point where remembrance is converted into action".&lt;ref&gt;in ''Geht dein Bild mich an?/Does Your Image Reflect Me?'', Sprengel-Museum, Hannover, Germany, 2002, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Rancière]] in his text ''The Work of the Image'', for the catalogue of ''MenschenDinge/The Human Aspect of Objects'', republished in the catalogue of the Jeu de Paume show, described the artist’s work in these words: "Esther Shalev-Gerz does not give voice to the witnesses of the past or of elsewhere, but to researchers that are at work in the here and now. She makes the ones who come from elsewhere speak of the present as they do of the past, of here as of there. She makes them speak about the way they have thought and arrange the relationship between one place and another, one time and another. But also the dispositifs that she constructs are themselves dispositifs that distend their words, and subject them to representation of the conditions governing their listening and uttering."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some projects and exhibitions==

* ''Monument Against fascism'', [[Hamburg]], Germany, 1986. Esther Shalev-Gerz developed with [[Jochen Gerz]] this permanent installation via an international competition organized by the city.  They erected in a public square a column clad in lead beside which they provided a metal pencil and a panel with the following text translated in seven languages (English, French, German, Russian, Turkish, Arabic and Hebrew):
"We invite the citizens of [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]], and visitors to the town, to add their names here to ours. In doing so we commit ourselves to remain vigilant. As more and more names cover this 12 metre-high lead column, it will gradually be lowered into the ground. One day it will have disappeared completely and the site of the Harburg monument against fascism will be empty. In the long run, it is only we ourselves who can stand up against injustice."

The column was sunk into the ground seven times from 1986 to 1993. All that remains visible are a lead plaque on the ground, the text panel and photos of the different stages.&lt;ref&gt;James E.

* ''Erase the Past'', Berlin, Germany, 1991. In 1990, during her residency in Berlin and just after the [[Berlin Wall#The Fall|Fall of the Berlin Wall]], Shalev-Gerz received as a present a portrait of [[Honecker]] sold off the street. She realized then this work as a slide series and a book both inspired by the [[Flip book|flipbook]]. In the same room, one can see a portrait of Honecker or a portrait of [[Brecht]]. By flipping the images, one realizes that the portrait resists a zoom movement as it keeps the same size when the walls and furnitures shrink or enlarge.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Erase the Past'', DAAD editions, Berlin, Germany, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/erasethepast  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Erase The Past'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Irreparable'', Musée de [[La Roche-sur-Yon]], France, 1996. In her first solo show in France, Shalev-Gerz presented her photographic series ''Irreparable'' as well as 15 other slideshows such as ''Just One Sky'', ''Homage to [[Lucy Schwob]]'' or ''Sea of Stones''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue by Esther Shalev-Gerz: ''Irréparable'', Musée de la Roche-sur-Yon, France, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/irreparable   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Irreparable'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/justeunciel  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Just One Sky'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Berlin Inquiry'', Berlin, Germany, 1998. She created with Jochen Gerz this interpretation of [[Peter Weiss]]’ play ''[[The Investigation (play)|Die Ermittlung'']], 1965. Weiss’ play is composed with testimonies of victims, perpetrators, judges and witnesses in the Auschwitz trials. The artists’ interpretation undermined the conventional distinctions between witnesses and actors by having the work performed by the audience. Over the five sold-out performances held in three theatres, Hebbel Theatre Berlin, Berliner Ensemble, Volksbühne am Rosa Luxemburg Platz, the course of each evening was determined by co-participation. Serving only as moderators, each theatre’s company of actors would invite attendees (individually, as a group, a musical choir or as a crowd) to recite passages from the text, so that every spectator became an actor. Not simply a recalling, the collective participatory qualities of ''The Berlin Inquiry'' rendered passive witnessing impossible and in permanently lit auditoria new forms of memory and remembrance were authored.&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz and Jochen Gerz: ''Die Berliner Ermittlung'', Hebbel-Theater, Berlin, Germany, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Die Berliner Ermittlung von Jochen Gerz und Esther Shalev-Gerz'' in Theater als Öffentlicher ''Raum, Christel Weiler, ''Spielen in Auschwitz'', in Theater der Zeit, Germany, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/berlin  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Berlin Inquiry'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Portraits of Stories'', 1998 to 2008. Esther Shalev-Gerz developed for this project a video and photo series. In [[Aubervilliers]], north of Paris, in Belzunce, a neighbourhood of [[Marseille]], in [[Skoghall]], Sweden and in [[Sandwell]], United Kingdom, she asked the participants in her project "What story must be told today?" Then they would decide where and how they wanted to be filmed and they would tell the story of their choice. More than 200 people answered this question. Each installation was shown in the city where it was conceived. In 2008 an exhibition displaying all the interviews was held in England.&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz: ''Les Portraits des Histoires – Aubervilliers'', Editions ENSBA, France, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz: ''Les Portraits des Histoires – Belsunce'', Editions Images en Manoeuvres, Marseille, France, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitsaubervilliers  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Aubervilliers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitsmarseille  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Marseille]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitsskoghall   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Skoghall]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitssandwell   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Sandwell]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Inseparable Angels: The Imaginary House of Walter Benjamin'', 2000. This installation comprises a video of the artist’s taxi ride between Weimar and Buchenwald, a series of photographs and two objects: a double-chair and a clock that has two faces – one showing time going forwards, the other backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Två installationer/Two Installations'', History Museum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie Heckmann, ''Spurensuche mit Engel'', in Berliner Zeitung, Germany n¡44, February 21st, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Bettina Müller, ''Engel im Gepäck'', in Der Tagesspiegel, Germany, n°17, February 24th, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/inseparable   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Inseparable Angels'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''White Out: Between Telling and Listening'', Stockholm, 2002. During her researches Shalev-Gerz found out that there was no word war in the [[Sami people|Sami]] language and that in parallel to that fact, Sweden had not participated in any war for over 200 years. Two screens facing each other show the same person. On one screen Asa Simma, a woman of dual culture, Sami and Swedish, speaks in her Stockholm apartment. On another video facing this one, she is in the landscape where she was born, in the North of Sweden, listening to her own words recorded in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Två installationer/Two Installations'', History Museum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/whiteout   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''White Out'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Does Your Image Reflect Me?'' 2002, [[Sprengel Museum]], [[Hanover]]. In this work the artist created an encounter between two women who were not far away from each other during World War II. One is German and was living in Hanover, 40&amp;nbsp;km away from the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] camp. The other is born in Poland and survived her internment in this very camp. On a photographic series and four screens, one can see each woman twice. As she is telling her story and as she is listening to the story of the other. It is only during the opening of the exhibition that they did really meet.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Geht dein Bild mich an? / Does Your Image Reflect Me?'', Sprengel-Museum, Hannover, Germany, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/tonimage   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Does Your Image Reflect Me?'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''First Generation'', 2004, Sweden. For this permanent installation, Shalev-Gerz filmed in extreme close-ups the face of each of the 34 people from the first generation of immigrants as she/he listens to her/his answers to the questions: when arriving here, what did you lose? What did you find? What did you get? What did you give? This silent film is visible on the glass façade of the Multicultural Center Botkyrka. One can here their voice by entering the building.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''First Generation'', Multiculturel Center, Fitja, Sweden, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/firstgeneration   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''First Generation'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Between Listening and Telling: Last Witnesses, Auschwitz 1945-2005''. In 2005 in commemoration of the liberation of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] camp, Shalev-Gerz designed this project for the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris]]. In the great Hall of the Hotel de Ville 60 little DVD players arranged on big tables would allow the visitors to watch the testimonies of 60 survivors collected on this occasion. In parallel to these a large silent video triptych was installed on the wall at the end of the hall. On each screen the same video with a 7 seconds lap: a slow motion edition of the moments of silence in the testimonies of the survivors, between the question and the answer, between a memory and a telling.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Boulbès, ''Entre l’écoute et la parole, derniers témoins'', in Art Press, France, n°312, May, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/between   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Between Listening and Telling'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A Thread'', permanent installation, [[Castlemilk]], south of [[Glasgow]]. From 2003 to 2006 Esther Shalev-Gerz developed a project in which ten groups of participants were invited to choose their favourite view in the former park of a castle near their new housing. At each point of view a circular bench was installed thus creating a path through the park.&lt;ref&gt;Publication: ''The Thread'', Aje Aje, in collaboration with CCA, Glasgow, U.K., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/thread   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Thread'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Menschendinge/The Human Aspect of Objects'', 2006, The [[Buchenwald]] Memorial, Germany. For this project the artist invited 5 persons working in the Memorial to talk about different objects created or adapted by the prisoners. The archaeologist, the historian, the conservator, the director and the photograph tell the reconstructed or imagined stories of these objects in 5 videos and 25 photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''MenschenDinge'', (The Human Aspect of Objects), Gedenkstätte Buchenwald, Germany, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/menschendinge   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Menschendinge'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Daedal(us)'', 2006, [[Dublin]], Ireland. 24 photographs of façades were projected on other buildings of the same neighbourhood after the owners of these buildings agreed for this as well as those who accepted to host a projector during the month the project lasted. Photos of these projections were printed and exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;''Wall to wall and off the beaten track'', in The Irish Times, Wednesday, p. 14, Ireland, February 8th, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Daedal(us)'', Fire Station Artists’ Studios, Dublin, Ireland, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/daedalus  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Daedal(us)'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Place of Art'', 2006, Sweden. "How would you define art?" and "Where does it take place?" Shalev-Gerz collected the answers to these two questions from 38 artists living in the suburb of [[Gothenburg]]. A video was displayed in a shopping centre and four other in the Konsthalle, 7&amp;nbsp;km away from the mall.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''The Place of Art'', Art monitor, Göteborg University, Sweden, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/theplaceofart   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Place of Art'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent installations in public space==

*''Oil on Stone'', [[Tel Hai]], [[Israel]], 1983. A sculpture realized from a white Jerusalem stone slab cut into bricks and brought to the Tel Hai hill where it reassembled by the artist as two walls forming a 45° angle without touching each other, so that depending on the point of view one sees a silhouette pointing north or walls fallen into ruins.
* ''Monument Against fascism'', [[Hamburg]], Germany, 1986. Esther Shalev-Gerz developed with [[Jochen Gerz]] this permanent installation via an international competition organized by the city.  They erected in a public square a column clad in lead beside which they provided a metal pencil and a panel with the following text translated in seven languages (English, French, German, Russian, Turk, Arabic and Hebrew):
"We invite the citizens of [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]], and visitors to the town, to add their names here to ours. In doing so we commit ourselves to remain vigilant. As more and more names cover this 12 metre-high lead column, it will gradually be lowered into the ground. One day it will have disappeared completely and the site of the Harburg monument against fascism will be empty. In the long run, it is only we ourselves who can stand up against injustice."

The column was sunk into the ground seven times from 1986 to 1993. All that remains visible are a lead plaque on the ground, the text panel and photos of the different stages.&lt;ref&gt;James E.

A commission by the German government to commemorate the 50 anniversary of the creation of the United nations in 1995. The two masts, reminiscent of the poles from which emblematic flags are flown, represent on the one hand the role of distribution to new beginnings and on the other hand the necessity to assemble histories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5596">{{redirect|Balduinus|other people with this name|Baldwin (name)}}
'''François Baudouin''' (1520–1573), also called '''Balduinus''', was a French jurist, Christian controversialist and historian. Among the most colourful of the noted French [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]], he was respected by his contemporaries as a statesman and jurist, even as they frowned upon his perceived inconstancy in matters of faith: he was noted as a [[Calvinist]] who converted to [[Catholicism]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Arras]], then part of the Empire, and educated in the convent school at [[St. Vaast]]. Baudouin studied law in the [[Université catholique de Louvain|University of Leuven]] with [[Gabriel Mudaeus|Mudaeus]]. He settled as an [[advocate]] in [[Arras]], where he continued his studies, but was banned from the town in 1545 on charges of [[heresy]] due to his Calvinist leanings. He went to the court of the [[Emperor Charles V]] at [[Brussels]], and then travelled extensively.

After brief stays in Paris, [[Strasbourg]] and [[Geneva]] – where he met and became an enemy of [[John Calvin|Calvin]] – he settled in 1549 in [[Bourges]] as a doctor and then professor of law, as a colleague of [[Eguinaire Baron|Baro]] and [[François Douaren|Duarenus]]. Rivalries with the latter led him to move to Strasbourg and, 1555, to [[Heidelberg]], where his academic career reached its apogee.

Leaving his chair to engage in European confessional politics, Baudouin was unsuccessful in assisting with attempts to reconcile the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], for instance in the failed [[Colloquy at Poissy]], and in mediation efforts in the [[Netherlands]]. In 1563, he re-converted to Catholicism and in 1569, he was called again to teach law at [[Angers]]. Before he could accompany his patron, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]] – now [[King of Poland]] – to [[Kraków]], he died 1573 in Paris of a fever.

==Writings==
Baudouin was a prolific writer on juridical and [[ecclesiastical]] topics. As a jurist, he established the [[Palingenesis|palingenetic]] method of presentation of legal sources. His works include many substantial commentaries on [[Roman law]]. He was the first to reconstruct the original legislation of [[Justinian]] and to authenticate a text (the ‘Octavius’) of the early Christian writer [[Minucius Felix]] (200-400). Baudouin had produced a monograph on the Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] in 1556.

He wrote a study of a major dispute between [[Catholics]] and [[Donatists]] (and the Emperor Constantine's first large-scale dealing with the Christian church), the episcopal election of [[Carthage]] in 313.

==A==
*'''[[Advent]]''' - a season observed in many Western Christian churches, a time of expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of the Nativity of Jesus at Christmas.
*'''[[Almah]]''' a girl who has reached puberty but is still under the shielding protection of her family. For theological reasons, the meaning and definition of this word (especially the definition of "virgin") can be controversial, particularly when applied to [[Isaiah 7:14]].
*'''[[Amen]]''' - the word Amen ({{Hebrew Name|אָמֵן|Amen|'Āmēn}} ; {{lang-ar|'''آمين'''}}, ''’Āmīn'' ; "So be it; truly"&lt;ref name="kaby"/&gt;) is a declaration of [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmation]]&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01407b.htm|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Amen|accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ety"/&gt; found in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="kaby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabylia.info/observer/spip.php?article94 |title=Etymology of the word "Amen" |publisher=D.Messaoudi |accessdate=2007-08-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225901/http://www.kabylia.info/observer/spip.php?article94 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has always been in use within [[Judaism]], and would find its way into Islam.  It has been generally adopted in [[Christianity|Christian]] worship as a concluding formula for [[prayer]]s and [[hymn]]s.&lt;ref name="ety"/&gt; Common English translations of the word ''amen'' include: "Verily", "Truly", "So be it", and "Let it be".&lt;ref name="kaby"/&gt; It can also be used colloquially to express strong agreement,&lt;ref name="ety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=a&amp;p=11|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=Amen|accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in, for instance, ''amen to that.''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta]] Dictionary Tools.  Retrieved 20 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Ancient of Days]]''' - a name for God in Aramaic: ''Atik Yomin''; in the Greek Septuagint: ''Palaios Hemeron''; and in the Vulgate: ''Antiquus Dierum''.
*'''[[Anno Domini]]''' ('''AD''') - Latin term for ''Year of the Lord'', the ''Lord'' in this case being Jesus, by Christian reckoning, the [[Messiah]]. Due to western dominance of the world, this has become the common world calendar system, though many cultures separately maintain their own calendars based on various events. Recently, the terms ''[[Common Era]]'' (''CE'') and ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' (''AM'') have come into use.
*'''[[Anointing]]''' - to pour or smear with perfumed oil, milk, water, melted butter or other substances. People and things are anointed to symbolize the introduction of a sacramental or divine influence, a holy emanation, spirit, power or god.
*'''[[Antichrist]]''' - in [[Christian eschatology]], the Antichrist or anti-Christ, has come to mean a [[person]], another [[entity]], or an [[image]] of a person, that is an embodiment of [[evil]]. The word 'Antichrist' is translated from the combination of two ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] words αντί + χριστος ('''[[Wiktionary:Anti|anti]] + khristos''), which can mean ''anti'' "opposite" (of) ''khristos'' "[[anoint]]ed" therefore "opposite of Christ" (the meaning of [[christ]] as the 'anointed one', having become secondary to its meaning as the honorific of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]) or ''anti'' "as" (if) ''khristos'' "messiah" thus "in place of Christ" or a substitute for Christ.
*'''[[Antilegomena]]''' - was an epithet used by the Church Fathers to denote those books of the New Testament which, although sometimes publicly read in the churches, were not — for a considerable amount of time — considered to be genuine, or received into the canon of Scripture. They were thus contrasted with the "Homologoumena" (from Greek ομολογουμένα), or universally acknowledged writings
*'''[[Antinomianism]]''' - in theology, is the idea that members of a particular religious group are under no obligation to obey the laws of ethics or morality, and that salvation is by predestination only
*'''[[Apocalypse]]''' - any prophetic revelation or so-called [[End Time]] scenario, or to the end of the world in general
*'''[[Apostasy]]''' - (from [[Greek language|Greek]] αποστασία,  meaning ''a defection or revolt''&lt;!--from a military commander--&gt;, from απο, ''apo'', "away, apart", στασις, ''stasis'', "standing") is a term generally employed to describe the formal abandonment or renunciation of one's [[religion]], especially if the motive is deemed unworthy. In a technical sense, as used sometimes by [[sociology|sociologists]] without the [[pejorative]] connotations of the word, the term refers to renunciation ''and'' criticism of, or opposition to, one's former religion
*'''[[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]''' - (''{{lang|grc|Ἀπόστολος}}'', ''apostolos'', "someone sent out", e.g. with a message or as a delegate) were, according to the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and [[Christian]] tradition, [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] (followers) whom [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] had chosen, named, and trained in order to send them on a specific mission.
*'''[[Apostolic Age]]''' - traditionally the period of the Twelve Apostles, dating from the Crucifixion of Jesus (c. 26–36) and the Great Commission until the death of John the Apostle
*'''[[Apostolic Decree]]''' - {{Bibleverse||Acts|15:19-21}} See [[Council of Jerusalem]]
*'''[[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]]''' - believed to be the primary language of Jesus.
*'''[[Ascension of Jesus]]''' - a Christian doctrine that says Jesus ascended to heaven in the presence of his Eleven Apostles following his resurrection, and that in heaven he sits at the right hand of God the Father
*'''[[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]]''' - a doctrine found within both [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]. It describes how [[sin]] can be forgiven by [[God]]. In Judaism, Atonement is said to be the process of forgiving or pardoning a transgression. This was originally accomplished through rituals performed by a [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] on the holiest day of the Jewish year: [[Yom Kippur]] (Day of Atonement). In Christian theology the atonement refers to the forgiving or pardoning of sin through the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] which made possible the reconciliation between God and man. Within Christianity there are numerous technical theories for how such atonement might work, including the [[Atonement (ransom view)|ransom theory]], the [[Atonement (moral influence view)|Abelardian theory]], the [[substitutionary atonement]] theory with its variations, and the [[Atonement (satisfaction view)|Anselmian satisfaction]] theory.

==B==
*'''[[Baptism]]''' - baptism ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''βάπτισμα'' and ''βαπτισμός'', from ''βαπτίζω'', baptizô, immerse, perform ablutions) is a religious act of purification by [[water]] usually associated with admission to membership or fullness of membership of [[Christianity]].

*'''[[Christ]]''' - the [[English language|English]] term for the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] [[word]] {{lang|grc|Χριστός}} (''Christós''), which [[literal translation|literally]] means "''The [[Anointing|Anointed]] One.''" The [[Hebrew]] word for Christ is מָשִׁיחַ (''Mašíaḥ,'' usually [[transliteration|transliterated]] ''[[Messiah]]''). The word may be misunderstood by some as being the [[surname]] of [[Jesus]] due to the frequent juxtaposition of ''Jesus'' and ''Christ'' in the Christian [[Bible]] and other Christian writings. Often used as a more formal-sounding synonym for Jesus, the word is in fact a [[title]], hence its common reciprocal use ''Christ Jesus,'' meaning ''The Anointed One, Jesus.''
*'''[[Christendom]]''' - In a [[Culture|cultural]] sense, it refers to the religion itself, or to the [[cultural community|worldwide community]] of [[Christian]]s, adherents of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Marty| first = Martin| title = The Christian World: A Global History| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MoolUlqQdmAC| year = 2008| publisher = Random House Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-58836-684-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or refer collectively to [[Christian majority countries]] or countries in which [[Christian civilization]] dominates&lt;ref name="MWChristendom"&gt;See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Christendom Merriam-Webster.com : dictionary, "Christendom"]&lt;/ref&gt; or nations in which Christianity is the established religion.

Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, [[superficiality]], the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the [[divine grace|grace of God]] or [[Letter and spirit of the law|emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit]].

*'''[[Christian Kabbalah|Remez]]/[[Allegory]]''' - (from [[Greek language|Greek]] αλλος, ''allos,'' "other", and αγορευειν, ''agoreuein,'' "to speak in public") is a figurative mode of [[representation (arts)|representation]] conveying a [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] other than the [[literal and figurative language|literal]]. Generally treated as a figure of [[rhetoric]], but an allegory does not have to be expressed in [[language]]: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic [[painting]], [[sculpture]] or some other form of [[Mimesis|mimetic]], or representative art. In allegorical representations, relationships between elements of a text or composition are understood to stand for different relationships between elements not found in the text or composition; meaning is thus constituted through the difference between the superficial (or literal) meaning of the text or composition, and a "deeper" meaning.  In Jewish thought this method is best known through the works of [[Philo]]. The extreme form of remez, sod, understands the Tanakh as an allegory for a mystical understanding of the universe and as a means for mystical communion with God; this approach is best known through [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] texts such as the [[Zohar]].  Traditionally, only Jews who have mastered the midrashic method and the corpus of halakha are encouraged to pursue this form of interpretation.  In Christianity this method was first promoted by [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]].

[[File:Hindu Temple of Dayton.jpg|thumb|Hindu Temple of Dayton undergoing a ''[[Gopuram|Rajagopuram]]'' restoration, May 2018]]
The '''Hindu Temple of Dayton''', is a [[Hindu]] temple located in [[Beavercreek, Ohio]]. It serves the Hindu community of the [[Dayton metropolitan area|Greater Dayton Area]]. Currently, there are shrines to the deities [[Venkateshwara]], [[Rama]] along with [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], [[Ganesha]], and [[Radha Krishna]].

==History==
The congregation was first organized in 1976.&lt;ref name=aht&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu Temple Of Dayton|url=http://allhindutemples.com/city/ohio/hindu_temple/hindu-temple-of-dayton/|work=Database|publisher=All Hindu Temples|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. V. Rangarajan was instrumental in organizing the Indian community in Dayton. He was a founding member of the temple.&lt;ref name="lapore times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obit: Rangarajan A. The Temple is currently owned by the parents of Vishwanathan Ramesh. |url=http://www.mylaporetimes.com/2010/07/obit-rangarajan-a-v/|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=My Lapore Times|date=24 July 2010|location=Lapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temple was consecrated in 1985 in Beavercreek.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite news|last=Gnau|first=Thomas|title=Dayton Area’s Second Hindu Temple Dedicated|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/18195/hinduism-3|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=7 May 2007|location=Dayton, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ground was broken next to the temple in order to build a [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] Hall. The hall serves as a multipurpose area for celebrations, classes, and cultural activities. 
Starting in 2011, the temple underwent two years of major renovations.&lt;ref name=weekend&gt;{{cite news|last=McCabe|first=Ginny|title=Beavercreek Hindu temple holds weekend events|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/beavercreek-hindu-temple-holds-weekend-events/nXgPY/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=8 May 2013|location=Dayton, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these renovations, shrines to Bhagawan Chandramauli, [[Tripura Sundari]], [[Bhudevi]], [[Lakshmi]] and [[Navagraha]] were added. The end of construction was marked by a six-day festival.&lt;ref name=weekend /&gt;

==Organization==
The Dayton Hindu Temple is organized by Hindu Community Organization, Inc, a non-profit organized for the purpose of maintaining the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HINDU COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION INC|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/31-0945422/hindu-community-organization.aspx|work=Non-profit database|publisher=Guide Star.Org|accessdate=29 April 2014|format=database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most religious organizations, the Dayton Hindu Temple has an executive committee, Board of Directors, and a Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=htd&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu Temple of Dayton|url=http://daytontemple.com/index.php?page=about|work=Temple website|publisher=Hindu Temple of Dayton|accessdate=29 April 2014|location=Dayton, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu Temple of Dayton publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, Mandir Vani, in which the organization, services, news, and religious information is discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandir Vani: Our Newsletter|url=http://daytontemple.com/index.php?page=mandirvani|publisher=Hindu Temple of Dayton|accessdate=14 May 2014|location=Dayton, Ohio|date=2009-Present}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple raises money through donations, fundraisers, and services.

==Services and community==
Several hundred people visit the temple on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name=weekend /&gt; Two priests perform services based on Hindu principles.&lt;ref name=htd /&gt; As with most Hindu temples, fees can be charged for special prayers and services.&lt;ref name=shuttered&gt;{{cite news|last=Beyerlein|first=Tom|title=Lawsuits, tax bills trail Hindu priest who bought, shuttered Dayton landmark|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/lawsuits-tax-bills-trail-man-who-bought-shuttered-/nTSmp/|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=22 December 2012|location=Dayton, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also scheduled events and services held throughout the week.&lt;ref name=htd /&gt; Every Sunday, the god Venkateshwara is given a sacred bath, while [[Shiva]] is bathed on Mondays.&lt;ref name="mandir march 2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=29th Temple Anniversary|url=http://daytontemple.com/MandirVani/MandirVani-2014-Mar-May.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=Mandir Vani|date=March 2014|location=Dayton, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Dayton Hindu Temple serves as a community center. There are weekly [[table tennis]] games, anniversary celebrations, summer camps for children, lectures, and [[yoga]] classes.&lt;ref name="mandir march 2014" /&gt;

[[Atheism]] and [[agnosticism]] have a long history in India and flourished within the [[Śramaṇa|Sramana movement]]. Indian religions like [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and certain schools of [[Hinduism]], though not all, consider atheism to be acceptable.&lt;ref name="wayoflife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshi"/&gt; India has produced some notable atheist politicians and [[reform movement|social reform]]ers.&lt;ref name="secularism"/&gt; According to [[2011 Census of India]], 99.76% of Indians identified with a religion while 0.24% did not state their religious identity.&lt;ref name="census_2011_religion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW00C-01%20MDDS.XLS |title=Population by religious community - 2011 |publisher=Office of the Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner |work=[[2011 Census of India]] |accessdate=25 August 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825155850/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW00C-01%20MDDS.XLS |archivedate=25 August 2015}} Percentages are calculated from population figures for individual religions in this word document by dividing them from total population of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=census2011&gt;{{cite web|title=All India Religion Census Data 2011|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/religion.php|publisher=[[Government of India]]|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were non-religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.&lt;ref name=gallup2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Index Of Religion And Atheism |url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |publisher=WIN-Gallup |accessdate=3 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062403/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schools of Philosophy====
{{See also|Indian philosophy}}
In Hinduism, the religion of the majority of [[India]]ns, [[atheism]] is considered to be a valid path to [[spirituality]], as it can be argued that God can manifest in several forms with "no form" being one of them. But, the path is considered difficult to follow.&lt;ref name="wayoflife"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chakravarti| first = Sitansu| title = Hinduism, a way of life| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1991| page = 71| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71| isbn = 978-81-208-0899-7| accessdate=2011-04-09}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in a personal creator God is not required in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], both of which also originated in the Indian subcontinent. [[Atheism in Hinduism|Atheistic schools]] are also found in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Joshi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=L.R. |year=1966 |title= A New Interpretation of Indian Atheism |journal=Philosophy East and West |volume=16 |issue=3/4 |pages=189–206|doi= 10.2307/1397540 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |jstor=1397540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hindu philosophy]] is divided into schools (''darśanam''). These schools can be categorised as ''āstika'' (orthodox), schools which conforms to the [[Vedas]], and ''nāstika'' (heterodox), schools reject the Vedas. The six schools ''[[Sāṃkhya]]'', ''[[Yoga]]'', ''[[Nyāya]]'', ''[[Vaiśeṣika]]'', ''[[Mimāṃsā]]'' and ''[[Vedānta]]'' are considered ''āstika'' (orthodox), while [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], ''[[Cārvāka]]'' and [[Ājīvika]] are considered  ''nāstika'' (heterodox).&lt;ref name="nastika"&gt;{{cite book|author=Y.

The ''Cārvāka'' school originated in India around the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/Not-scared-of-God-but-man/articleshow/46570208.cms|title=Not scared of God, but man}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is classified as a ''[[nāstika]]'' school. It is noteworthy as evidence of a [[Materialism|materialistic]] movement in ancient India.&lt;ref name=moor&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|author2= Charles A. Moore|title= A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy|publisher=Princeton University Press| year=1957|edition= Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989| pages= 227–249|isbn= 0-691-01958-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of this school only accepted ''pratyakşa'' (perception) as a valid ''pramāna'' (evidence). They considered other ''pramāna'' like ''sabda'' (testimony), ''upamāna'' (analogy), and ''anumāna'' (inference) as unreliable.&lt;ref name="pramana"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deepak Sarma|title=Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5TK5I6R9xtkC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=7 September 2013|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13399-9|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the existence of a soul (''ātman'') and God were rejected, because they could not be proved by perception. They also considered everything to be made of four [[Mahābhūta|elements]]: earth, water, air and fire. The Cārvāka pursued elimination of physical pain and enjoyment of life. So, they can be considered [[hedonistic]].&lt;ref name="hedonism"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eugene F.

=====Sāṃkhya=====
{{Main|Sāṃkhya}}
''Sāṃkhya'' is an ''āstika'' school, but has some atheistic elements.

=====Mīmāṃsā=====
{{Main|Mīmāṃsā}}
''[[Mīmāṃsā]]'' (meaning [[exegesis]])&lt;ref name=dual/&gt; is also an ''astika'' school. They believed the Vedas to be author-less and self-authenticating.  They did not accept the Vedas as being composed by any ''[[ṛishi]]'' (saint), they considered them to not be authored by anyone (''apauruṣeya''). They accepted the minor deities of the Vedas but resisted any notion of a Supreme Creator. They only concentrated on upholding the ''[[ṛta]]'' (order) by following the duties of the Vedas. The foundational text of this school is the ''Mīmāṃsā Sutra'' by [[Jaimini]] (c. 200 BCE - 200 CE).&lt;ref name=dual/&gt;

=====Ājīvika=====
{{Main|Ājīvika}}
''[[Ājīvika]]'' is yet another ''astika'' school with an atheistic outlook. None of their scriptures survive and there is some question as to whether or not the accounts of them in secondary sources (often hostile) are accurate. They believed in a naturalistic atomic theory and held that the consequence of natural laws led to a deterministic universe. They denied [[karma]], but upheld the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]. They lived in ascetic communities and existed in southern India until at least the 14th century.

He would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know the given name &amp; clan name of the man who wounded me... until I know whether he was tall, medium, or short... The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him. In the same way, if anyone were to say, 'I won't live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that 'The cosmos is eternal,'... or that 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist,' the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the Tathagata.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]] instead emphasises the system of causal relationships underlying the universe, [[pratītyasamutpāda]], which constitute the [[dharma]] and source of enlightenment. No dependence of phenomena on a supernatural reality is asserted in order to explain the behaviour of matter.

[[Jainism]] rejects the idea of a [[creator deity]] responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have [[Jainism and non-creationism|always existed]]. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and an immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Jainism offers an elaborate [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], including heavenly beings (devas), but these beings are not viewed as creators; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die. Jains define godliness as the inherent quality of any soul characterising infinite bliss, infinite power, [[Kevala Jnana]] (pure infinite knowledge){{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} and Perfect peace. However, these qualities of a soul are subdued due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] of the soul. One who achieves this state of soul through [[Ratnatraya|right belief, right knowledge and right conduct]] can be termed a god. This perfection of soul is called kevalin or [[bodhi]]. A god thus becomes a liberated soul – liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, karmas and finally liberated of body as well. This is called [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]].

In the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' (''Ayodhya Khanda''), when [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] goes to the forest to convince [[Rama]] to return home, he was accompanied by a [[sophist]]&lt;ref name="jabali sophist"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comparative History of Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gpulmza7BBYC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=9 September 2013|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1004-4|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; called [[Jabali]] ("{{lang|sa|जाबालिः}}"). Jabali uses [[nihilism|nihilistic]]&lt;ref name="nihilist jabali"/&gt; reasoning to convince Rama.

He had existed since the [[Krita Yuga]] by virtue of a boon from the god [[Brahma]], that he could only be killed when he is showing contempt towards brahmins.

There is a growing number of Indian Muslims gradually leaving Islam, driven by a questioning mind and joining the group of Ex-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/indias-ex-muslims-shedding-traditional-islam-for-science-3093252.html|title=India's ex-Muslims: Shedding traditional Islam for science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status, rights and laws==

Atheism and irreligion are not officially recognised in India. [[Apostasy]] is allowed under the right to [[Freedom of religion in India|freedom of religion]] in the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]], and the [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]] allows the marriage of people with no religious beliefs, as well as non-religious and non-ritualistic marriages. However, there are no specific laws catering to atheists and they are considered as belonging to the religion of their birth for administrative purposes.&lt;ref name=milliongods&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian atheists seek recognition in the land of a million gods|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-30/science/32483706_1_atheists-religion-beliefs|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=The Times of India|date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable verdicts===

On 29 October 2013, the [[Bombay High Court]] judged in favour of an atheist school teacher from [[Nashik]].&lt;ref name="atheist teacher"&gt;{{cite news|title=Teacher cannot be forced to fold hands in school prayers: Bombay high court|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Teacher-cannot-be-forced-to-fold-hands-in-school-prayers-Bombay-high-court/articleshow/25137023.cms|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanjay Salve had been employed by the state-funded Savitribai Phule Secondary School since 1996. In June 2007, during a prayer session, Salve didn't fold his hands during the pledge or prayer. The school management called this indiscipline and refused him a higher pay grade in 2008 when Salve became eligible for it. Salve sought legal recourse citing the Section 28 (a) of the Constitution which states "no person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite law|title=Constitution of India, Section 28 (a)|date=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="what wrong"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pray, what wrong did I do, asks atheist teacher|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pray-what-wrong-did-i-do-asks-atheist-teacher/article5080102.ece?ref=relatedNews|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in Salve's favour and directed the school to release his dues by 31 January 2013.&lt;ref name="answers prayers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bombay High Court answers atheist teacher's prayer; asks school to pay dues|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-bombay-high-court-answers-atheist-teacher-s-prayer-asks-school-to-pay-dues-1911611|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 2014, the [[Bombay High Court]] declared that the government cannot force a person to state a religion on any document or form. The court also stated any citizen has the right to declare that he/she doesn't belong to any religion. The decision came in response to a [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) filed by Ranjit Mohite, Kishore Nazare and Subhash Ranware, representing an organisation called Full Gospel Church of God, after the Maharashtra state printing press refused to issue them a gazette notification stating that they belonged to no religion. The petitioners stated that the organisation had 4000 members, and that they believe in [[Jesus Christ]] but they do not follow [[Christianity]] or any religion. Responding to the petition, the Maharashtra and the central governments had stated that "no religion" cannot be treated as a religion on official forms. The court cited the Article 25 of the Constitution, which guarantees right to freedom of conscience,  while passing the verdict.&lt;ref name=no_religion_BHC&gt;{{cite news|title=Citizen can declare that he does not belong to any religion: Bombay High Court|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/citizen-can-declare-that-he-does-not-belong-to-any-religion-bombay-high-court/1/392828.html|accessdate=26 November 2014|work=[[India Today]]|date=26 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BHC_religion&gt;{{cite news|title=Citizen can declare that he does not belong to any religion: Bombay High Court|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/citizen-can-declare-that-he-does-not-belong-to-any-religion-bombay-high-court/|accessdate=26 November 2014|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=24 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution and attacks==

==Demographics==

===Indian government census===
The Indian census does not explicitly count atheists.&lt;ref name="secularism"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Zuckerman|title=Atheism and Secularity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1hbaAHsAlUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA139|accessdate=7 September 2013|date=21 December 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35182-2|chapter=Chapeter 7: Atheism and Secularity in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2011 Census of India]], the response form required the respondent to choose from six options under religion. The "Others" option was meant for minor or tribal religions as well as [[atheist]]s and [[agnostic]]s.&lt;ref name=milliongods/&gt;

The religion data from [[2011 Census of India]] was released in August 2015. It revealed that about 2,870,000 people had stated no religion in their response, about 0.27% of the nation's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/753475/people-without-religion-have-risen-in-census-2011-but-atheists-have-nothing-to-cheer-about|title=People without religion have risen in Census 2011, but atheists have nothing to cheer about}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number included atheists, rationalists and also those who believed in a higher power. [[K. Veeramani]], a [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] leader, said that it was the first time the number of non-religious people was recorded in the census. However, he added that he believed that the number of atheists in India was actually higher as many people don't reveal their atheism out of fear.&lt;ref name=FirstTimeCensus&gt;{{cite news|title=2.87 million Indians have no faith, census reveals for first time|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-87-million-Indians-have-no-faith-census-reveals-for-first-time/articleshow/48689278.cms|accessdate=10 September 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different surveys===

====World Values Survey (2006)====

According to the 2006 [[World Values Survey]], conducted by the Dentsu Communication Institute Inc, Japan Research Center (2006), 6.6% of Indians stated that they had no religion.&lt;ref name="dentsu"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Values Survey (2006) ''English source requested''|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html|accessdate=5 September 2013|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists in India (2007)====

In 2007, a survey was conducted by the [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture]] of the [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] with the help of [[Center for Inquiry]] (India) called Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists in India. 1100 scientists surveyed from 130 institutes. Most of them identified themselves as [[secular]] (59%) or somewhat secular (16%) but refused to be labelled [[irreligious]]. 83% defined secularism, as it appears in the Indian constitutions, as the separation of state and religion. But, 93% also defined it as tolerance of other religious philosophies. 20% equated secularism to atheism. Only 11% called themselves completely not spiritual. However,  8% reportedly said they would refuse to do [[Stem cell controversy|stem cell research]] based on religious or moral convictions.&lt;ref name=SecularScientists&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian scientists are secular, but religious: Survey|url=http://computing.in.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3207887|accessdate=15 December 2014|work=[[MSN]]|date=16 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006231549/http://computing.in.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3207887|archivedate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yagnaswami Sundara Rajan|Y.

'''Justus Baronius Calvinus''' (b. at [[Kanthen]], Germany, c. 1570; d. after 1606) was a German theologian, a [[Roman Catholic]] convert and apologist.

==Life==

He was born of [[Calvinist]] parents and educated at [[Heidelberg]], where he took a course in theology. His study of the [[Church Fathers]] inclined him towards Catholicism and finally led him to Rome. There he was kindly received by [[Cardinal Bellarmine]], [[Cardinal Baronius]], and [[Pope Clement VIII]]. His gratitude to Baronius caused him to add that cardinal's name to his own. 

On his return to Germany he became a Catholic (1601) and a staunch defender of his faith. In his "Apologia" (Mainz, 1601) he gives the reasons for his conversion and in his "Praescriptionum adversus haereticos ... Tractatus" (ibid. 1602, 1756) he appeals to the Fathers in support of the truth of Catholicism.

The '''Tai Khamti''' ({{lang-th|ชาวไทคำตี่}}, ''Chao Tai Kam Dtee'') ({{lang-my|ခန္တီးရှမ်းလူမျိုး}}, '''Hkamti Shan''') ([[Shan language]]: တႆး ၶမ်းတီႈ {{IPA|[tai˥˩]}}) ([[Khamti]]: တဲး ၵံးတီႈ)({{lang-as|খাম্পতি}}) or simply '''Khamti''' as they are also known, are a sub-group of the [[Tai peoples]] found in the [[Hkamti Long]] region of Kachin state and [[Hkamti District]] of [[Sagaing Division]] of [[Burma|Myanmar]]. In India, they are found in [[Namsai district]] and [[Changlang district]] of [[Arunachal Pradesh|Arunachal]] Pradesh  . Smaller numbers can be found in [[Lakhimpur district]], [[Dhemaji district]] and Munglang Khamti village in [[Tinsukia district]] of [[Assam]] and possibly in some parts of [[China]]. According to the census of India (2011) the Khamtis have a population of 140,310 out of which 129,250 live in Arunachal Pradesh and 11,060 in Assam. However, in Myanmar their total population is estimated at 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Khampti Khampti, Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe's name is spelled 'Khampti' by the [[People of Assam|Assamese]].

The Tai Khamtis who inhabit the region around the Tengapani basin were descendants of migrants who came during the 18th century from the [[Hkamti long]] region, the mountainous valley of the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy]]. The Khamti possess [[South East Asian]] features.

The Tai-Khamti are followers of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The Tai-Khamti have their own script for their language, known as 'Lik Tai', which was originated from the Shan (Tai) script of Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atlas of the Languages and Ethnic Communities of South Asia|author=Roland J. L. Breton|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1997|isbn=0-8039-9367-6|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mother tongue is known as [[Khamti language]]. It is a [[Tai language]], closely related to [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]].

== Society ==

The Khamti society is divided into classes, each signifying distinct status in the social hierarchy. The chiefs occupy the highest positions, followed by the priests, who wield considerable influence over all ranks. In the past, the slaves constituted the lowest rank.&lt;!-- unclear what this refers to: The name "Chao Tai Kam Dtee" should be written as "Chao Tai Kham Tee." --&gt;

== Culture ==

=== Lifestyle and customs ===

The Tai-Khamti are very strong believers of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. Houses have a prayer rooms, and they pray every morning and evening by offerings flowers (nam taw yongli) and food (khao tang som). They are peace-loving people.

Houses of the Tai-Khampti are built on raised floors with thatched roofs. The roofs are constructed so low that the walls remain concealed. Wooden planks are used for flooring, and the walls are made of bamboo splices.

The Khamti are settled agriculturists. They use a plough (thaie) drawn by a single animal, either an ox or a buffalo (or even an elephant in olden days).

The Khamti raise crops such as paddy rice (khow), mustard/sesame seeds (nga) and potato (man-kala). Their staple food is rice, usually supplemented by vegetables, meat and fish. They drink a beer made from rice (low) as a beverage that is not served during festivals. Some of the well-known dishes are ''khao puk'' (made out of sticky rice and sesame seeds), ''khao lam'' (bamboo rice), ''paa sa'' (fresh river fish soup with special herbs), ''paa som'', and ''nam som'' among others. Beef is considered taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattaway|first=Paul|title=Peoples of the Buddhist world: a Christian prayer diary|publisher=William Carey Library|year=2004|pages=131|isbn=978-0-87808-361-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language and script ===
Khamti is a Southwestern Tai language spoken in Myanmar and India by the Khamti people. It is a Daic language, specifically Kadai, Kam-Tai, Tai, Southwestern, Northwest branch. The language seems to have originated around Mogoung in Upper Myanmar. It is closely related to Thai and Lao languages.

Three dialects of Khamti are known: North Burma Khamti, Assam Khamti and Sinkaling Khamti. Speakers of Khamti are bilingual, largely in Assamese and Burmese.

Currently there are about 200,000 Khamti speakers in Myanmar and 130,00 in northeastern part of India (Arunachal Pradesh and Assam areas)

The Tai Khamtis have their own writing character called 'Lik-Tai.'

Tai-Khampti alphabet, which is in pristine form, closely resembles Northern Shan alphabet of Myanmar with some of the letters taking divergent shapes. Their script is evidently derived from the Lik Hto Ngauk script since hundreds of years ago. There are 35 letters including 17 consonants and 14 vowels. The script is traditionally taught in monasteries on subjects like tripitaka, Jataka tales, code of conduct, doctrines and philosophy, history, law codes, astrology and palmistry etc. The first printed book was published in 1960. In 1992 it was edited by the Tai Literature Committee, Chongkham. In 2003 it was again modified with tone marking by scholars of Northern Myanmar and Arunachal Pradesh.

=== Dress ===

The traditional Khamti dress of men is a full sleeved cotton shirt (siu pachai) and multi-coloured lungi (phanoi). The women's dress consists of a blouse (siu pasao), a deep-coloured long skirt (sinn) made from cotton or silk, and a coloured silk scarf (famai). Married woman wear in plain black long wrap-around skirt (sinn) and above that a shorter green wrap-around skirt (langwat).&lt;!-- no shirt? --&gt;

Their jewelry consists of bright amber earrings, coral, beaded necklaces and gold ornaments. The Khamti men usually tattoo their bodies.

The Khamti tie their hair into a large knot, which is supported by a white turban (fa-ho). The chiefs wear a long coat made of silk. The hair is drawn up from the back and sides in one massive roll, measuring four to five inches in length. An embroidered band, the fringed and tasseled ends of which hang down behind, encircles the roll.

=== Arts ===

The Khamti are renowned for their craftsmanship. Their sword is known as pha-nap. Their priests are known to be amateur craftsmen, who use wood, bone or ivory to carve religious statues.

It is believed that by shaping ivory handles of weapons they will evince great skill. Their weapons include poisoned bamboo spikes (panjis), spear, bow and arrow, sword, and shield, usually made of rhinoceros or buffalo hide. The Khamti also have firearms which resemble old flint muskets and horse pistols. The sword is carried on the front of the body, so that its hilt can be grasped in the right hand if needed.

=== Dance and dama ===

The dance "Ka Poong Tai" is one of the main dramatic art form of the Tai Khamtis. Unlike many forms of traditional Arunachali dance, the Khamti dance is a dance drama, expressively and elegantly reflect the rich culture of the Khamti Buddhists.

The traditional folk dances of the Tai Khamtis have their roots in [[Southeast Asian]] countries like Thailand and Myanmar. The community has many folk dances and each dance has religious background. Some of the popular Tai Khamti dance dramas are:

* Peacock Dance: Kaa Kingnara Kingnari is a prominent dance among the Tai Khamti. It is a Buddhist belief in nature which depict the slow and gracious dance of mythical half-human and half-peacock that existed in the Himalayas.
* Cock Fight Dance: Kaa Kong Tou Kai is a popular dance of Tai Khamti tribe of Arunachal Pradesh. It is performed by two or four people who wear a head gear shaped like the head of the cock, accompanied by the beats of drum (kongpat), cymbals (paiseng) and a set of gongs (mong-seeing). This dance usually shows a fight between two cocks and is inspired by the ancient tradition of entertaining the king with a cock fight.
* Deer Dance: According to the legendary story, deer-dancing (kaa-toe) in the month of October (Nuen-Sip-Eit) is a celebration of the light festival based on the story of the spirits of the people and animals welcoming the return of Buddha after his preaching and thanksgiving to his mother and other spirits. This dancing of Ka-Toe is a Buddhist belief and religious in nature.
* Demon Dance: The demon dance Kaa Phi Phai is another prominent dance and is performed on important social and religious occasions. The theme of this dance revolves around the attainment of the enlightenment by Lord Buddha despite attempts of 'Mara', the king of evil spirits to disturb deep meditation of the Lord. Kaa Phi Phai symbolises the victory of the holy over the evil and marks the Buddha's attainment of 'Nirvana'.

===Festivals===

[[Sangken]] is the main festival of Khamti. It is celebrated on 14 April. The true colors of secular India are at the Sangken festival where people irrespective of their tribe, caste, culture, race, etc., participate in the rituals.

The main attraction of the festival is splashing clean water, which is the symbol of peace and purity. The images of Buddha are taken out and after the ceremonial bath. The procession is accompanied by drums, dances and enjoyment. This holy bath of is an auspicious event. The celebration takes place for three consecutive days. During the celebration the locals make homemade sweet and distribute them. The exchange of gifts is a common trait of the festival.

There are festivals other than Sangken celebrated throughout the year. Some of the festivals are Poi-Pee-Mau (Tai Khampti New Year), Mai-Kasung-Phai, Khoa-Wa, Poat-Wa, etc.

Lieutenant Colonel K. S. Pannu was commanding a battalion, which was airdropped near Tangail on 11 December 1971. The task involved cutting enemy routes of withdrawal and preventing his build-up at Tangail. This also involved the capture of an enemy position on a vital bridge at Poongli. The drop of the battalion was widely dispersed and Lieutenant Colonel Pannu had to move from one location to another under enemy fire to collect his platoons. It was entirely due to his cool courage, utter disregard for his personal safety and his timely and skilful direction that his battalion captured the enemy position at Poongli, under his able leadership, the battalion repulsed numerous counter-attacks inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Lieutenant Colonel Pannu displayed conspicuous gallantry, exemplary leadership, determination and devotion to duty in keeping with the best traditions of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twdi.in/node/1440|title=Mahavir Chakra (MVC), Awardee: Maj Gen Kulwant Singh Pannu, MVC  @ TWDI|website=twdi.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11022">The people described below have claimed to have attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] and become [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], claimed to be manifestations of [[bodhisattvas]], identified themselves as [[Gautama Buddha]] or [[Maitreya Buddha]], or been honored as buddhas or bodhisattvas.

== Claimants ==
* [[Guan Yu]] - a general serving under the [[warlord]] [[Liu Bei]] in the late Eastern [[Han Dynasty]] and [[Three Kingdoms]] period in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. Guan was deified as early as the [[Sui Dynasty]] and is still worshipped by many Chinese people today, especially in southern China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and among many overseas Chinese communities. He is a figure in [[Chinese folk religion]], popular [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]], and small shrines to Guan are almost ubiquitous in traditional Chinese shops and restaurants. Many Buddhists accept him as a bodhisattva that guards the Buddhist faith and temples.
* [[Wu Zetian]] - the only ruling female emperor in the history of China, and founder of her own dynasty, the Second Zhou dynasty. Ruled under the name Emperor Shengshen. Gained popular support by advocating Buddhism but ruthlessly persecuted her opponents within the royal family (by cutting off their arms and legs and inserting them in jars) and the nobility. She proclaimed herself an incarnation of [[Maitreya]] and made [[Luoyang]] the "holy capital".
* [[Gung Ye]] - Korean warlord and king of the short-lived state of [[Taebong]] during the 10th century. Claimed to be the living incarnation of Maitreya and ordered his subjects to worship him. His claim was rejected by most Buddhist monks and later he was dethroned and killed by his own servants.
* [[Nurhaci]] (Emperor Tai Zu) - founder and leader of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Believed he was a manifestation of [[Manjushri]] Bodhisattva.
* [[Lu Zhongyi]] - the 17th patriarch of the [[I-Kuan Tao]]. I-Kuan Tao followers believe that he is the first leader of the "White Sun" Era, the era of the apocalypse, thus he is the incarnation of Maitreya.
* [[Baha'u'llah]] - prophet of Persian origin, founder of the [[Baha'i Faith]] stated publicly in 1863 CE that he is the promised  [[Manifestation of God]] for this age predicted in all prophetic religions of the past.&lt;ref name = "momenbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism And The Baha'i Faith: An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith for Theravada Buddhists|first = Moojan |last=Momen|year=1995|isbn=0-85398-384-4|publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "buck_eschatologic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Modern Religions, Religious Movements and the Bābī-Bahā'ī Faiths|editor-last =Sharon | editor-first = Moshe|chapter=The eschatology of Globalization: The multiple-messiahship of Bahā'u'llāh revisited|first= Christopher | last = Buck|isbn=90-04-13904-4|pages=143–178|location=Boston | publisher = Brill|year=2004|url= http://bahai-library.com/buck_eschatology_globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoghi Effendi, eldest grandson and authorized interpreter of the sacred writings of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and guardian of [[Baha'i Faith]] from 1921 to 1957, identifies [[Bahá'u'lláh]] as "the fifth buddha" and "a Buddha named Maitreye, the Buddha of universal fellowship".&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Bahá'u'lláh |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 73–79|isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] - Ghulam Ahmad has claimed many titles he says were given to him by God including being a universal [[prophet]] for all religions (including Buddhism). In 1889 he found the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], preaching [[Islam]] as a universal faith which came to support the true teachings of all other religions lost over the centuries.
* [[Peter Deunov]] (Master Beinsa Douno) - spiritual teacher, founder of a teaching and school of [[Esoteric Christianity]]. Some students of [[Rudolf Steiner]], an Austrian philosopher, have identified Master Beinsa Douno as a manifestation of Maitreya in the late 20th century.
* [[Ruth E. Norman|Ruth Norman]] (Uriel) - founder of the [[Unarius Academy of Science]]. Claims to have had fifty-five past lives, some included were reincarnations of the Buddha, [[Socrates]], [[King Arthur]], [[Confucius]] and a king of [[Atlantis]].

* [[Jim Jones]] - leader of the [[Peoples Temple]] cult. Jones claimed to be a living incarnation of the Buddha as well as Jesus Christ, Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], [[Father Divine]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]].
* [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] - also known as Acharya Rajneesh from the 1960s onwards, as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (during the 1970s and 1980s and as Osho from 1989) was an Indian [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[guru]], and spiritual teacher who garnered an [[Rajneesh movement|international following]]. Osho later said he became spiritually enlightened on 21 March 1953, when he was 21 years old, in a mystical experience while sitting under a tree in the Bhanvartal Garden in Jabalpur.&lt;ref&gt;McCormack, W.

According to his brother Gangajit, a "very clear and white" light "different from sunlight" emanated from his head. On November 8, 2005 Palden Dorje arose and said to the public, "Tell the people not to call me a Buddha. I don't have the Buddha's energy. I am at the level of [[rinpoche]]." However, to his nearest followers Bomjon seems to share different identities. "His followers consider him to be Parmatma (supreme soul) and above [[Lord Buddha]].", "His followers claim his level of knowledge is above that of [[Lord Buddha]]. They claim [[Siddhartha Gautam]] reached a Sambuddha'' ''(self-enlightened) state but [[Ram Bomjon|Bomjon]] has attained Mahasambodhi (greater form of self-enlightenment) state", "Some even claim he has left Sukhapati Bhawan (heavenly abode where [[Amitābha|Amitabh Buddha]] is said to reside) replete with amenities and bliss, and come to the earth for the good of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://setopati.net/society/21938/State-must-watch-Bomjon-closely/|title=State must watch Bomjon closely|website=setopati.net|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naming himself publicly from 2012 as [[Maitreya|Maitriya]] Guru, he and his followers also openly claim that he is the awaited [[Maitreya Buddha]].

Similarly, the Holi festival is said to be the 'Festival of Colors", with its magnificent rain dance and the 'gulaal', it surely colors the lives of people.

 [[File:Rama, Sita and Lakshmana.jpg|thumb|upright|center|150px|Home shrine on Rama Navami]]
|| Ninth of the [[Chaitra]] month (Hindu calendar)
||''Rama Navami'' is the celebration of the birth of [[Rama]]. Rama Navami is the day on which Lord Rama, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, incarnated in human form in the land of Ayodhya. He is the ardha ansh of Vishnu or has half the divinitive qualities of Lord Vishnu. The word “Rama” literally means one who is divinely blissful and who gives joy to others, and one in whom the sages rejoice. Ram Navami falls on the ninth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Chaitra (April/May) and coincides with Vasant Navratri or Chait Durga Puja. Therefore, in some regions, the festival is spread over nine days. This day, marking the birthday of Lord Rama, is also observed as the marriage day of Rama and Sita and thus also referred to as Kalyanotsavam. In Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, a huge fair is held with thousands of devotees gathering to celebrate this festival. The fair continues for two days, and rathyatras, carrying the Deities of Ram, his brother Laxman, His wife Sita, and His greatest devotee Mahavir Hanuman, are taken out from almost all Ram Temples. Hanuman is known for is his devotion to Rama, and his tales form an important part of the celebration. In Andhra Pradesh, Ram Navami is celebrated for 10 days from the Chaitra saptami to the Bahula Padyami that fall in the month of March and April. Temples re-enact the marriage of Lord Rama and Sita to commemorate this event, since this day is also the day they got married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Rama_Navami |title=Rama Navami - Hindupedia, the Hindu Encyclopedia |publisher=Hindupedia.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janmashtami, the birthday of Lord Krishna is celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm in India in the month of July or August. According to the Hindu calendar this religious festival is celebrated on the Ashtami of Krishna Paksh or the 8th day of the dark fortnight in the month of Bhadon. Sri Krishna is considered as the one of the most powerful human incarnations of the Lord Vishnu. He was born around 5,200 years ago in Mathura. The sole objective of Sri Krishna's birth was to free the Earth from the evilness of demons. He played an important role in Mahabharata and propagated the theory of bhakti and good karma which are narrated deeply in the Bhagwat Geeta. Sri Krishna was born in a prison in the custody of Kansa. Vasudev, His father immediately thought of his friend Nand and decided to hand over his child to him to save Krishna from the clutch of Kansa. Krishna grew up in Gokul and finally killed his uncle, King Kansa. The actual celebration of Janmashtami takes place during the midnight as Sri Krishna is believed to be born on a dark, stormy and windy night to end the rule and violence of his uncle, Kansa. All over India this day is celebrated with devotional songs and dances, pujas, arti, blowing of the Conch and rocking the cradle of baby Sri Krishna. The Janmashtami celebration of Mathura and Vrindavan, the places where Sri Krishna had spent his life, are very special. On this day temples and homes are wonderfully decorated and illuminated. Night long prayers are offered and religious mantras are sung in the temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlabs.com/holidays/india/janmashtami.php |title=Janmashtami / Krishna Janmashtami : A hindu religious festival |publisher=Calendarlabs.com |date=2018-03-09 |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''war deity''' is a god or goddess in [[mythology]] associated with war, [[combat]], or bloodshed. They occur commonly in both [[monotheism|monotheistic]] and [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions.

Unlike most gods and goddesses in polytheistic religions, monotheistic deities have traditionally been portrayed in their mythologies as commanding war in order to spread their religion. (The intimate connection between "[[Religious war|holy war]]" and the "one true god" belief of monotheism has been noted by many scholars; including [[Jonathan Kirsch]] in his book ''God Against The Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism'' and Joseph Campbell in ''The Masks of God, Vol. 3: Occidental Mythology''.) &lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism|author=Kirsch, J.|date=2004|publisher=Viking Compass|isbn=9780670032860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z88nAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/014019441X|title=Occidental Mythology (Masks of God): Joseph Campbell: 9780140194418: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**the [[Trinitarian Order]]
* certain secular titles and offices, such as [[Master-General of the Ordnance]]

The title was also sometimes used interchangeably with the other title of [[Grandmaster (order)|Grand Master]], especially when referring to chivalric orders in the Middle Ages. In some [[chivalric orders]], for example the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]], this title was used by the Boigny [[Knights]] under the protection of the French [[monarchy]] so as to bypass a number of Papal Bulls which were intended to abolish the Order itself. Roman historians Ammianus and Zozimus&lt;ref name="Gibbon"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbon Esq. |first=Edward |date=January 1, 1816 |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |page=189 |volume=I[-VIII] |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com |subscription=yes |registration=yes |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Abraham Small, P.H. Nicklin, and Isaac Riley |accessdate=November 30, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; record that the Master General Vietor led the center column of three columns of infantry to push the Roman march through the country and into battle.

Even today, the [[Order of Saint Lazarus]], albeit fragmented into a number of varying factions and obediences, one of the Lazarite Groupings headquartered in [[London]] with Grand Priories and Commanderies in various countries, is led by a '''Master-general''' Fra John Baron von Hoff GCLJ GCMLJ who was unanimously appointed to the title by the Knights in Council of the United Grand Priories.

{{nihongo|'''''Mind Game'''''|マインド・ゲーム}} is a 2004 [[anime|Japanese animated]] [[feature film]] based on Robin Nishi's [[manga]] of the same name. It was planned, produced and primarily animated by [[Studio 4°C]] and adapted and [[Film director|directed]] by [[Masaaki Yuasa]] in his directorial debut, with chief [[Animation director|animation direction]] and [[model sheet]]s by Yūichirō Sueyoshi, [[Art director|art direction]] by Tōru Hishiyama and groundwork and further animation direction by Masahiko Kubo.

It is unusual among features other than [[anthology film]]s in using a series of disparate visual styles to tell one continuous story. As Yuasa commented in a ''[[Japan Times]]'' interview, "Instead of telling it serious and straight, I went for a look that was a bit wild and patchy. I think that Japanese animation fans today don't necessarily demand something that's so polished. You can throw different styles at them and they can still usually enjoy it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Director has whale of a time making experimental ‘Mind Game’|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2004/07/28/films/film-reviews/director-has-whale-of-a-time-making-experimental-mind-game/#.VmxsoDzhAnU|last=Schilling|first=Mark|date=28 July 2004|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|access-date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Mind Game'': Anime for the 21st century|url=http://www.kfccinema.com/features/interviews/tanaka_mindgame/tanaka_mindgame.html|last=Leong|first=David|date=1 July 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223143923/http://www.kfccinema.com/features/interviews/tanaka_mindgame/tanaka_mindgame.html|archive-date=23 February 2009|publisher=KFCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received a cult audience and was well received, winning [[#Reception|multiple awards worldwide]], and has been praised by directors [[Satoshi Kon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Interview with Satoshi Kon | url=http://www.gamestar.com/11_04/pause/pause_disc_satoshikon.shtml | publisher=Gamestar | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104062002/http://www.gamestar.com/11_04/pause/pause_disc_satoshikon.shtml | archive-date=4 January 2011 | quote=GS: Have you seen any films lately that you found great?

==Plot==
Nishi is a 20-year-old loser with dreams of becoming a comic book artist. One late evening he runs into his childhood crush, Myon, on the subway. She tells Nishi she is due to marry. Nishi has flashbacks of exchanging love letters and messages with Myon and ends up declaring that he has always loved Myon (but in an insincere fashion), which Myon brushes off.

They go to her father's [[yakitori]] restaurant, and see Myon's father and her elder sister Yan (who runs the restaurant). Nishi also meets Myon's fiancee, Ryo. Two yakuza gangsters enter, Atsu and a senior yakuza whom Atsu calls Aniki (lit. brother. A term used by Yakuza to refer to each other). They are looking for Myon's father, who seduced and stole Atsu's girlfriend, and now hides cowering behind a corner. It is later revealed through flashbacks that the senior yakuza is actually the first boyfriend of the girls' mother, who was also seduced away by her husband during a disco in their youth.

As Atsu threatens Myon with a gun, Ryo steps in and tries to punch Atsu, but instead gets knocked out. Atsu then prepares to rape Myon, who calls out Nishi's name. Atsu turns on Nishi, who is rolled in a ball, terrified, placing his pistol against Nishi's anus. Atsu fires when Nishi finally musters the courage to yell, "I will hurt you!", thus killing him instantly. The senior Yakuza, offended by Atsu's lack of control, shoots him dead, and then nonchalantly orders dinner.

Meanwhile, Nishi is in some sort of [[limbo]] where he encounters a being whose physical image changes every fraction of a second, Kami-sama (God). Kami-sama directs Nishi to walk into a red portal where he will disappear, but at the last moment Nishi runs for the opposite blue portal in order to return to life. Kami-sama becomes impressed by Nishi's sheer will to live, and so lets him escape.

Nishi returns to the moment just before Atsu pulled the trigger. This time, Nishi seizes Atsu's gun with his buttocks, and shoots him dead. He, Yan and Myon all pile into the yakuza's car, leaving the father and Ryo (still unconscious) behind. They speed off, followed by the massed yakuzas. The Yakuza boss rings (calls) Nishi using the yakuza's car phone and reveals that Atsu was a player on the Japanese national soccer team. Then after further chase the boss has his men force the trio in to a dead end on a bridge. However, Nishi steers the car off the bridge and they are swallowed up by an enormous whale.
 
Inside the whale, they meet an old man who was formerly yakuza and has been trapped in the whale for more than 30 years. (He is later shown through flashbacks to be the father of the senior Yakuza shown earlier). He shows them to the elaborate suspended house he has constructed over the 'sea' inside the whale's belly. Nishi attempts to escape the whale but he fails and they resign themselves to life inside the whale. Yan practices dancing and art, Myon practices swimming (a dream she gave up when her breasts got bigger), Nishi practices writing and drawing humorous manga and he and Myon finally become sexually intimate. 

They attempt to leave the whale, again failing. And the old man reveals that the water level inside the whale is rising, and he believes the whale is probably dying. They concoct a plan to make a motor boat out using spare parts and fuel from the car they arrived in. On the day before the final match of the soccer World Cup, the whale returns to Osaka (their home town) and Yan, Nishi, Myon, as well as the Old Man, manage to escape. 

As the four fly through the air, the film returns to its very first scene, with Myon running from the Yakuza, only this time she does not get her leg caught in the door of the train, and the Yakuza is left behind on the platform. This is followed by a lengthy montage, similar to that of the opening credits, showing the histories of the various characters. The movie ends ambiguously, with the phrase "This Story Has Never Ended" appearing before the credits roll.

[[File:Nejamesa horned god of India.png|thumb|Naigamesha, [[Mathura Museum]], [[Shunga Empire]], 2nd century BCE]]
'''''Naigamesha''''' ({{lang-sa|नैगमेष}}, {{IAST|Naigameśa}}), also known as '''''Harinegameshi''''', is a goat-headed or deer-headed deity, associated with children. He also appears in [[Jain]] as well as [[Hindu]]  traditions, associated with the war-god [[Kartikeya]] and [[childbirth]].

==Associations==
Naigamesha is known by a variety of names: Negamesha, Nemesha, Naigameshin, Negamesi, Harinegameshi. The last is translated as "Negamesi, the general of Hari ([[Indra]])". Another interpretation says that it is derived from ''harina'' (deer) and ''mesha'' ([[sheep|ram]]).&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

Naigamesha is the benefactor and protector of children in Jainism. While the Greek satyr [[Pan (god)|Pan]] is depicted with the lower body of a goat, Naigamesha has a goat head; in both cultures, the goat denotes fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Geer pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; He is worshipped to beget children.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

==Jain texts==
[[File:Naigamesha looks over Mahavira's birth.jpg|thumb|Naigamesha (left) looks over Mahavira's birth; the infant Mahavira is held in his mother's arms. Folio from the ''[[Kalpa Sutra]]'' (1450–1500).]]

According to the ''[[Kalpa Sutra]]'', Naigamesha, on the orders of the king of the gods [[Indra]], transferred the embryo of the [[Tirthankar]] [[Mahavira]] from the womb of the [[Brahmin]] (priest class) woman Devananda to the [[Kshatriya]] (ruling caste) [[Trishala]], who finally delivers Mahavira. According to the [[Shvetambara]] text ''Neminanathacharita'', which recalls the life of the Tirthankar [[Neminatha]], [[Krishna]] – a cousin of Neminatha and generally venerated as Hindu deity – worships Naigamesha to beget a son from his second wife [[Satyabhama]]; a son who equals his first-born [[Pradyumna]], from his first wife [[Rukmini]]. Other texts portray Satyabhama praying to the deity.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

==In Hinduism==
In Hinduism, Naigamesha is associated with [[Kartikeya]], the god of war. Naigamesha is an epithet and a form of Kartikeya, where he is generally depicted goat-headed. In other instances, Naigamesha is described as the son or brother of the war god. Hindu texts like the ''[[Brahmanas]]'', the ''[[Grhyasutras|Grihya sutras]]'' and medicinal texts mention a similar deity with a [[Sheep|ram]] head.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt; As a fearsome follower of Kartikeya, Naigamesha was feared and worshipped to ward off evil. later, he evolved into the patron of childbirth.&lt;ref name="Kala1980"/&gt;

==Iconography==
Depictions of Naigamesha are rare and are generally confined to North India and the pre-third century era. They are many depictions of the deity found in the region around [[Mathura]], dating from the 1st–3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Geer p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-81-8475-277-9|page=797}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Terracotta figurines of Naigamesha from 2nd century BCE to 4th century CE are also been discovered.&lt;ref name="Kala1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Satish Chandra Kala|title=Terracottas in the Allahabad Museum|year=1980|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-391-02234-8|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1st–3rd century depiction from Kankali Tila near Mathura (currently in [[Mathura Museum]]), Naigamesha is depicted with a goat's head and short, backward turning horns, a long beard ([[goatee]]) and "drooping" ears. Another sculpture from the 10th–13th century depicts him in the company of Hindu deities. The group of seven Hindu mother-goddesses, the [[Saptamatrika]] – who are associated with children – are surrounded by their usual companions [[Shiva]] and [[Ganesha]] as well as Naigamesha. The goat-features mirror the earlier depiction. In addition, Naigamesha is depicted with three children; one held in his left arm, another seated near his left foot and a third standing near the right leg, which conveys his association with children.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Geer pp. 172–3, xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his goat-head, Naigamesha may also be shown having a deer head and may be depicted transferring the embryo of Mahavira in narrative panels. He is also depicted as seated on a throne, flanked by children on his lap or shoulders. Female attendants or a goat-headed woman sometimes accompany the god.&lt;ref name="Dalal2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18186">The '''New Order Amish''' are a [[subgroups of Amish|subgroup of Amish]] which is close to the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]]. Some scholars see the group best characterized as a subgroup of Old Order [[Amish]], despite the name. New Order Amish split away from the Old Order Amish in the 1960s for a variety of reasons, which included a desire for "clean" youth courting standards, meaning they do not condone the practice of [[Bundling (tradition)|bundling]], or non-sexually lying in bed together, during courtship. Tobacco and alcohol are also not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amishamerica.com/whats-the-difference-between-new-order-and-old-order-amish/ "What’s the difference between New Order and Old Order Amish?" at amishamerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; They also wished to incorporate more evangelical elements into the church, including Sunday school and mission work.

== History ==

The New Order Amish emerged mainly in two regions: [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] and [[Holmes County, Ohio|Holmes]]/[[Wayne County, Ohio]]. [[G.C. Waldrep|Waldrep]] cites a New Order Amish man:

{{quote|In Lancaster County, the New Orders wanted a lot more new ''stuff'', but they also wanted to be a little bit more spiritual. In Holmes County the New Orders wanted to be a lot more ''spiritual'', but they also wanted a little more ''stuff''.}}

Even though in Waldrep's opinion this seems "like a simplistic reading", he states that "in the final analysis the characterization appears accurate".&lt;ref&gt;[[G.C. Waldrep]]: "The New Order Amish and Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal within Tradition." [[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]] 3 (2008), page 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, around one hundred families split with the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], over differences related to the use of modern machinery. The collective Lancaster Amish ministry forbid the use of said machinery, but in many districts, the Amish had adapted to the technology. Because of this, the ministry had a difficult time enforcing this ruling. In 1964, the bishops banned four districts from communion for not implementing the larger group’s standards on technology. By February 6, 1966, thirty Amish families, under threat of excommunication, met at the home of Christian F. Flick.&lt;ref&gt;Waldrep, G.C. "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008): 395. Literature Resource Center. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There, they organized a separate service where they received communion from a liberal Amish church in Newton, Ontario. In April 1966, sixty-five families had come to associate with Flick’s group. There were three defector districts in Lancaster County by fall of 1967. About one hundred families were split into three districts, one at Honey Brook and two at Gap.&lt;ref&gt;Kraybill, Donald B. The Riddle of Amish Culture. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate movement developed in Ohio at around the same time. In the early 1960s, a conflict in the Troyer Valley district began the movement of the New Order Amish in Ohio. At the time, only ministers and older Amish members were allowed to greet each other with a kiss. This upset the younger church members, as they wished to practice the “holy kiss” also. A ministerial committee was unable to reach a resolution. In 1966, the Troyer Valley’s bishop requested that minister Levi R. Troyer stop using the kiss to greet the younger brethren. He refused and was sent back from communion. Much like the Lancaster group, the Troyers then went outside of their church and home to find a more suitable church. From 1969-1971, about a dozen Holmes County districts joined the Troyers, headed by Bishop Roy L. Schlabach, for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Waldrep, G.C. "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008): 395. Literature Resource Center. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes County New Orders stood for "a strong desire to keep the Amish way; to remain Amish, but to promote more spiritual awareness and eliminate questionable practices, such as bundling, tobacco, etc." &lt;ref&gt;Kraybill, Donald B. The Riddle of Amish Culture. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Way of life ==

Like Old Order groups, New Order Amish use [[horse and buggy]], wear plain clothing, speak [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]] and practice home worship. As with other Amish, technological restrictions include prohibitions on the [[internet]], [[television]], and [[radio]].

All New Order Amish districts still preserve the traditional Amish dress, although there is a trend towards slimmer brimmed hats and trimmed beards among the men. As for the New Order women, they typically have brighter colors all around. Pennsylvania German is mostly preserved, but there is a tendency to shift to the English language.

New Order Amish may be more lenient in the practice of [[shunning]] and may be more permissive of photography than lower-order groups. They were also known for introducing brighter colored fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amishamerica.com/whats-the-difference-between-new-order-and-old-order-amish/ "Differences Between New Order and Old Order Amish"]. ''Amish Online Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; New Order Amish prohibit alcohol and tobacco use (seen in some Old Order groups), an important factor in the original division.

Different from the Old Order, the New Order actively suppress the use of tobacco and alcohol and do not allow bed courtship ([[Bundling (tradition)|bundling]]), which was an important factor in the original division. They did eventually allow milkers, balers, propane gas and pneumatic tires. The Lancaster County New Order Amish was different, however, they eventually did permit electricity, what led to the split into two New Order Amish groups, electric and non-electric.&lt;ref&gt;Waldrep, G.C. "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition". ''Mennonite Quarterly Review'' 3 (2008): 395. Literature Resource Center. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Holmes County New Orders allowed men to trim their beards as well as the hair above their ears.&lt;ref&gt;Ben, Macintyre. "A quiet lesson in forgiveness; Comment." ''The Times'' (London, England) 2006: Academic OneFile. Web. 13 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some New Order Amish permit telephone lines in the home.

The New Order worship patterns are essentially the same as among the Old Order.

The [[New Order Tobe Amish|New Order Tobe]] share an unusual mix of progressive and conservative traits. They are progressive in technology but conservative in spirituality and dress. In contrast to other New Order Amish groups, they have a relatively high retention rate of their young people that is comparable to the retention rate of the Old Order Amish.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, and Steven M. Nolt: ''The Amish'', Baltimore, MD, 2013, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliations ==

There are four different affiliations which are referred to as being "New Order": 
*Non-electric New Order (35 church districts in 2011), the most conservative among the New Orders
*Electric New Order (17 church districts in 2011), more progressive than the Non-electric New Orders
*[[New Order Tobe Amish|New Order Tobe]] (5 church districts in 2011), progressive in technology but conservative in spirituality
*[[New Order Amish Fellowship|New Order Fellowship]] (4 church districts in 2011), the most progressive among the New Orders

Especially in Lancaster County, there is a strong trend among the New Orders to join more progressive churches. In 1994 there were two New Order districts in Lancaster County with about 60 households, by 2004 there was only a single district with 21 households and almost no young people.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.C. Waldrep]]: "The New Order Amish and Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal within Tradition." [[The Mennonite Quarterly Review]] 3 (2008), page 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members and congregations ==
Counting all New Order Amish groups there were 3,961 baptized members in 70 congregations with a total population of about 8,912 people in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill and Nelson Hostetter: ''Anabaptist World USA'', Scottdale, PA, and Waterloo, ON, 2001, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008/9 there were about 3,500 baptized members in 58 New Order Amish congregations, while at the same time the New Order Amish Fellowship had 400 baptized members in 7 congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites, and Mennonites|last=Kraybill|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Kraybill|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ Pr|location=|isbn=|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there were 35 non-electric New Order districts and 17 electric ones, whereas Tobe New Order had 5 and the New Order Fellowship 4 church districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amish|last=Kraybill|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Kraybill|author2=Karen M. Johnson-Weiner |author3=Steven M. Nolt |year=2013|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ Pr|location=|isbn=|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that New Order Amish tend to keep a lower percentage of their children in the faith, according to the group about 50 to 65 percent, while Old Orders keep 80 to 95 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taeufergeschichte.net/index.php?id=121 Taeufergeschichte.net: Die Gemeinschaft der „Neu-Amischen“]&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is the [[New Order Tobe Amish]] with a defection rate of only 19.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner and Steven M. Nolt: The Amish, Baltimore, MD, 2013, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Order Amish communities can be found in around a dozen states including Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Kentucky, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and some others.&lt;ref&gt;"Amish." Encyclopædia Britannica (2014): Research Starters. Web. 13 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Their largest population is in the Holmes County, Ohio, settlement.

==Similar groups==
There are groups of Amish, considered being "Old Order", that allow more technologies than some groups of New Order Amish. According to [[G.C. Waldrep]] the [[Michigan Churches|Michigan-related]] Amish churches show many spiritual and material similarities to the New Orders, while they are still technically considered a part of the larger Old Order group.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.C. Waldrep]]: "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition." in Mennonite Quarterly Review 3 (2008), page 426.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Groffdale Conference Mennonite Church]], the largest [[Old Order Mennonite]] group, allows about the same level of technology as New Order Amish groups, while there are technologically very conservative Old Order Mennonite groups, like the [[Noah Hoover Mennonite]]s, that are as restrictive concerning technologies as the Swartzentruber Amish.

{{Liturgical year}}

'''Ordinary Time''' comprises two periods of time in the [[Christian]] [[liturgical year]] that are found in the calendar of the ordinary form of the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], as well as some other churches of [[Western Christianity]], including those that use the [[Revised Common Lectionary]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/lection.html|title=The Lectionary|last=Bratcher|first=Dennis|year=2014|publisher=[[Christian Research Institute]]|language=English|accessdate=5 June 2016|quote=The RCL Sunday readings are organized around the two major Seasons of the Church Year, beginning with Advent-Christmas-Epiphany, and then Lent-Easter-Pentecost. The remainder of the year between Pentecost and Advent is called Ordinary Time, from the word "ordinal", which simply means counted time (1st Sunday after Pentecost, etc.).}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Anglican Communion]], [[Methodist church]]es, [[Lutheran church]]es, [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic churches]] and [[Reformed church]]es.&lt;ref name="Holmes2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Stephen Mark|title=The Fathers on the Sunday Gospels|date=1 October 2012|publisher=Liturgical Press|language=English |isbn=9780814635100|page=22|quote=The ''Revised Common Lectionary'' has been subsequently adopted by many English-speaking Protestant denominations such as the Church of Scotland and various Lutheran and Reformed churches. It has also been adopted by some Old Catholic churches and is widely used throughout the Anglican Communion, for example by the Church of Ireland, the Scottish Episcopal Church, the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican churches of Canada, Australia, Aotearoa/New Zealand and Polynesia, Melanesia, the West Indies, Central Africa, and Southern Africa. In the Church of England the two-year Sunday Lectionary of the ''Alternative Service Book 1980'' was replaced in 2000 by an adapted version of the ''Revised Common Lectionary'' in ''Common Worship''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin, the name of this time is '''tempus per annum''' translated as ''time during the year''. 

Ordinary Time comprises two periods: the first period begins on [[Epiphany Day]] (in the Anglican Communion and Methodist churches) or the day after the Feast of the [[Baptism of the Lord]] (in the Catholic Church) and ends on the day before [[Ash Wednesday]]; the second period begins on the Monday after [[Pentecost]], the conclusion of the [[Eastertide|Easter season]], and continues until the Saturday before the First Sunday of [[Advent]]. In some traditions, the first period is celebrated as '''[[Epiphanytide]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/holydays/epiphany.shtml|title=Epiphany|date=7 October 2011|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|language=English|accessdate=5 June 2016|quote=For many Protestant church traditions, the season of Epiphany extends from 6 January until Ash Wednesday, which begins the season of Lent leading to Easter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter of these periods is observed as '''Trinitytide'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Trinitytide|title=Trinitytide|date=5 June 2016|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|language=English|accessdate=5 June 2016|quote=Definition of Trinitytide: the season of the church year between Trinity Sunday and Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these periods of time, combined, are the longest time in the liturgical year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/overviews/seasons/ordinary_time/ordinary1.cfm  "Ordionary Time"], Catholic Culture website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The weeks of Ordinary Time are numbered. Several Sundays bear the name of feasts or solemnities celebrated on those days, including [[Trinity Sunday]] and the [[Feast of Christ the King]].

The [[liturgical color]] normally assigned to Ordinary Time is [[green]].

==Events of Ordinary Time==
In the Catholic Church, Ordinary Time begins on the day after the Feast of the [[Baptism of the Lord]]. The church normally celebrates this feast on the Sunday after the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord]] (6 January). However, some  [[diocese]]s, including those in the United States, always celebrate Epiphany on the Sunday after the [[Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]] (1 January); in years when this Sunday celebration of the Epiphany of the Lord falls on January 7 or 8, the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is moved to the following day, the second Monday of the year.

Therefore, Ordinary Time starts on the second Monday or Tuesday of the year (January 9 or 10) in those years and dioceses. The Christmas season includes the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, so Ordinary Time begins the next day, Monday or Tuesday, not on Sunday. However, the Sunday after the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is always counted as the "Second Sunday of Ordinary Time".

Ordinary Time continues through the day before [[Ash Wednesday]], which falls between 4 February and 10 March (inclusive), and marks the beginning of the Season of [[Lent]]. Thus, for Roman Catholics, the period of Ordinary Time between Christmas and Lent may end amid the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, or ninth week of Ordinary Time. Ash Wednesday is a [[moveable feast]] which occurs on the 40th day (excluding Sundays) before the Solemnity of the Resurrection of the Lord (Easter Sunday).

Ordinary Time resumes on the Monday following Solemnity of [[Pentecost]], which is the Sunday between 10 May and 13 June that marks the 50th day of Easter. Ordinary Time concludes with the Saturday afternoon before the first Sunday of  [[Advent]] (27 November to 3 December). Ordinary Time thus always includes the entire months of July, August, September and October and most or all of June and November. In some years, Ordinary Time includes a portion of May, or a day or two in early December, or both. The Catholic Church substitutes the [[Feast of Christ the King|Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ the King of the Universe]] in the place of the 34th Sunday in Ordinary Time, the last Sunday of the season.

== Weeks in a year ==
{{Weeks of Ordinary Time}}
The actual number of complete or partial weeks of Ordinary Time in any given year can total 33 or 34. In most years, Ordinary Time comprises only 33 weeks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholic-resources.org/Lectionary/Calendar.htm Lectionary Calendar and Movable Feasts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are 34 weeks of Ordinary Time in years with [[dominical letter]]s '''A''' or '''g''' or some combination containing '''A''' or '''g''', i.e., '''Ag''', '''bA''', or '''gf'''. All other years have 33 weeks of Ordinary Time, with the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, or ninth or 10th week dropped from the calendar that year.&lt;/ref&gt; so the Church omits one week that otherwise would precede the resumption of Ordinary Time following Pentecost Sunday. For example, in 2011, the Sunday before Ash Wednesday was the Ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time, but the day after Pentecost Sunday began the 11th Week in Ordinary Time.

In the Church of England, a similar situation arises with "Sundays after Trinity", as Sundays in the second period of Ordinary Time are termed (until the final four, which are termed "Sundays before Advent"). The total number of Sundays varies according to the date of Easter and can range anything from 18 to 23. When there are 23, the [[Collect]] and [[Post-Communion]] for the 22nd Sunday are taken from the provision for the Third Sunday before Lent.

In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], it is normal to refer to Sundays after Epiphany and Sundays after Pentecost. The use of Ordinary Time is not common.

In the [[Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic churches]], Sundays are all numbered after Pentecost which runs through the following year. The Orthodox do not distinguish Ordinary Time.

===Solemnities and feasts in Ordinary Time===
In addition, certain solemnities and feasts that fall on Sundays during Ordinary Time preempt the observance of an ordinarily numbered Sunday. On preempted Sundays, the [[liturgical color]] of the feast or solemnity replaces the liturgical color green. These feast days include, in the Roman Catholic calendar, any [[holy day of obligation]], any other solemnity, any feast of the Lord, and the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed Souls.

On the universal calendar, these include:  
* [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Feast of the Presentation of the Lord]] on 2 February (liturgical color: white),
* [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Solemnity of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on 24 June (liturgical color: white),
* [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul|Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul]] on 29 June (liturgical color: red)
* [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord]] on 6 August (liturgical color: white)
* [[Feast of the Cross|Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] on 14 September (liturgical color: red)
* [[All Saints' Day|Solemnity of All Saints]] on 1 November (liturgical color: white)
* [[All Souls' Day|Commemoration of All Faithful Departed Souls]] on 2 November (liturgical color: violet or black&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, white may be used in place of violet on All Souls Day.&lt;/ref&gt;), and
* [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Feast of the Dedication of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome]] on 9 November (liturgical color: white).

The following observances always preempt a Sunday in Ordinary Time: 
* [[Baptism of the Lord|Feast of the Baptism of the Lord]] or [[Epiphany (holiday)|Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord]] always preempts the First Sunday in Ordinary Time
* [[Pentecost|Solemnity of Pentecost]] always begins the first week of Ordinary Time after Eastertide
* [[Trinity Sunday|Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity]] always preempts the Sunday immediately after Pentecost
* [[Feast of Christ the King|Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ the King of the Universe]] always preempts the 34th (and final) Sunday in Ordinary Time

Other solemnities which outrank Sundays of Ordinary Time vary from [[parish]] to parish and diocese to diocese; they may include the feast of the patron saint of a parish and the feast of the dedication of the parish church.

In addition, if a solemnity or feast that outranks a Sunday of Ordinary Time, such as those mentioned above, should occur during the week, a priest celebrating Mass with a congregation may observe the solemnity on a nearby Sunday. Such a celebration is traditionally called an "external solemnity," even if the feast in question is not ranked as a solemnity. If an external solemnity is celebrated on a Sunday, the color of that celebration is used rather than green.

==Use of the term==
In the [[Extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|extraordinary form]] there are two distinct seasons in the [[Roman Breviary]] and [[Roman Missal]], known as the time after Epiphany and the time after [[Pentecost]], which together correspond to Ordinary Time in the ordinary form. Sundays in these seasons are referred to as the ''n''th Sunday after Epiphany or Pentecost, as appropriate, and weekdays are identified in reference to the Sunday they follow.

With the reforms of 1970 came the introduction of four liturgical weeks (the 6th through 9th weeks of Ordinary Time) which could fall either after Epiphany or after Pentecost, making the old numbering scheme unusable, and the term  ''tempus per annum'' was used to describe both of these seasons. Before the reforms until the present, the term  ''tempus per annum'' has been used to describe the season of the [[Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] that is not part of [[Advent]] or [[Christmastide]], and so ''tempus per annum'' extends from [[Matins]] on 3 February through [[None (liturgy)|None]] on the last Saturday before [[Advent]].

Following the lead of the liturgical reforms of the Roman Rite, many [[Protestant]] churches also adopted the concept of Ordinary Time alongside the [[Revised Common Lectionary]].

==Kingdomtide exception==
Some [[Protestant]] denominations set off a time at the end of Ordinary Time known as [[Kingdomtide]] or Season of End Times.  This period can range from anywhere from only the three Sundays prior to Christ the King (as in the Wisconsin Synod Lutheran) to 13 or 14 weeks (most notably in the [[United Methodist Church]]).  The Church of England observes this time All Saints and Advent Sunday.

'''Penn Fraser Jillette''' (born March 5, 1955) is an American [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], comedian, musician, actor, inventor, filmmaker, television personality, and best-selling author known for his work with fellow magician [[Teller (magician)|Teller]] as half of the team [[Penn &amp; Teller]]. The duo have been featured in numerous stage and television shows such as ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us]]'', and ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'', and are currently headlining in [[Las Vegas]] at [[The Rio]]. Jillette serves as the act's orator and raconteur.

He has published eight books, including the ''New York Times'' Bestseller, ''[[God, No!|God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales]]''. He is also known for his advocacy of [[atheism]], [[scientific skepticism]], the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[libertarianism]], and [[free-market capitalism]].

==Early life==

Jillette was born in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]]. His mother, Valda Rudolph Jillette (née Parks; 1909–2000),&lt;ref name="parents"&gt;Ancestry.com. Social Security Death Index [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2011. Original data: Social Security Administration. Social Security Death Index, Master File. Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[secretary]], and his father, Samuel Herbert Jillette (1912–1999),&lt;ref name="parents"/&gt; worked at Greenfield's Franklin County Jail.&lt;ref name="kelly"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=What you see, what you get |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/659808331.html?dids=659808331:659808331&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+07%2C+1986&amp;author=Kevin+Kelly%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=WHAT+YOU+SEE%2C+WHAT+YOU+GET&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=September 2, 2011 |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=December 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recorder.com/story.cfm?id_no=5432510  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522022548/http://www.recorder.com/story.cfm?id_no=5432510 |date=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"&gt;{{cite news |title=A couple of Eccentric Guys |last=Trillin |first=Calvin |work=The New Yorker |date=May 15, 1989 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1989/05/15/1989_05_15_058_TNY_CARDS_000353087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jillette became an [[atheist]] in his early teens after reading the [[Bible]]. He was subsequently asked to leave the church, after asking questions in a youth group that also made skeptics of his peers.&lt;ref name="ReligionMorality"&gt;{{cite news |title=Morality, Religion and Bullsh*t: An Interview with Penn Jillette |last=Shaffer |first=R |work=[[American Humanist Association|Humanist Network News]] |date=December 2012 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-12-morality-religion-and-bullsht-an-interview-with-penn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102205959/http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2012-12-morality-religion-and-bullsht-an-interview-with-penn |archivedate=November 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jillette became disenchanted with traditional illusionist acts that presented the craft as authentic magic, such as [[The Amazing Kreskin]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist [[James Randi]], and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious [[supernatural]] power. Jillette regularly acknowledges Randi as the one person on the planet he loves the most besides members of his family.&lt;ref name="skepticalitynov2012"&gt;{{cite podcast| url = http://www.skepticality.com/jill-jet-and-the-magical-tale-of-penn/| title = Jill-Jet: And The Magical Tale of Penn|website = Skepticality| publisher = [[Skepticality]]| host = [[Derek Colanduno]]| date = November 27, 2012| accessdate = June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jillette worked with [[high school]] classmate [[Michael Moschen]] in developing and performing a juggling act during the years immediately following their 1973 graduation.&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"/&gt; In 1974, Jillette graduated from [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135432/ |title=Penn Jillette: The magician-comedian-writer's secrets revealed! |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=February 4, 2006 |first=Bryan |last=Curtis |accessdate=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he was introduced to [[Teller (magician)|Teller]] by Weir Chrisemer, a mutual friend.&lt;ref name="P&amp;T-faq"/&gt; The three then formed a three-person act called Asparagus Valley Cultural Society which played in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]] and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"/&gt; In 1981, he and Teller teamed up as [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and went on to do a successful [[Off Broadway]] and later [[Broadway theatre]] show called "Penn &amp; Teller" that toured nationally.&lt;ref name="New Yorker-Trillin-1989"/&gt;

==Career==
While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in a speed [[mariachi]] [[power trio]] called Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob "Bob" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the a capella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillette's movie commitments. They recorded an album with [[Kramer (musician)|Kramer]] at Noise New York called ''Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Here's Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?).'' It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]]'', but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, "Oral Hygiene".

Jillette was a contributor to the now-defunct ''[[PC/Computing]]'' magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994.

Jillette was the primary voice announcer for the U.S.-based cable network [[Comedy Central]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="nbc-ident-bio"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nbc.com/Identity/host.shtml| title = ''Identity'': Penn Jillette|publisher=[[NBC]]| accessdate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywood.com"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Penn_Jillette/1350693| title = Penn Jillette: Full Biography| work=Hollywood.com|accessdate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Jillette purchased a house in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] and dubbed it "The Slammer".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tschorn|first=Adam|title=Welcome to the Slammer |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/22/home/hm-jillette22?pg=1|accessdate=October 18, 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been featured in dozens of television shows and articles and was designed by his friend Colin Summers. He formerly recorded music there, and conducted his radio show at the studio inside "The Slammer".&lt;ref name="otlstudio"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.otlstudio.com/projects/199601.php| title = The Slammer| publisher=Outside The Lines Studio| accessdate = October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dellaCava"&gt;{{cite news| first = Marco R.| last = della Cava| url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-10-28-at-home-penn-jillette_x.htm| title = This is the manic magic house that Penn built|work=USA Today| date = October 29, 2004| accessdate = April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he sold "The Slammer" so that his family could move to a less remote location.&lt;ref name="latimes2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-penn-jillette-las-vegas-20161215-story.html|title=The Slammer, Las Vegas home of magician Penn Jillette, sells for $1.88 million|website=LA Times|accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1996, Jillette had a recurring role on ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' as Drell, the head of the Witches' Council. He and Teller both appeared in the pilot with [[Debbie Harry]] as the third member of the Council. The show was created by Jillette's friend [[Nell Scovell]].

Penn and Teller appear as comedians Rebo and Zooty in the 5th-season episode of ''[[Babylon 5]]'', "The Day of the Dead", written by [[Neil Gaiman]].

For a brief time in 1997, Jillette wrote bi-weekly dispatches for the [[search engine]] [[Excite.com]]. Each column ended with a pithy comment identifying which of the [[Penn &amp; Teller]] duo he was. (For example: "Penn Jillette is the half of Penn &amp; Teller that's detained at airports.") Jillette made a habit of linking many words in his online column to wacky sites that generally had nothing to do with the actual words. The columns are no longer available on the current Excite.com site, but have been republished with permission at PennAndTeller.com.&lt;ref name="penn-columns"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc.html| title = "Penn's Columns" (index)| publisher = PennAndTeller.com| accessdate = October 12, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202202011/http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penn-n-teller/pcc.html| archivedate = February 2, 2008| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2003, Jillette, along with Teller, began producing and hosting the show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In the show, the two analyze cultural phenomena, debunk myths, criticize people and aspects of society they deem "[[bullshit]]".

In 2005 with actor [[Paul Provenza]], Jillette co-produced and co-directed ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'', a documentary film tracing the life of an obscene joke known as [[The Aristocrats (joke)|"The Aristocrats"]]. It principally consists of a variety of comedians telling their own versions of the joke.

From January 3, 2006, to March 2, 2007, Jillette hosted, along with fellow [[atheist]], [[skeptic]], and [[juggler]] [[Michael Goudeau]], a live, hour-long [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] broadcast on [[Free FM]]. The show, ''[[Penn Radio]]'', broadcast from his [[#Vintage Nudes Studio|Vintage Nudes Studio]] in his Las Vegas home. The most notable recurring segment of the show was "[[Monkey Tuesday]]" and later "The Pull of the Weasel". On March 2, 2007, Jillette announced that he would no longer be doing his radio show. He stated that he is a "show biz wimp" and decided to stop doing the show so he could spend more time with his children.

During the 2006–07 television season, Jillette hosted the prime-time game show ''[[Identity (game show)|Identity]]'' on NBC-TV.

In 2008, Jillette was a contestant on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 6)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', paired with professional dancer [[Kym Johnson]]. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated. A reference to his large feet as a sign of another large body part was bleeped in the West Coast airing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

During 2010–2011, Jillette did a bi-weekly show on [[Revision3]] called ''Penn Point''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revision3.com/pennpoint |title=Penn Point |work=Revision3 |access-date=May 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522050852/http://revision3.com/pennpoint |archive-date=May 22, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 16, 2011, Jillette's book ''[[God, No! Signs You May Already Be An Atheist and Other Magical Tales]]'' was released and made the New York Times Best Sellers shortly after, in the week of August 28, in the 14th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Sellers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-09-04/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An avid upright bassist, Jillette frequently accompanies jazz pianist [[Mike Jones (jazz musician)|Mike Jones]], who opens for the magician's Las Vegas show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Andrew|title=Penn Jillette's Bass Magic|url=http://jazztimes.com/sections/tangents/articles/19709-penn-jillette-s-bass-magic|accessdate=November 13, 2011|newspaper=JazzTimes|date=December 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812085201/http://jazztimes.com/sections/tangents/articles/19709-penn-jillette-s-bass-magic|archivedate=August 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2018, Jones released a live jazz album with Jillette entitled ''The Show Before the Show'' which consisted of ten tracks played by the duo at the [[Rio Las Vegas]]. Jillette additionally performed at the famed [[Green Mill Cocktail Lounge]] to coincide with the album's debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Howard|title=Yes, magician Penn can play jazz bass and proves it at Green Mill|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/reich/ct-ent-mikes-jones-review-0326-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jillette was one of the contestants on [[The Celebrity Apprentice 5|''The Celebrity Apprentice'' season 5]], beginning on February 19, 2012. He was fired from the show by Donald Trump during the Week 11 episode. Also on February 19, 2012, along with Michael Goudeau, he started the podcast ''[[Penn Jillette#Podcasts|Penn's Sunday School]]''.

In 2013, he returned for the [[All-Star Celebrity Apprentice]] season, where he successfully made his way to the finale, raising $663,655 for the charity of his choice, Opportunity Village.&lt;ref name="FinishSecond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2013/may/20/jillette-finishes-second-spins-lot-magic-all-star-/ | title=Penn Jillette finishes second but spins a lot of magic on 'All-Star Celebrity Apprentice' | publisher=Las Vegas Sun| date=May 19, 2013 | accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, 2013, Penn and Teller were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the live performance category.

Penn credits magician and [[Skeptical movement|skeptical activist]] [[James Randi]] for his career.

===Jill-Jet===
In July 1999, Jillette was granted {{US patent|5920923}} for the "Jill-Jet", a hot-tub jet specially angled for allowing a woman to [[masturbate]] against the water stream. He has credited [[Debbie Harry]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] for suggesting the idea, as the two of them were once in a hot tub and Harry made a remark about changing the jets for a woman's pleasure. Jillette liked the idea enough to pursue a patent application at the [[USPTO]] under the patent title "Hydro-therapeutic Stimulator".&lt;ref name="uspto"&gt;{{cite web| last = Jillette| first = Penn| date = July 13, 1999| url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5920923.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5920923&amp;RS=PN/5920923| title = "Hydro-therapeutic Stimulator" (U.S. Patent 5,920,923)| work=USPTO Patent Full Text and Image Database| publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]

The abstract of the patent explains that a "discharge nozzle is located within the tub and connected to the outlet, mounted to the seat so that the discharged water from the circulation pump automatically aligns with and is directed to stimulation points (e.g., the [[clitoris]]) of the female user when the female user sits in the seat." An article in the June 2006 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' shed additional light on the invention. Originally, it was to be called the "ClitJet"; however, he stated that "Jill-Jet" was more suitable because it included his name in the title.

On the ''Penn Radio'' show, telling the listeners about the photo shoot for the ''Playboy'' article, Jillette mentioned that he has a Jill-Jet installed in a tub in his house, and that several of his female friends and friends' female spouses enjoy it a lot, but he is not aware of any other installations of a water jet in such a configuration anywhere else.

===Vintage Nudes Studio===
Jillette created a private recording studio in his Las Vegas home.&lt;ref name=netg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/penn_jillette/index.shtml |title=Penn Jillette Detailed Biography |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |publisher=NetGlimse.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921093652/http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/penn_jillette/index.shtml |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition, designed by ''Outside The Lines Studio'' and built by Crisci Custom Builders between October 2003 and June 2004 as part of his Las Vegas home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://otlstudio.com/projects/200401.php |title=The Slammer: Vintage Nudes Studio |date=February 21, 2009 |publisher=Outside The Lines |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named Vintage Nudes Studios by Jillette for [[playing card]]s that he had collected.

==Personal life==
Jillette says that he has an [[addictive personality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first= Penn| last= Jillette| work=[[Here's the Thing]] |interviewer= [[Alec Baldwin]]| title=Penn Jillette| url= http://www.wnyc.org/story/htt-penn-jillette/| publisher= WNYC| date= August 18, 2015| accessdate= April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to have never had "so much as a puff of [[marijuana]] or a drop of alcohol" because he does not trust himself to do it in moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media| work=Penn And Teller's 'Bullshit!' |title= War On Drugs |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7lavNFiTM |at=23:52| publisher= republished at ''YouTube.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an advocate of the legalization of all drugs and discontinuing the [[War on Drugs]].

Jillette is an [[atheism|atheist]], [[libertarianism|libertarian]] (he has stated that he may consider himself to be an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]]),&lt;ref name="pittsburghlive"&gt;{{cite web | last=Steigerwald | first=Bill | url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/qa/s_136178.html | title=Dear graduates: Work for freedom | date=May 24, 2003 | website=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] | accessdate=March 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[scientific skepticism|skeptic]], as well as an adherent to [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosophy, as stated on his ''Penn Says'' podcast. Jillette is a fellow at the libertarian think tank the [[Cato Institute]] and has stated that he "always" votes [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]].&lt;ref name=vote&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2008/10/29/whos-getting-your-vote/singlepage Who's Getting Your Vote?], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Jillette took the "[[Blasphemy Challenge]]" offered by the [[Rational Response Squad]] and publicly denied the existence of a holy spirit.&lt;ref name="youtubeblasphemy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2INdxjHgU0 | title=Penn's Blasphemy |accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His cars' license plates read "atheist", "nogod", and "godless".&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wang | first=K.S. | url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/112_0906_penn_jillette_celebrity_drive/index.html | title=Celebrity Drive: Penn Jillette, Magician, Comedian, Host, Author | date=June 1, 2009 | publisher=[[Motor Trend]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Strangely enough, they wouldn't give me 'Infidel,'" he says.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

From 1987 to 1989, Jillette provided financial support to David and [[Jad Fair]] of the art rock band [[Half Japanese]] for their record label [[50 Skidillion Watts]]. This allowed the band to release the albums ''[[Music to Strip By]]'', ''The Band that Would be King'' and ''Charmed Life''. When asked about his assistance Jillette said, "anybody who listens to Half Jap becomes a fan." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-02-17/news/26155220_1_skidillion-watts-label-punk|title=The Flip Side Of The Ever-flip Penn Jillette What Else Could The Magician Have In His Bag Of Tricks?

In 2005, he wrote and read an essay for [[National Public Radio]] claiming that he was "beyond atheism. Atheism is not believing in God... I believe there is no God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisibelieve.org/dsp_ShowEssay.php?uid=34&amp;topessays=2&amp;start=165|title=There Is No God| author=|date=|work=thisibelieve.org|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His atheism, he has explained, has informed every aspect of his life and thoughts, and as such is as crucial to him as [[theism|theistic beliefs]] are to the devout. Jillette encourages open discussion, debate, and proselytizing on the issue of [[Existence of God|God's existence]], believing that the issue is too important for opinions about it to remain private. Jillette does not dismiss all who do believe in God: a 2008 edition of his ''Penn Says'' podcast expresses his appreciation for a fan who brought him the gift of a pocket [[Gideon Bible]] after a performance because he realized that this individual sincerely cared enough about him to try to help him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=natecalaway |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa9JE_ZVL88&amp;feature=related |title=The Gift of A Bible |publisher=YouTube |date=February 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TAM 2012 Day2-Keynote-Penn &amp; Teller-4 7-14-2012.JPG|thumb|right|Jillette in 2012 at [[The Amazing Meeting]] in Las Vegas]]
Jillette stated that there is not enough information to make an informed decision on [[global warming]], that his gut told him it was not real, but his mind said that he can't prove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PTBSonShowtime |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWt2Rir8OQk |title=Penn &amp; Teller Discuss The Being Green Episode |publisher=YouTube |date=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since changed his position and now believes that climate change is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=pennjillette |author=Penn Jillette |number=448242297788825600 |date=24 March 2014 |title=Um.

Jillette is a collector and connoisseur of [[song poem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2011/10/nerdist-podcast-130-penn-teller/| title= Nerdist Podcast #130: PENN &amp; TELLER|author=|date=|work=Nerdist|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Jillette's blood pressure landed him in the hospital. By his birthday, March 5, 2015, he had lost {{convert|105|lb|abbr=on}}. He follows Dr. [[Joel Fuhrman]]'s [[Nutritarian]] diet, which means that he eats little or no animal products, no processed grains, and no added sugar or salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Penn Jillette Lost 105 Lbs. — Without Magic!|url=http://greatideas.people.com/2015/04/08/penn-jillette-weight-loss-las-vegas-home/|accessdate=April 10, 2015|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn is featured in ''Eating You Alive'', a 2016 American documentary about food and health.

Jillette is married to Emily Jillette, and they have two children, Zolten and Moxie CrimeFighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penn Jillette's kids Moxie CrimeFighter and Zolten laugh at 'god'|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/penn-jillette-s-kids-moxie-crimefighter-and-zolten-laugh-god| accessdate=August 8, 2015|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red fingernail===
Speculation arises from Jillette's red fingernail on his left hand. From the FAQ from [[Penn &amp; Teller]]'s official website, there are three common answers:

# It means he once shot a man for asking personal questions.
# When Jillette first began performing, his mother told him to get a manicure because people would be looking at his hands. In response to this, he had all of his nails painted red as a joke. The one remaining red fingernail is in memory of his mother.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=pennsays |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxq9ORifmOs |title=Painting My Fingernail |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=April 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611211728/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxq9ORifmOs |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn has stated "People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dad's ring and my Mom's nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user= pennjillette|author= Jillette, Penn | number= 328691791622709250| date= April 28, 2013| title= People are asking about my fingernail.

The governance ([[ecclesiastical polity|polity]]) of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] is based on [[democracy|democratic]] representation, and therefore resembles the [[Presbyterian polity|Presbyterian]] system of church organization. 

== Organization ==

Power and decision making comes ultimately from church members in local congregations. Local churches select delegates to meetings of the local conference/mission. Meetings of local conferences/missions select delegates that govern Unions and Unions send delegates to General Conference meetings. 

The organizational structure of the church consists of the following levels:

* The global church is governed by the "[[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|General Conference]]", which operates through 13 "Divisions" plus the attached MENA Union. Divisions do not have their own constituency, but are divisions of the General Conference. The Unions are the constituency of the General Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventistyearbook.org/ViewAdmField.aspx?AdmFieldID=GC|title=General Conference - Adventist Online Yearbook|website=www.adventistyearbook.org|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Each Division groups together "Union Conferences" and/or "Union Missions" (112 total). Union Conferences are self-supporting financially, while Union Missions are not.
* Each Union is composed of [local] "Conferences" and/or "Missions" (572 total). Local Conferences are self-supporting financially, while Local Missions are not. Certain Unions are composed of local congregations, without intervening local conferences/missions.
* Each local conference/mission is composed of local churches (congregations).  Often a number of local congregations are grouped operatively as a district, led by one senior pastor. In the United States, these numbers tend to be smaller (2-4 churches per district, perhaps), while in most of the worldwide church, the numbers tend to be larger (5+ per district and per pastor, sometimes as many as 15 or more).

Each level of organization holds a "general session" at certain intervals, when elected representatives gather to vote on general decisions and church business. The president of the General Conference, for instance, is elected at the [[General Conference Session]] every five years. 

Every inhabited location on earth is within the designated territory of a Union, even if there are no members in that territory.&lt;ref&gt;Pg 384 http://documents.adventistarchives.org/Yearbooks/YB2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Unions and local Conferences/Missions are created, and occasionally consolidated, based on membership trends and other factors. 

At the local churches, decisions are made by elected committees through vote of members. The day-to-day running of churches is governed by a church board formed by members of that church, together with the pastor of that congregation.

In contrast to [[congregational polity]], the conference corporation owns church property, employs and pays ministers, and receives [[tithes]] from members. In contrast to [[episcopal polity]], the ministers or pastors are a single level of ordained clergy and there are no [[bishops]]; elders and deacons are lay ministries. Moreover, it incorporates a hierarchical polity.

A 2002 survey of Adventists worldwide showed three quarters "affirm the structure, polity, and financial policies of the church."&lt;ref name="Strategic"&gt;"[http://www.adventist.org/world_church/official_meetings/2002annualcouncil/strategic-issues-report.pdf Three Strategic Issues: A World Survey]", p7,8. Presented to the General Conference Annual Council on 7 October 2002. Accessed 2008-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global church offices ==
{{Main|General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists}}
The Seventh-day Adventist global church is headquartered in [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], Maryland adjacent to Washington, DC. General Conference Division offices are located in various locations worldwide, usually within the territory served. The Inter-American Division is an exception which for logistical convenience is based in Miami, Florida to serve territory from Mexico through the Northern portion of South America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interamerica.org&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== General Conference senior leadership ===
{{Main|List of Presidents of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists}}
A President, General Conference Secretary, General Conference Treasurer, Division Presidents and other officers are elected at the General Conference Session every 5 years. The GC President presides over the Executive Committee.

==Union and Conference leadership==
Each organizational unit elects a President, Secretary (sometimes styled VP Administration), Treasurer and other officers. 

== Local church offices ==
Various church offices are elected by the church body as specified by the Church Manual. Positions must be filled by baptised members who attend regularly. Local church office terms run either 12 or 24 months. Offices are never elected permanently, although persons may be reelected indefinitely. 

=== Pastor ===
The most prominent church office is that of the [[pastor]] or [[Minister of religion|minister]]. Adventists believe that pastors are divinely called to ministry and they are ordained by the church for their ministry. The position of church pastor is not elected by the local church, but rather appointed by a local conference. When the minister transfers to the local church for pastoralship he also transfers his membership to that local congregation. Adventist believe in  [[clerical marriage]] and not a celibate priesthood. The pastor works with the head elder of the church and is responsible for guiding the church's spiritual direction, chairing the church board and leading out in services.

=== Elder ===
Working with the pastor in the local church is the [[Elder (religion)|elder]] who is elected by the local church and ordained by the local pastor.  The elder is seen as a religious leader in the local church and is able to conduct ordinances. The elder, or elders in most cases (who are led by a "head elder"), is largely responsible for the running of the church and the distribution of responsibility in the church. In the Adventist Church "elder" is not a title.  It's a function.  The term "pastor" is a function and often used as a title.  The "local elder's position authority is limited to the local church she/he is serving.  The "pastor's" authority is universal.  The local elder gets her/his authority from the pastor she/he is serving under or otherwise from the field administration.  The pastor's authority is inherent in the pastor's position.

=== Deacon ===
The [[deacon]], like the elder, is an elected and ordained role. The deacon's primary roles are the assistance in running of services, the visitation of members, the care of the sick, and the maintenance of church property.

=== Deaconess ===
The deaconess holds a similar position to a deacon. Earlier no provision was given for their induction, but the 2010 General Conference Session held in Atlanta, United States, decided for the ordination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.adventist.org/fileadmin/adventist.org/files/articles/information/seventh-day-adventist-church-manual_2015_updated.pdf|title=Church Manual 2010|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of deaconesses as is the case of deacons, a polity change.  The duties of a deaconess are very similar to the deacon, with particular emphasis placed on assistance in running certain services, and care of the sick and others in need.

=== Church clerk ===
The [[Clerk (position)|clerk]] is an elected position, and is responsible for the keeping of church records. The clerk facilitates the addition and removal of members from church records at the request of the church and helps with the generation of church reports to be presented to the conference.

=== Treasurer ===
The [[treasurer]] is an elected position responsible for the keeping of church funds. The treasurer is responsible for keeping accounts and the safeguarding of the money.

== Criticism and affirmation ==
[[George R. Knight|George Knight]] has argued for some structural change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.adventistreview.org/thisweek/millenn5-1.htm Proposals for Structural Change] by Harold Lee&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Cottrell]] has argued for an independent [[North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists|North American Division]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Case for an Independent North American Division" by Raymond Cottrell. ''[[Spectrum (magazine)|Spectrum]]''. Old url:[http://old.spectrummagazine.org/spectrum/archive11-15/13-1cottrell.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 75% of Adventists support items relating to the "cohesiveness of organization" of the church, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders. This statistic is composed of the following four individual items:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.adventist.org/world_church/official_meetings/2002annualcouncil/strategic-issues-report.pdf Three Strategic Issues: A World Survey]". [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]], 2002. See pages 20 and 29 especially&lt;/ref&gt;

* Question "39. Members have a responsibility to give 10% tithe to the local conference and additional offerings as able" – an estimated 81% agree
* "40. The Adventist church financial structure is a fair and proper way to support the world work of the church" – 79%
* "41. The Adventist world church organization was inspired by God" – 87%
* "43. Different world divisions should be allowed to have different church standards in order to meet differing needs" – 50%

[[William G. Johnsson]] forecasted a decreased role of structures and formal leaders in favor of initiatives by ordinary church members. He also argued that maintaining certain church institutions (like schools, hospitals, publishing houses, and health food factories) may in some cases not be worth the resources spent.&lt;ref&gt;[[William G. Johnsson]], "[http://www.adventistreview.org/article.php?id=538 Four Big Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017185524/http://www.adventistreview.org/article.php?id=538 |date=2011-10-17 }}".

'''Pundalik''' ({{lang-mr|पुंडलिक}}) or '''Pundarik''' is a central figure in the legends of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] God [[Vithoba]], generally considered a [[Vaishnava]] deity identified with the deities [[Vishnu]] and [[Krishna]]. He is credited to have brought Vithoba to [[Pandharpur]], where Vithoba's central shrine stands today. Pundalik is also perceived to be the historical founder of the [[Varkari]] sect, which is centered on the worship of Lord Vithoba.

Pundalik was one of the earliest [[Kundalini]] Yoga practitioners. As He was the master of Kundalini Yoga, people used to call him "Kundalik". 
Later, after several years, Kundalik become Pundalik. He symbolised Kundalini energy in the form of Lord [[Vitthal]] also knows as Lord [[Pandurang]] after his name Pundalik. 
[[Pandharpur]]'s Vitthal was an incarnation of [[Lord Vishnu]] or [[Lord Krishna]]. According to legends it also depicts the symbol of the [[Kundalini]] Energy, although spiritually, the same energy dwells in all.

The brick on which Lord Vitthal is standing is the basic chakra of Kundalini energy known as [[Muladhara]] Chakra. Both hands, like bows, represents Ida and Pingla [[nadi]]s which cross over at the central body of [[Sushumna]] or Brahma [[nadi]]. Body represents purusha means [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]] and the tilaka or the mark on the head represents [[Ajna]] Chakra or  '''guru chakra''' or '''third-eye chakra''' is the subtle center of energy, believed to be located between the eyebrows, located behind it along the subtle (non-physical) spinal column, as said by [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] in [[Bhagavad Gita]].

Many Kings and other noblemen were devotees of Pundalik and they built the famous Vitthal temple at Pandharpur. The age old practice of the Kundalini Yoga converted the shrine into a holy place and truth seekers from all over the world were directed here by the divine to activate and raise their Kundalini energy by the very natural process of [[Bhakti]], the highest form of Love anyone can express.

==Historicity==
Pundalik is commonly perceived to be a historical figure, connected with the establishment and propagation of the Vithoba-centric Varkari sect.&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar]] considers Pundalik to be the founder of the Varkari cult and the one who promulgated the cult in Maratha country.&lt;ref name="Bhandarkar125126"&gt;Bhandarkar (1995) pp. 125–26&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson (1843) goes further, suggesting he might have been a Jain or a Buddhist, since Varkari tradition is a combination of Jain and Buddhist morals, and Vithoba is viewed as Vishnu in his form as Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (1843) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer, Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar (1922) all suggest that Pundalik tried to unify Shiva and Vishnu, and that this culture originated in Karnataka.&lt;ref name="Sand37"&gt;Sand (1990) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Ranade (1933) thinks that Pundalik, a Kannada saint, was not only the founder of the Varkari culture but also the first great devotee or first high priest of the Pandharpur temple.&lt;ref&gt;Ranade (1933) pp. 183–84&lt;/ref&gt; Upadhyaya supports the priest theory but declines the Kannada origin theory.&lt;ref name="Sand37"/&gt; Tulpule also accepted the theory that Pundalik was the historical founder of the Varkari sect, though declines to fix a date for him due to "lack of authentic evidence".&lt;ref name="Sand37"/&gt; According to M. S. Mate, Pundalik was instrumental in coaxing the [[Hoysala]] king [[Vishnuvardhana]] to build the Pandharpur temple to Vishnu, placing him in the early 12th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Sand38"&gt;Sand (1990) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Deleury (1960) believes Pundalik was a mystic, influenced by the Vaishnava [[Haridasa]] sect of [[Karnataka]], who brought a drastic change in the worship of Vithoba. Pundalik not only founded the Varkari sect, but also was the first to identify Vithoba with the god [[Vishnu]]. Pundalik's fame also led to naming of Pandharpur to ''Paundrika-kshetra'' - the sacred place of Pundalik.&lt;ref name="Sand38"/&gt;

Other scholars like Raeside (1965), Dhanpalvar (1972), and Vaudeville (1974) have questioned the historicity of Pundalik altogether, and dismissed him as a mythical figure. In his analysis of the text ''Panduranga mahatmya'' by Sridhar (discussed in "Legend" section ahead), Raeside says that the legend of devotee Pundalik could have been nothing more a derivative of [[Puranic]] legend.&lt;ref&gt;Raeside (1965) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Dhanpalvar strongly agreed with this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Vaudeville found the legend of the Pundalik of Pandharpur was very similar to the legend of Pundarik, the devotee of Vishnu, in the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The religious historian [[R.C. Dhere]], winner of the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for his book ''Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya'', opines that identification of Vithoba with Vishnu led to conversion of the Shaiva (related to god [[Shiva]]) Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik. The main argument of the hypothesis is that the memorial shrine of Pundalik is a Shaiva shrine, rather than a Vaishnava one, compromising of a Shiva-[[linga]], the symbol of god Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
[[File:Vithoba Pundalik.jpg|thumb|Image of a [[gopuram]] of a Pandharpur temple near Vithoba's central temple, depicting Vithoba (standing dark figure, left) waiting on the brick as Pundalik (centre) serves his parents.]]
Texts, that narrate the legend of Pundalik and Vithoba, can be categorised into the Varkari tradition, the Brahmin tradition and what Raeside calls a "third tradition", that includes both Varkari and Brahmin elements. The Varkari texts are written in [[Marathi language|Marathi]], the Brahmin texts in [[Sanskrit]], and the "third tradition" are Marathi texts written by Brahmins.

The Varkari texts are: ''Bhaktalilamrita'' and ''Bhaktavijaya'' by [[Mahipati]], ''Pundalika-Mahatmya'' by [[Bahinabai]], and a long ''abhanga'' by [[Namdev]]. All these texts describe the legend of Pundalik. The Brahmin texts include: two versions of ''Panduranga-Mahatmya'' from the [[Skanda Purana]] (consisting of 900&amp;nbsp;verses); ''Panduranga-Mahatmya'' from the [[Padma Purana]] (consisting of 1,200&amp;nbsp;verses); ''Bhima-Mahatmya'', also from the Padma Purana; and a third devotional work, yet again called ''Panduranga-Mahatmya'', which is found in the [[Vishnu Purana]].&lt;ref name="Sand56"&gt;Sand (1990) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the complete English translation of ''Bhaktavijaya'', which narrates the legend of Pundalik see ''Stories of Indian Saints'' (1988) by Mahīpati, Justin Edwards Abbott, and Narhar R. Godbole.&lt;/ref&gt; The "third tradition" is found in two works: ''Panduranga-Mahatmya'' by the Brahmin Sridhara (consisting of 750 verses), and another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj (consisting of 181&amp;nbsp;verses).&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sridhra"&gt;For a complete Marathi text and English translation of ''Panduranga-Mahatmya'' by Sridhara see Raeside (1965) pp. 81-100&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three versions of the Pundalik legend, two of which are attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34–67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god [[Gopal (Krishna)|Gopala]]-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from [[Govardhan]]a as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in ''digambar'' form, wearing ''makara-kundala'', the ''srivatsa'' mark, a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting his hands on his hips and keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form on the banks of the river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a ''[[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]]'' (a holy place near a water body) and a ''[[kshetra]]'' (a holy place near a temple).&lt;ref name="Sand41f"&gt;Sand (1990) pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker (1990) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The second version of the legend depicts Vithoba appearing before Pundalik as the five-year-old [[Bala Krishna]] (infant Krishna). This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas, Prahlada Maharaj, and the poet-saints, notably Tukaram.&lt;ref&gt;Sand (1990) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining version of the Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana. Pundalik, a Brahmin madly in love with his wife, neglected his aged parents as a result. Later, on meeting sage Kukkuta, Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents. Meanwhile, one day, Krishna comes to the forest Dandivana, near Pundalik's house, in search of his angry wife [[Rukmini]], who has left him. After some coaxing, Rukmini was pacified. Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found Pundalik serving his parents. Pundalik threw a brick outside for Krishna to stand on. Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik. After completing his services, Pundalik asked that his Lord, in the Vithoba form - waiting arms-akimbo on the brick, remain on the brick with Rukmini, in Rakhumai form, and bless his devotees forever.&lt;ref name="Bhandarkar125126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sridhra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sand41f"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pande (2008) p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Norwegians, like all of the people of Scandinavia, were adherents of [[Norse paganism]]; the [[Sámi]] having a [[shamanism|shamanistic]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.karasjok.kommune.no/document.aspx?uid=49&amp;title=Pre-Christian+Religion&lt;/ref&gt; Norway was gradually [[Christianization|Christianized]] by [[Christianity in Norway|Christian]] missionaries  between 1000 and 1150. Before the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1536/1537, Norwegians were part of the [[Catholic Church in Norway|Catholic Church]]. 

According to the [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] of 2010:-&lt;ref name="Special Eurobarometer 393 "&gt;''[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf Biotechnology report 2010]'' p.383&lt;/ref&gt;

* 22% of Norwegian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God".
* 44% responded that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force".
* 29% responded that "they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force".
*  5% gave no response.

According to 2016 data from annual social-cultural study Norwegian Monitor (Norsk Monitor), 39 percent of Norwegians responded with "No" to the question to the question “Do you believe in God?”, while 37 percent said "Yes" and 27 percent said that they did not know. The survey also showed that women are more likely to believe in God than men and that faith in God is stronger among the old than the young. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20160318/majority-of-norwegians-dont-believe-in-god|title=For first time, majority in Norway don’t believe in God|date=2016-03-18|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norse religion==
{{Main|Norse paganism}}

Norse religion developed from the common mythology of the Germanic people. Scandinavian mythology and the relative importance of gods and heroes developed slowly. Thus, the cult of [[Odin]] in Norway probably spread from Western Germany not long before they were written down. Gods shown as minor gods such as [[Ullr]], the fertility god [[Njord]] and [[Heimdall]] are likely to be older gods in Norway who lost popularity. Other gods (or aesir, as they were called) worth mentioning are the thunder-god [[Thor]] and the love-goddess [[Freya]].

Most information about Scandinavian mythology is contained in the old Norse literature including Norwegian literature, the [[Eddas]] and later sagas. Other information comes from the Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] with fragments of legends preserved in old inscriptions. Unfortunately, we know relatively little about old religious practices in Norway or elsewhere as most of the knowledge was lost in the gradual Christianisation.

Due to nationalistic movements in the late 18th century, Norwegian scholars found renewed interest for Norse religion, translating many of the myths to Danish (the written language in Norway at the time) and tried to use it to create a common Norwegian culture. But Christianity was too deeply rooted in the society to accept such Paganism, and it only resulted in popularized legends. Nowadays, a revival of the Old Norse religion, called [[Åsatru]] ("Faith of the Aesir") seeks to reconstruct the pre-Christian faith practiced in the Viking Age.

==Sámi religion==
{{Main|Sami religion}}

The Sámi followed a shamanistic religion based on nature worship. The Sámi pantheon consisted of four general gods: the Mother, the Father, the Son and the Daughter (Radienacca, Radienacce, Radienkiedde and Radienneida). There was also a god of fertility, fire and thunder [[Horagalles]], the sun goddess Beive and the moon goddess [[Manno]] as well as the goddess of death Jabemeahkka.

Like many pagan religions, the Sámi saw life as a circular process of life, death and rebirth. The shaman was called a [[Noaidi]] and the traditions were passed on between families with an ageing Noaidi training a relative to take his or her place after he or she dies. Training went on as long as the Noaidi lived but the pupil had to prove his or her skills before a group of Noaidi before being eligible to become a fully fledged shaman at the death of his or her mentor.

The Norwegian church undertook a campaign to Christianise the Sámi in the 16th and 17th century with most of the sources being missionaries. While the vast majority of the Sámi in Norway have been Christianised, some of them still follow their traditional faith and some Noaidi are still practising their ancient religion. [[Sami people]] are often more religious than [[Norwegians]].

==Christianity==
{{Main|Christianity in Norway}}
[[File:Cross in Grense Jakobselv.JPG|thumb|right|240px|A cross close to the church in Grense Jakobselv, Norway]]

===From Conversion to Reformation===
The conversion of Norway to Christianity began in the 1000s. The raids on the British isles and on the Frankish kingdoms had brought the Vikings in touch with Christianity. [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon the Good of Norway]] who had grown up in England tried to introduce Christianity in the mid-10th century, but had met resistance from pagan leaders and soon abandoned the idea.

Anglo-Saxon missionaries from England and Germany had tried to convert Norwegians to Christianity but only had limited success. However, they succeeded in converting [[Olav Tryggvason|Olaf I of Norway]] to Christianity. [[Olaf II of Norway]] (later Saint Olaf) had more success in his attempts to convert the population with many Norwegians converting in the process, and he is credited with Christianizing Norway.

The Christians in Norway often established churches or other holy sites at places that had previously been sacred under the Norse religion. The spread of conversion can be measured by burial sites as Pagans were buried with [[grave goods]] while Christians were not. Christianity had become well established in Norway by the middle of the 11th century and had become dominant by the middle of the 12th century. [[Stave church]]es were built of wood without the use of nails in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christianization.hist.cam.ac.uk/regions/norway/norway-eccl-org.html ''Norway – Ecclesiastical organization'' (Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Bergen)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Reformation to Now===
{{Further|Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein}}
[[File:Christian III of Denmark.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In 1536, King [[Christian III of Denmark]] converted the Norwegians from Catholicism to Protestant [[Lutheranism]].]] 
The Norwegians were Catholic until the Danish king [[Christian III of Denmark]] ordered Denmark to convert to Lutheranism in 1536 and as Norway was then ruled by Denmark, the Norwegians converted as well. The Danish Church Ordinance was introduced in 1537 and a Norwegian Church Council officially adopted Lutheranism in 1539. Monasteries were dissolved and church property confiscated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway established and funded by the state.
Bishops still adhering to Catholicism were deposed with [[Olav, Archbishop of Nidaros]] fleeing the country in 1537 and another bishop dying in prison in 1542. Catholicism held on in remote parts of Norway for another couple of decades, although eventually the remaining Catholics converted or fled, to the [[Netherlands]] in particular. Many pastors were replaced with Danes and Norwegian clergy being trained at the [[University of Copenhagen]] as Norway did not have a university. The Danish translation of the Bible was used as were Danish catechisms and hymns. The use of Danish in religious ceremonies had a strong influence on the development of the [[Norwegian language]].

The church undertook a program to convert the Sámi in the 16th and 17th century with the program being largely successful. The [[University of Oslo]] was established in 1811 allowing priests to train in Norway. The [[Norwegian Constitution]] of 1814 did not grant [[religious freedom]] as it stated that Jews and [[Jesuits]] were denied entrance in Norway. Moreover, adherence to Evangelical Lutheran Christianity was compulsory, and so was [[church attendance]]. A ban on lay preaching was lifted in 1842, allowing several free church movements and a strong lay movement being established in the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Three years later, the so-called [[Dissenter]] Law came into effect, allowing other Christian congregations to establish in Norway. [[Atheism]] became allowed as well, and the ban on Judaism was lifted in 1851. [[Monasticism]] and Jesuits were allowed starting in 1897 and 1956 respectively.

The Norwegian Constitution was amended in 1964 allowing freedom of religion; the exceptions are the [[Norwegian royal family]], who are required by the Constitution to be Lutherans. Furthermore, at least one half of the Government must belong to the state church.  On May 21, 2012 the constitution was again amended to increase the autonomy of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and decrease the connection to the state.

Church pastors were active in the [[Norwegian resistance movement]] during World War II. The state church was also active in the moral debate which arose in the 1950s.

==Islam==
[[File:Moskesankthanshaugen.JPG|thumb|right|The world's northernmost mosque, in [[Tromsø]]]]
{{Main|Islam in Norway}}
Islam is the largest non-Christian religion in [[Norway]] with about 2.9% of the population officially (about 153,000 people in 2016) and has increased by 26.6% since 2012.&lt;ref name=stat2016other/&gt;  
In 2006, 56% lived in the counties of [[Oslo]] and [[Akershus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{no icon}} [http://www.ssb.no/emner/07/02/10/trosamf/tab-2006-12-18-02.html Medlemmer i trus-og livssynssamfunn utanfor Den norske kyrkja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218114034/http://www.ssb.no/emner/07/02/10/trosamf/tab-2006-12-18-02.html |date=18 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some sources report that the numbers are higher than those on the official records; the Pew Foundation calculates the number of Muslims in Norway for 2010 at about 144,000 and projects the numbers to reach 359,000 by 2030.&lt;ref name=Pew2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Region: Europe|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-regional-europe/#1|website=Pew Forum|publisher=PewResearch|accessdate=3 July 2014|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For 2013, Professor Leirvik of the University of Oslo estimates regarding the number of people of Muslim background though not necessarily practicing in Norway at about 220,000 including people from Pakistan, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iran, and Morocco.&lt;ref name=islamnorge&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leirvik|first1=Oddbjørn|title=Islam i Norge|url=http://folk.uio.no/leirvik/tekster/IslamiNorge.html|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of the 1990s, Islam passed the Catholic Church and [[Pentecostalism]] to become the largest minority religion in Norway (though the Catholics have regained ground since), provided Islam is seen as one united grouping, as there are different denominations in existence, such as [[Sunni]], [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadiyya]]. In 2009, the registered Muslims were members of 126 different congregations.&lt;ref name=islamnorge/&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main|Jews in Norway}}

There were never many Jews in Norway. Although there are no indications of active persecution, Jews were banned from entering and residing in the dual monarchy of [[Denmark-Norway]] for long periods of time. After the split with Denmark in 1814, the new Norwegian Constitution included a notorious paragraph that banned Jews and [[Jesuits]] from entering the realm. The paragraph, which was abolished with regard to Jews in 1851 after strong political debate, appears to have been primarily aimed at the [[Messianic Judaism|Jewish Messianic]] revival movements in Eastern Europe at the time, since the [[Sephardi]] and Western European Jews in many cases seem to have been exempted.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

[[Shechita]], Jewish kosher slaughter, has been banned in Norway since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Johansen |first= Per Ola |title= Oss selv nærmest |year= 1984 |publisher=Gyldendal Norsk Forlag |location= Oslo |language= Norwegian|isbn= 82-05-15062-1 |chapter= Korstoget mot schächtningen |page= 63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

741 Norwegian Jews were murdered during the [[Nazi occupation of Norway]] during World War II, and in 1946 there were only 559 Jews registered living in Norway.

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism in Norway}}
[[File:Hindu temple Norway.jpg|thumb|[[Hindu temple]] in [[Norway]].]]
[[Hinduism]] is a minority faith in [[Norway]]. 75% of [[Hindus]] are from [[Sri Lanka]]. There are 4 [[Hindu temples]] in Norway. The [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] is registered in Norway and [[ISKCON]] has a centre in the country.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith in Norway}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] in Norway began with contact between traveling Scandinavians with early Persian believers of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in the mid-to-late 19th century.&lt;ref name="historie"&gt;{{Cite web

There is, however, an ever ongoing political debate on [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Church of Norway#Current issues|Church of Norway, current issues]]&lt;/ref&gt; The state also supports religious aid organisations such as [[Norwegian Church Aid]] financially. Bishops are formally nominated by the Norwegian Monarch,&lt;ref&gt;"Monarch" is here the word that is used in the [[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution]]. But it is the Government that decides.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the head of the church, and clerical salaries and pensions regulated by law. Clergy train in the theological faculties of the University of Oslo and the [[University of Tromsø]], as well as Misjonshøgskolen (School of Mission and Theology) in [[Stavanger]] and Menighetsfakultetet ([[MF Norwegian School of Theology]]) in [[Oslo]]. Menighetsfakultetet is by far the most important educational institution for the Norwegian clergy. Men and women can both become members of the clergy of the church. The church has two sacraments namely [[Baptism]] and [[Holy Communion]].

In Norway as of 2016, 71.5% of the population are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as compared to 96% in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=stat2016statechurch/&gt; [[Kevin Boyle (lawyer)|Kevin Boyle]]'s 1997 global study of freedom of religion states that "Most members of the state church are not active adherents, except for the rituals of birth, confirmation, weddings, and burials. Some 3 per cent on average attend church on Sunday and 10 per cent on average attend church every month."&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report'' (Routledge, 1997), page 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religious groups operate freely and people are also free not to be affiliated with any religion or life stance.  Approximately 16.8% are not members of any official religious or philosophical communities, while about 10% of the population are members of other religious or philosophical communities outside the Church of Norway. Catholics and Muslims are each about 2.9% of the population and have been rising in numbers in recent years. About 1.8% of the population lists the [[Norwegian Humanist Association]] as a life stance instead of a religion. Orthodox, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs are present in very small numbers, together comprising about 1 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=stat2016other/&gt;

However officially belonging to a religion does not necessarily reflect actual religious beliefs and practices.  
In 2005, a survey conducted by Gallup International in sixty-five countries indicated that Norway was the least religious country in Western Europe, with 29% counting themselves as believing in a church or deity, 26% as being atheists, and 45% not being entirely certain.&lt;ref name=AFTENPOSTEN&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1226265.ece|title=Aftenposten: Vi tviler mer (17.02.06)|accessdate=23 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609113926/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1226265.ece|archivedate=9 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious education===
In 2007, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in favor of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] parents who had sued the [[Norway|Norwegian state]]. The case was about a subject in compulsory school, ''kristendomskunnskap med religions- og livssynsorientering'' (Teachings of Christianity with orientation about religion and philosophy), KRL. The applicants complained that the refusal to grant full exemption from KRL prevented them from ensuring that their children received an education in conformity with their atheist views and philosophical convictions. A few years earlier, in 2004, the UN Committee on Human Rights in [[Geneva]] had given its support to the parents. In 2008 the subject was renamed to ''Religion, livssyn og etikk'' (Religion, philosophy and ethics).&lt;ref&gt;See the Norwegian Wikipedia: [[:no:Kristendoms-, religions- og livssynskunnskap|Kristendoms-, religions- og livssynskunnskap]]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of this course is however still tied to Christianity. Philosophy and ethics are not properly introduced until after compulsory school. The largest Christian school in Norway has 1,400 pupils and 120 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danielsen-skoler.no/ Forside: Egill Danielsen Stiftelse]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kristne Friskolers Forbund'' is an interest group of approximately 130 Christian schools and colleges, including 12 Christian private schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.no/ Kristne Friskolers Forbund]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], the '''Sakadāgāmin''' ([[Pali]]; Sanskrit: ''Sakṛdāgāmin''), "returning once"&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 660, entry for "Sakadāgāmin" (retrieved 26 Sep 2007 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2653.pali).&lt;/ref&gt; or "once-returner," is a partially [[bodhi|enlightened person]], who has cut off the first three [[Fetter (Buddhism)|chain]]s with which the ordinary mind is bound, and significantly weakened the fourth and fifth. Sakadagaminship is the second stage of the [[four stages of enlightenment]].

The Sakadagamin will be reborn into the realm of the senses at most once more. If, however, he attains the next stage of enlightenment ([[Anagami]]ship) in this life, he will not come back to this world.

The three specific chains or fetters (Pali: {{IAST|saṃyojana}}) of which the Sakadagamin is free are:&lt;br&gt;
1. {{IAST|Sakkāya-diṭṭhi}} (Pali) - Belief in self&lt;br&gt;
2. Sīlabbata-parāmāsa (Pali) - Attachment to rites and rituals&lt;br&gt;
3. Vicikicchā (Pali) - Skeptical doubt&lt;br&gt;The Sakadagami also significantly weakened the chains of:&lt;br&gt;
4. Kāma-rāga (Pali) - [[Raga (Buddhism)|Sensuous craving]]&lt;br&gt;
5. Byāpāda (Pali) - Ill-will

Thus, the Sakadagamin is an intermediate stage between the [[Sotapanna]], who still has comparatively strong sensuous desire and ill-will, and the [[Anagami]], who is completely free from sensuous desire and ill-will. A Sakadagami's mind is very pure. Thoughts connected with greed, hatred and delusion do not arise often, and when they do, do not become obsessive.

'''The Template Network''' was once called the Emin Society or the Emin Foundation, and is now an international network of independent groups. As of 2014 there are some 1600 people regularly engaged within these groups worldwide in countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, England, Germany, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and the United States of America. Activities are diverse with interests including personal development, spirituality, psychology, meditation, music, dance, ecology, healing, sustainable development, evolution and health and well-being.

==Historical background==

In 1971 a small number of people began to meet with Raymond Armin (1924 - 2002) to research the core issues of life, the universe and everything. The group called their activities "The Way" and later "The Emin".

By 1974 the group had 80 members; Raymond Armin was employed full-time by the society and a centre was rented for meetings at Gospel Oak in London. By 1976 a larger place was found at Putney. By 1977 there were 700 members in the UK.

===Origins of the name===

''Emin'' is an [[Arabic]] word which means [[the faithful one]].

In 1981 a request for verification of this from the [[London Central Mosque]] produced the response that Emin is a [[Europe]]anised variation of the ''[[Arabic]]'': [[Ameen]]. The meanings attributed to the various forms of the word are: "trust", "faith", "worthy to be trusted", "truly", "reliable". It is also a form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[Amen]]'' and appears also in [[Christian]] usage with the meaning: "I concur" (used at the end of a prayer to signify that the words in the prayer are true and reliable, a statement of faith).

===Origins of the philosophy===

The Emin philosophy is the result of the work of Raymond Armin (AKA Leo), born in Camden Town, London, in 1924. As a child, Leo came to develop a deep conviction that everything that existed did so according to a core set of laws or principles; later he would call these the Natural Laws.

During the 1940s and 50's Leo married and had a family but maintained his on-going enquiry into the meaning and purpose of life. He spent much time researching in the British Museum and the British Library. In 1971 a number of young people met Leo and started meeting with him on a regular basis. They found him to have the ability to unlock perception into a huge range of subjects using a toolkit of techniques later referred to as groundwork.

Leo shared these techniques with the students and together they worked into new subjects as the topics arose during their regular meetings. To aid students in their own researches, Leo wrote papers explaining important concepts and these became known as the Emin archives. Using the natural laws, Leo was able to understand and explain even the most complicated of phenomena in a simple to grasp form - the basic premise being that natural laws are at the core of the appearance of everything.

As Leo continued to work with students, so the Emin philosophy developed and grew. The concept of universal templates developed out from the Emin philosophy and describes personal development according to 21 levels or stations.

==Philosophical content==
The Emin represents an experimental spiritual philosophy. The first premise is the fact of a human life and all that it may do. The second premise is that human life's relationship with creation.  Each individual is responsible for their own development and destiny. The Emin web site (see below) gives a good introduction to the philosophy.

===Propositions===
The philosophy contains work on many areas of life and contains many propositions that include:

* That the universe is governed by laws and is constantly evolving
* That the potential of a human lies within and can be brought out by development
* The human is not alone or arbitrary; rather, they are part of Creation and designed to integrate with that Creation.
* The very fact of being alive and conscious offers the possibility of intellectual and spiritual development, which is for any individual to take up, should they so wish.
* Each life is ultimately responsible for itself.
* Human knowledge derives in the first instance from the natural laws, and has aggregated throughout history. The continuing aggregation provides the basis for further development of the human faculty and possibility.

===Sentiment===
The idea of sentiment runs through much, if not all, of the Emin philosophy. The premise being that a person's sentiment towards anything, including themselves, will largely determine what type of relationship, dealing or interaction they might have with that thing. As an example, if a person has a good sentiment towards the planet then they will respect her and appreciate her processes and will want to help in issues that might affect her well being. And, a person's sentiment towards their partner will likewise determine the nature of that relationship. This can be extended and applied to any matter at all and is viewed as being fundamental to a person's spiritual journey especially where integration is concerned.

===The archives===
The above-mentioned subjects comprise what is often referred to as the Emin archives. Other components include writings on psychology and personal development, theology, history, meditation and various practical personal development exercises and so on.

===Comparison to other philosophies===

The philosophy was developed from original research - although certain elements of the philosophy have similarity to those found in [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Shinto]], the works of [[Gurdjieff]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and other [[eastern philosophy|eastern]] and [[western philosophy|western]] philosophy and [[theology]].

A number of the early archives (from the 1970s) borrow and develop concepts from Gurdjieff's work, and these include: The ''[[Ray of Creation]]'', the ''[[Five Centres]]'', '' [[Essence]] &amp; [[Personality]] '', [[Knowledge]], [[Understanding]] &amp; [[Being]], [[Body Types]], The Three Brains, States of [[Consciousness]], [[Plane (cosmology)|Level]]s of [[existence]], [[Cosmology]] and [[The Laws (Fourth Way)|Laws]].

==Practices==
Exercises include mental and physical conditioning, reasoning, meditation and contemplation. They are designed to regulate and develop the different functional levels of the human system. Many exercises are designed to promote understanding of oneself and of others; and then there are exercises of a more fun nature designed to release stress.

An ingredient of the Emin way is to seek understanding in order to change the conduct of one's life to come into greater harmony with the higher, spiritual, self. There is, however, no ideal of ascetism or otherworldliness in the Emin – spirituality is to be realised ''through'' rather than ''at the cost of'' ordinary, human life in the world.

==Criticism==
In 1980 the Emin was the subject of a series of lampoons in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. There was a follow-on article in the ''[[Daily Express]]''.

Anti-cult groups have called the society [[Secrecy|secretive]], and have complained that Emin archives are uninformative. The society responds that Emin archives are the product of philosophical and scientific studies and often occur in a graduated fashion from simple to more advanced so that the concepts are easier to grasp and the reader is not overwhelmed. The organisation explains that the practise of quoting subsections of text out of their original context does not lend to easy understanding by the casual observer. They say that complex language is sometimes required to cover abstract and difficult-to-master concepts although wherever possible, people try to keep it simple.

The '''Temples of the Beqaa Valley''' are a number of [[shrine]]s and [[Roman temple]]s that are dispersed around the [[Beqaa Valley]] in [[Lebanon]]. The most important and famous are those in [[Heliopolis of Phoenicia|Roman Heliopolis]]. A few temples are built on former buildings of the Phoenician &amp; Hellenistic era, but all are considered to be of Roman construction and were started to be abandoned after the fourth century with the fall of the Roman [[Paganism]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=Aliquot, Julien., Sanctuaries and villages on Mount Hermon in the Roman period in The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=17 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==	
[[File:Temple of Venus, Baalbek, 1891.jpg|thumb|200px|The Basilica of Constantine in 1891 at Heliopolis, formed over the ruins of the Temple of Venus]]
During the early first century BC the territory of the Beqaa valley became jointly controlled by the cities of [[Damascus]], [[Sidon]] and [[Paneas]], that were conquered by the Romans in 64 BC.
 	
It is thought that the area was inhabited continuously until the third century AD. Although the sites may have been built on previous layers of architecture, the current temples are predominantly considered to be of Roman construction and were largely abandoned after the fourth century AD during the [[Byzantine]] era.
 	
In the first century the Temples started to be built by the Romans, using the nearby quarries with famous "[[List of ancient architectural records#Monoliths|"Monoliths"]]. The [[Temple of Jupiter (Roman Heliopolis)|Temple of Jupiter]] in Heliopolis (in a complex area called even ''Sanctuary of Heliopolitan Zeus'') was the biggest pagan temple in the classical world. The presence of a huge quarry was one of the reasons for the Roman decision to create a huge "Great Court" of a big pagan temple complex in this mountain site, located at nearly 1100 meters of altitude and on the eastern [[Borders of the Roman Empire]]: it took three centuries to create this colossal [[Roman paganism]]'s temple complex.
 	
With [[Constantine the Great]] Christianity was declared officially the religion of the Roman empire and the pagan Temples started to be neglected. Later the Bizantines used some materials from the abandoned Temples.

==Surveys==

Documentation of the temples in the Beqaa Valley area began in the 19th century, with surveys by [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] in 1852 CE and [[Sir Charles Warren]].&lt;ref name="Robinson1856"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robinson|title=Biblical researches in Palestine and the adjacent regions: a journal of travels in the years 1838 and 1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9y3QCMvh48C&amp;pg=PA433|accessdate=17 September 2012|year=1856|publisher=J.

Chouf et du sud de la Béqa,” Mélanges de l'université Saint Joseph 43, pp. 233-50, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; George F. Taylor provided a pictorial guide in the late 1960s with more recent information coming from Shim'on Dar in 1993 and [[epigraphic]] surveys in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide. Les temples romains au Liban; guide illustré|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ii8NAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 October 2012|year=1971|publisher=Dar el-Machreq Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seleucid]]s occupied the area after 200 BCE, shortly after which the [[Ituraean]]s developed a principality in the area until the fall of [[Chalcis]] when the territory passed to the [[Herodian]] kings [[Agrippa I]] and [[Agrippa II]]. After the end of the first century CE the territory became jointly controlled by the cities of [[Damascus]], [[Sidon]] and [[Paneas]]. It is thought that the area was inhabited continuously until the third century CE. Although the sites may have been built on previous layers of architecture, the current temples are predominantly considered to be of Roman construction and were largely abandoned after the fourth century CE during the [[Byzantine]] era.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

The temples were often connected with ancient occupational sites. Olivier Callot and Pierre-Louis Gatier argued that several of the temple sites might have been mistaken for monumental [[tomb]]s as Roman [[mausoleum]]s such as [[Saidnaya]] have been found in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Callot, Olivier, and Pierre-Louis Gatier. "Le reseau des sanctuaires en Syrie du Nord." Topoi 9, pp. 665-688, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor held the view that the religious architecture was the responsibility of "the hand of a single master builder" but was not able to answer the question of why so many shrines should be concentrated in the area.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; [[Henry Seyrig]], when reviewing Krencker and Zscheitzmann's "Romische Tempel in Syrien" highlighted that ''"the clue to an important social and economic change that would deserve to be one day the focus of a study"''. There is still a deplorable lack of a comprehensive study into the [[history]], [[archaeology]],  [[architecture]] of these buildings and ancient sites, or the religious life of the people who used them.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

==Temple types==

The [[typology (archaeology)|typology]] of the temples has been studied and they are generally divided into [[Antae temple|Antae]], [[Prostyle|Prostylos]] or [[Peripteral]] types. Antae temples have side walls that extend to form a [[porch]] at the front or rear (or both) and terminated in [[pilaster]]s that were called the ''antae''.&lt;ref name="(sir)antiq1833"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Ellis (sir)|author2=British museum dept. of Gr. and Rom. antiq|title=The British museum. Elgin and Phigaleian marbles (by Sir. H. Ellis)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKNbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=25 October 2012|year=1833|publisher=Charles Knight|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt; If columns were placed in advance of the walls or antae, the temple was termed Prostylos and if columns surrounded the temple it was termed Peripteral. The peripteral type is thought to be the most perfect form of temple and the best preserved of this type is the [[Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1971" /&gt;&lt;ref name="(sir)antiq1833"/&gt;

==Worship==
It was the opinion of [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] that [[worship]] was not conducted within the temples, but rather outside it.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; The temple was the domain of the [[priests]] where they venerated a [[cult statue]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; Worshippers gathered around the temple at ceremonial times and hence there was no need for divisions within it, such as the [[aisle]]s of modern [[Church (building)|church]]es.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; The cult images, along with temples themselves would often be aligned so that the [[sun]] would illuminate them at certain times of day and year.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; George F. Taylor was of the opinion that a [[sacrifice]] would be made when certain areas of the temple became illuminated.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; He suggested that a "[[Ministry (government department)|Minister of Works]]" may have been responsible for local [[civil engineering]] in [[Ancient Roman]] times.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971" /&gt;

==Temple groups==

George F. Taylor divided up the [[Archaeology of Lebanon|Temples of Lebanon]] into three groups, one covering the Beqaa valley north of the road from [[Beirut]] to [[Damascus]]. Secondly a group to the south, including the [[Wadi al-Taym]] known as [[Temples of Mount Hermon]]. Thirdly a group in the area west of a line drawn along the ridge of [[Mount Lebanon]] that includes [[Makam Er-Rab]], [[Sfire]], [[Kasr Naous]], [[Amyioun]], [[Bziza]], [[Batroun]], [[Edde, Lebanon|Edde]], [[Mashnaqa]], [[Yanuh]], [[Afka]], [[Kalaat Fakra]], [[Kalaa]], [[Sarba]], [[Antoura]], [[Deir el-Kalaa]], [[Shheem]] and the coastal plains of [[Beirut]], [[Byblos]], [[Sidon]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. The Temples of the Beqaa Valley in Taylor's first group included [[El-Lebwe]], [[Yammoune]], [[Qasr el Banat, Lebanon|Qasr Banat]], [[Iaat]], [[Nahle, Lebanon|Nahle]], [[Baalbek]], [[Hadet]], [[Kasr Neba]], [[Temnin el-Foka]], [[Nebi Ham]], [[Saraain El Faouqa]], [[Niha Bekaa|Niha]], [[Hosn Niha]], [[Fourzol]] and [[Kafr Zebad]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt;

'''Umū dabrūtu''', inscribed ''u''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''-mi da-ab-ru-ti'' and meaning "Violent Storms" (lit. "fierce day"&lt;ref&gt;''dabru'', CAD D, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n mythical beast, demon or species of creature and one of the eleven monsters created by [[Tiamat|Tiāmat]] in her conflict with the younger gods in the Epic of Creation, [[Enûma Eliš]]. Its form is unknown but was probably a composite beast like its companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts | author = F. A. M. Wiggermann | publisher = Styx Publications | year = 1992 | page = 169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

The Enûma Eliš relates that the Umū dabrūtu and its companions "bore cruel weapons, without fear of the fight". Their demise, however, was complete as [[Marduk]] is said to have overcome them and "broke their weapons and bound them (the creatures) to his feet".&lt;ref&gt;The ''enūma eliš'' at [http://www.etana.org/node/581 eTACT]&lt;/ref&gt; His transformation of them into benevolent apotropaic symbols to guard the gate of the Apsû, provides a precedent which would be imitated on the doorways of temples, palaces and homes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12926">'''Vilhelm Peter Grønbech''' (14 June 1873 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1948) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] cultural historian. He was professor of the history of religion at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and also had a great influence on Danish intellectual life, especially during and after World War II.

==Life and career==
Grønbech was born in [[Allinge]], on [[Bornholm]]. His family moved to Copenhagen and beginning in 1890 he studied [[philology]] at the University of Copenhagen (Danish with Latin and English as secondary subjects),&lt;ref name=BioLex&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Historie/Religionshistoriker/Vilh._Gr%C3%B8nbech "Vilhelm Grønbech"], ''[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]'', retrieved 10 October 2014 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]] and as a schoolteacher. In 1902 he received his doctorate for a study of the historical phonetics of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], after which he began teaching at the university, first as a [[docent]] and then from 1908 to 1911 as a lecturer in English literature, while also working as a church organist. He published a book of poems and a study of the dialect of [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell11&gt;P. M. Mitchell, ''Vilhelm Grønbech'', Twayne's World Authors Series 397, Boston: Hall-Twayne, 1978, {{ISBN|9780805763065}}, Chronology p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 the first volume of his work on [[Germanic paganism]], ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'' (English title ''The Culture of the Teutons'') was published, and in 1911 he became a docent in the history of religion. After the appearance of the remaining three volumes of ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'' in 1912 and of a related essay, "Religionsskiftet i Norden" on the [[christianization of Scandinavia|conversion of Scandinavia]] (1913), the [[University of Leipzig]] sought in 1914 to award him a professorship and in 1915 he was appointed professor of the history of religion at Copenhagen, a position which he held until 1943.&lt;ref name=SD&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Religion_og_mystik/Religionshistorikere/Vilhelm_Gr%C3%B8nbech "Vilhelm Grønbech"], ''[[Den Store Danske]]'', retrieved 8 October 2014 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell11/&gt; Early in his career he also taught at the state college of education and from 1918 to 1920 headed the Danish Society for Psychic Research.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; 

During the [[German occupation of Denmark]] in World War II, Grønbech's lectures drew large audiences, and after the war he founded the periodical ''[[Frie Ord]]'' with the theologian [[Hal Koch]]. It ran from 1946 to 1948, with Grønbech the primary contributor, and was rapidly successful, with 6,000 subscribers within a few months of its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 129&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his articles published there were republished in posthumous collections; a 1943 lecture series at [[Borup's College]] in [[Copenhagen]] was published from shorthand transcriptions as ''Lyset fra Akropolis'' (The Light from the Acropolis, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 115, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech was nominated for the [[Nobel prize in literature]] eleven times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3689 Nomination Database], Nobel Prize, retrieved 24 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year of his retirement, Allinge awarded him honorary citizenship and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] awarded him a free residence at Lundehave in [[Helsingør]]; he died in Helsingør in 1948.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;

Grønbech was married twice, in 1900 to Pauline Ramm, who died in 1946, and in August 1947 to [[Honorine Hermelin|Honorine Louise Hermelin]], [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the Swedish [[folk high school]] for women at Fogelstad in Sweden. His son Kaare Grønbech, born in 1901, was a specialist in Asian languages.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; Grønbech ordered his papers destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Royal Library has a large archive.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;&lt;ref name=revival&gt;Brigitte Larsen, [http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kultur/gr%C3%B8nbech-i-understr%C3%B8mmen "Grønbech i understrømmen"], ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'', 24 April 2002 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and views==
Although trained as a philologist, Grønbech's focus from his earliest major work, ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'', was on analysing key terms in order to apprehend the essence of a religion and hence of a culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 16&amp;ndash;17, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He later applied the same method to the study of Greek, medieval, and Indian mystics (''Mystikere i Europa og Indien'', 4 volumes, 1925, 1932, 1934, with the last volume being on 19th-century poets) and two studies of Greece and Hellenistic Rome, ''Hellenismen'' (1940; 2 volumes published, a projected third not completed) and ''Hellas'' (4 volumes, 1942, 1944, 1945). He was unusually capable of immersing himself in the system of thought he wished to depict,&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; such that in the words of his English-language biographer he could "write about [it] as if he accepted its theses and principles", and "it is not possible to circumscribe accurately what his own religious&amp;mdash;not to mention political&amp;mdash;convictions must have been."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=19threview&gt;[[Basil Willey]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3720701 Review of ''Religious Currents in the 19th Century'' by Vilhelm Grønbech; translated by P. M. Mitchell, W. D. Paden], ''[[The Modern Language Review]]'' 60.3 (July 1965) 438&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The admission of multiple realities (but only one actuality) is a [[leitmotiv]] in his work,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 112&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; and he gave his second collection of poems, published in 1941, the title ''Solen har mange veje'' (The Sun Has Many Paths).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Chronology, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with a much reprinted 1915 essay, "Primitiv Religion", he took a then revolutionary position with respect to "primitive" thought, rejecting the evolutionary hypothesis underlying works such as [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Christian Aarslev, [http://www.religion.dk/viden/professoren-der-ville-g%C3%B8re-op-med-evolutionisme-i-religionsforskning "Professoren, der ville gøre op med evolutionisme i religionsforskning"], ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', 27 December 2011 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead holding that so-called 'primitive' religion is as complex as modern religion, differing from it in the direct relationship between 'primitive' people and their world; he argued that to label a culture 'primitive' said less about them than about "our own astonishment that people can be different from us".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; This openness combined with his heavy use of paraphrase can make it hard to distinguish his own position from those of the thinkers he is depicting, for example in his presentation of [[Empedocles]]' thought in ''Hellas'', Volume 4.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech did have a fundamental belief in the importance of "harmony", which he saw as the permeation of life by religion,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 35, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically as society constituting a "community of believers".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed emphasis on the individual as destructive to this and therefore criticised [[Kierkegaard]] in several of his works, once characterising him as "the last offshoot of medieval mysticism and its selfish concerns and the scholasticism which was identified with it".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 121, citing an essay on Kierkegaard and [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] reprinted in ''Kampen om Mennesket'' (1930), p.&amp;nbsp;190.&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of [[Goethe]], on whom he wrote a two-volume book (1935, 1939), because while seeking harmony, he did not appreciate the need for a community of believers.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast he appears to have felt a kinship with [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and was ahead of literary fashion in his appreciation of both [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[William Blake|Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 76, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general Grønbech was suspicious of mystics as he regarded the mystical experience as inherently selfish; he reached this conclusion after an early mystical experience of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; He made exceptions for, for example, [[Wordsworth]], whom he regarded as a mystic who had achieved harmony;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 44, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; in an entire volume of his work on mystics devoted to [[Teresa of Ávila|St Teresa]], he writes about her with "ironic humo[u]r" but characterises her as having "undermined the authority she was appealing to", contributing to the revolution in thought that "drew the human being out of his church's commonality".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view as set out in his second major work, ''Religiøse strømninger i det nittende aarhundrede'' (Religious Currents of the Nineteenth Century, 1922; translated edition ''Religious Currents in the 19th Century'', 1964&lt;ref name=19threview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompsonreview&gt;[[Lawrence S. Thompson]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27714919 Review of ''Religious Currents in the Nineteenth Century'' by Vilhelm Grønbech, translated P. M. Mitchell, W. D. Paden], ''[[The Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]'' 65.3 (July 1966) 574&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref name=Mitchell11/&gt; that revolution that ushered in the modern age of crisis in Western religion began not in the Sixteenth Century with the [[Protestant Reformation]] but around 1770 with the development of [[Romanticism]],&lt;ref name=Thompsonreview/&gt; and the [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]ian theory of evolution restored faith in a universe of laws and was the basis for a new religious harmony.&lt;ref name=19threview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He also regarded the book as a vital means of uniting modern people in shared experience, "lift[ing] modern man out of his lonely imprisonment".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech's book on Hellenism was an outgrowth of his work on a three-volume analysis of early Christianity, ''Jesus, menneskesønnen'' (Jesus, the Son of Man, 1935), ''Paulus'' (St Paul, 1940) and ''Kristus'' (Christ, 1941). He interpreted Jesus as "an agitator in the world of the spirit" who attempted to create the Kingdom of God on earth; the first book, ''Jesus'', is more simply written than other works of his and provoked negative responses, but became his most-read book.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 82&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer of ''Jesus'' noted that a theme of Grønbech's, which he saw in Jesus, was the commandment to simply live, rather than to analyse morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Bachmann, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40077612 Review of ''Jesus: Menneskessønnen'' by Vilhelm Grønbech], ''[[Books Abroad]]'' 10.4 (Autumn 1936) 425&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two volumes, and the work on Hellenism, appeared only after Denmark was under occupation, and his treatment of Hellenistic Rome can often be read as applicable to his own period.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Grønbech's ideas were influential in Denmark, and reached a broad popular audience.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 21, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings and in particular ''Frie Ord'' have often been said to have been the impetus for the establishment of ''[[Heretica]]'', an influential literary journal published from 1948 to 1953;&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; the third issue contains three articles written in tribute to him following his death, of which that by the poet and co-editor [[Thorkild Bjørnvig]] is titled "The Heretic".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 14, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Grønbech Society was formed in Copenhagen in 1994.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;&lt;ref name=revival/&gt;

== Biography ==
Visser 't Hooft was born in [[Haarlem]], in the [[Netherlands]] and in his early adult years, was involved in Dutch student Christian movement and soon became involved internationally. In 1925, while on his first trip to the United States with [[John R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6810">'''Wormwood''' (ἀψίνθιον ''apsinthion'' or ἄψινθος ''apsinthos'' in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) is a [[star]] or [[angel]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R., Oliver, Evelyn Dorothy (1996), ''Angels A to Z'', entry: "Wormwood", p. 417, Visible Ink Press&lt;/ref&gt; that appears in the [[Book of Revelation]].

==Old Testament==
Wormwood is mentioned seven times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], always with the implication of bitterness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2.odu.edu/~lmusselm/plant/bible/wormwood.php |title=Wormwood |last1=Musselman |first1=Lytton John  |date= 12 April 2007|website=Plant Site: Bible Plants |publisher=Old Dominion University |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''wormwood'' appears several times in the [[Old Testament]], translated from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term  לענה (''la'anah'', which means "[[curse]]" in Hebrew).

==New Testament==
''Wormwood'' is only mentioned once in the [[Book of Revelation]]: Revelation 8 verse 10. "The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water— the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter." ({{bibleref2|Rev|8:10–11}})

The Greek word is believed to refer to a plant of the genus [[Artemisia (genus)|''Artemisia'']], used metaphorically to mean something with a bitter taste.&lt;ref name="danker"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Danker |first=Frederick W |author-link=Frederick William Danker |encyclopedia=A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, Third Edition |title=ἀψίνθιον |date=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-03933-1 |pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English rendering "wormwood" refers to the dark green oil produced by the plant, which was used to kill intestinal worms.&lt;ref name="danker" /&gt;  In the [[Book of Revelation]], it refers to the water being turned into wormwood, i.e. made bitter.&lt;ref name="danker" /&gt;

==Interpretations==
Certain commentators have held that this "great star" represents one of several important figures in political or ecclesiastical history,&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Matthew, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc6.xxvii.ix.html ''Commentary on the Whole Bible Volume VI (Acts to Revelation)'': Revelation Chap. VIII] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504110830/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc6.xxvii.ix.html |date=2007-05-04 }}, Public domain, Library of Congress call no: BS490.H4, at [http://www.ccel.org/ Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  while other Bible dictionaries and commentaries view the term as a reference to a celestial being. ''A Dictionary of The Holy Bible'' states, "the star called Wormwood seems to denote a mighty prince, or power of the air, the instrument, in its fall."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, W. W. (1859), ''A Dictionary of the Holy Bible: for general use in the study of the scriptures; with engravings, maps, and tables'', [https://archive.org/details/dictionholybible00randrich Entry: '''WORM WOOD'''] at [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historicist===
Various religious groups and figures, including [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and the theologians [[Matthew Henry]] and [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]],&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;Gill, John, ''Exposition of the Entire Bible'', [http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GillsExpositionoftheBible/gil.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=008&amp;verse=010&amp;next=011&amp;prev=009 Revelation 8:10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030170507/http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GillsExpositionoftheBible/gil.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=008&amp;verse=010&amp;next=011&amp;prev=009 |date=2006-10-30 }} at [http://bible.crosswalk.com/ bible.crosswalk.com]&lt;/ref&gt; regard the verses of Revelation 8 as symbolic references to past events in human history.  In the case of Wormwood, some [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|historicist]] interpreters believe that this figure represents the army of the [[Huns]] as led by king [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], pointing to chronological consistencies between the timeline of prophecy they have accepted and the history of the Huns' campaign in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichol, Francis D (1957), ''The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary'', Volume 7, Revelation, p. 789, Review and Herald Publishing Association, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others point to [[Arius]], the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], [[Origen]] or the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[monasticism|monk]] [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]], who denied the doctrine of [[Original sin]].&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt;

===Alternative interpretations===
A number of Bible scholars consider the term ''Wormwood'' to be a purely symbolic representation of the bitterness that will fill the earth during troubled times, noting that the [[Absinth Wormwood|plant]] for which Wormwood is named, ''[[Artemisia absinthium]]'', or [[Mugwort]], ''[[Artemisia vulgaris]]'', is a known Biblical metaphor for things that are unpalatably bitter.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. W. (1891), ''The People's New Testament'', [http://www.ccel.org/j/johnson_bw/pnt/PNT27-08.HTM The Revelation of John, Chapter VIII: The Seventh Seal Opened] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125704/http://www.ccel.org/j/johnson_bw/pnt/PNT27-08.HTM |date=2007-02-03 }} at the [http://www.ccel.org Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GenevaStudyBible/gen.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=008 Revelation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230941/http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GenevaStudyBible/gen.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=008 |date=2007-09-26 }} in the ''Geneva Study Bible'' (1599) at [http://bible.crosswalk.com bible.crosswalk.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ukrainian language]] word for "wormwood" is чорнобиль or "chornobyl", the Ukrainian name of the town of [[Chernobyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wormwood in Ukrainian - English-Ukrainian Dictionary - Glosbe|url=https://en.glosbe.com/en/uk/wormwood|website=Glosbe|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mugwort is Wormwood is Artemesia|url=http://www.flavorandfortune.com/dataaccess/article.php?ID=831|website=www.flavorandfortune.com|accessdate=24 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mugwort Herb Uses, Side Effects and Benefits|url=https://www.herbal-supplement-resource.com/mugwort-herb.html|website=The Herbal Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;
