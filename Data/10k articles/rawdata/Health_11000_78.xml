{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}In 2009, a nine-year-old Brazilian girl became pregnant with twins. The girl's mother obtained an [[abortion]] for the girl and, afterward, Archbishop [[José Cardoso Sobrinho|José Sobrinho]] said that automatic [[excommunication]] applied to the girl's mother and to the doctors who performed the abortion, prompting national and international criticism. In response, the [[National Conference of Bishops of Brazil]] declared that no one was excommunicated in the case, and in an article published on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' a Vatican bioethicist rebuked the archbishop for his public statement.

==Law==
;Civil law
[[Abortion in Brazil|Abortion is legal under Brazilian law]] in cases of [[Pregnancy from rape|pregnancies resulting from rape]] or in which giving birth would [[Maternal death|endanger the mother's life]].&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news |last=Grudgings |first=Stuart|title=Brazil attacks church opposition to girl's abortion|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/05/us-brazil-abortion-idUSTRE5247DU20090305|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7926694.stm |publisher=BBC |first=Gary |last=Duffy |title=Rape row sparks excommunications |date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brazil2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2009/03/07/catholic-abortion.html|title=Vatican backs excommunication of Brazilian MDs over child's abortion|date=7 March 2008|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Canon law
The [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]] says that automatic excommunication is imposed on "a person who procures a completed abortion" ([[Canon 1398]]), but not if, for instance, the act was done "by a person who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1323 §4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The abortion==
Doctors in [[Recife]] performed an abortion on a nine-year-old girl on 4 March. They judged her life to be at risk because of her age and because she was pregnant with twins and weighed 80 pounds. According to Fatima Maia, the director of the hospital CISAM, if the pregnancy continued, the child could suffer a [[uterine rupture|ruptured uterus]] and [[gynecologic hemorrhage|hemorrhage]], and she also ran the risk of [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[eclampsia]] and [[infertility|lifelong sterility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,equipe-medica-excomungada-diz-que-nao-esta-arrependida,334543,0.htm “Equipe médica excomungada diz que não está arrependida”Estadão, 06 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; She had allegedly been raped by her stepfather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1883598,00.html Nine-Year-Old's Abortion Outrages Brazil's Catholic Church], ''Time'', Mar. 06, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sobrinho's view and actions ==
As well as expressly denying that he had excommunicated anyone, but had only said that excommunication had been automatically incurred,&lt;ref&gt;[https://expresso.sapo.pt/menina-violada-abortou-e-a-mae-foi-excomungada-toda-a-polemica=f502990 ''Expresso'',"Menina violada abortou e a mãe foi excomungada: Toda a polémica", 14 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.cancaonova.com/bispo-esclarece-que-aborto-e-causa-de-excomunhao-automatica/ "Bispo esclarece que aborto é causa de excomunhão automática" (interview granted to ''Canção Nova''", 5 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainhamaria.com.br/Pagina/6529/Arcebispo-nao-dei-excomunhao-a-lei-da-Igreja-pune-quem-faz-aborto/imprimir=true "Arcebispo: não dei excomunhão; a lei da Igreja pune quem faz aborto" (interview granted to ''Terra Magazine''}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quadrante.com.br/artigos_detalhes.asp?id=289&amp;cat=4&amp;pagina=1 |title=Francisco Faus, "A menina, o aborto e a excomunhão" |access-date=16 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222141248/http://www.quadrante.com.br/artigos_detalhes.asp?id=289&amp;cat=4&amp;pagina=1 |archive-date=22 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobrinho said that "the law of God is higher than any human laws. When a human law—that is, a law enacted by human legislators—is against the law of God, that law has no value. The adults who approved, who carried out this abortion have incurred excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/03/05/brazil-church-excommunicates-mom-doctors-after-raped-year-old-has-abortion/ |agency=AP |date=5 March 2009|title=Brazil Church Excommunicates Mom, Doctors After Raped 9-Year-Old Has Abortion |accessdate= 13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, he added: "They took the life of an innocent. Abortion is much more serious than killing an adult. An adult may or may not be an innocent, but an unborn child is most definitely innocent. Taking that life cannot be ignored."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1883598,00.html |title=Nine-Year-Old's Abortion Outrages Brazil's Catholic Church |first=Andrew |last=Downie |date=6 March 2009|newspaper=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobrinho explained that the rapist stepfather was not excommunicated because abortion, the taking of an innocent life, is even worse than rape. The girl was not excommunicated, because minors are exempt from excommunication.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/03/11/brazil.rape.abortion/ |publisher=CNN |title=Excommunicated doctor hailed for abortion on child rape victim |date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Sobrinho and his diocese also tried to prevent the abortion by approaching the child's parents, the State Governor and the hospital where she was first admitted, after which it put off the abortion indefinitely. His lawyers then issued legal threats against the second hospital where the abortion finally took place. &lt;ref&gt;Muriel Fraser, [http://digital.graphcompubs.com/publication/?i=198105&amp;p=44 "An Abortion in Brazil: The Case That Saved a Life and Divided the Vatican"], Conscience XXXV - No.1, 2014 - Catholics for Choice &lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2015}}

== Government reaction ==
President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], a Catholic, criticized what he called the "conservative attitude" of the Archbishop in a case where the doctors were trying to save the girl's life, adding: "In this case, the medical profession was more right than the Church."&lt;ref name=Brazil2/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lula 'rues' Church abortion move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7929712.stm|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Health Minister [[José Gomes Temporão]] described what he called the Catholic Church's position as "extreme, radical and inadequate".&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; Temporão, who had frequently clashed with the Church on questions such as abortion and state distribution of free condoms,&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; called on the participants in a national convention on women's health to acknowledge the "brilliant" work done by the medical team who performed the abortion.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DP&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.old.diariodepernambuco.com.br/vidaurbana/nota.asp?materia=20090309190626 |title=Médico responsável por aborto de menina é aplaudido em Brasília |date=9 March 2009|publisher=Diario de Pernambuco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Church hierarchy's view ==
===National Conference of Bishops of Brazil===
The National Conference of Bishops of Brazil repudiated Sobrinho's initiative.&lt;ref name=ESP&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,cnbb-desautoriza-iniciativa-de-bispo,338133,0.htm |title=CNBB desautoriza iniciativa de bispo |first=Luciana |last=Nunes Leal |date=13 March 2009 |work=O Estadão de S.Paulo |accessdate=13 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223153757/http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso%2Ccnbb-desautoriza-iniciativa-de-bispo%2C338133%2C0.htm |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference, Bishop [[Dimas Lara Barbosa]], Secretary General of the Conference, said that the girl's mother was not excommunicated, since she had acted under pressure to save her daughter's life, and that there were no grounds to declare the doctors excommunicated, because (automatic) excommunication depended on each one's degree of awareness and only those who were "aware and contumacious" were excommunicated.&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Globo/&gt; At the press conference, a document on excommunication written by canonist Enrique Pérez Pujol, who stressed that the penalty should not be applied amid a polemic, was distributed to journalists.&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt;

[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mariana|Archbishop Geraldo Lyrio Rocha]], President of the Conference, avoided answering a question whether Sobrinho had acted hastily in saying that automatic excommunication had occurred. He said that "at no time did he want to hurt someone who was already hurting, but only wished to draw attention to the gravity of the deed of abortion in the face of a certain permissiveness regarding the life of the unborn". He said that Sobrinho had excommunicated no one, but had pointed out that abortion entails the possibility of excommunication, which is a measure intended to make not only an individual but the whole Church community take note of the gravity of the deed. As for the rapist, he said that a rapist "is outside of communion" and "in grave [[mortal sin]]", even though rape is not listed among the crimes that give rise to automatic excommunication. He said: "Rape is something so repugnant that the Church does not need to call attention to it. It is punished by the state justice system, which does not punish abortion so much." He said that talk of excommunication seemed to have made people forget the crime of the rapist, who needed to be punished.&lt;ref name=ESP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Globo&gt;{{cite news |last= Bresciani|first=Eduardo|title=Para CNBB, ninguém foi excomungado em caso de aborto de menina de 9 anos |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1040654-5598,00-PARA+CNBB+NINGUEM+FOI+EXCOMUNGADO+EM+CASO+DE+ABORTO+DE+MENINA+DE+ANOS.html |accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=O Globo |date=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rino Fisichella===
The Holy See's non-official newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', published a front-page article on 15 March by Archbishop [[Rino Fisichella]], President of the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]], that was highly critical of Sobrinho's action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Top Vatican ethicist says abortion saved life of nine-year-old rape victim |date=21 April 2009|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2009-04/top-vatican-ethicist-says-abortion-saved-life-nine-year-old-rape-victim|work=The Christian Century |accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisichella said that excommunication was automatic, so that focusing on it rather than on helping and supporting the child victim showed a lack of compassion that detracted from the credibility of the Church's anti-abortion teaching.&lt;ref name="obrien"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Church and Abortion: A Catholic Dissent |first=George Dennis |last=O'Brien |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYBUE1ZZNA4C&amp;pg=PA86 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mines"&gt;{{Cite news |work=L'Espresso |url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1337637?eng=y |date=23 March 2009|title=Drifting Mines. In Africa the Condom, in Brazil Abortion}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reiterating the church's condemnation of abortion, he wrote that the moral situation was difficult because of the girl's young age and the risk to her life and praised those who "allowed [her] to live and will help [her] to recover hope and trust".&lt;ref name="mines"/&gt; He wrote: "The conscience of the physician finds itself alone when forced to decide the best thing to do. A choice like that of having to save a life, knowing that one puts a second at serious risk, never comes easily."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|title=Vatican Official Defends Child's Abortion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/20/AR2009032002415.html |first=Francis X.|last=Rocca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] responded to press coverage of Fisichella's article calling it manipulation and exploitation. It issued a clarification that the article did not signal a change of doctrine and said that "the Church's teaching on procured abortion has not changed, nor can it change".&lt;ref name="obrien"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDF&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20090711_aborto-procurato_en.html Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, "Clarification on procured abortion"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1339277?eng=y The Holy Office Teaches Archbishop Fisichella a Lesson]&lt;/ref&gt; The clergy of the Archdiocese of Olinda and Recife took issue with Fisichella, stating that the local Church had been supportive of the girl and her mother.&lt;ref name="mines"/&gt; The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ruled that Sobrinho had acted "with all pastoral solicitude".&lt;ref name="obrien"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDF/&gt; The members of the Academy gave Fisichella a vote of no confidence because of his article, and he was reassigned in the next year to the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/vatican-academy-mulls-how-pro-life-pro-life-enough |first=John L. |last=Allen Jr. |title=Vatican academy mulls how pro-life is pro-life enough |date=30 May 2012|work=National Catholic Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Cardinal [[Giovanni Battista Re]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] and President of the [[Pontifical Commission for Latin America]], deplored what he called an attack on the Church in Brazil: "It is a sad case, but the real problem is that the twins conceived were two innocent persons, who had the right to live and could not be eliminated. Life must always be protected. The attack on the Brazilian church is unjustified." He added that excommunication of those who performed the abortion was just.&lt;ref name=Brazil2/&gt;

[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gap|Bishop Jean-Michel di Falco]] of [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap, France]], criticized what he saw as the un-Christlike nature of Sobrinho's statement. He said that bishops should act as pastors rather than executioners. As had the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, he denied the applicability of Canon 1398 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] to the girl's mother, because such an automatic excommunication does not apply to someone who acts out of grave fear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-20441?l=french Mgr di FALCO, évêque de Gap, sur l'excommunication au Brésil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316160505/http://www.zenit.org/article-20441?l=french |date=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other reactions ==
On 9 March 2009, Health Minister [[José Gomes Temporão|Temporão]] interrupted the opening ceremony of a national medical convention on women's health in Brasília in order to compliment Dr. Olímpio Moraes, one of the doctors who carried out the abortion and who was in attendance. Participants gave Moraes a standing ovation.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DP/&gt;

Moraes expressed gratitude to Sobrinho for the excommunication, which, he said, had drawn attention to Brazil's restrictive abortion laws. Another of the doctors involved said that he will continue attending [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], "praying, conversing with God, and asking him to illuminate me and my colleagues in our medical team to help us take care of people in similar cases."&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

The United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], in its January 2014 assessment of the [[Concluding observations on the second periodic report of the Holy See|Holy See's compliance]] with the U.N. [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], cited this Brazil case. It "urge[d] the Holy See to review its position on abortion which places obvious risks on the life and health of pregnant girls and to amend Canon 1398 relating to abortion with a view to identifying circumstances under which access to abortion services can be permitted."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights: [http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2FC%2FVAT%2FCO%2F2&amp;Lang=en Concluding observations on the second periodic report of the Holy See, 31 January 2014], retrieved 8 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1172">'''Anaerobic membrane bioreactor''' or '''AnMBR''' is the name of a technology utilized in [[wastewater treatment]]. AnMBR works by using a [[membrane bioreactor]] (MBR). The sewage is filtered and separated leaving the effluent and sludge apart. This sludge is treated anaerobically by [[mesophilic]] bacteria which release methane as a byproduct. The [[biogas]] can later be combusted to generate heat or electricity. AnMBR is considered to be a sustainable alternative for sewage treatment because the energy that can be generated by the methane combustion can exceed the energy required for maintaining the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/04/f21/fcto_beto_2015_wastewaters_workshop_umble.pdf|title=Anaerobic MBR: Challenges &amp; Opportunities|date=March 2015|first=Art|last=Umble|series=Hydrogen, Hydrocarbons, and Bioproduct Precursors from Wastewaters|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antinutrients''' are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere with the absorption of [[nutrient]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpUjsqD7lFUC&amp;pg=PA47|title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Cammack, Richard|year=|isbn=9780198529170|edition=Rev.|location=Oxford|pages=47|chapter=Aa|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198529170.001.0001|oclc=65467611|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198529170.001.0001/acref-9780198529170-e-1324?rskey=PPEnbe&amp;result=1261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition studies focus on these antinutrients commonly found in food sources and beverages.

== Examples ==
[[Phytic acid]] has a strong binding affinity to [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] such as [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]]. This results in precipitation, making the minerals unavailable for absorption in the [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Päivi | last1 = Ekholm | first2 = Liisa | last2 = Virkki | first3 = Maija | last3 = Ylinen | first4 = Liisa | last4 = Johansson | name-list-format = vanc |title=The effect of phytic acid and some natural chelating agents on the solubility of mineral elements in oat bran |journal=Food Chemistry |date=Feb 2003 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=165–70 |doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheryan M | title = Phytic acid interactions in food systems | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–335 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7002470 | doi = 10.1080/10408398009527293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytic acids are common in the hulls of nuts, seeds and grains and of great importance in [[agriculture]] animal nutrition and [[eutrophication]] wise due to the mineral [[chelation]] and bound [[phosphate]]s released in to the environment. Without the need to use phytate (but also nutrient) reducing [[Mill (grinding)|milling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bohn L, Meyer AS, Rasmussen SK | title = Phytate: impact on environment and human nutrition. A challenge for molecular breeding | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–91 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18357620 | pmc = 2266880 | doi = 10.1631/jzus.B0710640 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of phytic acid is commonly reduced in [[animal feed]]s by adding [[Phytase#Histidine acid phosphatases (HAPs)|histidine acid phosphate]] type of [[phytase]]s to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar V, Singh G, Verma AK, Agrawal S | title = In silico characterization of histidine Acid phytase sequences | journal = Enzyme Research | volume = 2012 | pages = 845465 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23304454 | pmc = 3523131 | doi = 10.1155/2012/845465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protease]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] are substances that inhibit the actions of [[trypsin]], [[pepsin]] and other proteases in the gut, preventing the digestion and subsequent absorption of protein. For example, [[Bowman–Birk protease inhibitor|Bowman–Birk trypsin inhibitor]] is found in soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Anna L. | last1 = Tan-Wilson | first2 = Jean C. | last2 = Chen | first3 = Michele C. | last3 = Duggan | first4 = Cathy | last4 = Chapman | first5 = R.

Agric. Food Chem. |year=1987 |volume=35 |issue=6 |page=974 |doi=10.1021/jf00078a028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lipase]] inhibitors interfere with enzymes, such as [[human pancreatic lipase]], that catalyze the hydrolysis of some [[lipid]]s, including fats. For example, the anti-obesity drug [[orlistat]] causes a percentage of fat to pass through the digestive tract undigested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heck AM, Yanovski JA, Calis KA | title = Orlistat, a new lipase inhibitor for the management of obesity | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 270–9 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10730683 | doi = 10.1592/phco.20.4.270.34882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amylase]] inhibitors prevent the action of enzymes that break the [[glycosidic bond]]s of [[starch]]es and other complex [[carbohydrate]]s, preventing the release of simple sugars and absorption by the body. [[Amylase]] inhibitors, like lipase inhibitors, have been used as a diet aid and obesity treatment. Amylase inhibitors are present in many types of beans; commercially available amylase inhibitors are extracted from white [[kidney bean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Preuss HG | title = Bean amylase inhibitor and other carbohydrate absorption blockers: effects on diabesity and general health | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–76 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 20150600 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2009.10719781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxalic acid]] and [[oxalate]]s are present in many plants and in significant amounts particularly in [[rhubarb]], [[tea]], [[spinach]], [[parsley]] and [[Portulaca oleracea|purslane]]. Oxalates bind to [[calcium]] and prevent its absorption in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan LC, Matulka RA, Burdock GA | title = Naturally occurring food toxins | journal = Toxins | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 2289–332 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22069686 | pmc = 3153292 | doi = 10.3390/toxins2092289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glucosinolate]]s prevent the uptake of [[iodine]], affecting the function of the [[thyroid]] and thus are considered [[goitrogen]]s. They are found in plants such as [[broccoli]], [[Brussels sprout|brussel sprouts]], [[cabbage]], [[Brassica juncea|mustard greens]], [[radish]]es and [[cauliflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan LC, Matulka RA, Burdock GA | title = Naturally occurring food toxins | journal = Toxins | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 2289–332 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22069686 | pmc = 3153292 | doi = 10.3390/toxins2092289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive intake of required nutrients can also result in them having an anti-nutrient action. Excessive intake of [[dietary fiber]] can reduce the transit time through the intestines to such a degree that other nutrients cannot be absorbed. However, this effect is often not seen in practice and reduction of absorbed minerals can be attributed mainly to the phytic acids in fibrous food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber|title=Fiber|last=|first=|date=2014-04-28|work=Linus Pauling Institute|access-date=2018-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414180232/http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coudray C, Demigné C, Rayssiguier Y | title = Effects of dietary fibers on magnesium absorption in animals and humans | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12514257 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.1.1 | url = https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/1/1/4687577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods high in [[Calcium in biology|calcium]] eaten simultaneously with foods containing [[iron]] can decrease the absorption of iron via an unclear mechanism involving iron [[transport protein]] h[[DMT1]], which calcium can inhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheers N | title = Regulatory effects of Cu, Zn, and Ca on Fe absorption: the intricate play between nutrient transporters | journal = Nutrients | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 957–70 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23519291 | pmc = 3705329 | doi = 10.3390/nu5030957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Protein (nutrient)|proteins]] can also be antinutrients, such as the [[trypsin inhibitor]]s and [[lectin]]s found in [[legume]]s. These [[enzyme inhibitor]]s interfere with digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilani GS, Cockell KA, Sepehr E | title = Effects of antinutritional factors on protein digestibility and amino acid availability in foods | journal = Journal of AOAC International | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 967–87 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 16001874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avidin]] is an antinutrient found in active form in raw [[egg white]]s.

Widespread form of antinutrients are the [[flavonoid]]s, which are a group of [[polyphenol]]ic compounds that include [[tannin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beecher GR | title = Overview of dietary flavonoids: nomenclature, occurrence and intake | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 10 | pages = 3248S-3254S | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14519822 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.10.3248S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14519822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds [[chelate]] metals such as iron and zinc and reduce the absorption of these nutrients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karamać M | title = Chelation of Cu(II), Zn(II), and Fe(II) by tannin constituents of selected edible nuts | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 5485–97 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20054482 | pmc = 2802006 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10125485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also inhibit digestive enzymes and may also precipitate proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adamczyk B, Simon J, Kitunen V, Adamczyk S, Smolander A | title = Tannins and Their Complex Interaction with Different Organic Nitrogen Compounds and Enzymes: Old Paradigms versus Recent Advances | journal = ChemistryOpen | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 610–614 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29046854 | pmc = 5641916 | doi = 10.1002/open.201700113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Antinutrients are found at some level in almost all foods for a variety of reasons. However, their levels are reduced in modern crops, probably as an outcome of the process of [[domestication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Toxins and Antinutrients |author=GEO-PIE Project |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |url=http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/issues/toxins.html |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612160331/http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/issues/toxins.html |archive-date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility now exists to eliminate antinutrients entirely using [[genetic engineering]]; but, since these compounds may also have beneficial effects, such genetic modifications could make the foods more nutritious but not improve people's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Welch RM, Graham RD | title = Breeding for micronutrients in staple food crops from a human nutrition perspective | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 55 | issue = 396 | pages = 353–64 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14739261 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erh064 | url = http://jexbot.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14739261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional methods of food preparation such as [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], [[cooking]], and [[malting]] increase the nutritive quality of plant foods through reducing certain antinutrients such as phytic acid, polyphenols, and oxalic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hotz C, Gibson RS | title = Traditional food-processing and preparation practices to enhance the bioavailability of micronutrients in plant-based diets | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 137 | issue = 4 | pages = 1097–100 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17374686 | doi = 10.1093/jn/137.4.1097 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17374686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such processing methods are widely used in societies where cereals and legumes form a major part of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chavan JK, Kadam SS | title = Nutritional improvement of cereals by fermentation | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–400 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2692608 | doi = 10.1080/10408398909527507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips RD | title = Starchy legumes in human nutrition, health and culture | journal = Plant Foods for Human Nutrition | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–211 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8295859 | doi = 10.1007/BF01088314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important example of such processing is the fermentation of [[cassava]] to produce cassava flour: this fermentation reduces the levels of both toxins and antinutrients in the tuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oboh G, Oladunmoye MK | title = Biochemical changes in micro-fungi fermented cassava flour produced from low- and medium-cyanide variety of cassava tubers | journal = Nutrition and Health | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 355–67 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18087867 | doi = 10.1177/026010600701800405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2687">The '''Aqueduct of Nottolini''' is a prominent [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical architectural]] landmark near the city of [[Lucca]], region of [[Tuscany]], Italy. The 19th-century structure brought water to Lucca from the mountains south of the city through a stone channel supported by more than 400 arches, stretching for over 3 kilometres. It is now interrupted by the east-west [[autostrada]] [[Autostrada A11 (Italy)|A11]] from [[Florence]] to [[Pisa]]. 
[[Image:Aquädukt Lorenzo Nottolini 2009-07-21.JPG|thumb|center|800px|Aqueduct]]

==Construction==
[[File:Aqueduct Nottolini Guamo Lucca.jpg|thumb|left|Temple cistern of Guamo and first arches]]
While the arches of the aqueduct are often confused as being those of an ancient [[Roman aqueduct]], construction of the aqueduct was begun in 1823 by the architect [[Lorenzo Nottolini]], under the rule of [[Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca]], and continued until 1851. In the slopes of Monte di Vorno, a number of springs were conveyed through rocky channels to a domed circular stone temple-cistern ({{coord|43.80755|10.52072|format=dms|type:landmark_region:IT|display=inline|name=Cistern in Guamo}}) located near San Quirico in the frazione of Guamo.

[[Image:Acq nottolini.jpg|thumb|Aqueduct and temple-tank of San Concordio]]
The water was then conveyed northward through covered stone conduits to the temple-tank of San Concordio ({{coord|43.83576|10.50879|format=dms|type:landmark_region:IT|display=inline|name=Tank of San Concordio}}), just outside the fortified walls of Lucca. The arches were mainly built with brick.

From the San Concordio tank, potable water was led by metal pipes into fountains in the city, starting with the circular fountain in Piazza Antelminelli next to [[Lucca Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.capannori-terraditoscana.org/index.php/territory/historical_personages/lorenzo_nottolini.html Terra di Toscana], entry on aqueduct.&lt;/ref&gt;

When inaugurated, the flow of water was governed completely by gravity. The final iron conduits allowed for expansion and contraction of the metal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cHs5AAAAcAAJ Guida del Forestiere per la citta e il contado di Lucca], by Tommaso Felice Trenta, 1820, page 139-141.&lt;/ref&gt; The interruption of the aqueduct occurred when the autostrada was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s government in 1928–1932.

'''Automatic Generic Substitution''' is a proposal by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DH) whereby in January 2010 pharmacists could be obliged to substitute a [[generic drug|generic]] version (a version of the drug with the same active ingredient) of a medication even if the prescriber had written the prescription for a specific [[brand]], as part of a new deal on drug pricing.

This is different from generic prescribing. In most cases, receiving a generic medicine is fully appropriate and effective for patient treatment and should continue. Indeed, generic prescribing already accounts for 83% of all prescriptions in the UK.&lt;ref name="Prescribing costs in primary care"&gt;{{Cite book|author=National Audit Office |title=Prescribing costs in primary care |url=https://www.nao.org.uk/report/prescribing-costs-in-primary-care/ |location=London |publisher=The Stationery Office |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-10-294517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DH is conducting a public formal consultation on the arrangements for the implementation of Automatic Generic Substitution. The consultation document can be found [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_110517 here]

Currently, Automatic Generic Substitution is not permitted under UK law, except in an emergency or under strict hospital control.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Pharmacy dispensing rules==

Under current dispensing rules, the prescriber writes a prescription for a branded or generic medicine, which is dispensed by a [[pharmacist]].

Under the proposed pharmacy dispensing rules, if Automatic Generic Substitution is introduced, the pharmacist may dispense either the prescribed product, or they may replace it with a generic or another brand without being required to inform the patient or healthcare professional.

It has been indicated by the DH that a prescriber will be able to tick a "do not substitute" box to prevent a proprietary medicine being replaced with a generic alternative. A group of people drawn from academia, medicine and patient groups has reported that it may not be adequate to safeguard patients. They state an example of when patients request a repeat prescription that may not be written by their doctor.&lt;ref name="Automatic Generic Substitution - Clinical Implications for Patients"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Automatic Generic Substitution - Clinical Implications for Patients |date=June 2009 |url=http://www.kidney.org.uk/main/switch_meds/AutomaticGenericSubstitutionClinicalImplicationsForPatientsJuly09.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228032056/http://www.kidney.org.uk/main/switch_meds/AutomaticGenericSubstitutionClinicalImplicationsForPatientsJuly09.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations between generics==
Generic medicines have the same [[active ingredient]] as the branded medicine, but are not always identical, which could affect some patients. The amount of drug that finally reaches the site of action is known as the [[bioavailability]], directly impacting on the effectiveness and tolerability of a drug.

For a generic medicine to be considered bioequivalent, the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) requires that the bioavailability lies between 80% and 125% of the original branded medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tga.gov.au/DOCS/pdf/euguide/ewp/140198entga.pdf |publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]] |title=Note for guidance on the investigation of bioavailability and bioequivalence |location=London |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/qwp/140198enrev1.pdf |publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]] |title=Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence |location=London |year=2008 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients can be switched between different generic medicines, which can mean that they might receive a generic medicine with effectively 25% more active ingredient than the branded medicine on one occasion and one with effectively 20% less active ingredient on the next.

==Impact on patient adherence==
Generic medicines often have different sizes, shapes, colours and packaging to each other, and to the branded medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/PROFESSIONAL-ISSUES/Pages/Physicians-and-the-Pharmaceutical-Industry.aspx |publisher=[[Royal College of Physicians]] |title=Patients, physicians, the pharmaceutical industry and the NHS |date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switching between medications has been shown to significantly reduce [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Thiebaud P, Patel BV, Nichol MB, Berenbeim DM |title=The effect of switching on compliance and persistence: the case of statin treatment |journal=The American Journal of Managed Care |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=670–4 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16268750 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/pubMed.php?pii=3031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor adherence is known to be associated with worse outcomes and increased costs for a variety of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bainbridge JL, Ruscin JM |title=Challenges of treatment adherence in older patients with Parkinson's disease |journal=Drugs &amp; Aging |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=145–55 |year=2009 |pmid=19220071 |doi=10.2165/0002512-200926020-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18693783&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ansell BJ |title=Not getting to goal: the clinical costs of noncompliance |journal=Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy |volume=14 |issue=6 Suppl B |pages=9–15 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18693783 |url=http://www.amcp.org/data/jmcp/JMCPSuppB_S9-S15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are exacerbated in elderly patients, who are more likely to be taking multiple medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Carey IM, De Wilde S, Harris T |title=What factors predict potentially inappropriate primary care prescribing in older people? Analysis of UK primary care patient record database |journal=Drugs &amp; Aging |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=693–706 |year=2008 |pmid=18665661 |doi=10.2165/00002512-200825080-00006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that £800 million worth of drugs is wasted annually in [[primary care]].&lt;ref name="Prescribing costs in primary care"/&gt; A report from a group of people drawn from academia, medicine and patient groups suggests this could increase further with a reduction in patient adherence due to Automatic Generic Substitution.&lt;ref name="Automatic Generic Substitution - Clinical Implications for Patients"/&gt;

Under Automatic Generic Substitution, a patient could receive a different medication, with a different appearance and [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] instructions, on each visit to the pharmacy.

==Generic prescribing in the UK==
There are many cases where generic prescribing is fully appropriate and vital to containing costs. Generic prescribing in the UK is currently at 83%.&lt;ref name="Prescribing costs in primary care"/&gt; The [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry
]] (ABPI) suggests that the maximum possible level for generic prescribing would be in the region of 90%,&lt;ref name="PPRS update 10"&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=[[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry]] |journal=PPRS update |date=March 2009 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a number of medicines have either no generic equivalent or are not appropriate for substitution, e.g. [[slow-release]] formulations. Prescribers now commonly prescribe a generic over a brand-name product in cases where it does not present any significant disadvantages to their patients.

==The options for introducing Automatic Generic Substitution==
The DH is proposing three options for introducing generic substitution:
* Option 1 – do nothing
* Option 2 – Introduce generic substitution but with specific medicines excluded
* Option 3 – Introduce generic substitution but with specific medicines included

The DH favours Option 3; Introduction of dispensing flexibility but limiting the scheme in such a way that the arrangements only apply to a selected group of products on a select list

The initial inclusion list for Option 3 can be found [http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_110511.pdf  here]

If Option 3 is adopted, the list can be "revised" by DH without any further consultation and may be revised up to four times per year.

A group of people drawn from academia, medicine and patient groups has raised concerns in a report, ‘Automatic Generic Substitution – Clinical Implications for Patients’ that any substitution could be detrimental to the patient. It is known that many medicines have the potential to interact with each other. Medicines on the inclusion list could be substituted for a different version and interact differently with a patient’s established medicine.

This could be a particular issue for the elderly, who often have multiple conditions and receive multiple medications.&lt;ref name="Automatic Generic Substitution - Clinical Implications for Patients"/&gt; A study of patients registered with 201 UK general practices showed that patients aged 65–69 years received [[Medical prescription|repeat prescriptions]] for an average of 5.9 medications in 2005.&lt;ref name=pmid18693783/&gt;

The '''collagen gel contraction assay''' is a type of [[wound healing|wound contraction]]. It is performed using the [[dermal equivalent]] model, which consists of [[dermal fibroblast]]s seeded into a [[collagen]] gel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g518380278431706/ Macrophages restrain contraction of an in vitro wound healing model]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''colony picker''' is an instrument used to automatically identify [[Colony (biology)|microbial colonies]] growing on a [[Agar|solid]] [[Growth medium|media]], pick them and duplicate them either onto solid or liquid media. It is used in research laboratories as well as in industrial environments such as [[Food safety|food testing]] and in [[microbiological culture]]s.

== Uses ==
In food safety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/MLG_41_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207095754/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/MLG_41_01.pdf |archivedate=December 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in clinical diagnosis colony picking is used to isolate individual colonies for identification. Colony pickers automate this procedure, saving costs and personnel and reducing [[human error]]. In the [[drug discovery]] process they are used for [[High throughput screening|screening]] purposes by picking thousands of microbial colonies and transferring them for further testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=USA |title=Automated panning and screening procedure on microplates for antibody generation from phage display libraries. |date=2015-09-28 |pmid=19224869 |doi=10.1177/1087057108330113 |volume=14 |journal=J Biomol Screen |pages=282–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other uses include [[cloning]] procedures and [[DNA sequencing]].

== as add-on ==
Colony pickers are sold either as stand-alone instruments or as add-ons to liquid handling robots, using the robot as the [[actuator]] and adding a camera and [[image analysis]] capabilities. This strategy lowers the price of the system considerably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/gene-cloning-and-colony-picking/3904/ |title=Gene Cloning and Colony Picking &amp;#124; GEN Magazine Articles &amp;#124; GEN |publisher=Genengnews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adds reusability as the robot can still be used for other purposes.

[[File:Chicken noodle soup (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Chicken soup]], a common classic comfort food that is found across various cultures]]

'''Comfort food''' is [[food]] that provides a [[nostalgic]] or sentimental value to someone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comfort%20food "Comfort Food."] (definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-webster.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and may be characterized by its high [[Calorie|caloric nature]], high [[carbohydrate]] level, or simple [[Food preparation|preparation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comfort food|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=comfort+food|publisher=WordNet 3.1|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nostalgia may be specific to an individual, or it may apply to a specific [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rufus |first=Anneli |title=How comfort foods work like Prozac |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/06/23/comfort_food_psychology/ |publisher=Gilt Taste |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XeO3Tlsm?url=http://www.salon.com/2011/06/23/comfort_food_psychology/ |archivedate=9 April 2015 |df=dmy }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term ''comfort food'' has been traced back at least to 1966, when the ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' used it in a story: "Adults, when under severe emotional stress, turn to what could be called ‘comfort food’—food associated with the security of childhood, like mother’s [[poached egg]] or famous [[chicken soup]]."&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/why-comfort-food-comforts/389613/ | title=Why Comfort Food Comforts | publisher=The Atlantic | date=3 April 2015 | accessdate=21 July 2015 | last=Romm | first = Cari}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are believed to be a great coping mechanism for rapidly soothing negative feelings.

==Psychological studies==
Consuming energy-dense, high calorie, high in fat or salt, or sweet food; such as ice cream, chocolate or french fries, could trigger the reward system in human's brain, which give a distinctive pleasure or temporarily feeling better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201609/5-reasons-why-we-crave-comfort-foods|title=5 Reasons Why We Crave Comfort Foods|website=Psychology Today| first = Shahram | last = Heshmat | language=en-US| date = 28 Sep 2016  |access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comfort foods may be consumed to reduce stress and feel better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wansink |first1=Brian |first2=Cynthia |last2=Sangerman |title=Engineering comfort foods |journal=American Demographics |date=July 2000 |pages=66–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the psychological aspects of food addiction that led to the unhealthy eating habits, people often use comfort food to treat themselves. Those with negative emotions tend to eat unhealthy food in an effort to experience the instant gratification which resulted in good feeling — although only short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deserthopetreatment.com/addiction-psychology/comfort-food/|title=The Science behind Comfort Food - Desert Hope|work=Desert Hope|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study divided college-students' comfort-food identifications into four categories (nostalgic foods, indulgence foods, [[convenience food]]s, and physical comfort foods) with a special emphasis on the deliberate selection of particular foods to modify mood or effect, and indications that the medical-therapeutic use of particular foods may ultimately be a matter of mood-alteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07409710500334509 |title=Comfort Foods: An Exploratory Journey into the Social and Emotional Significance of Food |year=2005 |last1=Locher |first1=Julie L. |last2=Yoels |first2=William C. |last3=Maurer |first3=Donna |last4=Van Ells |first4=Jillian |journal=Food and Foodways |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=273–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of particular items as comfort food may be idiosyncratic, though patterns are detectable. In one study of American preferences, "males preferred warm, hearty, meal-related comfort foods (such as [[steak]], casseroles, and soup) while females instead preferred comfort foods that were more [[snack]] related (such as chocolate and ice cream). In addition, younger people preferred more snack-related comfort foods compared to those over 55 years of age." The study also revealed strong connections between consumption of comfort foods and feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(03)00203-8 |title=Exploring comfort food preferences across age and gender |year=2003 |last1=Wansink |first1=B |last2=Cheney |first2=M |last3=Chan |first3=N |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=79 |issue=4–5 |pages=739–47 |pmid=12954417}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article, "The Myth of Comfort Food" asserted that men tend to choose these types of savory comfort foods because they remind them of being "pampered" or spoiled, while women choose snack-related foods because they are associated with low amounts of work and less "cleanup." It also suggested that women are more likely to reach for unhealthier foods in times of stress due to more weight-conscious mindsets.

Comfort food consumption has been seen as a response to [[emotional stress]] and, consequently, as a key contributor to the epidemic of [[obesity in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1934666100 |title=Chronic stress and obesity: A new view of 'comfort food' |year=2003 |last1=Dallman |first1=Mary F. |last2=Pecoraro |first2=Norman |last3=Akana |first3=Susan F. |last4=La Fleur |first4=Susanne E. |last5=Gomez |first5=Francisca |last6=Houshyar |first6=Hani |last7=Bell |first7=M.

Further studies suggest that consumption of comfort food is triggered in men by positive emotions, and by negative ones in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.08.023 |title=Affect asymmetry and comfort food consumption |year=2005 |last1=Dube |first1=L |last2=Lebel |first2=J |last3=Lu |first3=J |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=559–67 |pmid=16209880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stress effect is particularly pronounced among college-aged women, with only 33% reporting [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]] choices during times of emotional stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.nutres.2005.11.010 |title=Stress influences appetite and comfort food preferences in college women |year=2006 |last1=Kandiah |first1=Jayanthi |last2=Yake |first2=Melissa |last3=Jones |first3=James |last4=Meyer |first4=Michaela |journal=Nutrition Research |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=118–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For women specifically, these psychological patterns may be maladaptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.02.005 |title=Weakened biological signals: Highly-developed eating schemas amongst women are associated with maladaptive patterns of comfort food consumption |year=2008 |last1=Lebel |first1=J |last2=Lu |first2=J |last3=Dube |first3=L |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=384–92 |pmid=18325547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A therapeutic use of these findings includes offering comfort foods or "[[happy hour]]" beverages to [[anorexia (symptom)|anorectic]] [[geriatric]] patients whose health and [[quality of life]] otherwise decreases with reduced oral intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0197-4572(98)90153-7 |title=Feeding the anorectic client: Comfort foods and happy hour |year=1998 |last1=Wood |first1=Paulette |last2=Vogen |first2=Barbra D |journal=Geriatric Nursing |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=192–4 |pmid=9866509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, according to some figures 26 percent of the world consumption of Nutella is done by the French even though the brand is Italian. This means that around a whopping 75,000 tonnes of Nutella are consumed every year in France. France's long love affair with the chocolate spread starts, for many, at childhood when it is the sweet and some say sickly breakfast of choice for many French school children. And according to Paris food writer and author of the blog Chocolate &amp; Zucchini [[Clotilde Dusoulier]] it could be this childhood link which is partly behind the France's love for Nutella.  "French people eat it by the spoonful. I had it on toast for breakfast as a child," Dusoulier told The Local. "And like with candy, grownups continue to eat it to connect with their inner child." The food writer also explained that the French have a tendency to turn to sweets in times of uncertainty.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bubur ayam chicken porridge.JPG|thumb|[[Bubur ayam]] (chicken [[congee]]) is an [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] comfort food.]]
Some popular [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian foods]] are considered to be comfort food, usually served hot or warm, and soupy or with a soft texture. Most of them are high in [[carbohydrate|carbs]] or fat, such as fried rice, congee, and noodles which are high in carbs; while meatballs and grilled skewered meats contains fair amount of fat and salt. Comfort foods often are the kind of food that provides nostalgic sentiments, as they often called ''masakan rumahan'' (home cooking) or ''masakan ibu'' (mother's dishes). In Indonesia, the warm and soft texture of [[bubur ayam]] is believed to help people to recover during [[convalescence]].&lt;ref name="detikFood"&gt;{{cite web | title=Comfort Food, Makanan Yang Bikin Nyaman dan Kangen | publisher=Detik Food | author=Fitria Rahmadianti | date=26 September 2012 | url=http://food.detik.com/read/2012/09/26/093841/2036688/297/2/comfort-food-makanan-yang-bikin-nyaman-dan-kangen | language=Indonesian | accessdate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayur sop or sup ayam is Indonesian chicken soup that often sought during [[influenza|flu]].

'''Cortical deafness''' is a rare form of [[sensorineural hearing loss]] caused by damage to the [[primary auditory cortex]]. Cortical deafness is an auditory disorder where the patient is unable to hear sounds but has no apparent damage to the anatomy of the ear (see  [[auditory system]]), which can be thought of as the combination of [[auditory verbal agnosia]] and [[auditory agnosia]]. Patients with cortical deafness cannot hear any sounds, that is, they are not aware of sounds including non-speech, voices, and speech sounds.&lt;ref name="Ingram, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ingram, John Henry |title=Neurolinguistics: an introduction to spoken language processing and its disorders |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |pages=160–171 |isbn=0-521-79190-1 |oclc=297335127 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although patients appear and feel completely deaf, they can still exhibit some reflex responses such as turning their head towards a loud sound.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stroke Syndromes|last = Bogousslavsky|first = Julien|publisher = Cambridge UP|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inner ear functions, however, remains intact. Cortical deafness is most often cause by [[stroke]], but can also result from brain injury or birth defects.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.audiology.org/sites/default/files/journal/JAAA_05_05_08.pdf|title = Cortical Deafness: A longitudinal study|last = Hood|first = Linda|date = 1999|journal = The American Journal of Nursing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, a common cause is bilateral embolic stroke to the area of Heschl's gyri.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; Cortical deafness is extremely rare, with only twelve reported cases. Each case has a distinct context and different rates of recovery.

It is thought that cortical deafness could be a part of a spectrum of an overall cortical hearing disorder.&lt;ref name="Graham, 1980" /&gt; In some cases, patients with cortical deafness have had recovery of some hearing function, resulting in partial auditory deficits such as auditory verbal agnosia.&lt;ref name="Graham, 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cavinato M, Rigon J, Volpato C, Semenza C, Piccione F |title=Preservation of auditory P300-like potentials in cortical deafness |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e29909 |year=2012 |pmid=22272260 |pmc=3260175 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029909 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome might be difficult to distinguish from a bilateral temporal lesion such as described above.

== Diagnosis ==
Since cortical deafness and auditory [[agnosia]] have many similarities, diagnosing the disorder proves to be difficult. Bilateral lesions near the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe are important criteria. Cortical deafness requires demonstration that [[brainstem]] auditory responses are
normal, but cortical evoked potentials are impaired. [[Brainstem auditory evoked potential]]s ('''BAEP)''', also referred to as brainstem auditory evoked responses ('''BAER''') show the neuronal activity in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olive, and inferior colliculus of the brainstem. They typically have a response latency of no more than six milliseconds with an amplitude of approximately one microvolt. The latency of the responses gives critical information: if cortical deafness is applicable, '''LLR''' (long-latency responses) are completely abolished and '''MLR''' (middle latency responses) are either abolished or significantly impaired.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In auditory agnosia, LLRs and MLRs are preserved.

Another important aspect of cortical deafness that is often overlooked is that patients ''feel'' deaf. They are aware of their inability to hear environmental sounds, non-speech and speech sounds. Patients with [[auditory agnosia]] can be unaware of their deficit, and insist that they are not deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Denes, G., and Luigi Pizzamiglio. "Comprehension Disorders." Handbook of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology. Hove, East Sussex, UK: Psychology, 1999. 210. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal deafness and auditory agnosia are disorders of a selective, perceptive and associative nature whereas cortical deafness relies on the anatomic and functional disconnection of the auditory cortex from acoustic impulses.

=== Case examples ===
Although cortical deafness has very specific parameters of diagnosis, its causes on the other hand can vary tremendously. The following are three case studies with different reasons for cortical deafness.
# A case published in 2001 describes the patient as 20-year-old man referred for cochlear implants because of bilateral deafness following a motorcycle accident two years earlier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His [[CT scan|CT]] shows hemorrhagic lesions involving both [[internal capsule]]s. He was comatose for several weeks and awoke quadriparetic, cognitively impaired and completely deaf. He exhibited a response towards the occasional sudden, loud sound, however, by turning his head. Reading and writing capabilities were maintained, and he was able to communicate by lip-reading. His own speech was dysarthric, but comprehensible. Normal tympanograms and stapedial reflexes imply that the middle and [[inner ear]] remained functioning and the auditory nerve was intact. His auditory nerve was tested by evoking responses with normal auditory nerve potentials at 10&amp;nbsp;dB bilaterally. The results of the BAER waves were normal, but an abnormal complex IV-V suggested that the pathways were functioning through the brainstem, but there was a lesion present in the mid-brain. With these findings, it was determined the patient had cortical deafness due to bilateral interruption of the ascending auditory pathway associated with hemorrhagic lesions of both internal capsules. Therefore, cochlear implantation was not performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Published in 1994, this patient was monitored over the course of almost 20 years after exhibiting signs of hearing impairment as an infant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Audiologic and related test results in concurrence with MRI confirmed bilateral absence of considerable portions of her temporal lobes resulting in cortical deafness. Although physiologic measures demonstrate normal peripheral hearing sensitivity, this patient's speech has the inflection and prosodic characteristics associated with profound peripheral hearing loss, and she is unable to understand spoken communication. Behaviorally obtained pure-tone thresholds were variable, ranging from normal to moderate hearing loss with normal middle ear muscle reflexes and normal ABRs to high- and low-intensity stimuli. Auditory middle latency and cortical evoked potentials were grossly abnormal, consistent with the central nature of cortical deafness. Because of her inability to communicate auditorily, this patient was ultimately taught American Sign Language and educated at the Louisiana School for the Deaf. At the completion of the case study, the patient was married and expecting a child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# A more recent study, published in 2013 the patient described is a 56-year-old woman a history of [[hypertension]], [[hypercholesterolemia]], and multiple cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented in March 2009 with a complaint of complete bilateral hearing loss. In March 2009, she experienced an acute right-sided insulotemporal intracerebral hemorrhage. Immediately after this event, the patient complained of hearing loss with the inability to hear all sounds except for severe bilateral [[tinnitus]]. Imaging revealed [[sequela]]e in the left cerebral cortex from her previous CVA. The new right-sided hemorrhage was centered on the posterior putamen with surrounding [[edema]] involving the posterior portion of the posterior limbs of the internal, external, and extreme capsules. Signal abnormalities extended into the right temporal lobe. The patient had no other neurologic deficits and spoke fluently, although with poor internal volume control of her voice. Otoscopic examination revealed normal-appearing external auditory canals, intact tympanic membranes bilaterally, and normal middle ear anatomy. Audiogram at that time showed bilateral profound hearing loss with no responses to pure-tone or speech testing.

== Treatment ==
Auditory perception can improve with time.There seems to be a level of neuroplasticity that allows patients to recover the ability to perceive environmental and certain musical sounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Patients presenting with cortical hearing loss and no other associated symptoms recover to a variable degree, depending on the size and type of the cerebral lesion.  Patients whose symptoms include both motor deficits and aphasias often have larger lesions with an associated poorer prognosis in regard to functional status and recovery.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Cochlear or auditory brainstem implantation could also be treatment options. Electrical stimulation of the peripheral auditory system may result in improved sound perception or cortical remapping in patients with cortical deafness.&lt;ref name="Graham, 1980" /&gt; However, hearing aids are an inappropriate answer for cases like these. Any auditory signal, regardless if has been amplified to normal or high intensities, is useless to a system unable to complete its processing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ideally, patients should be directed toward resources to aid them in lip-reading, learning American Sign Language, as well as speech and occupational therapy. Patients should follow-up regularly to evaluate for any long-term recovery.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
== History ==
Early reports, published in the late 19th century, describe patients with acute onset of deafness after experiencing symptoms described as [[apoplexy]]. The only means of definitive diagnosis in these reports were postmortem dissections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brody, Robert M., Brian D. Nicholas, Michael J. Wolf, Paula B. Marcinkevich, and Gregory J. Artz. "Cortical Deafness: A Case Report and Review of the Literature." Otology and Neurology 34.7 (2013): 1226–229. Ovid. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent cases throughout the 20th century reflect advancements in diagnoses of both hearing loss and stroke. With the advent of audiometric and [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiologic]] studies, investigators could diagnose cortical deafness with increasing precision. Advances in imaging techniques, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], greatly improved the diagnosis and localization of cerebral infarcts that coincide with primary or secondary auditory centers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Neurological and cognitive testing help to distinguish between total cortical deafness and [[auditory agnosia]], resulting in the inability to perceive words, music, or specific environmental sounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">The '''Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons''' was a declaration of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]], made on 9 December 1975. It is the 3447th resolution made by the Assembly.

As a resolution of the Assembly, it is not binding on member nations, but it forms a framework that may be drawn on for the purposes of international and domestic law.

It consists of a lengthy preamble, and thirteen proclamations that broadly promote the rights of those with disabilities.

In 2007 the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proclamations==
The Declaration makes thirteen distinct proclamations:

# Definition of the term "disabled person" as "''any person unable to ensure by himself or herself, wholly or partly, the necessities of a normal individual and/or social life, as a result of deficiency, either congenital or not, in his or her physical or mental capabilities''".
#
# Assertion that these rights apply to all disabled persons "''without any exception whatsoever and without distinction or discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, state of wealth, birth or any other situation applying either to the disabled person himself or herself or to his or her family''".
#
# Right to respect for [[human dignity]].
# 
# Right to same civil and political rights as other human beings.
#
# Right to measures designed to enable [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]].
#
# Right to medical, psychological and functional treatment as necessary.
#
# Right to economic and social security, including the right to [[equal opportunity|employment]].
#
# Right to have consideration of special needs at all stages of economic and social planning.
#
# Right to live with their families or with foster parents and to participate in all social, creative or recreational activities.
#
# Right to protection against exploitation, discrimination, and abuse.
#
# Right to qualified legal aid.
# 
# Right to consult [[List of disability rights organizations|organizations of disabled persons]] for in matters of concern.
#
# Right to be fully informed of the rights proclaimed in the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/RightsOfDisabledPersons.aspx Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons (U.N. General Assembly - 30th Session. 1975.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New_Brunswick_people_with_disability.jpg|alt=People with disability in New Brunswick, 2017.|thumb|350x350px|People with disability in New Brunswick, 2017.]]

According to a 2012 survey by [[Statistics Canada]], around 3.8&amp;nbsp;million adult Canadians reported being "limited in their daily activities due to a disability". This represented 13.7% of the adult population. The three most-prevalent forms of disability in Canada are chronic pain issues, mobility, and flexibility limitations. Around 11% of Canadian adults experience one of these disability types, and 40% of those people have had all three at the same time.&lt;ref name="Stats2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability in Canada: Initial findings from the Canadian Survey on Disability|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-654-x/89-654-x2013002-eng.htm|website=Statistics Canada|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled people in Canada have historically experienced many forms of discrimination and abuse, such as segregation, institutionalization, and compulsory sterilization. They were not given the same rights as non-disabled people until the end of the 1970s, when the Coalition of Provincial Organizations of the Handicapped (now [[Council for Canadians with Disabilities]]) initiated significant changes. Legislation intended to protect disabled Canadians include the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]], and the [[Employment Equity Act]].

==Legislation==
Currently-existing federal legislation which protects the rights of Canadians with disabilities most prominently includes the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]], and the [[Employment equity (Canada)|Employment Equity Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/disability/acts/index.shtml |title=Acts and Regulations: Disability|publisher=esdc.gc.ca |date=2013-12-17 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Discrimination against persons with disabilities is prohibited by the Canadian Human Rights Act, which was enacted in 1985.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regionalGovernment/resources/DOCS_ADMIN-1292073-v1-Historical_Timeline_for_People_with_Disabilities.pdf |title=People with Disabilities Significant Historical Events|publisher=Region of Waterloo.ca|accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, enacted in 1982,&lt;ref name="waterloo" /&gt; guarantees that persons with disabilities are protected by and will receive the same benefits under the law as any other Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccdonline.ca/en/humanrights/|title=Human Rights|publisher=Council of Canadians with Disabilities|accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Employment Equity Act aims to ensure that particular groups, including persons with disabilities, enjoy the same employment opportunities and benefits as anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-5.401/page-1.html#h-2|title=Employment Equity Act|publisher=justice.gc.ca|date=2015-11-05 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Largely having to do with the widespread trust of [[medical model of disability|medical authority]] and the growth of industrialization, Canadian society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the segregation of persons with disabilities.&lt;ref name="canency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/disability-rights-movement/ |title=Disability Rights Movement|publisher=Historica Canada|date=2015-02-04 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public institutions, such as psychiatric hospitals, houses for the blind, houses of refuge, and church-run homes, confined and isolated persons with disabilities from the rest of society. Persons with disabilities were seen as being a burden on the rest of society and denied the full exercise of their rights.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt;

===War wounded===
After [[World War I]], many veterans returned to Canada with disabilities due to war injuries, and had difficulty re-integrating into society. The needs of these veterans gave rise to disability advocacy organizations such as the [[The War Amps|War Amps]], which fought for the need for services like rehabilitation, training in sheltered workshops, and other employment-related services.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt; A disparity formed between the status of veterans with disabilities and that of civilians with disabilities, which would continue to widen until after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. In the mid-20th century, civilians with disabilities and their allies advocated for the rights of all persons with disabilities to participate fully in society. The deinstitutionalization of persons with disabilities was among their primary causes.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt;

===Compulsory sterilization===
{{main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}
From the end of the 1920s and into the 1970s, provincial legislation in Alberta&lt;ref name="e1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyofrights.ca/encyclopaedia/main-events/eugenics/ |title=Eugenics|publisher=Canada's Human Rights History |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Columbia&lt;ref name="e2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/timeline/ |title=Eugenics Timeline|publisher=eugenicsarchive.ca |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for persons with mental health disabilities who had been institutionalized to be sterilized for the purpose of preventing them from having children who would inherit the same disabilities. While legislation in British Columbia required the consent of the person in question, their spouse, or a guardian, a 1937 amendment to the [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] meant that, in certain circumstances, this procedure could be completed without the consent or even the knowledge of the person being sterilized. In Alberta, this legislation was repealed in 1972 under the Progressive Conservative government of [[Peter Lougheed]]. [[David Thomas King|David King]], the MLA who had tabled the bill for the repeal of the Act, stated that he saw the legislation as being in violation of human rights.&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt; In British Columbia, legislation permitting sexual sterilization was repealed in 1973, and the ''[[E (Mrs) v Eve]]'' [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] decision in 1986 affirmed that, in Canada, it is not legal to sexually sterilize someone without their consent outside of emergency situations.&lt;ref name="e2" /&gt;

===Deinstitutionalization===
During the 1950s and 1960s the process continued for the deinstitutionalization of persons with disabilities. Not-for-profit organizations such as the [[Canadian Association for Community Living]] (formed in 1958, then called the Canadian Association for Retarded Children) opened group homes for persons with disabilities and advocated that money saved by closing government institutions could be used for the expansion of community services.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt;

===Disability rights organizations===
The end of the 1970s marked the establishment of the Coalition of Provincial Organizations of the Handicapped (now the [[Council for Canadians with Disabilities]] [CCD]), a prominent advocacy group. This organization stood out from others in that it was composed mainly of persons with disabilities themselves, rather than allies or professionals.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt;

In 1981 the United Nations International Year for Disabled Persons drew attention to and triggered an increase in Canadians' awareness of disability issues. The following year the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was amended to include disability as a basis for discrimination,&lt;ref name="waterloo" /&gt; a cause strongly advocated by stakeholder groups such as the CCD. Canada's Human Rights Act came into effect in 1985, and the Employment Equity Act in 1986.

As a result of the economic recession, the early 1990s marked a difficult time for persons with disabilities: less funding was available for social assistance and government subsidies were scarce and more difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt; Developments on disability issues continued to be made at a federal level. In 1991, under the [[Mulroney government]], a five-year strategic action plan was announced for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities. In 1996 Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] appointed a Federal Task Force on Disability Issues.&lt;ref name="waterloo" /&gt; The federal government Office for Disability Issues, the Government of Canada's focal point on matters with relation to disability, was founded in 2001.&lt;ref name="waterloo" /&gt; The 1990s marked the emergence of an academic discourse aimed at determining the place of disability in Canadian society.

Twenty-first century developments in disability issues include a 2012 Supreme Court decision which established that persons with mental-health disabilities can provide reliable court testimony,&lt;ref name="waterloo" /&gt; and Canada's ratification of the [[UN]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] in March&amp;nbsp;2010.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt; In signing the convention, Canada committed to attempt to improve the social and economic condition of Canadians with disabilities, and in 2014 it submitted a report to the UN detailing its progress.&lt;ref name="canency" /&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the 2012 Canadian Survey on Disability by [[Statistics Canada]], about 3.8&amp;nbsp;million or 13.7% of Canadians aged 15 to 64 were regarded as disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/131203/dq131203a-eng.htm |title=The Daily — Canadian Survey on Disability, 2012 |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2013-12-03 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a correlation between disability and age, from 4.4% of those aged 15&amp;nbsp;24 to 42.5% among those 75 and older.&lt;ref name="Stats2012" /&gt;

==Education==
Only 20.2% of Canadians with disabilities have a university degree compared to 40.7% of their non-disabled compatriots.&lt;ref name="chrc-ccdp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/sites/default/files/rerpd_rdepad-eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Report on Equality Rights of People with Disabilities |publisher=Chrc-ccdp.ca |accessdate=2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income inequality and employment==
Disabled men aged 15-to-64 earn $9,557 less than non-disabled men of the same age. In the case of disabled women in the same age-group the income difference is $8,853.&lt;ref name="chrc-ccdp1"/&gt; In 2006 the unemployment rate among disabled Canadians was 8.6%, compared to the national average of 6.3%.&lt;ref name="chrc-ccdp1"/&gt;

==Social inclusion==
According to a 2004 survey, 10% of Canadians believe disabled people are fully included in Canadian social life. About 1.4&amp;nbsp;million disabled adults required assistance with [[activities of daily living]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-628-x/2010015/tbl/tbl1-eng.htm |title=Table 1 - Adults with disabilities that need help with everyday activities, by sex and age groups, Canada, 2001 and 2006 |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
During the 1990s its relatively low importance led to its being referred to unfavourably by [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s as the "[[Cinderella]] committee". However, since then the committee's powers have increased. The [[co-decision procedure]] for legislation, which grants greater powers to the Parliament, has been extended to more policy areas. Notably, the areas covered by this committee were the main recipients of these new powers. The rising importance of the issues it deals with (for example, [[global warming]]) has also meant that it has become one of the most important committees in Parliament. The committee's open sessions, as well as constituting a major forum within the Parliament, are usually well attended by both business [[lobbyist]]s and representatives from environmental [[NGO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Although the process is similar in many animals, this article will deal exclusively with [[human]] folliculogenesis.''
[[File:Order of changes in ovary.svg|thumb|right|320px|Order of changes in ovary.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1 - Menstruation&lt;BR&gt;2 - Developing follicle&lt;BR&gt;3 - Mature follicle&lt;BR&gt;4 - Ovulation&lt;BR&gt;5 - Corpus luteum&lt;BR&gt;6 - Deterioration of corpus luteum]]
In [[biology]], '''folliculogenesis''' is the maturation of the [[ovarian follicle]], a densely packed shell of [[somatic cells]] that contains an immature [[oocyte]]. Folliculogenesis describes the progression of a number of small ''[[Folliculogenesis#Primordial|primordial follicles]]'' into large ''[[Folliculogenesis#Late tertiary and preovulatory .28the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.29|preovulatory follicles]]'' that occurs in part during the [[menstrual cycle]].

Contrary to male [[spermatogenesis]], which can last indefinitely, folliculogenesis ends when the remaining follicles in the [[Ovary|ovaries]] are incapable of responding to the hormonal cues that previously recruited some follicles to mature. This depletion in follicle supply signals the beginning of [[menopause]].

==Overview==
The primary role of the follicle is [[oocyte]] support. From birth, the [[ovaries]] of the human female contain a number of immature, [[Folliculogenesis#Primordial|primordial follicles]]. These follicles each contain a similarly immature [[primary oocyte]]. At [[puberty]] clutches of follicles begin folliculogenesis, entering a growth pattern that ends in death (apoptosis) or in ovulation (the process where the oocyte leaves the follicle).

During follicular development, primordial follicles undergo a series of critical changes in character, both histologically and hormonally. First they change into primary follicles and later into secondary follicles. The follicles then transition to [[Folliculogenesis#Primordial|tertiary, or antral, follicles]]. At this stage in development, they become dependent on hormones, particularly FSH which causes a substantial increase in their growth rate. [[Folliculogenesis#Late tertiary and preovulatory .28the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.29|The late tertiary or pre-ovulatory follicle]] ruptures and discharges the oocyte (that has become a [[secondary oocyte]]), ending folliculogenesis.

[[File:Folliculogenesis chart.gif|frame|center|Diagram of folliculogenesis, starting from pre-antral (late secondary), courtesy NCBI]]

==Phases of development==
Folliculogenesis is continuous, meaning that at any time the ovary contains follicles in many stages of development. The majority of follicles die and never complete development. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called [[ovulation]].

The growing follicle passes through the following distinct stages that are defined by certain structural characteristics:

In a larger perspective, the whole folliculogenesis, from primordial to preovulatory follicle, belongs to the stage of [[ootidogenesis]] of [[oogenesis]].

{{Further|oogenesis}}

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Stage''' || '''Description''' || '''Size'''

 | ''Primordial'' ||  [[Dormancy|Dormant]], small, only one layer of flat [[granulosa]] cells || Primordial follicles are about 0.03-0.05&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

In addition, follicles that have formed an [[follicular antrum|antrum]] are called [[antral follicles]] or Graafian follicles. Definitions differ in where this shift occurs in the staging given above, with some stating that it occurs when entering the ''secondary'' stage,&lt;ref name=Lauralee2010/&gt; and others stating that it occurs when entering the ''tertiary'' stage.&lt;ref name=Hurk1997/&gt;

Until the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of [[meiosis|meiosis I]]. During the late preovulatory stage, the oocyte continues meiosis and becomes a secondary oocyte, arrested in [[metaphase|metaphase II]].

[[Image:Figure 28 02 04.JPG|thumb|right|600px|(a) The maturation of a follicle is shown in a clockwise direction proceeding from the primordial follicles. FSH stimulates the growth of a tertiary follicle, and LH stimulates the production of estrogen by granulosa and theca cells. Once the follicle is mature, it ruptures and releases the oocyte.

===Primordial===


&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Follicle histology1.gif|right]] --&gt;

At 18–22 weeks post-conception, the cortex of the female [[ovary]] (foetal female ovary) contains its peak number of follicles (about 4 to 5 million in the average case, but individual peak populations range from 6 to 7 million).&lt;ref name="WKmodel"&gt;Wallace WHB and Kelsey TW (2010) ''[http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0008772 Human Ovarian Reserve from Conception to the Menopause.]'' PLoS ONE 5(1):e8772. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0008772}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ''primordial follicles'' contain immature oocytes surrounded by flat, squamous [[granulosa cells]] (support cells) that are segregated from the oocyte's environment by the basal lamina. They are quiescent, showing little to no [[biological activity]]. Because primordial follicles can be dormant for up to 50 years in the human, the length of the ovarian cycle does not include this time.

The supply of follicles decreases slightly before birth, and to 180,000 by puberty for the average case (populations at puberty range from 25,000 to 1.5 million).&lt;ref name="WKmodel"/&gt; By virtue of the "inefficient" nature of folliculogenesis (discussed later), only 400 of these follicles will ever reach the preovulatory stage. At [[menopause]], only 1,000 follicles remain. It seems likely that early menopause occurs for women with low populations at birth, and late menopause occurs for women with high populations at birth, but there is as yet no clinical evidence for this.&lt;ref name="WKmodel"/&gt;

The process by which primordial cells 'wake up' is known as initial recruitment. Research has shown that initial recruitment is mediated by the counterbalance of various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones and locally produced growth factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fortune J, Cushman R, Wahl C, Kito S | title = The primordial to primary follicle transition. | journal = Mol Cell Endocrinol | volume = 163 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 53–60 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10963874 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-7207(99)00240-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Follicle histology2.gif|right]] --&gt;
During [[ovarian follicle activation]], the granulosa cells of the primordial follicles change from a flat to a cuboidal structure, marking the beginning of the ''primary follicle''. The oocyte genome is activated and genes become [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]. Rudimentary [[paracrine signalling]] pathways that are vital for communication between the follicle and oocyte are formed. Both the oocyte and the follicle grow dramatically, increasing to almost 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

Primary follicles develop receptors to [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) at this time, but they are gonadotropin-independent until the antral stage. Research has shown, however, that the presence of FSH accelerates follicle growth ''in vitro''.

A glycoprotein polymer capsule called the [[zona pellucida]] forms around the oocyte, separating it from the surrounding granulosa cells. The zona pellucida, which remains with the oocyte after ovulation, contains enzymes that catalyze with [[spermatozoon|sperm]] to allow penetration.

===Secondary===
Stroma-like theca cells are recruited by oocyte-secreted signals. They surround the follicle's outermost layer, the [[basal lamina]], and undergo cytodifferentiation to become the [[theca externa]] and [[theca interna]]. An intricate network of capillary vessels forms between these two thecal layers and begins to circulate blood to and from the follicle.

The late-term secondary follicle is marked histologically and structurally by a fully grown oocyte surrounded by a zona pellucida, approximately nine layers of granulosa cells, a basal lamina, a theca interna, a capillary net, and a theca externa.

===Antrum formation===
{{Further|Antral follicle}}
The formation of a fluid-filled cavity adjacent to the oocyte called the [[Follicular antrum|antrum]] designates the follicle as an [[antral follicle]], in contrast to a so-called ''preantral follicle'' that still lacks an antrum. An antral follicle is also called a ''Graafian follicle''.

Definitions differ as to which stage this shift occurs in, with some designating follicles in the ''secondary'' stage as ''antral'',&lt;ref name=Lauralee2010&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gOmpysGBC90C&amp;pg=PT797 Page 769], section "formation of the antrum" in: {{Cite book  | last1 = Sherwood | first1 = Lauralee. | last2 =  | first2 =  | title = Human physiology : from cells to system | year = 2010 | publisher = Brooks/Cole | location = Australia ; United States | isbn = 978-0-495-39184-5 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others designating them as ''preantral''.&lt;ref name=Hurk1997&gt;Page 76 in: {{Cite journal | last1 = Vandenhurk | first1 = R. | last2 = Bevers | first2 = M. | last3 = Beckers | first3 = J. | title = In-vivo and in-vitro development of preantral follicles | journal = Theriogenology | volume = 47 | pages = 73–82 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1016/S0093-691X(96)00341-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early tertiary===
In the ''tertiary follicle'', the basic structure of the mature follicle has formed and no novel cells are detectable. Granulosa and theca cells continue to undergo mitotis concomitant with an increase in antrum volume. Tertiary follicles can attain a tremendous size that is hampered only by the availability of FSH, which it is now dependent on.

Under action of an oocyte-secreted morphogenic gradient, the granulosa cells of the tertiary follicle undergo differentiation into four distinct subtypes: ''corona radiata'', surrounding the zona pellucida; ''membrana'', interior to the basal lamina; ''periantral'', adjacent to the antrum and ''cumulus oophorous'', which connects the membrana and corona radiata granulosa cells together. Each type of cell behaves differently in response to FSH.

Theca interna cells express receptors for luteinizing hormone ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]). LH induces the production of [[androgen]]s by the theca cells, most notably [[androstendione]], which are aromatized by granulosa cells to produce [[estrogens]], primarily [[estradiol]]. Consequently, estrogen levels begin to rise.

===Late tertiary and preovulatory (the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle)===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:mature Graffian follicle.jpg|frame|right|Histological presentation of a preovulatory follicle]] --&gt;
At this point, the majority of the group of follicles that started growth have died. This process of follicle death is known as ''[[Ovarian follicle atresia|atresia]]'', and it is characterized by radical [[apoptosis]] of all constituent cells and the oocyte. Although it is not known what causes atresia, the presence of high concentrations of FSH has been shown to prevent it.

A rise in pituitary FSH caused by the disintegration of the corpus luteum at the conclusion of the twelfth menstrual cycle precipitates the selection of five to seven class 5 follicles to participate in the thirteenth. These follicles enter the end of the twelfth menstrual cycle and transition into the [[follicular phase]] of the thirteenth cycle. The selected follicles, called antral follicles, compete with each other for growth-inducing FSH.

In response to the rise of FSH, the antral follicles begin to secrete estrogen and [[inhibin]], which have a negative feedback effect on FSH.&lt;ref&gt;de Ziegler D (2007), "Roles of FSH and LH during the follicular phase: insight into the natural cycle IVF", RBM Online volume 15 No. 5, page 508&lt;/ref&gt; Follicles that have fewer [[FSH-receptor]]s will not be able to develop further; they will show retardation of their growth rate and become atretic. Eventually, only one follicle will be viable. This remaining follicle, called the ''dominant follicle'', will grow quickly and dramatically—up to 20&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter—to become the ''preovulatory follicle''.

''Note: Many sources misrepresent the pace of follicle growth, some even suggesting that it takes only fourteen days for a primordial follicle to become preovulatory. Actually, the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle means the time between selection of a tertiary follicle and its subsequent growth into a preovulatory follicle.The actual time for development of a follicle varies. ''

==Ovulation and the corpus luteum==
By the end of the follicular (or proliferative) phase of the thirteenth day of the menstrual cycle, the [[cumulus oophorus]] layer of the preovulatory follicle will develop an opening, or ''stigma'', and excrete the oocyte with a complement of cumulus cells in a process called [[ovulation]]. The oocyte is technically still a secondary oocyte, suspended in the metaphase II of meiosis. It will develop into an ootid, and rapidly thereafter into an ovum (via completion of meiosis II) only upon fertilization.  The oocyte will now travel down one of the [[fallopian tubes]] to eventually be discharged through menstruation in the case that it is unfertilized or if it is not successfully implanted in the [[uterus]] (if previously [[fertilization|fertilized]]).

The ruptured follicle will undergo a dramatic transformation into the [[corpus luteum]], a steroidiogenic cluster of cells that maintains the [[endometrium]] of the uterus by the secretion of large amounts of [[progesterone]] and minor amounts of [[estrogen]].

These two steps, while not part of folliculogenesis, are included for completeness. They are discussed in their entirety by their respective articles, and placed into perspective by the [[menstrual cycle]] article. It is recommended that these three topics be reviewed.

==Hormone function==
As with most things related to the reproductive system, folliculogenesis is controlled by the [[endocrine system]]. Five hormones participate in an intricate process of positive and negative feedback to regulate folliculogenesis. They are:
* [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) secreted by the [[hypothalamus]]
* two [[gonadotropins]]:
** [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH)
** [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH)
* [[estrogen]]
* [[progesterone]]

GnRH stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland that will later have a stimulatory effect on follicle growth (not immediately, however, because only antral follicles are dependent on FSH and LH). When theca cells form in the tertiary follicle the amount of estrogen increases sharply (theca-derived androgen is aromatized into estrogen by the granulosa cells).

At low concentration, estrogen inhibits gonadotropins, but high concentration of estrogen stimulates them. In addition, as more estrogen is secreted, more LH receptors are made by the theca cells, inciting theca cells to create more androgen that will become estrogen downstream. This positive feedback loop causes LH to spike sharply, and it is this spike that causes ovulation.

Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition.

The endocrine system coincides with the menstrual cycle and goes through thirteen cycles (and thus thirteen LH spikes) during the course of normal folliculogenesis. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes.

== Number of follicles ==
[[File:Non-Growing Follicles.png|thumb|right|500px|"'''Percentage of ovarian reserve related to increasing age.''' The curve describes the percentage of ovarian reserve remaining at ages from birth to 55 years, based on the ADC model. 100% is taken to be the maximum ovarian reserve, occurring at 18–22 weeks post-conception. The percentages apply to all women whose ovarian reserve declines in line with our model (i.e. late and early menopause are associated with high and low peak NGF populations, respectively). We estimate that for 95% of women by the age of 30 years only 12% of their maximum pre-birth NGF population is present and by the age of 40 years only 3% remains. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0008772.g005}}"&lt;ref name="10% NGF @ age 30 study"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2010, researchers at the [[University of Edinburgh]] determined that by the time women are 30 years old, only 10% of their non-growing follicles (NGFs) remain.&lt;ref name="10% NGF @ age 30 study"/&gt; At birth, women have all their follicles for folliculogenesis, and they steadily decline until [[menopause]].

==Depletion of the ovarian reserve==
As women (and mice) age, double-strand breaks accumulate in their primordial follicle reserve.  These follicles contain primary oocytes that are arrested in prophase of the first cell division of meiosis. Double-strand breaks are accurately repaired during meiosis by searching for, and building off of, the matching strand (termed “homologous recombinational repair”).  Titus et al.&lt;ref&gt;Titus S, Li F, Stobezki R, Akula K, Unsal E, Jeong K, Dickler M, Robson M, Moy F, Goswami S, Oktay K. (2013). Impairment of BRCA1-related DNA double-strand break repair leads to ovarian aging in mice and humans.  Sci Transl Med 5(172):172ra21. {{doi|10.1126/scitranslmed.3004925}}. {{PMID|23408054}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2013) found that, as humans (and mice) age, expression of four key DNA repair genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair declines in oocytes.  They hypothesized that DNA double-strand break repair is vital for the maintenance of oocyte reserve, and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a key role in the depletion of the ovarian reserve (ovarian aging).

The '''General Dental Council''' ('''GDC''') is an organisation which regulates [[dentistry|dental]] professionals in the United Kingdom. It keeps an up-to-date register of all qualified dentists and other dental care professionals such as: [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dental therapist]]s, [[Registered Dental Nurse|dental nurse]]s, [[dental technicians]] and clinical dental technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gdc-uk.org/Aboutus/Whoweregulate/Pages/default.aspx |title=About us: Who we regulate |publisher=General Dental Council |accessdate=2 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729150559/http://www.gdc-uk.org/Aboutus/Whoweregulate/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1956 to set and maintain standards in UK dentistry, with the aims of protecting the general public from unqualified dental professionals.

Its headquarters are in Wimpole Street, [[Marylebone]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gdc-uk.org/Contactus/Pages/default.aspx |title=Contact us |publisher=General Dental Council |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808181145/http://www.gdc-uk.org/Contactus/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Dental Council has also stated that it aims to promote confidence in dental professionals and to be at the forefront of health care regulation. The GDC is tasked with ensuring that all dental professionals maintain up to date knowledge, controlling the quality of dental education in the country, ensuring a proper quality of care is given to the patients, and helping any patient who has questions or complaints. It is meant to act as a bridge of communication between the government, public and the dental professionals.

The General Dental Council is entirely funded by the profession it regulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gdc-uk.org/Aboutus/policy/Pages/policyitem.aspx?policy=Annual%20Retention%20Fee%20policy |title=About us: Policy development: Annual Retention Fee policy |publisher=General Dental Council |accessdate=20 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813083840/http://gdc-uk.org/Aboutus/policy/Pages/policyitem.aspx?policy=Annual%20Retention%20Fee%20policy |archivedate=13 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration of dental care professionals==
The professions that the GDC include in the dental care professionals group are: dental nurse, dental technician, dental therapist, dental hygienist, orthodontic therapist and clinical dental technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dental professionals: Apply for registration |publisher=General Dental Council |url=http://www.gdc-uk.org/Dentalprofessionals/Applyforregistration/Pages/default.aspx |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808202542/http://www.gdc-uk.org/Dentalprofessionals/Applyforregistration/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 2006 it became possible for dental nurses to voluntarily join the GDC register and in July 2008 it became a mandatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260203/dentalnurse.pdf |title=Internal Caseworker Guidance: Dental nurse |publisher=[[UK Government]] |date=December 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overseas Registration Exam==
The Overseas Registration Exam (ORE) is administered by the GDC, and is designed to test the knowledge, skills and professionalism of candidates against the standard expected of graduate dentists on first registration with the General Dental Council (GDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gdc-uk.org/Dentalprofessionals/ORE/Pages/default.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221084551/http://www.gdc-uk.org/Dentalprofessionals/ORE/Pages/default.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 February 2011 |title=Dental professionals: Overseas registration exam |publisher=General Dental Council |accessdate=9 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that UK graduates and overseas dentists are expected to have the same basic level of knowledge and skills.

The ORE has two parts which must be taken – and passed – in order. The purpose of Part 1 is to test the candidates' application of knowledge to clinical practice and Part 2 is designed for candidates to demonstrate practical clinical skills.

==Council==

From 1 October 2013 the Council has consisted of 12 members who are all appointed: 6 registrants and 6 lay members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staging.gdc-uk.org/Aboutus/Thecouncil/Pages/council.aspx |title=About us: Who are we: the council |publisher=General Dental Council |accessdate=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810002823/http://staging.gdc-uk.org/Aboutus/Thecouncil/Pages/council.aspx |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes were specified in the General Dental Council (Constitution) (Amendment) Order 2012 that was made in July 2012. The new Council took office on 1 October 2013, supported by other new governance arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staging.gdc-uk.org/Aboutus/Thecouncil/Documents/Evaluation%20of%202013%20Council%20recruitment.pdf |title=Review of the Recruitment of the Council 2013 |publisher=General Dental Council |accessdate=9 August 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council is led by the first appointed Chair of the GDC, Bill Moyes, who took up office on 1 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gdc-uk.org/Newsandpublications/Pressreleases/Pages/General-Dental-Council-announces-first-appointed-Chair.aspx |title=Press release: General Dental Council announces first appointed Chair |publisher=General Dental Council |date=31 May 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216140525/http://www.gdc-uk.org/Newsandpublications/Pressreleases/Pages/General-Dental-Council-announces-first-appointed-Chair.aspx |archivedate=16 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Moyes currently holds non-executive directorships with the Office of Fair Trading, the Priory Hospital Group, and the Legal Services Board. He is a trustee of the Catholic Trust of England and Wales and chairman of the boardof Governors of Heythrop College, a constituent college of the University of London. He was previously Executive Chairman of Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts from 2004 to 2010, during the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust Scandal and Director General of the British Retail Consortium from 2000 to 2003.

==History==
It was established in 1956 by an amendment to the [[Dentists Act 1948]], now updated in the [[Dentists Act 1984]].

The Council was originally set up in 1956 with 50 members but has been restructured, with the number of members decreasing each time. On 1 October 2009, a smaller fully appointed Council took office with 24 members and a balance of 12 lay and 12 professional. The last Chair of the GDC to be elected was qualified dentist Kevin O'Brien who was in post from 21 September 2011 to 30 September 2013. In October 2013 further restructuring occurred.

== Oversight of health and social care regulators ==

The [[Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care]] (PSA), is an independent body accountable to the UK Parliament, which promotes the health and wellbeing of the public and oversees the nine UK healthcare regulators, including the General Dental Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/regulators/statutory-regulators-directory/organisation-profile?id=94025dcf-9d29-443c-8eb0-62ab9ac2ebfd |title=Statutory Regulators Directory: Organisation Profile: General Dental Council (GDC) |publisher=Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care |accessdate=20 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129022743/http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/regulators/statutory-regulators-directory/organisation-profile?id=94025dcf-9d29-443c-8eb0-62ab9ac2ebfd |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSA review the performance of all regulators on an annual basis, identifying where things are being done well and where improvements can be made.&lt;ref name="PSA overseeing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/regulators/overseeing-regulators |title=Regulators: Overseeing Regulators |publisher=Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSA review all final decisions made by fitness to practise committees. The PSA audit the initial stages of fitness to practise processes to examine whether the regulator is using effective decision-making processes.&lt;ref name="PSA overseeing" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Concerns about cost-effectiveness, levels of confidence in the GDC and cost-effectiveness of fitness to practise procedures were put to the CEO Evlynne Gilvarry by the BDA in an interview that was published in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v217/n5/full/sj.bdj.2014.784.html |title=Evlynne Gilvarry: GDC view on the 2014 ARF consultation  |first=Ruth |last=Doherty |journal=British Dental Journal |volume=217 |issue=5  |page=218–220 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2014.784 |date=12 September 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Retention Fees ===
The GDC recently ran a consultation on the Annual Retention Fee (ARF) policy, which was open from 16 April until 4 June 2014. The GDC had received over 4000 responses to the consultation on the proposed 64% rise in the Annual Retention, fee, and 97% of responses were critical of the rise. The BDA took the step of appointing Forensic Accountants to analyse the figures presented by the GDC as justification for the rise. The subsequent report was quoted as being 'Damning' and resulted in the GDC having to engage KPMG to assess the figures which had been presented as evidence. In September 2014 the GDC's proposed increase in Annual Retention Fees led to threats of legal action from the [[British Dental Association]], the trade union and representative body of UK dentists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bda.org/news-centre/press-releases/47174-bda-tells-gdc-step-back-or-face-legal-challenge.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140920201501/http://www.bda.org/news-centre/press-releases/47174-bda-tells-gdc-step-back-or-face-legal-challenge.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 September 2014 |title=Press release: BDA tells GDC – “Step back or face legal challenge” |publisher=[[British Dental Association]] |date=4 September 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Professional Standards Authority have also been highly critical of the GDC in recent months. The GDC is the poorest performing regulator in the eyes of the Professional Standards Authority, failing on 8 aspects of its assessment.

=== Fitness to practise process===
The initial stages of the GDC's fitness to practise process were audited by the PSA with the findings published in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/docs/default-source/audit-reports/gdc-ftp-audit-report-2013.pdf |title=Audit of the General Dental Council's initial stages fitness to practise process |publisher=Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care |date=December 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235903/http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/docs/default-source/audit-reports/gdc-ftp-audit-report-2013.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dental Protection Limited have been highly critical of the way in which the GDC approach the Fitness to Practise Proceedings that are the disciplinary hearings Dentists have to undergo. The PSA announced in May 2014 that it would be undertaking an investigation of the management and support processes of the General Dental Council's Investigating Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/footer-pages/news-and-media/latest-news/news-article?id=7bf2589e-2ce2-6f4b-9ceb-ff0000b2236b |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141103182638/http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/footer-pages/news-and-media/latest-news/news-article?id=7bf2589e-2ce2-6f4b-9ceb-ff0000b2236b |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 November 2014 |title=News: GDC Investigation 2014 |publisher=Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Egyptian history ==
Many ancient [[Arab]]ic physicians were interested in the field of geriatrics and some of them wrote separate books on this subject. Abu Ali Ibn-Sina [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/saab/avicenna/|title=Ibn Sina / Avicenna - Saab Medical Library - AUB|website=ddc.aub.edu.lb|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1025) was the first book to offer instruction for the care of the [[Ageing|aged]]. In a chapter entitled "Regimen of Old Age", Avicenna was concerned with how "old folk need plenty of sleep", how their bodies should be [[Anointing|anointed]] with [[oil]], and recommended [[exercise]]s such as [[walking]] or [[Equestrianism|horse-riding]]. Thesis III of the ''Canon'' discussed the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] suitable for [[Old age|old people]], and dedicated several sections to elderly patients who become [[Constipation|constipated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna and the care of the aged by TH Howell ''Gerontologist'' 1972 12: 424-426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/4931547 Gerontology and geriatrics in the works of Abu Ali Ibn Sina  in ''Sovetskoe zdravookhranenie'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the famous Physician [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]] (''Algizar'') Al-Qayrawani (circa 898–980) wrote a special book on the medicine and health of elderly (''Kitab Tibb Al Machayikh'')&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm Al Jazzar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155736/http://www.islam.org.br/al_jazzar.htm |date=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or (''Teb Al-Mashaikh wa hefz sehatahom'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bium.univ-paris5.fr/ishm/vesalius/VESx1998x04x01.pdf|title=''Vesalius'' Official journal of the International Society for the History of Medicine|website=univ-paris5.fr|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a book on sleep disorders and  another one on forgetfulness and how to strengthen memory (''Kitab Al Nissian wa Toroq Taqwiati Adhakira'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medarus.org/Medecins/MedecinsTextes/al_jazzar.htm |title=Algizar a web page in french |website=medarus.org |accessdate=9 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407202425/http://medarus.org/Medecins/MedecinsTextes/al_jazzar.htm |archivedate=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geritt Bos, ''Ibn al-Jazzar'', ''Risala fi l-isyan'' (Treatise on forgetfulness), London, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and a Treatise on causes of mortality (''Rissala Fi Asbab Al Wafah'').&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Another Arabic physician in the 9th century, [[Ishaq ibn Hunayn]] (died in 910) wrote a Treatise on Drugs for Forgetfulness (''Risalah al-Shafiyah fi adwiyat al-nisyan'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_08.html|title=Islamic Culture and the Medical Arts: Specialized Literature|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering the cost of healthcare is a major challenge for seniors (defined as 60 years or older in Egypt&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kowal &amp; Karen Peachey (2001): Indicators for the Minimum Data Set Project on Ageing: A Critical Review in sub-Saharan Africa. World Health Organization report on 2001 Dar es Salaam MDS Meeting WHO/EIP/GPE/01.1 http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageing_mds_report_en_daressalaam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). Currently, 62 percent of elderly men have health insurance compared to 35 percent of elderly women. However, medical care for the elderly, in the absence of a comprehensive health insurance plan, is extremely expensive.

The total number of beds for elder people was 3856. The health services were distributed all over the country. In each governorate (province), there are the three levels of health care, primary, secondary and tertiary; but the geriatric specialty is presented mostly in Cairo, and a few big cities.

The number of consultants in geriatric medicine was around 12 and are mainly based in the capital of Egypt. As regarding health insurance there are 352 units which are mainly clinics (202), beneficiaries are 7.5 millions in which pensioners and widows 1.8 millions. Despite such high percentage of older people there is no geriatric specialist or consultant with the health insurance agency.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

**The Egyptian Alzheimer’s Society has branches in Cairo, Alexandria, Assiut, Mansoura, Ismailia and Suez. It is moving forward in its work by entering into dialogue with carers to find out what they want. A number of initiatives have been set up in this way – including the production of a regular newsletter, carer support groups and a telephone help line – with varying degrees of success. The most welcomed initiative by family carers has been setting up respite care. The Society also provides a number of services – including memory clinics, home-based assessments and family support, and bi-monthly family carer training and counselling programmes. In addition, the Society continues with its awareness and education programme and has found that the consequence of enhanced awareness has been an increased drive to act and achieve on behalf of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alz.co.uk/adi/pdf/gp200207.pdf|title=Az Newsletter|website=alz.co.uk|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55560">This is a glossary of some of the terms used in [[phytopathology]].

Phytopathology is the study of plant diseases.  It is a multi-disciplinary science since prerequisites for disease development are the presence of a susceptible host species, a pathogen and the appropriate environmental conditions.  This is known as the [[glossary of phytopathology#disease triangle|disease triangle]].  Because of this interaction, the terminology used in phytopathology often comes from other disciplines including those dealing with the host species ([[Botany| botany / plant science]], [[plant physiology]]), the pathogen ([[Bacteria|bacteriology]], [[mycology]], [[Nematodes|nematology]], [[virology]]), the environment and disease management practices ([[agronomy]], [[soil science]], [[meteorology]], [[environmental science]], [[ecology]], [[plant breeding]], [[pesticides]], [[entomology]]), and areas of study that apply to both the host and pathogen ([[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[molecular genetics]]).  The result is that most phytopathological glossary include terms from these other disciplines in addition to terms ([[glossary of phytopathology#disease incidence|disease incidence]], [[glossary of phytopathology#horizontal resistance|horizontal resistance]], [[glossary of phytopathology#gene-for-gene hypothesis|gene-for-gene relationship]], [[glossary of phytopathology#blast|blast]], [[glossary of phytopathology#scab|scab]] and so on) that are specific to, or which have a unique meaning in phytopathology. This glossary is no exception. However, for the sake of brevity, it has, for the most part, restricted terms from other disciplines to those that pertain to the pathogen.  At some point, these terms should be moved to other glossaries (e.g. [[glossary of mycology]], [[glossary of nematology]], and so on).

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
'''Herd immunity''' (also called '''herd effect''', '''community immunity''', '''population immunity''', or '''social immunity''') is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] to an infection, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=P.|last2=Eames|first2=K.|last3=Heymann|first3=D.

&lt;!-- Methods --&gt;
Individual immunity can be gained through recovering from a natural infection or through artificial means such as [[vaccination]].&lt;ref name=merrill /&gt; Some individuals cannot become immune due to medical reasons and in this group herd immunity is an important method of protection.&lt;ref name="ofg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity|title=Herd Immunity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ska &gt;{{cite book|last1=Somerville|first1=M.|last2=Kumaran|first2=K.|last3=Anderson|first3=R.|date=19 January 2012|title=Public Health and Epidemiology at a Glance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rnPItVn_oEC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=58–59|isbn=978-1118308646|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a certain threshold has been reached, herd immunity gradually eliminates a disease from a population.&lt;ref name=ska /&gt; This elimination, if achieved worldwide, may result in the permanent reduction in the number of infections to zero, called eradication.&lt;ref name=cliffsr &gt;{{cite book|last1=Cliff|first1=A.|last2=Smallman-Raynor|first2=M.|date=11 April 2013|title=Oxford Textbook of Infectious Disease Control: A Geographical Analysis from Medieval Quarantine to Global Eradication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqhDZkWJjPQC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=125–36|isbn=978-0199596614|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was used for the eradication of [[smallpox]] in 1977 and for the regional elimination of other diseases.&lt;ref name=pmid21604922 &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=T.

&lt;!-- History, society and culture --&gt;
The term herd immunity was first used in 1923.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt; It was recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when it was observed that after a significant number of children had become immune to [[measles]], the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among [[Susceptible individual|susceptible]] children.&lt;ref name=pmid15106084 &gt;*{{cite journal|last1=Hinman|first1=A.

{{Further|Mathematical modelling of infectious disease}}

Individuals who are immune to a disease act as a barrier in the spread of disease, slowing or preventing the transmission of disease to others.&lt;ref name=merrill /&gt; An individual's immunity can be acquired via a natural infection or through artificial means, such as vaccination.&lt;ref name=merrill /&gt; When a critical proportion of the population becomes immune, called the ''herd immunity threshold'' (HIT) or ''herd immunity level'' (HIL), the disease may no longer persist in the population, ceasing to be [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]].&lt;ref name=ska /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24175217 /&gt; This threshold can be calculated by taking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[basic reproduction number]], or the average number of new infections caused by each case in an entirely susceptible population that is homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning each individual can come into contact with every other susceptible individual in the population,&lt;ref name=pmid15627236 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24175217 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19197342 /&gt; and multiplying it by ''S'', the proportion of the population who are susceptible to infection:

: &lt;math&gt; \ R_0 \cdot S = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

''S'' can be rewritten as (1 - ''p'') because ''p'' is the proportion of the population that is immune and ''p'' + ''S'' equals one. Then, the equation can be rearranged to place ''p'' by itself as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \ R_0 \cdot (1-p) = 1, &lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt; 1-p = \frac {1} {R_0}, &lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt; p_c = 1 - \frac {1} {R_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

With ''p'' being by itself on the left side of the equation, it can now be written as ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; to represent the critical proportion of the population needed to become immune to stop the transmission of disease, or the herd immunity threshold.&lt;ref name=pmid15627236 /&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; functions as a measure of contagiousness, so low ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values are associated with lower HITs, whereas higher ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;s result in higher HITs.&lt;ref name=pmid24175217 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19197342 /&gt; For example, the HIT for a disease with an ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of 2 theoretically is only 50%, whereas with disease with an ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of 10 the HIT is 90%.&lt;ref name=pmid24175217 /&gt; These calculations assume that the entire population is susceptible, meaning no individuals are immune to the disease. In reality, varying proportions of the population are immune to any given disease at any given time.&lt;ref name=pmid15627236 /&gt; To account for this, the effective reproductive number ''R''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, also written as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, or the average number of infections caused at time ''t'', can found by multiplying ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by the fraction of the population that is still susceptible. When ''R''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced to and sustained below 1, the number of cases occurring in the population gradually decreases until the disease has been eliminated.&lt;ref name=pmid15627236 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24175217 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dabmago &gt;{{cite book|last1=Dabbaghian|first1=V.|last2=Mago|first2=V.

A second assumption in these calculations is that populations are homogeneous, or well-mixed, meaning that every individual comes into contact with every other individual, when in reality populations are better described as social networks as individuals tend to cluster together, remaining in relatively close contact with a limited number of other individuals. In these networks, transmission only occurs between those who are geographically or physically close to one another.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19197342 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid20667876 /&gt; The shape and size of a network is likely to alter a disease's HIT, making incidence either more or less common.&lt;ref name=pmid24175217 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19197342 /&gt; In heterogeneous populations, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is now considered to be a measure of the number of cases generated by a "typical" infectious person, which depends on how individuals within a network interact with each other.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt; Interactions within networks are more common than between networks, in which case the most highly connected networks transmit disease more easily, resulting in a higher ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a higher HIT than would be required in a less connected network.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid20667876 /&gt; In networks that either opt not to become immune or are not immunized sufficiently, diseases may persist despite not existing in better-immunized networks.&lt;ref name=pmid20667876 /&gt;

===Vaccination===
{{Main|Vaccination|Vaccine}}

The primary way to boost levels of immunity in a population is through vaccination.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid22561998 &gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 22561998| year = 2012| author1 = Rashid| first1 = H| title = Vaccination and herd immunity: What more do we know?| journal = Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases| volume = 25| issue = 3| pages = 243–49| last2 = Khandaker| first2 = G| last3 = Booy| first3 = R| doi = 10.1097/QCO.0b013e328352f727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccination is originally based on the observation that milkmaids exposed to [[cowpox]] were immune to smallpox, so the practice of [[inoculation|inoculating]] people with the cowpox virus began as a way to prevent smallpox.&lt;ref name=pmid23760373 /&gt; Well-developed vaccines provide protection in a far safer way than natural infections, as vaccines generally do not cause the diseases they protect against and severe adverse effects are significantly less common than complications from natural infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 25086160| year = 2014| author1 = Maglione| first1 = M.

Assuming a vaccine is 100% effective, then the equation used for calculating the herd immunity threshold can be used for calculating the vaccination level needed to eliminate a disease, written as ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt; Vaccines are usually imperfect however, so the effectiveness, ''E'', of a vaccine must be accounted for:

: &lt;math&gt; V_c = \frac {1 - \frac {1} {R_0}}{E}. &lt;/math&gt;

From this equation, it can be observed that if ''E'' is less than (1 − 1/''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), then it is impossible to eliminate a disease, even if the entire population is vaccinated.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt; Similarly, waning vaccine-induced immunity, as occurs with [[DPT vaccine#Combination vaccines with acellular pertussis|acellular pertussis vaccines]], requires higher levels of booster vaccination to sustain herd immunity.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25560446 /&gt; If a disease has ceased to be endemic to a population, then natural infections no longer contribute to a reduction in the fraction of the population that is susceptible. Only vaccination contributes to this reduction.&lt;ref name=pmid15627236 /&gt; The relation between vaccine coverage and effectiveness and disease incidence can be shown by subtracting the product of the effectiveness of a vaccine and the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, from the herd immunity threshold equation as follows:
[[File:Measles cases coverage eastern mediterranean.jpg|right|thumb|Measles vaccine coverage and reported measles cases in [[Eastern Mediterranean]] countries. As coverage increased, the number of cases decreased.]]
: &lt;math&gt; (1 - \frac {1} {R_0}) - (E \times p_v). &lt;/math&gt;

It can be observed from this equation that, ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', any increase in either vaccine coverage or vaccine effectiveness, including any increase in excess of a disease's HIT, further reduces the number of cases of a disease.&lt;ref name=pmid15627236 /&gt; The rate of decline in cases depends on a disease's ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with diseases with lower ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values experiencing sharper declines.&lt;ref name=pmid15627236 /&gt; Vaccines usually have at least one [[contraindication]] for a specific population for medical reasons, but if both effectiveness and coverage are high enough herd immunity can protect these individuals.&lt;ref name=pmid22773718 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23910028 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tulvar /&gt; Vaccine effectiveness is often, but not always, adversely affected by passive immunity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 22841972| year = 2012| author1 = Leuridan| first1 = E| title = Measles outbreak in Europe: Susceptibility of infants too young to be immunized| journal = Vaccine| volume = 30| issue = 41| pages = 5905–13| last2 = Sabbe| first2 = M| last3 = Van Damme| first3 = P| doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.07.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 22189699| year = 2012| author1 = Hodgins| first1 = D.

===Passive immunity===
{{Main|Passive immunity}}

Individual immunity can also be gained passively, in which [[Antibody|antibodies]] to a pathogen are transferred from one individual to another. This can occur naturally, whereby maternal antibodies, primarily [[immunoglobulin G]] antibodies, are transferred across the placenta and in colostrum to fetuses and newborns,&lt;ref name=pmid20956021 &gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 20956021| year = 2010| author1 = Chucri| first1 = T.

==Cost–benefit analysis==
Herd immunity is often accounted for when conducting [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost–benefit analyses]] of vaccination programs. It is regarded as a [[Externality#Positive|positive externality]] of high levels of immunity, producing an additional benefit of disease reduction that would not occur had no herd immunity been generated in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bärnighausen, T.; Bloom, D.

==History==
[[File:Measles US 1944-2007 inset.png|right|thumb|Measles cases in the [[United States]] before and after mass vaccination against measles began.]]
The term ''herd immunity'' was first used in 1923 to refer to an entire population's immunity, in reference to research examining disease mortality in [[mouse]] populations with varying degrees of immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Topley|first1=W. W. C.|last2=Wilson|first2=G. S.|date=May 1923|title=The Spread of Bacterial Infection. The Problem of Herd-Immunity|journal=The Journal of Hygiene (London)|volume= 21|issue=3|pages=243–249|doi=10.1017/s0022172400031478|pmid=20474777|pmc=2167341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herd immunity was first recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when A. W. Hedrich published research on the [[epidemiology]] of measles in [[Baltimore]] and took notice that after many children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children.&lt;ref name=pmid15106084 /&gt; In spite of this knowledge, efforts to control and eliminate measles were unsuccessful until mass vaccination using the [[measles vaccine]] began in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=pmid15106084 /&gt; Mass vaccination, discussions of disease eradication, and cost–benefit analyses of vaccination subsequently prompted more widespread use of the term ''herd immunity''.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt; In the 1970s, the theorem used to calculated a disease's herd immunity threshold was developed.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt; During the [[Smallpox#Eradication|smallpox eradication campaign]] in the 1960s and 1970s, the practice of ''[[ring vaccination]]'', of which herd immunity is integral to, began as a way to immunize every person in a "ring" around an infected individual to prevent outbreaks from spreading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 7044193| year = 1982| author1 = Strassburg| first1 = M. A.| title = The global eradication of smallpox| journal = American journal of infection control| volume = 10| issue = 2| pages = 53–59| doi=10.1016/0196-6553(82)90003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the adoption of mass and ring vaccination, complexities and challenges to herd immunity have arisen.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22561998"/&gt; Modeling of the spread of infectious disease originally made a number of assumptions, namely that entire populations are susceptible and well-mixed, which do not exist in reality, so more precise equations have been developed.&lt;ref name=pmid21427399 /&gt; In recent decades, it has been recognized that the dominant strain of a microorganism in circulation may change due to herd immunity, either because of herd immunity acting as an evolutionary pressure or because herd immunity against one strain allowed another already-existing strain to spread.&lt;ref name=pmid21310617 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid22903767 /&gt; Emerging or ongoing [[vaccine controversies]] and various reasons for opposing vaccination have reduced or eliminated herd immunity in certain communities, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to these communities.&lt;ref name=pmid22926181 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23584253 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23807359 /&gt;

[[Bread]] was central to the formation of early human societies. From the western half of Asia, where [[wheat]] was [[domestication|domesticated]], [[Agriculture|cultivation]] spread north and west, to Europe and North Africa. This in turn led to the formation of towns, as opposed to the [[nomad]]ic lifestyle, and gave rise to more and more sophisticated forms of societal organization. Similar developments occurred in eastern Asia, centered on rice, and in the Americas with maize.

==Antiquity==

Charred crumbs of a [[flatbread]] made by  proto-[[Natufian]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s from wild wheat, wild barley and plant roots between 14,600 and 11,600 years ago have been found at the Shubayqa 1 archaeological site in the [[Harrat al-Shamah|Black Desert]] in [[Jordan]], predating the earliest known making of bread from cultivated wheat by thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Briggs2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Briggs |first1=Helen |title=Prehistoric bake-off: Recipe for oldest bread revealed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44846874 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=17 July 2018 |date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arranz-Otaegui Gonzalez Carretero Ramsey Fuller p=201801071"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Arranz-Otaegui | first=Amaia | last2=Gonzalez Carretero | first2=Lara | last3=Ramsey | first3=Monica N. | last4=Fuller | first4=Dorian Q. | last5=Richter | first5=Tobias | title=Archaeobotanical evidence reveals the origins of bread 14,400 years ago in northeastern Jordan | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | date=16 July 2018 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1801071115 | page=201801071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common source of leavening in antiquity was to retain a piece of dough (with sugar and water in) from the previous day to utilize as a form of [[sourdough]] [[pre-ferment|starter]].&lt;ref&gt;Tannahill p. 68f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] reported that the [[Gauls]] and [[Iberians]] used the foam skimmed from beer to produce "a lighter kind of bread than other peoples." Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of [[Must|grape must]] and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast.

The idea of a free-standing oven that could be pre-heated, with a door for access, appears to have been Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint-Samat 2009, p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in antiquity there were a wide variety of breads.  In ancient times the Greek bread was barley bread: [[Solon]] declared that wheaten bread might only be baked for feast days. By the 5th century BC bread could be purchased in Athens from a baker's shop, and in Rome, Greek bakers appeared in the 2nd century BC, as Hellenized Asia Minor was added to Roman dominion as the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]];&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint-Samat 2009, p.204 gives a date of 168 for "a considerable influx of craftsmen bakers (''pistores'') of Greek origin into Rome".&lt;/ref&gt; the foreign bakers of bread were permitted to form a ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]''.  In the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', the author [[Athenaeus]] (c.A.D.170 – c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in the Classical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chrysippus of Tyana]] gives a list of thirty kinds, without commentary (Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 202).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit.  The type and quality of flours used to produce bread could also vary, as noted by [[Diphilus]] when he declared "bread made of wheat, as compared with that made of [[barley]], is more nourishing, more digestible, and in every way superior."  In order of merit, the bread made from refined [thoroughly sieved] flour comes first, after that bread from ordinary wheat, and then the unbolted, made of flour that has not been sifted."&lt;ref&gt;Tannahill p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The essentiality of bread in the diet was reflected in the name for the rest of the meal: ''ópson'', "condiment", i.e. bread's accompaniment, whatever it might be.&lt;ref&gt;Changes in diet are reflected in the modern significance of ''opson'' as fish (Toussaint-Samat 2009, p. 202); in Italy the ''[[contorni]]'' are now the accompaniment to meat rather than bread.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Peasants breaking bread.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--fmt for low img--&gt;|Peasants sharing bread, from the ''Livre du roi Modus et de la reine Ratio'', France, 14th century. ([[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]])]]
In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], bread served not only as a [[staple food]] but also as part of the table service.  In the standard table setting of the day the [[Trencher (tableware)|trencher]], a piece of [[staling|stale bread]] roughly 6&amp;nbsp;inches by 4&amp;nbsp;inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm by 10&amp;nbsp;cm), was served as an absorbent plate.  At the completion of a meal the trencher could then be eaten, given to the poor, or fed to the dogs. It was not until the 15th century that trenchers made of wood started to replace the bread variety.&lt;ref&gt;Tannahill p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

==To the 19th century==

Up to the 19th century, bread sold in Europe was often adulterated with hazardous materials, including chalk, sawdust, alum, plaster, clay and ammonium carbonate. This gradually came to an end with government action, such as the 1860 and 1899 Food Adulteration Acts in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Coley |first=Noel |date=1 March 2005 |title=The fight against food adulteration |url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=46–49 |dead-url=no |magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614144230/https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |archive-date=14 June 2018 |access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; America had a more difficult time ending these processes of adulteration however, as various states had varying policies regarding bread making. &lt;ref&gt; MS., City Clerk's Office, Record Book, 1814-1820, pp. 3, 5. &lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, the British empire encouraged a noticeable increase in import of bread from the colonies. This was regarded as British bread despite its origins, and institutes such as the Imperial Economic Committee encouraged the consumption and trade of foods such as bread from across the empire as they viewed it as cementing Britain's position in its colonies further. Advancements in refrigeration technology and techniques also encouraged an increase in the import of bread, as it could be preserved a lot longer than before and could be transported over longer distances. Bread was transported and stored using refrigeration more than most other foods, particularly in North America, as it was a staple food in most diets, more so than other staple foods like meat. &lt;ref&gt; The Trade Marks Journal. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialization==

Bread-baking was industrialised at the start of the 20th century. [[Otto Frederick Rohwedder]] developed a prototype [[sliced bread|bread-slicing]] machine in 1912, and a practical machine that both sliced and wrapped bread in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chillicothecity.org/bread/breadnews1.html#070708|title=Sliced Bread Turns 80 Years Old|date=July 7, 2008|work=Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It occupies a section in [[Sigfried Giedion]], [1948] 1969. ''Mechanization Takes Command'' (Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|thumb|An automated bakery with industrial robots palletizing bread, Germany]]

A major change was the development in 1961 of the [[Chorleywood bread process|Chorleywood Bread Process]]. This used the intense mechanical working of dough, and control of gases touching dough, to dramatically reduce the [[Fermentation in food processing|fermentation]] period and the time taken to produce a loaf at the expense of taste and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allotment.org.uk/recipes/bread-making/chorleywood-process Criticisms of the Chorleywood bread process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522022319/http://www.allotment.org.uk/recipes/bread-making/chorleywood-process |date=22 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For generations, white bread was the preferred bread of the rich while the poor ate dark (whole grain) bread. However, in most western societies, the connotations reversed in the late 20th century, with whole grain bread becoming preferred as having superior nutritional value while Chorleywood bread became associated with lower-class ignorance of nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Christianne L.H. Hupkens, Ronald A. Knibbe and Maris J. Drop, for example analyzed social class variation in the intake of fat and fibre, including white bread consumption, in Maastricht, Liège and Aachen, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WB2-45RFD9K-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=f44217b8c767b67f9dccd684cdec64e0 "Social Class Differences in Women's Fat and Fibre Consumption: A Cross-National Study" 1995]; the literature on class perceptions and diet is enormous.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, and especially in smaller retail bakeries, [[Flour treatment agent|chemical additives]] are used that both speed up mixing time and reduce necessary fermentation time, so that a batch of bread may be mixed, made up, risen, and baked in fewer than three hours.  Dough that does not require fermentation because of chemical additives is called "quick bread" by commercial bakers. Common additives include reducing agents such as [[Cysteine|L-cysteine]] or [[sodium metabisulfite]], and oxidants such as [[potassium bromate]] or [[ascorbic acid]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pyler |first=Ernst John |title=Our Daily Bread |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EaPQAAACAAJ |year=1958 |publisher=Siebel |page=703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elkassabany |first=M. |last2=Hoseney |first2=R.C. |last3=Seib |first3=P.A. |year=1980 |title=Ascorbic Acid as an Oxidant in Wheat Flour Dough.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44660">[[Psychopathy]], from psych (soul or mind) and pathy (suffering or disease), was coined by German [[psychiatrists]] in the 19th century and originally just meant what would today be called [[mental disorder]], the study of which is still known as [[psychopathology]]. By the turn of the century 'psychopathic inferiority' referred to the type of mental disorder that might now be termed [[personality disorder]], along with a wide variety of other conditions now otherwise classified. Through the early 20th century this and other terms such as 'constitutional (inborn) psychopaths' or 'psychopathic personalities', were used very broadly to cover anyone who violated legal or moral expectations or was considered inherently socially undesirable in some way.

The term '''sociopathy''' was popularized from 1929/30 by an American [[psychologist]], originally intended as an alternative term to indicate that the defining feature was a pervasive failure to adhere to societal norms in a way that could harm others. The term psychopathy also gradually narrowed to the latter sense, based on interpretations of the work of a Scottish psychiatrist and especially checklists popularized by an American psychiatrist and later a Canadian psychologist. Psychopathy became defined in these quarters as a constellation of personality traits allegedly associated with immorality, criminality, or in some cases socioeconomic success.

Official psychiatric diagnostic manuals adopted a mixture of approaches, eventually going by the term [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial or dissocial personality disorder]]. In the meantime concepts of psychopaths/sociopaths had become notorious among the general public and [[Fictional portrayals of psychopaths|as characters in fiction]].

==Early literature==
Historical descriptions of people or characters are sometimes noted in discussions of psychopathy, with claims of superficial resemblance or [[retrospective diagnosis]]. For example, a [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] by [[Theophrastus]] in [[Ancient Greece]] concerning ''The Unscrupulous Man''.&lt;ref&gt;Millon, T., Simonsen, E., Birket-Smith, M. Historical Conceptions of Psychopathy in the United States and Europe. In T. Millon &amp; E. Simonsen (Eds.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSiBsdxcGigC&amp;vq=Historical+conceptions+of+psychopathy&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychopathy: Antisocial, criminal, and violent behavior] New York, NY, US: Guildford Press&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the ancient Greek military statesman [[Alcibiades]] has been described as the best example of a probable psychopath&amp;nbsp;– due to inconsistent failures despite his potential and confident speaking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hervey Cleckley]], [[The Mask of Sanity]]&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of [[insanity]] (e.g. [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], [[libertines]], the "mad") have, at least since the 18th century, often represented an image of darkness and threat to society, as later would "the psychopath"&amp;nbsp;– a mixture of concepts of dangerousness, evil and illness.&lt;ref&gt;Federman, C. Holmes, D. Jacob, JD (2009) [https://montclair.academia.edu/CaryFederman/Papers/705855/Deconstructing_the_Psychopath_A_Critical_Discursive_Analysis Deconstructing the psychopath: a critical discursive analysis] Cultural Critique, 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early clinical concepts==

Psychiatric concepts began to develop in the early 19th century which to some extent fed into the use of the term psychopathy from the late 19th century, when that term still had a different and far broader meaning than today. In 1801, French psychiatrist [[Philippe Pinel]] described without moral judgment patients who appeared mentally unimpaired but who nonetheless engaged in impulsive and self-defeating acts. He described this as insanity without confusion/delusion (manie sans délire), or rational insanity (la folie raisonnante), and his anecdotes generally described people carried away by instinctive fury (instincte fureur). American [[Benjamin Rush]] wrote in 1812 about individuals with an apparent "perversion of the moral faculties", which he saw as a sign of innate defective organization. He also saw such people as objects of compassion whose mental alienation could be helped, even if that was in prison or what he referred to as the "[[christian]] system of [[criminal]] [[jurisprudence]]".&lt;ref name=Toch/&gt; In 1835 English psychiatrist [[James Cowles Prichard]], based partly on Pinel's publications, developed a broad category of mental disorder he called [[moral insanity]] - a "madness" of emotional or social dispositions without significant [[delusions]] or [[hallucinations]]. Generally Prichard referred more to eccentric behaviour than, as had Pinel, out of control passions. Prichard's diagnosis came into widespread use in Europe for several decades. None of these concepts are comparable to current specific constructs of psychopathy, or even to the broader category of personality disorders. Moreover, "moral" did not necessarily refer at that time to morality but to the psychological or emotional faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitlock|first=F. A.|title=A Note on Moral Insanity and Psychopathic Disorders|journal=Psychiatric Bulletin|date=1 April 1982|volume=6|issue=4|pages=57–59|doi=10.1192/pb.6.4.57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 19th century the (pseudo) scientific study of individuals thought to lack a conscience flourished. Notably the Italian physician [[Cesare Lombroso]] rejected the view that criminality could occur in anyone and sought to identify particular "[[born criminal]]s" who he thought showed certain physical signs, such as proportionately long arms or a low and narrow forehead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/d186445v73407582/ Mythos and Mental Illness: Psychopathy, Fantasy, and Contemporary Moral Life (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benning TB |title=Neuroimaging psychopathy: lessons from Lombroso |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=183 |issue= 6|pages=563–4 |date=December 2003 |doi=10.1192/bjp.183.6.563|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/183/6/563}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of the 20th century the English psychiatrist [[Henry Maudsley]] was writing about not just "moral insanity" but the "moral imbecile" and "criminal psychosis", conditions he believed were genetic in origin and impervious to punishment or correction, and which he applied to the lower [[Social class|class]] of chronic offenders by comparison to "the higher [[Industry|industrial]] classes".&lt;ref name=Toch&gt;Toch, H. Chapter 9: Psychopathy or Antisocial Personality in Forensic Settings. In T. Millon &amp; E. Simonsen (Eds.) (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSiBsdxcGigC&amp;vq=Historical+conceptions+of+psychopathy&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychopathy: Antisocial, criminal, and violent behavior] New York, NY, US: Guildford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_dai69OlFkC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The pathology of mind] (1895) by [[Henry Maudsley]], Chapter 3, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==First uses of term==

Initially physicians who specialised in mental disorders might be referred to as psychopaths (e.g. the ''American Journal of the Medical Sciences'' in 1864) and their hospitals as psychopathic institutions (compare to the etymologically similar use of the term [[homeopathic]]). Treatments of physical conditions by psychological or spiritualist methods might be referred to as psychopathic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7R6OrFVRxKoC Mental Medicine] WF Evans. Originally published 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to the 1840s, the term psychopathy was also used in a way consistent with its [[etymology]] to refer to any illness of the mind. German psychiatrist [[von Feuchtersleben]]'s (1845) ''The Principles of Medical Psychology'', which was translated into English, used it in this sense, as well as the roughly equivalent new term [[psychosis]], now traced back to [[Karl Friedrich Canstatt]]'s ''Handbuch der Medicinischen Klinik'' (1841).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06058b.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia] (1909)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1918589 | pmid=13155507 | volume=47 | title=A forgotten psychiatrist: Baron Ernst von Feuchtersleben, 1833 | journal=Proc R Soc Med | pages=190–4 | last1 = Burns | first1 = CL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bürgy | first1 = Martin | year = 2008 | title = The Concept of Psychosis: Historical and Phenomenological Aspects | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/6/1200.full | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1200–1210 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbm136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Griesinger]] (1868) and [[Krafft-Ebing]] (1886) also notably employed the term in distinct ways.

The use of the term in a criminological context was popularised by a high-profile legal case in Russia between 1883 and 1885, concerning the murder of a girl who had previously lived in Britain for some time, Sarah Becker (Sarra Bekker). The owner of the [[pawnbroker]] shop in which she worked and where her body was found, a retired military man Mr Mironovich, was eventually convicted on circumstantial evidence and imprisoned. In the meantime, however, a Ms Semenova had handed herself in saying she had killed Becker while trying to steal jewellery with her lover Bezak, a married policeman, though she soon recanted and changed her confession. Semenova was found not guilty following testimony from eminent Russian psychiatrist Prof Ivan M. Balinsky, who described her as a psychopath, still then a very general term. Dictionaries to this day note this as the first use of the noun, via British or American articles which had suggested a known murderer had been released and in some cases that psychopaths should be immediately hanged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2011: Psychopath: 1885 Pall Mall G. 21 Jan.

Balinsky's explanation of the new malady. ‘The psychopath‥is a type which has only recently come under the notice of medical science.‥ Beside his own person and his own interests, nothing is sacred to the psychopath’.

In 1888 [[Julius Ludwig August Koch]] first published on his concept of "psychopathic inferiority" (psychopathische Minderwertigkeiten), which would become influential domestically and internationally. He used it to refer to various kinds of dysfunction or strange conduct noted in patients in the absence of obvious mental illness or retardation. Koch was a [[Christian]] and also influenced by the [[degeneration]] theory popular in Europe at the time, though he referred to both [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] and acquired types. Habitual criminality was only a small part of his concept but the German public soon used the shortened version "inferiors" to refer to anyone supposedly suffering from an inherent ('constitutional') disposition toward crime.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Gutmann [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=97643 Julius Ludwig August Koch (1841–1908)] American Journal of Psychiatry 2007 164:35-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wetzell2000&gt;Richard F.

==Early 20th century==
Some writers would still use psychopathy in the general sense of mental illness, such as Austrian psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]] in ''Psychopathic Characters on Stage''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1415-47142009000200004&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt  From H.

(Translation option on right)&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast influential German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]], who had  previously included a section on moral insanity in his psychiatric classification scheme, was by 1904 referring to specific psychopathic subtypes all involving antisocial, criminal or dissocial behaviour, including: born criminals (inborn delinquents), liars and swindlers, [[querulous]] persons, and driven persons (including [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], [[spendthrifts]], and [[dipsomaniacs]]).&lt;ref name=millon2002&gt;{{Cite book| first= Theodore | last= Millon | authorlink= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LSiBsdxcGigC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=dissocial+personality+disorder| title=Psychopathy: Antisocial, Criminal, and Violent Behavior | work= | publisher= Guidford Press | year=2002| pages=3–18 |isbn=1-57230-864-8 |accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influential [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)]] spread the concept of constitutional psychopathy when he emigrated to the US, though unlike Koch he separated out cases of what was termed [[psychoneurosis]].

After [[World War I]] German psychiatrists dropped the term inferiors/defectives (Minderwertigkeiten) and used psychopathic (psychopathisch) and its derivatives instead, at that time a more neutral term covering a wide range of conditions. [[Emil Kraepelin]], [[Kurt Schneider]] and [[Karl Birnbaum]] developed categorisation schemes under the heading 'psychopathic personality', only some subtypes of which were thought to have particular links to antisocial behaviour. Schneider in particular advanced the term and tried to formulate it in less judgemental terms than Kraepelin, though infamously defining it as ‘those abnormal personalities who suffer from their abnormality or from whose abnormality society suffers.’&lt;ref name=Wetzell2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7cvA1eewzUC Hitler's Prisons: Legal Terror in Nazi Germany] Nikolaus Wachsmann, Yale University Press, 2004. Page 47&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Birnbaum, a biological psychiatrist, suggested from 1909 a concept similar to sociopathy, implying the social environment could determine whether dispositions became criminal or not.&lt;ref name="sociopathy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rutter |first=Steve |title=The Psychopath: Theory, Research, and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzhylqWiPxIC&amp;pg=PA37 |accessdate=July 2, 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. |location=New Jersey |isbn=0-8058-6079-7 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 a forerunner to later diagnostic manuals, called the Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane, included a category of 'psychoses with constitutional psychopathic inferiority'. This covered abnormalities in the emotional and [[Volition (psychology)|volitional]] spheres associated with episodic disturbances which did not fit into the established categories of psychosis: "The type of behavior disorder, the social reactions, the trends of interests, etc., which the psychopathic inferior may show give special features to many cases, e. g., criminal traits, moral deficiency, [[tramp]] life, sexual perversions and various temperamental peculiarities." Constitutional psychopathic inferiority without psychosis was listed separately as one term to apply to patients considered 'Not insane'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/statisticalmanu00assogoog Statistical manual for the use of institutions for the insane (1918)] University of Michigan via Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[American Prison Association]] had its own definition, in which psychopathic personalities were considered non-psychotic and characterized by failure to adjust to environment, lacking purpose, ambition and proper feelings, while often showing tendencies towards [[wikt:delinquency|delinquency]], lying and various eccentricities, perversions or manias (including [[dromomania]] (compulsion to travel or experience new lifestyles), [[kleptomania]] (stealing), [[pyromania]] (fire-setting) etc.). In the UK the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]] included the category of moral [[imbeciles]], who were not intellectually [[idiots]] but displayed from an early age an alleged mental defect coupled with alleged vicious or criminal propensities, and on whom punishment has little or no deterrent effect. [[Cyril Burt]] and others pointed out that 'psychopathic personality' was used in a broader and somewhat different way in America than in the UK.&lt;ref name=Partridge1930/&gt;

In the first decades of the 20th century, "constitutional psychopathic inferiority" had become a commonly used term in the US, implying the issue was inherent to the genetics or makeup of the person, an [[organic disease]].&lt;ref name=Hildebrand&gt;Hildebrand, M 2004 [http://dare.uva.nl/document/75716 The Construct of Psychopathy] in Psychopathy in the treatment of forensic psychiatric patients&lt;/ref&gt; As a category it was used to target any and all dysfunctional or antisocial behavior, and in psychiatric categorization it labeled a broad range of alleged mental deviances, including [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Ena Chadha [http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/67/67 "Mentally Defectives" Not Welcome: Mental Disability In Canadian Immigration Law, 1859-1927] Disability Studies Quarterly Winter 2008, Volume 28, No.1 Society for Disability Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts began to develop "psychopathic laboratories" for the classification and treatment of offenders; the term psychopathic was chosen to avoid the [[social stigma]] of "lunacy" or "insanity", while emphasizing variance from normality rather than simply a [[mental hygiene]] issue.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, HM. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1134178 Organization of Psychopathic Work in the Criminal Courts] Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, Vol. 9, No. 3, Nov., 1918&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at least one such laboratory issued a report on [[eugenic]] [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Laughlin, HM.

From the late 1920s American psychologist [[George E. Partridge]] influentially narrowed the definition of psychopathy to antisocial personality, and from 1930 suggested that a more apt name for it would be sociopathy. He suggested that anyone, and indeed groups of people acting together, could be considered sociopathic at times, but that sociopaths&amp;nbsp;– or technically 'essential sociopaths' - were chronically and pervasively so in their motivation and behavior.&lt;ref name=Partridge1930&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=140325 Current Conceptions of Psychopathic Personality] G.

==Mid-20th century==

''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'' by American psychiatrist [[Hervey M. Cleckley]], first published in 1941 and with revised editions for several decades, is considered a seminal work which provided a vivid series of case studies of individuals described as psychopaths. Cleckley proposed 16 characteristics of psychopathy, derived mainly from his work with male [[psychiatric hospital|psychiatric patients]] in a locked institution. The title refers to the "mask" of normal functioning that Cleckley thought concealed the disorganization, amorality and disorder of the psychopathic personality.&lt;ref name="meloy"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Meloy | first = J.

In [[Nazi Germany]], especially during [[World War II]], psychiatrists and others in programmes such as [[Action T4]] and [[Action 14f13]] systematically [[Deportation|deported]], [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilised]], [[Internment|interned]] and [[Euthanasia|euthanised]] (killed) patients and prisoners who could be classed as mentally ill, feebleminded, psychopathic, criminally insane or just [[Black triangle (badge)|asocial]].&lt;ref name=Wetzell2000/&gt; In the aftermath of the war, therefore, concepts of antisocial psychopathic personalities fell out of favour in [[Europe]] to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9AqPs9ootqoC The DSM-IV Personality Disorders] Edited by W. John Livesley, Guilford Press, 1995, Page 139&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, in America and other countries the concept became increasingly prominent, used to categorise allied soldiers as fit or unfit for duty or on return to society, or, conversely, in the more specific sinister sense of the term, as a way to explain the actions of Nazis.

The first version of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) in 1952 did not use the term psychopathy as a diagnosis, but "sociopathic personality disturbance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coolidge |first1=Frederick L. |last2=Segal |first2=Daniel L. |year=1998 |title=EVOLUTION OF PERSONALITY DISORDER DIAGNOSIS IN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS |url=http://www.uccs.edu/~faculty/dsegal/pdfs/Evolution-of-PDs-1998.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=585–599 |doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(98)00002-6 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals to be placed in this category were said to be "...ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing [[Social environment|milieu]], and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals". There were four subtypes (called 'reactions' after [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]]): antisocial, dyssocial, sexual and addiction. The antisocial reaction was said to include "individuals who are chronically in trouble and do not seem to change as a result of experience or punishment, with no loyalties to anyone", as well as being frequently callous and lacking responsibility, with an ability to 'rationalize' their behaviour. The dyssocial reaction was for "individuals who disregard societal rules, although they are capable of strong loyalties to others or groups." Although the sociopathy category was very broad by today's definitions, the DSM-I itself pointed out that it was more specific and limited than the then current notions of 'constitutional psychopathic state' or 'psychopathic personality'.

Meanwhile, other subtypes of psychopathy were sometimes proposed, notably by [[psychoanalyst]] [[Benjamin Karpman]] from the 1940s. He described psychopathy due to psychological problems (e.g. psychotic, hysterical or neurotic conditions) and [[idiopathic]] psychopathy where there was no obvious psychological cause, concluding that the former could not be attributed to a psychopathic personality and that the latter appeared so absent of any redeeming features that it couldn't be seen as a personality issue either but must be a constitutional "anethopathy" ([[amorality]] or [[antipathy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Karpman, B. (1941) [http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;uid=1942-00202-001 On the need of separating psychopathy into two distinct clinical types: the symptomatic and the idiopathic.]  Journal of Criminal Psychopathology, 3, 112-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karpman48&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karpman|first=B.|title=The Myth of the Psychopathic Personality|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 March 1948|volume=104|issue=9|pages=523–534|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.104.9.523|pmid=18911629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories of distinctions between primary and secondary psychopathy remain to this day.

Cleckley's concept of psychopathy as expanded on in new editions of his book, particularly the sense of a [[conscience]]-less man beneath a mask of normality, caught the public imagination around this time. It also became increasingly influential in psychiatric circles. It later fell out of favor for some time, however, such that when he died in 1984 he was better remembered for a vivid case study of a female patient published in 1956, turned into a movie [[The Three Faces of Eve]] in 1957, which had (re)popularized in America another controversial diagnosis, [[Multiple Personality Disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, J.

In the [[Mental Health Act]] in England, a new category of 'Psychopathic Personality' was added in 1959, renamed Psychopathic Disorder in 1983 (then in 2007 removed entirely). This was a legal subcategory in addition to 'mental illness' which did not equate to any one psychiatric diagnosis but covered anyone with "a persistent disorder or disability of mind which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramas.co.uk/report3.pdf The Treatment of Psychopathic and Antisocial Personality Disorders: A Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618124323/http://www.ramas.co.uk/report3.pdf# |date=2013-06-18 }} Jessica H Lee, 1999, London: Risk Assessment Management and Audit Systems&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, various analysts began to identify "successful" psychopaths in society, some even suggesting it was but an adaption to the social or economic [[mores]] of the age, others noting they could be hard to spot either because they were so good at hiding their lack of conscience, or because many people showed the traits to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmes | first1 = Colin A | year = 1991 | title = Psychopathic disorder: a category mistake? | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1376001/pdf/jmedeth00277-0023.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Medical Ethics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 77–85 | pmc=1376001 | pmid=1870086 | doi=10.1136/jme.17.2.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20th century==
In 1968 the second edition of the DSM, in place of the antisocial subtype of sociopathic personality disturbance, listed "antisocial personality" as one of ten [[personality disorders]]. This was still described in similar terms as the DSM-I's category, for individuals who are "basically unsocialized", in repeated conflicts with society, incapable of significant loyalty, selfish, irresponsible, unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences, and tend to blame others and rationalise. It warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis and that a 'group delinquent reaction' of childhood or adolescence or 'social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder' should be ruled out first. The dyssocial type from the DSM-I was relegated, though would resurface as the main diagnosis in the ICD manual of the [[World Health Organization]].

In 1974 (and republished in 1984) clinical psychologist [[Bobby E. Wright]] wrote about 'The Psychopathic Racial Personality', in which he suggested that negative aspects of the overall behavior of white peoples towards non-white peoples could be understood by seeing the former as displaying psychopathic traits&amp;nbsp;– involving predatory behavior and senseless destruction combined with ability to persuade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Psychopathic_Racial_Personality.html?id=jvh2AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y The Psychopathic Racial Personality: And Other Essays] by Bobby Eugene Wright, Third World Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcommentator.com/505/505_ww_damage.html Damage To the African Mind and Dr. Bobby Wright] Conrad Worrill, The Black Commentator magazine, Feb 21, 2013 - Issue 505&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultural-expressions.com/diaspora/wright.htm Review of The Psychopathic Racial Personality and Other Essays] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908044710/http://www.cultural-expressions.com/diaspora/wright.htm |date=2012-09-08 }} by Baba Adubiifa, 2003, Diaspora Book Link&lt;/ref&gt;

There remained no international clinical agreement on the diagnosis of psychopathy. A 1977 study found little relationship with the characteristics commonly attributed to psychopaths and concluded that the concept was being used too widely and loosely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=6AE988D0D03210BA66AB8068D29293E3.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5012500 Psychopathic personality: a conceptual problem (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert D. Hare]] had published a book in 1970 summarizing research on psychopathy, and was subsequently at the forefront of psychopathy research. Frustrated by a lack of agreed definitions or rating systems for psychopathy, including at a ten-day international [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) conference in 1975, Hare began developing a [[Psychopathy Checklist]]. Produced for initial circulation in 1980, it was based largely on the list of traits advanced by Cleckley and partly on the theories of other authors and on his own experiences with clients in prisons. Meanwhile, a DSM-III task force instead developed the diagnosis of [[antisocial personality disorder]], based on 1972 [[Feighner Criteria]] for research and published in the DSM in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Christopher J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OuNdrmHcJlgC&amp;q=nato#v=snippet&amp;q=nato&amp;f=false Handbook of Psychopathy] Page 62&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on some of the criteria put forward by Cleckley but [[operationalize]]d in behavioral rather than personality terms, more specifically related to conduct. APA was most concerned to demonstrate inter-rater reliability rather than necessarily validity.

Nevertheless, one author referred to the concept of psychopathy in 1987 as an "infinitely elastic, catch-all category".&lt;ref name=lust&gt;

Hare redrafted his checklist in 1985 (Cleckley had died in 1984), renaming it the [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]] Revised and finalising it as a first edition in 1991, updated with extra data in a 2nd edition in 2003. Hare's list differed from Cleckley's not just in rewordings and introducing quantitative scores for each point. Cleckley had required an absence of delusions and an absence of nervousness, which was central to how he defined psychopathy, whereas neither were mentioned in Hare's list. Hare also left out mention of suicidality being rarely completed and behavior with alcohol. Moreover, while Cleckley only listed "inadequately motivated antisocial behavior", Hare turned this into an array of specific antisocial behaviors covering a person's whole life, including juvenile delinquency, parasitic lifestyle, poor behavioural controls, and criminal versatility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NBC0jOMVmIYC Thinking about Psychopaths and Psychopathy: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions] "What are the differences between the psychopathy definitions designed by Hare and by Cleckley?"

Meanwhile, following some criticism over the lack of psychological criteria in the DSM, further studies were conducted leading up the DSM-IV in 1994 and some personality criteria were included as "associated features" which were outlined in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, RD. (1996) [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-iv/content/article/10168/54831 Psychopathy and Antisocial Personality Disorder: A Case of Diagnostic Confusion] Psychiatric Times&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]]'s ICD incorporated a similar diagnosis of Dissocial Personality Disorder. Both state that psychopathy (or sociopathy) may be considered [[synonyms]] of their diagnosis.

Hare wrote two bestsellers on psychopathy, "Without Conscience" in 1993 and "[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]" in 2006. Cleckley had described psychopathic patients as "carr[ying] disaster lightly in each hand" and "not deeply vicious", but Hare presented a more [[wikt:malevolence|malevolent]] picture; the "mask of sanity" had acquired a more sinister and [[Machiavellian]] meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Koehli (2010) [http://www.sott.net/articles/show/204905-Ponerology-101-The-Psychopath-s-Mask-of-Sanity Ponerology 101: The Psychopath's Mask of Sanity] Sott.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=millon&gt;

==21st century==

In 2002 an academic dispute arose around claims and counterclaims of [[racism]] in the use of the concept of psychopathy. British psychologist [[Richard Lynn]] claimed that some races were inherently more psychopathic than others, while other psychologists criticized his data and interepretations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://riskreduction.soceco.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Psychopathic-personality-and-racial-ethnic-differences-reconsidered.pdf Psychopathic personality and racial/ethnic differences reconsidered: a reply to Lynn (2002)]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Jennifer L. Skeem, John F. Edens, Glenn M. Sanford, Lori H. Colwell, Personality and Individual Differences 35 (2003) 1439–1462 {{DOI|10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00361-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s monthly outreach and communication bulletin focused on psychopathy in June 2012, featuring articles introduced and co-authored by the main contemporary proponent of the construct, [[Robert D. Hare]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/july-2012/leb-july-2012 Focus on Psychopathy] FBI Law Enforcement bulletin, July 2012, Volume 81, Number 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-5 published in 2013 had criteria for an overall diagnosis of Antisocial (Dissocial) Personality Disorder similar to DSM-IV, still noting that it has also been known as psychopathy or sociopathy. In an 'alternative model' suggested at the end of the manual, there is an optional specifier for "psychopathic features" - where there is a lack of anxiety/fear accompanied by a bold and efficacious interpersonal style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rEPy72wKdswC The Pocket Guide to the DSM-5 Diagnostic Exam] Abraham M. Nussbaum, American Psychiatric Pub, 2013. Pg 236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall trends==
One exhaustive analysis by a Canadian psychologist describes the various lines of work as 'a psychopathy project' attempting to establish psychopathy as an object of science. Overall this was found to have suffered from 'a number of serious logical confusions and deliberate mischaracterizations of its scientific merits' - including its early basis in [[degeneration]] theory, [[tautological consequence|tautological]] definitions and associated neuroscience findings, routinely unclarified assumptions and shifting levels of explanation about the core concept, and exaggerated statistical claims such as based on Hare's use of [[factor analysis]]. It was noted, however, that some of the limited research findings may prove useful in a better explanatory framework (i.e. not necessarily under the umbrella of 'psychopathy').&lt;ref&gt;[http://summit.sfu.ca/item/8120 Science of conscience: Metaphysics, morality, and rhetoric in psychopathy research] Jarkko Jalava, 2007, PhD at Simon Fraser University, then Professor at Okanagan College, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish sociologist has further placed the more recent resurgence in popular coverage of psychopathy in the context of "the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project" to use rationality and technology to deal with problems in human life and society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_8/paulsen_december2010.pdf Mediated Psychopathy--A Critical Discourse Analysis of Newspaper Representations of Aggression] Roland Paulsen, Dec 2010, Kritike Journal of Philosophy, Vol 4, Issue 2, P60&lt;/ref&gt; A Scottish sociologist of biomedical ethics has suggested that the DSM's attempt to develop different standards for Antisocial Personality Disorder have been limited and modified by [[path dependence]] on the concept of psychopathy/sociopathy, due to the latter being embedded in diverse sociotechnological networks and thereby demanded by various users.&lt;ref name=shaping/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40439">The '''medical genetics of Jews''' is the study, screening, and treatment of [[genetic disorder]]s more common in particular [[Jewish]] populations than in the population as a whole.&lt;ref name=Rosner/&gt; The genetics of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have been particularly well-studied, resulting in the discovery of many genetic disorders associated with this [[ethnic group]].

In contrast, the medical genetics of [[Sephardic Jews]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]] are more complicated, since they are more genetically diverse and consequently no genetic disorders are more common in these groups as a whole; instead, they tend to have the genetic diseases common in their various countries of origin.&lt;ref name=Rosner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{Cite news | first = Talia | last = Bloch | name-list-format = vanc  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1109222.html |title=Sephardi Jews lack screening programs for their genetic diseases |work=Haaretz |date=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations, such as [[Dor Yeshorim]],&lt;ref name=Kolata&gt;{{Cite news | first = Gina | last = Kolata | name-list-format = vanc  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/07/health/nightmare-or-the-dream-of-a-new-era-in-genetics.html |title=Nightmare or the Dream Of a New Era in Genetics? |work=New York Times |date=December 7, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer [[genetic screening|screening]] for Ashkenazi genetic diseases,  and these screening programs have had a significant impact, in particular by reducing the number of cases of [[Tay–Sachs disease]].&lt;ref name=Ostrer&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostrer H | title = A genetic profile of contemporary Jewish populations | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = 891–8 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11715044 | doi = 10.1038/35098506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics of Jewish populations==
Different ethnic groups tend to suffer from different rates of hereditary diseases, with some being more common, and some less common. Hereditary diseases, particularly [[hemophilia]], were recognized early in [[Jewish history]], even being described in the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt; However, the scientific study of hereditary disease in Jewish populations was initially hindered by [[scientific racism]], which was based on [[racial supremacism]].&lt;ref name="Abel 2001 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Abel|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachrach S | title = In the name of public health--Nazi racial hygiene | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 5 | pages = 417–20 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15282346 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp048136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, modern studies on the genetics of particular ethnic groups have the tightly defined purpose of avoiding the birth of children with genetic diseases, or identifying people at particular risk of developing a disease in the future.&lt;ref name="Abel 2001 7"/&gt; Consequently, the Jewish community has been very supportive of modern genetic testing programs; this high level of cooperation has raised concerns that conclusions may lead to stigmatization of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin M | title = Screening Jews and genes: a consideration of the ethics of genetic screening within the Jewish community: challenges and responses | journal = Genetic Testing | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–13 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10464669 | doi = 10.1089/gte.1999.3.207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most populations contain hundreds of [[allele]]s that could potentially cause disease and most people are [[heterozygote]]s for one or two [[recessive]] alleles that would be lethal in a [[homozygote]].&lt;ref name=Modell&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Modell B, Darr A | title = Science and society: genetic counselling and customary consanguineous marriage | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–9 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11972160 | doi = 10.1038/nrg754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the overall frequency of disease-causing alleles does not vary much between populations, the practice of consanguineous marriage (marriage between second cousins or closer relatives) is common in some Jewish communities, which produces a small increase in the number of children with congenital defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul DB, Spencer HG | title = "It's ok, we're not cousins by blood": the cousin marriage controversy in historical perspective | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 2627–30 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19108607 | pmc = 2605922 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0060320 | editor1-last = Keller | editor1-first = Evelyn Fox }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Daphna Birenbaum Carmeli at the [[University of Haifa]], Jewish populations have been studied thoroughly because:&lt;ref name=Carmeli/&gt;

* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], and at the same time are a large group.
* Jewish populations are overwhelmingly urban and are concentrated near biomedical centers where such research has been carried out.

The result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]]. This has sometimes created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations. Carmeli writes, "Jews are over-represented in human genetic literature, particularly in mutation-related contexts."&lt;ref name=Carmeli&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carmeli DB | title = Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: figures, explanation, and potential implications | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics. Part A | volume = 130A | issue = 1 | pages = 76–83 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15368499 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.20291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This set of advantages have led to Ashkenazi Jews in particular being used in many genetic studies, not just in the study of genetic diseases. For example, a series of publications on Ashkenazi centenarians established their longevity was strongly inherited and associated with lower rates of age-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Atzmon G, Schechter C, Greiner W, Davidson D, Rennert G, Barzilai N | title = Clinical phenotype of families with longevity | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 274–7 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14728640 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This "healthy aging" phenotype may be due to higher levels of [[telomerase]] in these individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Atzmon G, Cho M, Cawthon RM, Budagov T, Katz M, Yang X, Siegel G, Bergman A, Huffman DM, Schechter CB, Wright WE, Shay JW, Barzilai N, Govindaraju DR, Suh Y | display-authors = 6 | title = Evolution in health and medicine Sackler colloquium: Genetic variation in human telomerase is associated with telomere length in Ashkenazi centenarians | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl_1 | pages = 1710–7 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19915151 | pmc = 2868292 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0906191106 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.1710A }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be due to the well established correlation between high intelligence and longevity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iveson MH, Cukic I, Der G, Batty GD, Deary IJ | title = Intelligence and all-cause mortality in the 6-Day Sample of the Scottish Mental Survey 1947 and their siblings: testing the contribution of family background | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–96 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29025063 | pmc = 5837228 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyx168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cochran G, Hardy J, Harpending H | title = Natural history of Ashkenazi intelligence | journal = Journal of Biosocial Science | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 659–93 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16867211 | doi = 10.1017/S0021932005027069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ashkenazi diseases==
Today's 10 million Ashkenazi Jews descend from a population of only 350 individuals who lived about 600–800 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carmi |first1=Shai |last2=Hui |first2=Ken Y. |last3=Kochav |first3=Ethan |last4=Liu |first4=Xinmin |last5=Xue |first5=James |last6=Grady |first6=Fillan |last7=Guha |first7=Saurav |last8=Upadhyay |first8=Kinnari |last9=Ben-Avraham |first9=Dan |last10=Mukherjee |first10=Semanti |last11=Bowen |first11=B.

There is evidence that the [[population bottleneck]] may have allowed [[allele|deleterious alleles]] to become more prevalent in the population due to [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Behar DM, Hammer MF, Garrigan D, Villems R, Bonne-Tamir B, Richards M, Gurwitz D, Rosengarten D, Kaplan M, Della Pergola S, Quintana-Murci L, Skorecki K | title = MtDNA evidence for a genetic bottleneck in the early history of the Ashkenazi Jewish population | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 355–64 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 14722586 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201156 | displayauthors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this group has been particularly intensively studied, so many mutations have been identified as common in Ashkenazim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | name-list-format = vanc  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/04/health/genetics/04GENE.html |title=Diseases Common in Ashkenazim May Be Random |work=New York Times |date=March 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these diseases, many also occur in other Jewish groups and in non-Jewish populations, although the specific mutation which causes the disease may vary between populations. For example, two different mutations in the [[glucocerebrosidase]] gene causes [[Gaucher's disease]] in Ashkenazim, which is their most common genetic disease, but only one of these mutations is found in non-Jewish groups.&lt;ref name=Ostrer/&gt; A few diseases are unique to this group; for example, [[familial dysautonomia]] is almost unknown in other populations.&lt;ref name=Ostrer/&gt;

===Tay–Sachs disease===
[[Tay–Sachs disease]], which can present as a fatal illness of children that causes mental deterioration prior to death, was historically extremely common among Ashkenazi Jews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/taysachs/taysachs.htm 
|title=Tay–Sachs Disease Information Page |publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] |date=February 14, 2007 |access-date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with lower levels of the disease in some Pennsylvania Dutch, southern Louisiana Cajun, and eastern Quebec French Canadian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sutton VR | title = Tay-Sachs disease screening and counseling families at risk for metabolic disease | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–96 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12108829 | doi = 10.1016/S0889-8545(01)00002-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, however, proactive genetic testing has been quite effective in eliminating Tay–Sachs from the Ashkenazi Jewish population.&lt;ref name="genomenewsnetwork"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Genome News Network, J. Craig Venter Institute | title=The Success Story of Gene Tests | first=Julie | last=Buckles | name-list-format = vanc | date= August 20, 2001 | access-date = April 14, 2008 | url = http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/08_01/Tay_Sachs_gene_tests.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lipid transport diseases===

[[Gaucher's disease]], in which [[lipid]]s accumulate in inappropriate locations, occurs most frequently among Ashkenazi Jews;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diaz GA, Gelb BD, Risch N, Nygaard TG, Frisch A, Cohen IJ, Miranda CS, Amaral O, Maire I, Poenaru L, Caillaud C, Weizberg M, Mistry P, Desnick RJ | title = Gaucher disease: the origins of the Ashkenazi Jewish N370S and 84GG acid beta-glucosidase mutations | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 1821–32 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10777718 | pmc = 1378046 | doi = 10.1086/302946 | displayauthors = etal }}'&lt;/ref&gt; the mutation is carried by roughly one in every 15 Ashkenazi Jews, compared to one in 100 of the general American population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaucherdisease.org/prevalence.php |title=National Gaucher Foundation |access-date=May 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517013236/http://www.gaucherdisease.org/prevalence.php |archive-date=May 17, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaucher's disease can cause [[brain damage]] and [[seizure]]s, but these effects are not usually present in the form manifested among Ashkenazi Jews; while sufferers still bruise easily, and it can still potentially rupture the [[spleen]], it generally has only a minor impact on life expectancy.

Ashkenazi Jews are also highly affected by other [[lysosomal storage disease]]s, particularly in the form of [[lipid storage disorder]]s. Compared to other ethnic groups, they more frequently act as carriers of [[mucolipidosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mssm.edu/jewish_genetics/diseases/mucolipidosis.shtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217005259/http://www.mssm.edu/jewish_genetics/diseases/mucolipidosis.shtml | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 17 February 2007 |title = Diseases: Mucolipidosis | work = Mount Sinai – Center for Jewish Genetic Diseases – Department of Human Genetics  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Niemann–Pick disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org/what/ashkenazi/niemann.asp | title = Ashkenazi Disorders: Mendelian – Niemann–Pick disease | work = The Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which can prove fatal.

The occurrence of several lysosomal storage disorders in the same population suggests  the alleles responsible might have conferred some [[Selection (biology)|selective advantage]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boas FE | title = Linkage to Gaucher mutations in the Ashkenazi population: effect of drift on decay of linkage disequilibrium and evidence for heterozygote selection | journal = Blood Cells, Molecules &amp; Diseases | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 348–59 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 11042036 | doi = 10.1006/bcmd.2000.0314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be similar to the [[hemoglobin]] allele which is responsible for [[sickle-cell disease]], but solely in people with two copies; those with just one copy of the allele have a [[sickle cell trait]] and gain partial immunity to [[malaria]] as a result. This effect is called [[heterozygote advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harpending H, Cochran G | title = Genetic diversity and genetic burden in humans | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–62 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16246638 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2005.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Familial dysautonomia===

[[Familial dysautonomia]] (Riley–Day syndrome), which causes [[vomiting]], speech problems, an inability to [[cry]], and false [[sensory perception]], is almost exclusive to Ashkenazi Jews;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org/what/ashkenazi/familial.asp | title = Ashkenazi Disorders: Mendelian – Familial dysautonomia | work = The Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkenazi Jews are almost 100 times more likely to carry the disease than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;about one in 30 Ashkenazi Jews carry the disease, compared to 1 in 3000 of the general population&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Ashkenazi diseases and disorders ===

Diseases inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern often occur in [[endogamy|endogamous]] populations. Among Ashkenazi Jews, a higher incidence of specific [[genetic disorders]] and [[hereditary]] [[disease]]s have been verified, including:

==Genetic testing in Jewish populations==

One of the first [[genetic testing]] programs to identify [[heterozygote]] carriers of a genetic disorder was a program aimed at eliminating Tay–Sachs disease. This program began in 1970, and over one million people have now been screened for the mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaback MM | title = Population-based genetic screening for reproductive counseling: the Tay-Sachs disease model | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 159 Suppl 3 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S192-5 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11216898 | doi = 10.1007/PL00014401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying carriers and counseling couples on reproductive options have had a large impact on the incidence of the disease, with a decrease from 40–50 per year worldwide to only four or five per year.&lt;ref name=Ostrer/&gt; Screening programs now test for several genetic disorders in Jews, although these focus on the Ashkenazi Jews, since other Jewish groups cannot be given a single set of tests for a common set of disorders.&lt;ref name=Bloch/&gt; In the USA, these screening programs have been widely accepted by the Ashkenazi community, and have greatly reduced the frequency of the disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kronn D, Jansen V, Ostrer H | title = Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, and Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population: the first 1000 cases at New York University Medical Center, New York, NY | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 158 | issue = 7 | pages = 777–81 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9554684 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.158.7.777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prenatal testing for several genetic diseases is offered as commercial panels for Ashkenazi couples by both [[CIGNA]] and [[Quest Diagnostics]].  The CIGNA panel is available for testing for parental/preconception screening or following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia, Gaucher disease, mucolipidosis IV, Neimann-Pick disease type A, Tay-Sachs disease, and torsion dystonia.  The Quest panel is for parental/preconception testing and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, Neimann-Pick disease types A and B, and Tay-Sachs disease.

The official recommendations of the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] is that Ashkenazi individuals be offered screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia as part of routine obstetrical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = ACOG committee on genetics | title = ACOG Committee Opinion No. 442: Preconception and prenatal carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European Jewish descent | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 114 | issue = 4 | pages = 950–3 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19888064 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181bd12f4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox community]], an organization called [[Dor Yeshorim]] carries out anonymous genetic screening of couples before marriage to reduce the risk of children with genetic diseases being born.&lt;ref name=Ekstein&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ekstein J, Katzenstein H | title = The Dor Yeshorim story: community-based carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease | journal = Advances in Genetics | volume = 44 | issue =  | pages = 297–310 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11596991 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2660(01)44087-9 | isbn = 978-0-12-017644-1 | series = Advances in Genetics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program educates young people on medical genetics and screens school-aged children for any disease genes. These results are then entered into an anonymous database, identified only by a unique ID number given to the person who was tested. If two people are considering getting married, they call the organization and tell them their ID numbers. The organization then tells them if they are genetically compatible.  It is not divulged if one member is a carrier, so as to protect the carrier and his or her family from stigmatization.&lt;ref name=Ekstein/&gt; However, this program has been criticized for exerting social pressure on people to be tested, and for screening for a broad range of recessive genes, including disorders such as Gaucher disease.&lt;ref name=Kolata/&gt;

'''NGLY1 deficiency''' or '''NGLY1-congenital disorder of deglycosylation''' is a very rare [[genetic disorder]] caused by mutations in ''[[NGLY1]]''. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Errors in [[glycosylation|deglycosylation]] are responsible for the symptoms of this condition.&lt;ref name=OMIM&gt;{{cite web|title=OMIM Entry   - # 615273 - CONGENITAL DISORDER OF DEGLYCOSYLATION; CDDG|url=https://omim.org/entry/615273|website=omim.org|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinically, most affected individuals display developmental delay, lack of tears, elevated liver transaminases and a movement disorder.&lt;ref name= genereviews&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK481554/ | title=NGLY1-Related Congenital Disorder of Deglycosylation |access-date = September 2, 2018 | language = en | publisher = NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NGLY1 deficiency is difficult to diagnose, and most individuals have been identified by [[exome]] sequencing.  

NGLY1 deficiency causes a dysfunction in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]-associated degradation pathway. ''NGLY1'' encodes an enzyme, [[N-glycanase 1]], that cleaves [[N-linked glycosylation|N-glycan]]s. Without N-glycanase, N-glycosylated proteins that are misfolded in the endoplasmic reticulum cannot be degraded, and thus accumulate in the [[cytoplasm]] of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeze|first1=Hudson H.|title=Understanding Human Glycosylation Disorders: Biochemistry Leads the Charge|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=8 March 2013|volume=288|issue=10|pages=6936–6945|doi=10.1074/jbc.R112.429274|pmc=3591604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24651605"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Enns GM, Shashi V, Bainbridge M, Gambello MJ, Zahir FR, Bast T, Crimian R, Schoch K, Platt J, Cox R, Bernstein JA, Scavina M, Walter RS, Bibb A, Jones M, Hegde M, Graham BH, Need AC, Oviedo A, Schaaf CP, Boyle S, Butte AJ, Chen R, Chen R, Clark MJ, Haraksingh R, Cowan TM, He P, Langlois S, Zoghbi HY, Snyder M, Gibbs RA, Freeze HH, Goldstein DB|display-authors = 6 | title = Mutations in NGLY1 cause an inherited disorder of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway | journal = Genet.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Clinical findings in NGLY1 deficiency are not specific, however four common findings have been identified in a majority of patients.  These four findings include developmental delay or intellectual disability of varying degrees, lack of or greatly reduced tears, elevated liver transaminases, and a complex movement disorder. The elevated liver enzymes often resolve in childhood. In addition, approximately 50% of patients described with NGLY1 deficiency have seizures, which can vary in their difficulty to control.  Other findings that have been reported in affected individuals include [[sleep apnea]], [[constipation]], [[scoliosis]], oral motor defects, auditory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
NGLY1 deficiency can be suspected based on clinical findings, however confirmation of the diagnosis requires the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ''NGLY1''.  Traditional screening tests utilized for [[congenital disorders of glycosylation]], including carbohydrate deficient [[transferrin]] are not diagnostic in NGLY1 deficiency.  To date all variants identified as being causative of NGLY1 deficiency have been sequence variants, rather than copy number variants.  This spectrum may change as additional cases are identified.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;  A common nonsense variant (c.1201A&gt;T (p.Arg401Ter)) accounts for approximately 1/3 of pathogenic variants identified, and is associated with a more severe clinical course.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for NGLY1 deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NGLY1|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |url=https://www.ngly1.org/about/|website=NGLY1.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supportive care is indicated for each patient based on their specific symptoms, and can include eye drops to manage the [[alacrima]], pharmaceutical management of seizures, feeding therapy and physical therapy.&lt;ref name=genereviews /&gt;  Most potential treatment options for NGLY1 deficiency are in the pre-clinical stages.  These include enzyme replacement therapy, as well as ENGase inhibitors.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Eighteen patients with confirmed NGLY1 deficiency have been reported in the medical literature.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;  Patient databases managed through disease specific support groups have reported 46 patients.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;&lt;ref name=GHR&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reference|first1=Genetics Home|title=NGLY1 gene|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NGLY1#conditions|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the majority of individuals reported with NGLY1 deficiency are of northern European descent, however this likely reflects an ascertainment bias in these early stages of the disorder.  Affected individuals with African and Hispanic backgrounds have been identified.&lt;ref name = genereviews /&gt;.

== History ==
The first cases of NGLY1 deficiency were described in 2012.&lt;ref name=OMIM /&gt;  NGLY1 deficiency has received a large amount of attention, despite its rarity, due to the children of two media-savvy families being afflicted.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mnookin|first1=Seth|title=One of a Kind|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/one-of-a-kind-2|website=The New Yorker|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wilseys, descendants of [[Dede Wilsey]], founded the Grace Science Foundation in honor of their daughter, and [[Matt Might]] and his wife founded the Bertrand Might Research Fund. These foundations have contributed millions of dollars to research efforts.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our work - Grace Science Foundation|url=https://gracescience.org/our-work/|website=Grace Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ophthalmia''' (also called '''ophthalmitis''') is inflammation of the eye. It is a [[medical sign]] which may be indicative of various conditions, including [[sympathetic ophthalmia]] (inflammation of both eyes following trauma to one eye), [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|gonococcal]] ophthalmia, [[trachoma]] or "[[Egypt]]ian" ophthalmia, [[ophthalmia neonatorum]] (a [[conjunctivitis]] of the newborn due to either of the two previous pathogens), [[photophthalmia]] and [[actinic conjunctivitis]] (inflammation resulting from prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays), and others.

== Noted historical sufferers ==

*Aristodemus, a Spartan captain during the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], was afflicted with ophthalmia and was thus unable to fight at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] (of the famous Spartan 300.) However, he fought bravely and died at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. Due to the ophthalmia, and his absence from the first battle, he was not buried with proper funeral rights of a Spartan Captain.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, C. (2010). Marathon &amp; salamis. (p. 146). Yardley, PA: Westholme Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cicero, on the 1st of March 49BC wrote to Atticus that he was suffering from ophthalmia &lt;ref&gt;Letters to Atticus VIII.I3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eratosthenes]], who among other things was a Greek geographer and mathematician, contracted ophthalmia as he aged, becoming blind around 195 BC, depressing him and causing him to voluntarily starve himself to death. He died in 194&amp;nbsp;BC at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ellen. "Eratosthenes of Cyrene." Eratosthenes Of Cyrene (January 2006): 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannibal]]'s sight was lost in his right eye in 217 B.C. by what was likely ophthalmia. He lost the sight while crossing a swamp area on a four-day march through water early in his Italian campaign.
*Citing Galatians 4:13-15 and 6:11, [[Restoration Movement]] scholar [[John William McGarvey|J. W. McGarvey]] theorized that ophthalmia may have very well been the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul's]] "[[thorn in the flesh]]" (2 Cor. 12:7).&lt;ref&gt;J. W. McGarvey and P. Y. Pendleton, ''Thessalonians, Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans'' (Cincinnati, OH: Standard Publishing, n.d.) 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
*King [[John of Bohemia]], who died in battle in 1346 at age 50 after being blind for a decade, lost his sight to this general condition.
*[[Christopher Columbus]] suffered ophthalmitis late in his life. Ophthalmitis was a common disease of sailors, possibly related to [[scurvy]] or poor nutrition. In the book "Negro Builders and Heroes" by [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley|Benjamin Brawley]], in the chapter entitled "The Wake of the Slave-Ship", is a description of this condition afflicting, on slave ships, sometimes the whole crew and captive slaves.
*[[Elizabeth Blackwell]], the first female physician in the United States, lost an eye from purulent ophthalmia contracted from an infant with an eye infection, while working in Paris at La Maternité (1849), and after loss of the eye she could no longer be a surgeon.
*The Spanish composer and guitar virtuoso [[Francisco Tárrega]] also suffered from ophthalmia and seriously impaired sight after a traumatic childhood event (1850s).
*[[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]], author of the American classic, ''Two Years Before the Mast'' (1840), developed "a weakness of the eyes" after contracting measles while a junior at Harvard College. In an attempt to cure his condition, he undertook a two-year sailing voyage to California from Boston via Cape Horn, which provided the experiences for his memoir. The cure worked.
*[[Edward Rushton]], 18th Century blind poet and slavery abolitionist, who founded the first blind school in the UK in 1776. He is believed to have caught ophthalmia while compassionately feeding slaves who had been isolated for it.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Hawkins, BBC News Blog https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-ouch-29957645&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wild Bill Hickock]], 1876, Hickok was diagnosed by a doctor in Kansas City, Missouri, at just 39, his marksmanship and health were apparently in decline.

Organic [[infant formula]]s are synthetic substitutes to natural [[breast milk]].  

==United States requirements==

Organic formulas manufactured in the United States must meet specific conditions regulated by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the Agricultural Marketing Services and the [[National Organic Program]]. The system of organic production is managed in accordance with the [[Organic Foods Production Act of 1990]] (OFPA) and regulations in Title 7, Part 205 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  All three programs are designed to accredit state agencies and authorize businesses to certify producers and handlers of agricultural goods that operate according to the National Organic Program’s regulations—such as enforcing the OFPA and Federal Title7, Part 205) as organic.

Organic infant formulas are manufactured with all production aspects certified as organic, including vitamins, cow's milk, sugar and the cleanliness of machines and of handlers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3074">'''Practice management''' is the term used in [[General practice]] for the person who manages the finance and administration of a [[doctor's office]] or an office of a medical professional in one of many types of [[specialty_(medicine)]],.  This is distinct from other official titles such as Advanced Practice Manager, which are generally clinical.  Practice management encompasses multiple topics including governance, the financial aspects of [[medical billing]], management of one or more [[mid-level practitioner]]s, ancillary service development, information technology, transcription utilization, and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/BOT.0000000000000138 |pmid=24918826 |title=Practice Management |journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma |volume=28 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=S12–7 |year=2014 |last1=Althausen |first1=Peter L |last2=Mead |first2=Lisa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Practice==
The job of the practice manager has evolved over the last century.  When general practice was a cottage industry, operating in the doctor's front room, the receptionist, and the manager, insofar as there was any management, was often the doctor's wife.  In the 21st century the biggest practices in the UK now have more than 200,000 patients and hundreds of staff over dozens of sites. Some practices, however, are still single handed.  Working conditions in rural areas are very different from those in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GPs slept in practice overnight to be in time for morning surgery|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/premises/gps-slept-in-practice-overnight-to-be-in-time-for-morning-surgery/20035827.article|accessdate=31 December 2017|publisher=Pulse|date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By no means all the jobs are full time.  About half the practice managers surveyed in the UK reported working from five to eight additional hours per week, not all of it paid.  Average salary was £39,334.17&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Practice managers work the equivalent of an extra day per week, survey shows|url=http://www.managementinpractice.com/editors-pick/practice-managers-work-equivalent-extra-day-week-survey-shows|accessdate=31 December 2017|publisher=Management in practice|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Veterinary practice==
The same role exists in veterinary practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rising star moves from admin assistant to practice manager|url=https://www.vettimes.co.uk/news/rising-star-moves-from-admin-assistant-to-practice-manager/|accessdate=31 December 2017|publisher=Vettimes|date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of practice managers is varied but generally includes:
*personnel administration
*payroll
*finance
*strategic planning
*Information technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice manager|url=https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/management/roles-management/practice-manager|website=Health Careers|publisher=Health Education England|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyomyositis''', also known as '''tropical pyomyositis''' or '''myositis tropicans''', is a [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] of the [[skeletal muscle]]s which results in a [[pus]]-filled [[abscess]]. Pyomyositis is most common in [[tropical]] areas but can also occur in [[temperate zone]]s. 
[[File:CT pyomyositis.jpg|thumb|CT with IV contrast showing enlargement and heterogeneous hypodensity in the right pectoralis major muscle.  A focal abscess collection with gas within it is present medially.  There are enlarged axillary lymph nodes and some extension into the right hemithorax.  Note the soft tissue and phlegmon surrounding the right internal mammary artery and vein.  The patient was HIV+ and the pyomyositis is believed to be due to direct inoculation of the muscle related to parenteral drug abuse. The patient admitted to being a "pocket shooter"]]

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
* Pus discharge culture and sensitivity
* X ray of the part to rule out osteomyelitis
* Creatinine phosphokinase (more than 50,000 units)
* MRI is useful.
* Ultrasound guided aspiration

==Treatment==
The abscesses within the muscle must be drained [[surgery|surgically]] (not all patient require surgery if there is no abscess). [[Antibiotics]] are given for a minimum of three weeks to clear the infection.&lt;ref name="pmid16983604"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Pyomyositis is most often caused by the bacterium ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid15138315"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chauhan S, Jain S, Varma S, Chauhan SS | title = Tropical pyomyositis (myositis tropicans): current perspective | journal = Postgrad Med J | volume = 80| issue = 943 | pages = 267&amp;ndash;70 | year = 2004| pmid = 15138315 | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.2003.009274| url=http://pmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15138315 | pmc = 1743005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infection can affect any skeletal muscle, but most often infects the large muscle groups such as the [[quadriceps]] or [[gluteal muscles]].&lt;ref name="pmid16983604"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Pannaraj PS, Hulten KG, Gonzalez BE, ((Mason EO Jr)), Kaplan SL| title = Clin Infect Dis| year = 2006| volume = 43| pages = 953&amp;ndash;60| pmid = 16983604| issue = 8| doi = 10.1086/507637| journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17273045"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ovadia D| title = Primary pyomyositis in children: a retrospective analysis of 11 cases| journal = J Pediatr Orthop B| year = 2007| volume = 16| issue = 2| pages = 153&amp;ndash;159| pmid = 17273045|name-list-format=vanc| author2 = Ezra E| author3 = Ben-Sira L| display-authors = 3| doi = 10.1097/BPB.0b013e3280140548| last4 = Kessler| first4 = A| last5 = Bickels| first5 = J| last6 = Keret| first6 = D| last7 = Yaniv| first7 = M| last8 = Wientroub| first8 = S| last9 = Lokiec| first9 = F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19944229"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Mitsionis GI| title = Pyomyositis in children: early diagnosis and treatment| journal = J Pediatr Surg| year = 2009| volume = 44| issue = 11| pages = 2173&amp;ndash;178| pmid = 19944229|name-list-format=vanc| author2 = Manoudis GN| author3 = Lykissas MG| display-authors = 3| doi = 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.02.053| last4 = Sionti| first4 = I| last5 = Motsis| first5 = E| last6 = Georgoulis| first6 = AD| last7 = Berisa| first7 = AE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyomyositis is mainly a disease of children and was first described by Scriba in 1885. Most patients are aged 2 to 5 years, but infection may occur in any age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Small LN, Ross JJ | title = Tropical and temperate pyomyositis| journal = Infect Dis Clin North Am| year = 2005| volume = 19| pages = 981&amp;ndash;989| doi = 10.1016/j.idc.2005.08.003| issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19013093"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Taksande A, Vilhekar K, Gupta S | title = Primary pyomyositis in a child| journal = Int J Infect Dis| year = 2009| volume = 13| pages = e149&amp;ndash;e151| pmid = 19013093| doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.08.013| issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection often follows minor trauma and is more common in the tropics, where it accounts for 4% of all hospital admissions. In temperate countries such as the US, pyomyositis was a rare condition (accounting for 1 in 3000 pediatric admissions), but has become more common since the appearance of the USA300 strain of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]].&lt;ref name="pmid16983604"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17273045"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19944229"/&gt;

'''Sociedad Española de Inmunología Clínica, Alergología y Asma Pediátrica''' ('''SEICAP'''), the Spanish Society of Pediatric Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology, is a scientific, non-profit organization, whose aims are to develop and disseminate the knowledge of allergic and immunologic diseases that affect children. Since June 2012 SEICAP has been recognized as a Public Interest Entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2012-8551 BOE: Boletin Oficial del Estado ]&lt;/ref&gt;
As the most important part of their field of study we can include childhood [[asthma]], [[rhinitis]] and [[conjunctivitis]], [[anaphylaxis]], [[atopic dermatitis]], [[contact dermatitis]], [[urticaria]] and [[angioedema]], [[food allergy]], [[drug allergy]], allergy to [[latex]], allergy to insect stings, primary [[immunodeficiency]], and other disorders.
These conditions are very frequent in children, especially in developed countries,&lt;ref name="Asher1"&gt;Asher MI, Montefort S, Bjorksten B, et al.

==History ==
The acquisition of new [[knowledge]] and the [[Research and development|development]] of new [[diagnostic]] and [[therapeutic]] techniques in the field of [[medicine]] have given rise to different medical specialties. [[Pediatrics]] was born as a specialty in the nineteenth century, for the study of health in children, because their special features make their pathological processes differ from those of adults, and it experienced the same progress as other areas of medicine. The subsequent development of techniques led to the creation of subspecialties within the field of pediatrics.
The different Pediatric Specialties are being promoted by the Spanish Association of Pediatrics (AEP) since 1967. In 1972 the Section of Pediatric Clinical Immunology and Allergology was created, although its actual implementation took place in 1976, during the National Congress of Pediatrics held in Barcelona. In 1995 the Section was transformed into the current SEICAP, as an independent Society with its specific statutes, while maintaining a close relationship with AEP.

==Mission and values ==

*Leading the knowledge about the diagnosis, assessment, treatment and prevention of allergic and immunological diseases in children, in order to provide the best care for those who have or are at risk for having these diseases.
*Disseminating such knowledge among professionals and nonprofessionals interested in this field.
*Contributing to national and international research, especially in the European and Latin American area.
*Establishing national and international relationships with other Societes that share the same goals.
*Acting as an advisory body for the Public Administration, private entities and other societies, on issues related to the specialty.
*Representing professionals interested in the area of pediatric allergy and clinical immunology.

Ethics is an inseparable foundation of SEICAP as an association. The aims and activities of SEICAP are guided by the objective of achieving excellence in the care of children with health problems related to the specialty.

==Structure==

The number of members of SEICAP is about 350 in 2012. The Society is governed by a Board, composed of seven members, to be partially renewed every 2 years by voting in the General Assembly.  To achieve its purposes SEICAP has created several working groups, whose activity is focused on specific aspects of childhood allergy and clinical immunology. These groups are:

*Clinical Immunology 
*Continued Education 
*Drug Allergy
*Food Allergy
*Health Public Education

The activity of such groups results in the preparation of Reports and Position Papers, Protocols for Diagnosis and Treatment, in organizing training courses, in the design and implementation of projects for basic and clinical research, in the dissemination of information for the scientific community and the general public, and in the collaboration with other scientific societies, with official bodies and with patients’ associations.

Every year SEICAP organizes its Annual Congress, which updates the knowledge of the specialty, and in which the members contribute papers on their research. SEICAP has a medical journal, ''[http://www.elsevier.es/en/revistas/allergologia-et-immunopathologia-105 Allergologia et Immunopathologia]'', which is the official organ of the Society, and in which scientific articles are published, submitted by authors from any country. SEICAP has implemented a  [http://www.seicap.es website]. It has an area for professionals and an area for patients and families. It features news and permanent and updated advice (in Spanish) about practical management of allergic diseases, concerning avoidance of [[allergens]], diets, use of [[medication]], treatment protocols, and extensive information for public education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43053">'''Self-help groups for mental health,''' or mutual aid groups are voluntary associations of people who share a common desire to overcome [[mental illness]] or otherwise increase their level of cognitive or emotional wellbeing.&lt;ref name="HUMPHREYS1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Humphreys | first = Keith |author2=Rappaport, Julian  | title = Researching self-help/mutual aid groups and organizations: Many roads, on journey |date=Autumn 1994 | journal = Applied and Preventive Psychology |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=217–231 |doi=10.1016/S0962-1849(05)80096-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the different approaches, many of the psychosocial processes in the groups are the same. Self-help groups have had varying relationships with [[mental health professionals]] but generally is shown in research to provide additional support alongside mental health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borkman|first=Thomasina|date=April 1990|title=Self-help groups at the turning point: Emerging egalitarian alliances with the formal health care system?|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1007/BF00931307|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=321–332|doi=10.1007/bf00931307|issn=0091-0562}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Powell|first=Thomas J.|title=The Contribution of Self-Help Groups to the Mental Health/Substance Use Services System|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-6253-9_15|work=Mental Health Self-Help|pages=335–353|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781441962522|access-date=2018-07-31|last2=Perron|first2=Brian E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;Due to the nature of these groups, self-help groups can help defray the costs of mental health treatment and implementation into the existing mental health system could help provide treatment to a greater number of the mentally-ill population.

Although this article specifically defines mental health as relating to mental illness diagnoses or cognitive/behavioral processes, it should be noted that mental health is an important focus of other categories of self-help groups that are not listed below, such as 12-step groups like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], [[support group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for those who have undergone trauma like [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]]. These self-help groups aim towards improving the mental health surrounding trauma or addiction in order to facilitate recovery.

== Types ==

===Mutual support and self-help===

'''Mutual support''' or [[peer support]] is a process by which people voluntarily come together to help each other address common problems. Mutual support is social, emotional or instrumental support that is mutually offered or provided by persons with similar [[mental health]] conditions where there is some mutual agreement on what is helpful.&lt;ref name="SOLOMON2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davidson | first = Larry |author2=Chinman, Matthew |author3=Kloos, Bret |author4=Weingarten, Richard |author5=Stayner, David |author6=Kraemer, Jacob | year = 1999 | title = Peer Support Among Individuals with Severe Mental Illness: A Review of the Evidence | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–187 | issn = 1468-2850 | doi = 10.1093/clipsy/6.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual support may include many other [[mental health consumer]] [[non-profit]]s and social groups. Such groups are further distinguished as either Individual Therapy (inner-focused) or Social Reform (outer-focused) groups. The former is where members seek to improve themselves, where as the latter set encompasses advocacy organizations such as the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] and [[Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association]]&lt;ref name="NANCY2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tomes | first = Nancy |date=May 2006 | title = The Patient As A Policy Factor: A Historical Case Study Of The Consumer/Survivor Movement In Mental Health | journal = Health Affairs (Project Hope) | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 720–729 | issn = 1544-5208 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.25.3.720 | pmid = 16684736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-help''' groups are subsets of mutual support and peer support groups, and have a specific purpose for mutual aid in satisfying a common need, overcoming a shared handicap or life-disrupting problem. Self-help groups are less bureaucratic and work on a more [[grassroots]] level.&lt;ref name="SOLOMON2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEVY1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Levy | first = Leon H. | year = 1978 | title = Self-help groups viewed by mental health professionals: A survey and comments | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–313 | issn = 0091-0562 | doi = 10.1007/BF00885522 | pmid = 696694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-help Organizations are national affiliates of local self-help groups or mental health consumer groups that finance research, maintain public relations or lobby for legislation in favor of those affected.&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"/&gt; Self-help groups include Family-to-Family education and [[support group]]s - the effectiveness of which has been confirmed in a recent controlled study.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, L. B., Lucksted, A., Medoff, D. R., Burland, J., Stewart, B., Lehman, A. F., Fang, L. J., Sturm, V., Brown, C., Murray-Swank, A. (2011). Outcomes of a randomized study of a peer-taught family-to-family education program for mental illness.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior Control or Stress Coping groups ===
Of individual therapy groups, researchers distinguish between Behavior Control groups (such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and [[TOPS Club, Inc.|TOPS]]) and Stress Coping groups (such as mental health support groups, [[Cancer support group|cancer patient support groups]], and groups of [[single parents]]).&lt;ref name="KNIGHT1980"/&gt; German researchers refer to Stress Coping groups as Conversation Circles.&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Moeller | first = Michael L. | title = History, Concept and Position of Self-Help Groups in Germany | journal = Group Analysis | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–194 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1177/05333169922076653 | issn = 0533-3164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant differences exist between Behavioral Control groups and Stress Coping groups. Meetings of Behavior Control groups tend to be significantly larger than Stress Coping counterparts (by more than a factor of two). Behavior Control group members have a longer average group tenure than members of Stress Coping groups (45 months compared to 11 months), and are less likely to consider their membership as temporary. While very few members of either set saw professionals concurrently while being active in their group, Stress Coping members were more likely to have previously seen professionals than Behavior Control group members. Similarly, Stress Coping groups worked closer with mental health professionals.&lt;ref name="KNIGHT1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WOLLERT1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wollert | first = Richard W. |author2=Levy, Leon H. |author3=Knight, Bob G. |date=May 1982 | title = Help-Giving in Behavioral Control and Stress Coping Self-Help Groups | journal = Small Group Research | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 204–218 | issn = 1046-4964 | doi = 10.1177/104649648201300206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Member vs professional leadership ===
'''Member leadership.''' In Germany a specific subset of Conversation Circles are categorized as Talking Groups (''Gesprächsselbsthilfegruppen''). In Talking Groups all members of the group have the same rights, each member is responsible only for themselves (group members do not make decisions for other group members), each group is autonomous, everyone attends the group on account of their own problems, whatever is discussed in the group remains confidential, and participation is free of charge.&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"/&gt;

'''Professionally led group psychotherapy.''' Self-help groups are not intended to provide "deep" psychotherapy. Nevertheless, their emphasis on psychosocial processes, and the understanding shared by those with the same or similar mental illnesses does achieve constructive treatment goals.&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt;

Interpersonal learning, which is done through processes such as feedback and confrontation, is generally deemphasized in self-help groups. This is largely because it can be threatening, and requires training and understanding of small group processes. Similarly, reality testing, is also deemphasized. Reality testing relies on consensual [[Compliance (Psychology)|validation]], offering feedback, seeking feedback and confrontation. These processes seldom occur in self-help groups, though they frequently occur in professionally directed groups.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WOLLERT1982"/&gt;

==== Professional affiliation and group lifespan ====
If self-help groups are not affiliated with a national organization, professional involvement increases their [[life expectancy]]. Conversely, if particular groups are affiliated with a national organization professional involvement decreases their life expectancy.&lt;ref name="MATON1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maton | first1 = Kenneth I. | last2 = Leventhal | first2 = Gerald S. | last3 = Madara | first3 = Edward J. | last4 = Julien | first4 = Mariesa |date=October 1989 | title = Factors affecting the birth and death of mutual-help groups: The role of national affiliation, professional involvement, and member focal problem | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 643–671 | issn = 0091-0562 | doi = 10.1007/BF00922640 | pmid = 2627026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules enforcing self-regulation in Talking Groups are essential for the group's effectiveness.&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"/&gt;

=== Typology of Self-Help Groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Marsha A.|last2=Borkman|first2=Thomasina J.|date=October 1991|title=An organizational typology for self-help groups|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00938044|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|volume=19|issue=5|pages=769–787|doi=10.1007/bf00938044|issn=0091-0562}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

==== Unaffiliated Groups ====
Unaffiliated groups are defined as self-help groups that function independently from any control at state or national levels, and from any other group or professionals. These groups accept all potential members, and everyone has an equal opportunity to volunteer or be elected. Leaders serve to help the groups function by collecting donations not through controlling the members. Experiential knowledge is mostly found, and there is a high emphasis on sharing. An example of an unaffiliated group includes Wildflowers' Movement in Los Angeles.

==== Federated Groups ====
Federated groups have superordinate levels of their own self-help organization at state or national levels which make publicity and literature available. The local unit of the federated self-help group retains full control of its decisions. These groups tend to rely on experiential knowledge, and professionals rarely directly interact. The leaders of these groups would be any members comfortable with the format and willing to accept responsibilities. Leaders do not need to have formal training to gain their title. Examples of a federated self-help group would be [[Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance]] (DBSA) and [[Recovery International]].

==== Affiliated Groups ====
Affiliated groups are subordinate to another group, a regional or national level of their own organization. Local groups conform to guidelines of the regional/national groups. Leaders are self-helpers not professional caregivers, and meetings included educational activities and sharing, supplemented by research and professionals. Examples of an affiliated self-help group would be the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI).

==== Managed Groups ====
Managed groups are based on a combination of self-help and professional techniques. These groups are populated generally through referrals and group activities are led by group members. Managed groups do not meet all the criteria for self-help groups, and so should be designated professionally controlled support groups. Examples of managed groups are common with support groups in hospitals, such as those with breast cancer survivors and patients that may be managed by a nurse or therapist in some professional fashion. 

==== Hybrid Groups ====
The hybrid group has characteristics of the affiliated and managed groups, Like Affiliated Groups, hybrid groups are organized by another level of their own organization. To participate in specialized roles, training is developed by a higher level and enforced through trained leaders or facilitators. The hybrid group14/5 is like a managed group in that it cooperates and interacts with professionals, and that knowledge is highly valued alongside experiential knowledge.

== Group processes ==
No two self-help group are exactly alike, the make-up and attitudes are influenced by the group ideology and environment.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt; In most cases, the group becomes a miniature society that can function like a buffer between the members and the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt; The most essential processes are those that meet personal and social needs in an environment of [[safety]] and [[simplicity]]. Elegant theoretical formulations, systematic behavioral techniques, and complicated [[Cognitive restructuring|cognitive-restructuring]] methods are not necessary.&lt;ref name="WOLLERT1982"/&gt;

Despite the differences, researchers have identified many psychosocial processes occurring in self-help groups related to their effectiveness. This list includes, but is not limited too: [[acceptance]], [[Practice (learning method)|behavioral rehearsal]], changing member's [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]] of themselves, changing member's perspectives of the world, [[catharsis]], [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]], [[role model]]ing, learning new [[coping strategies]], mutual [[wikt:affirmation|affirmation]], [[Objective (goal)|personal goal setting]], instilling [[hope]], [[Theory of justification|justification]], [[Normalization (sociology)|normalization]], positive [[reinforcement]], reducing [[social isolation]], reducing [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigma]], [[self-disclosure]], sharing (or "opening up"), and showing [[empathy]].&lt;ref name="SOLOMON2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WOLLERT1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="POWELL2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SARGENT2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sargent | first = Judy | last2 = Williams | first2 = Reg A |last3 = Hagerty | first3 = Bonnie |last4 = Lynch-Sauer, | first4 = Judith | last5 = Hoyle |first5 = Kenneth | year = 2002 | title = Sense of Belonging as a Buffer Against Depressive Symptoms | journal = Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 120–129 | issn = 1532-5725 | doi = 10.1067/mpn.2002.127290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five theoretical frameworks have been used in attempts to explain the effectiveness of self-help groups.&lt;ref name="SOLOMON2004"/&gt;

# [[Social support]]: Having a community of people to give physical and emotional comfort, people who love and care, is a [[Moderator variable|moderating factor]] in the development of psychological and physical disease.
# [[Experiential knowledge]]: Members obtain specialized information and perspectives that other members have obtained through living with severe mental illness. Validation of their approaches to problems increase their confidence.
# [[Social learning theory]]: Members with experience become creditable role models.
# [[Social comparison theory]]: Individuals with similar mental illness are attracted to each other in order to establish a sense of normalcy for themselves. Comparing one another to each other is considered to provide other peers with an incentive to change for the better either through upward comparison (looking up to someone as a role model) or downward comparison (seeing an example of how debilitating mental illness can be).
# [[Helper theory]]: Those helping each other feel greater interpersonal competence from changing other's lives for the better. The helpers feel they have gained as much as they have given to others. The helpers receive "personalized learning" from working with helpees. The helpers' self-esteem improves with the social approval received from those they have helped, putting them in a more advantageous position to help others.

A framework derived from common themes in empirical data describes recovery as a contextual nonlinear process, a trend of general improvement with unavoidable [[wiktionary:paroxysm|paroxysm]]s while negotiating environmental, socioeconomic and internal forces, motivated by a drive to move forward in one's life. The framework identified several negotiation strategies, some designed to accommodate illnesses and others designed to change thinking and behavior. The former category includes strategies such as acceptance and [[Balance (metaphysics)|balancing]] activities. The latter includes [[Positive mental attitude|positive thinking]], increasing one's own personal [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]/[[Control theory (sociology)|control]] and [[Psychiatric survivors movement|activism within the mental health system]].&lt;ref name="OCHOCKA2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ochocka |first=Joanna |author2=Nelson, Geoff |author3=Janzen, Rich  |title=Moving Forward: Negotiating Self and External Circumstances in Recovery |pmid=15895914 |journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal |volume=28 |issue=4 |date=Spring 2005 |pages=315–322 |doi=10.2975/28.2005.315.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with mental health professionals ==

A 1978 survey of [[mental health professional]]s in the United States found they had a relatively favorable opinion of self-help groups and there was a hospitable climate for integration and cooperation with self-help groups in the mental health delivery system.&lt;ref name="LEVY1978" /&gt; The role of self-help groups in instilling hope, facilitating coping, and improving the quality of life of their members is now widely accepted in many areas both inside and outside of the general medical community.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt;

The 1987 Surgeon's General Workshop marked a publicized call for egalitarian relationships with self-help groups. Surgeon General Everett C. Koop presented at this workshop, advocating for relationships that are not superordinate-subordinate, but rather emphasizing respectful, equal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borkman|first=Thomasina|date=April 1990|title=Self-help groups at the turning point: Emerging egalitarian alliances with the formal health care system?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00931307|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=321–332|doi=10.1007/bf00931307|issn=0091-0562|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study about the risks of professional partnerships centers on the partnership between Schizophrenics Anonymous (SA) and the Mental Health Association of Michigan (MHAM) over a 14-year period. The study shows that the professional partnership resulted in increased access to SA Groups across Michigan and organization expansion and development within SA. The professional influence also lead more SA Groups to be held in more traditional mental health treatment settings and led to more professional-led SA groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Salem|first=Deborah A.|title=Helping Mutual Help: Managing the Risks of Professional Partnerships|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-6253-9_14|work=Mental Health Self-Help|pages=303–334|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781441962522|access-date=2018-08-08|last2=Reischl|first2=Thomas M.|last3=Randall|first3=Katie W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of psychotherapists in [[Germany]] found that 50% of the respondents reported a high or very high acceptance of self-help groups and 43.2% rated their acceptance of self-help groups as moderate. Only 6.8% of respondents rated their acceptance of self-help groups as low or very low.&lt;ref name="FRIEDHELM2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedhelm | first1 = Meyer | last2 = Matzat | first2 = Jürgen | last3 = Höflich | first3 = Anke |last4=Scholz |first4=Sigrid |last5 = Beutel | first5 = Manfred E. |date=December 2004 | title = Self-help groups for psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders in Germany—themes, frequency and support by self-help advice centres | journal = Journal of Public Health | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 359–364 | issn = 0943-1853 | doi = 10.1007/s10389-004-0071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys of self-help groups has shown very little evidence of antagonism towards mental health professionals.&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt; The maxim of self-help groups in the United States is "Doctors know better than we do how a sickness can be treated. We know better than doctors how sick people can be treated as humans."&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"/&gt;

=== Referrals ===
A large majority of self-help users use professional services as a gateway to self-help services, or concurrently with professional service or the aftercare following professional service. Professional referrals to self-help groups thus can be a cost-effective method of continuing mental health services and are a way the two can co-exist within their own fields. While 12-step groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous make an indispensable contribution to the mental and/or substance use (M/SU) professional services system, a vast number of non-12-step groups remain underutilized within that system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Powell|first=Thomas J.|title=The Contribution of Self-Help Groups to the Mental Health/Substance Use Services System|date=2010|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-6253-9_15|work=Mental Health Self-Help|pages=335–353|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781441962522|access-date=2018-08-09|last2=Perron|first2=Brian E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These non-12 step groups include those listed below, such as NAMI, DBSA, and Recovery International, as well as local, unaffiliated groups. Professional referrals to such non-12 step groups could be greatly beneficial in establishing these groups as part of the mental health treatment system and gaining acceptance amongst the community. 

Professional referrals to self-help groups for mental health are less effective than arranging for prospective self-help members to meet with veterans of the self-help group. This is true even when compared to referrals from professionals familiar with the self-help group when referring clients to it.&lt;ref name="POWELL2000"/&gt; Referrals mostly come from informal sources (e.g. family, friends, word of mouth, self). Those attending groups as a result of professional referrals account for only one fifth to one third of the population.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt; One survey found 54% of members learned about their self-help group from the media, 40% learned about their group from friends and relatives, and relatively few learned about them from professional referrals.&lt;ref name="KNIGHT1980"/&gt;

Self-help groups are effective for helping people cope with, and recover from, a wide variety of problems.&lt;ref name="SOLOMON2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KYROUZ2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kyrouz | first = Elaina M. |author2=Humphreys, Keith |author3=Loomis, Colleen |date=October 2002 | title = American Self-Help Group Clearinghouse Self-Help Group Sourcebook | edition = 7th  | chapter = Chapter 4: A Review of Research on the Effectiveness of Self-help Mutual Aid Groups | chapterurl = http://facesandvoicesofrecovery.org/pdf/kyrouz%20humphreys%20loomis%202002.pdf | editor = White, Barbara J. |editor2=Madara, Edward J. | isbn = 1-930683-00-6 | pages = 71–86 | url = http://www.mentalhelp.net/selfhelp/ | publisher = American Self-Help Group Clearinghouse | accessdate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; German Talking Groups have been shown to be as effective as psychoanalytically oriented group therapy.&lt;ref name="MOELLER1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DAUM1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Daum | first = K.W. |author2=Matzat, J. |author3=Moeller, M.L. | year = 1984 | title = Psychologisch-therapeutische Selbsthilfegruppen: Ein Forschungsbericht | journal = Schriftenreihe des Bundesministers fur Jugend, Familie und Gesundheit. | issue = Stuttgart: Kohlhammer | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in self-help groups for mental health is correlated with reductions in psychiatric hospitalizations, and shorter hospitalizations if they occur. Members demonstrate improved [[coping skill]]s, greater acceptance of their illness, improved medication adherence, decreased levels of [[worry]], higher satisfaction with their health, improved daily functioning and improved illness management. Participation in self-help groups for mental health encourages more appropriate use of professional services, making the time spent in care more efficient. The amount of time spent in the programs, and how proactive the members are in them, has also been correlated with increased benefits.&lt;ref name="SOLOMON2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="POWELL2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Powell | first = Thomas J. |author2=Hill, Elizabeth M. |author3=Warner, Lynn |author4=Yeaton, Willian |author5=Silk, Kenneth R. | year = 2000 | title = Encouraging People With Mood Disorders to Attend a Self-Help Group | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 2270–2288 | issn = 0021-9029 | doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02436.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased hospitalization and shorter durations of hospitalization indicate that self-help groups result in financial savings for the health care system, as hospitalization is one of the most expensive mental health services.

While self-help groups for mental health increase self-esteem, reduce stigma, accelerate [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], improve [[decision making|decision-making]], decrease tendency to [[Decompensation|decompensate]] under [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], and improve social functioning, they are not always shown to reduce psychiatric symptomatology.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KAUFMAN1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaufman |first=C.

=== Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) ===
{{Main|Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance}}

Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) is a non-profit organization offering support groups for people with depression and bipolar disorder and their family and friends. Originally founded in 1986, it was formerly known as NDMDA (The National Depressive and Manic-Depressive Alliance). DBSA’s format is based neither on twelve steps, nor&amp;nbsp;on a certain text, and in some respects varies from location to location and group to group. While peer facilitators lead the groups, mental health professionals from the local area act as advisors and board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/272382232|title=Evidence-based adjunctive treatments|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|others=O'Donohue, William T., Cummings, Nicholas A.|isbn=9780120885206|edition=1st |location=Amsterdam|oclc=272382232}}&lt;/ref&gt; DBSA’s emphasis is on in-person and online peer support; updated, easily comprehensible information about depression and bipolar disorder; and tools that put the focus on an integrated method of dealing with wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=www.dbsalliance.org|title=About the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions Anonymous ===
{{Main|Emotions Anonymous}}
Emotions Anonymous (EA) is a derivative program of Neurotics Anonymous&lt;ref name="CHESTNUT2015"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chestnut, Glenn F. |title=Father Ed Dowling: Bill Wilson's Sponsor |chapter=Notes |publisher=iUniverse |date=2015-07-17 |isbn=1491770872 |oclc=914573796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and open to anyone who wants to achieve emotional well-being.&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt; Following the [[Twelve Traditions]], EA groups cannot accept outside contributions.&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt;

=== GROW ===
{{Main|GROW}}
GROW was founded in [[Sydney, Australia]], in 1957 by a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]], [[Con Keogh|Father Cornelius Keogh]], and people who had sought help with their mental illness at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. After its inception, GROW members learned of Recovery, Inc. (the organization now known as Recovery International) and integrated its processes into their program. GROW's original literature includes the Twelve Stages of Decline, which state that emotional illness begins with self-centeredness, and the Twelve Steps of Recovery and Personal Growth, a blend of AA's Twelve Steps and will-training methods from Recovery International. GROW groups are open to anyone who would like to join, though they specifically recruit people who have been in psychiatric hospitals or are socioeconomically disadvantaged. GROW does not operate with funding restrictions and have received state and outside funding in the past.&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kurtz | first = Linda F. |author2=Chambon, Adrienne  | year = 1987 | title = Comparison of self-help groups for mental health | journal = Health &amp; social work | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 275–283 | issn = 0360-7283 | pmid = 3679015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hearing Voices ===
{{Main|Hearing Voices Movement|}}The Hearing Voices Movement was founded in 1987 by [[Marius Romme]], [[Sandra Escher]] and Patsy Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.intervoiceonline.org/about-intervoice/patsy-hague-inspiration|title=Patsy Hague: Inspiration|work=Intervoice|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization represents a different approach to talking about "hearing voices", or medically-deemed auditory hallucinations. 

===National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)===
{{Main|National Alliance on Mental Illness|}}
NAMI Peer to Peer is an educational program hosted by the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], a mental illness advocacy and psycho-education group with branches in most areas of the United States. The program involves a 10-week educational course target at those diagnosed with a mental illness and aims to impress on its attendees better practical coping skills and knowledge of mental illnesses in hopes of empowering individuals. NAMI has Peer-to-Peer classes in addition to the family-to-family classes.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatric Services, 62(6), 591-598.&lt;/ref&gt; National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has two self-help groups: NAMI Family Support Group for family, friends and caregivers of people living with mental illness, and NAMI Connection Recovery Support Group for consumers, or individuals with mental illness. Both groups are led by peer facilitators who either have a diagnosed mental illness or who have a loved one who does. The groups utilize a&amp;nbsp;structured model but do not endorse a certain therapy or medication. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/NAMI-Programs/NAMI-Connection|title=NAMI Connection|last=|first=|date=2018|website=www.nami.org|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurotics Anonymous===
{{Main|Neurotics Anonymous}}
Neurotics Anonymous is a twelve-step program open to anyone with a desire to become emotionally well.&lt;ref name="BOYDSTONINTRO1974"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Boydston |first=Grover |title=A history and status report of Neurotics Anonymous, an organization offering self-help for the mentally and emotionally disturbed |year=1974 |publisher=[[Barry University]] |location=[[Miami, Florida]] |oclc=14126024 |pages=1–5 |chapter=Part I. Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Twelve Traditions]] followed in the program, Neurotics Anonymous is unable to accept outside contributions.&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt;The term "neurotics" or "neuroses" has since fallen out of favor with mental health professionals, with movement away from the psychoanalytic principles of a DSM-II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayer|first=Ronald|date=1985-02-01|title=Neurosis, Psychodynamics, and DSM-III|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.1985.01790250081011|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=42|issue=2|pages=187|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1985.01790250081011|issn=0003-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branches of Neurotics Anonymous have since changed their name to Emotions Anonymous, which is currently the name in favor with the Minnesota Groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54625984|title=It works if you work it|date=2003|publisher=Emotions Anonymous|others=Emotions Anonymous International.|isbn=0960735690|location=Saint Paul, Minn.|oclc=54625984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups in Mexico, however, called Neuróticos Anónimos still are referred to by the same name, due to the term "neuroticos" having a less pejorative connotation in Spanish. This branch continues to flourish in Mexico City as well as largely Spanish-speaking cities in the United States, such as Los Angeles.

=== Recovery International ===
{{Main|Recovery International}}
Recovery, Inc. was founded in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1937 by psychiatrist [[Abraham Low]] using principles in contrast to those popularized by [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name="SAGARINMENTAL1969"/&gt; During the organization's annual meeting in June 2007 it was announced that Recovery, Inc. would thereafter be known as Recovery International.&lt;ref name="REPORTER2007"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Recovery Reporter |title=Annual Meeting | year = 2007 |volume=70 |issue=2 |oclc=22518904 |publisher=Recovery, Inc |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery International is open to anyone identifying as "nervous" (a compromise between the loaded term [[neurosis|neurotic]] and the colloquial phrase "nervous breakdown");&lt;ref name="SAGARINMENTAL1969"/&gt; strictly encourages members to follow their physician's, social worker's, psychologist's or psychiatrist's orders; and does not operate with funding restrictions.&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt;

Fundamentally, Low believes "Adult life is not driven by [[instincts]] but guided by [[Will (philosophy)|Will]]," using a definition of will opposite of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Arthur Schopenhauer's]]. Low's program is based on increasing determination to act, [[Self control|self-control]] and [[self-esteem|self-confidence]]. [[Edward Sagarin]] compared it to a modern, reasonable, and rational implementation of [[Émile Coué|Émile Coué's]] psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="SAGARINMENTAL1969"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagarin |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Sagarin |title=Odd Man In: Societies of Deviants in America |year=1969 |publisher=Quadrangle Books |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |isbn=0-531-06344-5 |oclc=34435 |pages=210–232 |chapter=Chapter 9.

== Criticism ==
There are several limitations of self-help groups for mental health, including but not limited to their inability to keep detailed records, lack of formal procedures to follow up with members, absence of formal screening procedures for new members, lack formal leadership training, and likely inability of members to recognize a "newcomer" presenting with a serious illness requiring immediate treatment. Additionally, there is a lack of professional or legal regulatory constraints determining how such groups can operate, there is a danger that members may disregard the advice of mental health professionals, and there can be an anti-therapeutic suppression of ambivalence and hostility.&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt; Researchers have also elaborated specific criticisms regarding self-help groups' formulaic approach, attrition rates, over-generalization, and "panacea complex."&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt;

=== Formulaic approach ===
Researchers have questioned whether formulaic approaches to self-help [[group therapy]], like the [[Twelve-step program#Twelve Steps|Twelve Steps]], could stifle creativity or if adherence to them may prevent the group from making useful or necessary changes.&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dean | first = Stanley R. |date=January 1971 | title = The Role of Self-Conducted Group Therapy | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 127 | issue = 7 | pages = 934–937 | issn = 0002-953X | pmid = 5540340| doi = 10.1176/ajp.127.7.934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAGARINGAMBLERS1969"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagarin |first=Edward |title=Odd man in; societies of deviants in America |year=1969 |publisher=Quadrangle Books |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |isbn=0-531-06344-5 |oclc=34435 |pages=56–77 |chapter=Chapter 3. Gamblers, addicts, illegitimates, and others: imitators and emulators}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly others have criticized self-help group structure as being too rigid.&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt;

=== High attrition rates ===
There is not a universal appeal of self-help groups; as few as 17% of people invited to attend a self-help group will do so. Of those, only one third will stay for longer than four months. Those who continue are people who value the meetings and the self-help group experience.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KURTZ1987"/&gt;

=== Overgeneralization ===
Since these groups are not specifically diagnosis-related, but rather for anyone seeking mental and emotional health, they may not provide the necessary sense of community to evoke feelings of oneness required for recovery in self-help groups.&lt;ref name="POWELL2000" /&gt; [[French and Raven's bases of power#Referent power|Referent power]] is only one factor contributing to group effectiveness. A study of [[Schizophrenics Anonymous]] found [[French and Raven's bases of power#Expert power|expert power]] to be more influential in measurements of perceived group helpfulness.&lt;ref name="SALEM2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salem |first=Deborah |author2=Reischl, Thomas M. |author3=Gallacher, Fiona |author4= Randall, Katie Weaver  |title=Referent and Expert Power in Mutual Help |journal=American Journal of Community Psychology |issn=1573-2770 |volume=28 |date=June 2000 |pages=303–324 |doi=10.1023/A:1005101320639 |issue=3 |pmid=10945119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panacea complex ===
There is a risk that self-help group members may come to believe that group participation is a [[Panacea (medicine)|panacea]]—that the group's processes can remedy any problem.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DEAN1971"/&gt;

[[File:Emmet Practices Opening a Power Door.jpg|thumb|300px|This service dog has been trained to press a button to open an electric door for his wheelchair-using owner.]]

'''Service animals''' are [[animal]]s that have been trained to perform tasks that assist disabled people.  Service animals may also be referred to as '''assistance animals''', '''assist animals''', or '''helper animals''' depending on the country and the animal's function.

Dogs are the most common service animals, assisting people in many different ways since at least 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Harrison Eustis |first1=Dorothy |authorlink1=Dorothy Harrison Eustis |title=The Seeing Eye |journal=Saturday Evening Post |date=November 5, 1927 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other animals such as pigs, birds, and horses have also been documented. The service animal is not required by the ADA to wear a vest, ID tag or a specific harness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Service Animals and the ADA |url=https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html |website=www.ada.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In places of public accommodation in the United States, only dogs (and in some cases miniature horses) are legally considered service animals.&lt;ref name="DOJ"&gt;[http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm Revised ADA Requirements: Service Animals].  US Department of Justice.  12 July 2011.  Accessed 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  It is legal in certain states to have service "animals". For instance, in Montana all animals are allowed at state level. Many cats, birds, and even a wolf are working to help mitigate people's disabilities in Montana. It is also legal to train your own service animal in the United States.  There is a broader definition for assistance animals under the US [[Fair Housing Act]] as well as a broader definition for service animals under the US [[Air Carrier Access Act]].&lt;ref name="DOJ" /&gt;  In the United States, prior to a revision of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] going into effect March 15, 2011&lt;ref name="ada.gov"&gt;http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm&lt;/ref&gt; types of animals other than service dogs and miniature horses were protected at least on the Federal level; individual states ''could'' expand coverage.

==Definitions==
The international assistance animal community has categorized three types of assistance animals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaadp.org/A-dogWorld.html International Association of Assistance Dog Plove burger artners] Retrieved on October 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Guide animal—to guide the blind
# Hearing animal—to signal the hearing impaired
# Service animal—to do work for persons with disabilities other than blindness or deafness.

==Access==
Despite regulations or rules that deny access to animals in restaurants and other public places, in many countries, [[guide dog]]s, other types of assistance dogs, and in cases miniature horses,&lt;ref name="ada.gov"/&gt; are protected by law, and therefore may accompany their handlers in most places that are open to the public. Laws and regulations vary worldwide:

*In the [[United States]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] prohibits any business, government agency, or other organization that provides access to the general public from barring guide dogs. However, religious organizations are not required to provide such access. Current federal regulations define "service animal" for ADA purposes to exclude all species of animals other than domestic dogs and miniature horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Service Animals|url=http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm|work=Civil Rights Division|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other laws, though, still provide broader definitions in other areas.  For instance, the Department of Transportation's regulations enacting the [[Air Carrier Access Act]] permit "dogs and other service animals" to accompany passengers on commercial airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=14 CFR Part 382 Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel|url=http://airconsumer.dot.gov/rules/382short.pdf| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161224194842/http://airconsumer.dot.gov/rules/382short.pdf | archive-date = 24 December 2016 |work=Department of Transportation|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Fair Housing Act]] also requires housing providers to permit service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals) without species restrictions in housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Housing Information Sheet # 6: Right to Emotional Support Animals in 'No Pet' Housing|url=http://www.bazelon.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017-06-16-Emotional-Support-Animal-Fact-Sheet-for-Website-final.pdf|work=Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Revised ADA Requirements: "Beginning on March 15, 2011, only dogs are recognized as service animals under titles II and III of the ADA. A service animal is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability. Generally, title II and title III entities must permit service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas where members of the public are allowed to go.In addition to the provisions about service dogs, the Department’s revised ADA regulations have a new, separate provision about miniature horses that have been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. (Miniature horses generally range in height from 24 inches to 34 inches measured to the shoulders and generally weigh between 70 and 100 pounds.) Entities covered by the ADA must modify their policies to permit miniature horses where reasonable. The regulations set out four assessment factors to assist entities in determining whether miniature horses can be accommodated in their facility. The assessment factors are (1) whether the miniature horse is housebroken; (2) whether the miniature horse is under the owner’s control; (3) whether the facility can accommodate the miniature horse’s type, size, and weight; and (4) whether the miniature horse’s presence will not compromise legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation of the facility.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Brennan | first = Jacquie S. | title = Service Animal Book | publisher = Southwest ADA Center, 2014 | url = https://adata.gov/sites/adata.gov/files/files/Service_Animal_Booklet_2014(2).pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most [[South America]]n countries and [[Mexico]], guide dog access depends solely upon the goodwill of the owner or manager. In more tourist-heavy areas, guide dogs are generally welcomed without problems. In [[Brazil]], however, a 2006 federal decree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2004-2006/2006/Decreto/D5904.htm |title=Decreto nº 5904 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires allowance of guide dogs in all public and open to public places. The [[Brasília Metro]] has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it.
*In [[Europe]], the situation varies by location. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country and sometimes the decision is left up to the respective regions.
*In [[Australia]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1992]] protects all assistance dog handlers.  Current laws may not ensure that assistance dog users can always have their service animals present in all situations. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly pertain to guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the [[Guide, Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009|Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/2009/09AC004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that covers all certified assistance dogs.  
*In [[Canada]], guide dogs along with other service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of them. Fines for denying a service animal access can be up to $3000 in Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/statutes/stcasa2007_c_S_7_5.htm |title=Canada&amp;nbsp;– Alberta&amp;nbsp;– Service Dogs Act |publisher=Animallaw.info |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[South Korea]], it is illegal to deny access to guide dogs in any areas that are open to the public. Violators are fined for no more than 2 million [[South Korean won|won]].

===Overall view of a service animal===

Service animals can be of many species and come in many sizes. Dogs, cats, dolphins, miniature horses, monkeys, ducks, ferrets, and parrots have all been trained to perform specific duties of a service animal, though the type of animal that may be registered as a "service animal" may vary depending on legal definitions. The people that can qualify for a service animal can have a range of physical and/or mental disabilities.

A ''guide animal'' is an animal specifically trained to assist visually impaired persons to navigate in public. These animals may be trained to open doors, recognize traffic signals, guide their owners safely across public streets, and navigate through crowds of people. A ''mobility animal'' may perform similar services for a person with physical disabilities, as well as assisting with balance or falling issues. ''Hearing animals'' are trained to assist hearing-impaired or deaf persons. These animals may be trained to respond to doorbells or a ringing phone or to tug their owners toward a person who is speaking to them. ''Psychiatric animals'' can be trained to provide deep-pressure therapy by lying on top of a person who may be suffering from [[post traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, overstimulation, or [[acute anxiety]]. Similarly, ''autism dogs'' have been recently introduced to recognize and respond to the needs of people with [[autism spectrum disorder]]; some persons with ASD state that they are more comfortable interacting with animals than with human caregivers due to issues regarding eye contact, touch, and socialization.{cn|Sept=2018} ''Medical emergency animals'' can assist in medical emergency and perform such services as clearing an area in the event of a [[grand mal]] seizure, fetching medication or other necessary items, alerting others in the event of a medical episode; some may even be trained to call emergency services through use of a telephone with specially designed oversized buttons.

The animals also provide important companionship and emotional support for owners who might otherwise be isolated due to disability. It is important to note, however, that providing "important companionship and emotional support for owners" is not a task that would qualify an animal as a service animal. In the US, it is illegal to bring an animal to non-pet friendly places simply because it provides companionship or emotional support. Additionally, saying your animal is a service animal for such reasons is illegal.{cn|Sept=2018} The owners in turn often derive a sense of accomplishment and importance from attending to the needs of their animals.

==Animals for individual assistance==
Many service animals may be trained to perform tasks to help their disabled partners live independent lives. Such animals include:
* [[Seizure]] sensing dogs, trained to sense epileptic seizures in their partner. Dogs can support a litany of both physical and mental disabilities.
* [[Capuchin monkey]]s, which can be trained to perform manual tasks such as grasping items, operating knobs and switches, and turning the pages of a book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://monkeyhelpers.org/our-programs/monkey-care-and-training/why-monkeys Helping Hands] Retrieved on January 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miniature horse ===
A  [[miniature horse]] can be trained to [[Guide horse|guide the blind]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidehorse.org Guide Horse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017020720/http://www.guidehorse.org/ |date=2007-10-17 }} Retrieved on October 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to pull wheelchairs, or as support for persons with Parkinson's disease.

A full-grown miniature horse can vary from 26” to 38”. There are two main registering organizations. The [http://www.amha.org/ American Miniature Horse Association]  limits height to 34” whereas the [http://www.amha.org/registration American Miniature Horse Registry]  has a division for horses 34” to 38”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hiddenhollowminiatures.com/Service_Animals.html|title=Service Animals|work=hiddenhollowminiatures|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of advantages of miniature horses as service animals. Miniature horses may be chosen by people whose [[Dogs in religion#Islam|religion considers dogs to be unclean]] or who have serious [[allergies to dogs]], as well as phobias. Miniature horses have average lifespans of 30–40 years (longer than those of both service dogs and monkeys) and take 6 months to a year of training, done only by professional trainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidehorse.com/|title=Guide Horse Foundation - Miniature horses for the blind|website=www.guidehorse.com|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guide horse users report they typically are immediately recognized as a working service animal, whereas a dog may be mistaken for a [[pet]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Miniature horses have been praised for their excellent range of vision (350 degrees), good memories, calm nature, focused demeanor, and good cost-effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidehorse.com/text_only_master.htm|title=The Guide Horse Foundation|website=www.guidehorse.com|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helper monkey===
[[Image:TSA Service Monkey.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A United States [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] agent inspects a service monkey before a flight.]]
A '''helper monkey''' is a type of assistance animal, similar to an [[assistance dog]], that is specially trained to help people with [[quadriplegia]], severe [[spinal cord]] injuries, or other mobility impairments.

Helper monkeys are usually trained in schools by private organizations, taking 7 years to train, and are able to serve 25–30 years (two to three times longer than a guide dog).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=4361694 | title = Monkey Helpers Lend a 'Helping Hand' | accessdate = August 14, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927041542/http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=4361694 | archivedate = September 27, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being socialized in a human home as infants, the monkeys undergo extensive training before being placed with an individual needing assistance. Around the house, the monkeys assist in daily living by doing tasks including microwaving food, washing their human's face, and opening drink bottles.[[File:HelpingHandsServicemonkeyWash.jpg|thumb|160px|A service monkey washing itself]]

In 2010, the U.S. federal government revised its definition of service animal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Non-human primates are no longer recognized as service animals under the ADA.&lt;ref name="ada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Highlights of the Final Rule to Amend the Department of Justice's Regulation Implementing Title II of the ADA|url=http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/factsheets/title2_factsheet.html|publisher=United States Department of Justice-Civil Rights Division|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Veterinary Medical Association does not support the use of nonhuman primates as assistance animals because of animal welfare concerns, the potential for serious injury to people, and risks that primates may transfer dangerous diseases to humans.&lt;ref name="avma"&gt;{{cite web|title= AVMA Animal Welfare Division Director's Testimony on the Captive Primate Safety Act|url=https://www.avma.org/News/PressRoom/Pages/Testimony-golab-080311.aspx|publisher=American Veterinary Medicine Association|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sorby Research Institute''' was a research facility that operated in the UK during and immediately after the [[World War II|Second World War]] in [[Sheffield, England]].  The Institute mostly investigated questions of nutrition.  This was an important consideration in wartime Britain, where food was in short supply.  The experiments into deficiency of [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin C]] were particularly notable.  However, other kinds of medical research was also undertaken, such as research into the transmission of [[scabies]].

The leading figures in the institute were [[Kenneth Mellanby]] and  [[Hans Adolf Krebs]].  The volunteers were mainly [[conscientious objectors]] to military service.  Some of the experiments were unpleasant, or even dangerous.  The Institute closed in 1946, soon after the end of the war.

==History==

Early in 1941 twelve volunteers, [[pacifist]] conscientious objectors, recruited via the Sheffield Pacifist Service Unit, were established in a large house&lt;ref&gt;"Fairholme", 18 Oakholme Drive, [[Broomhill, Sheffield]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a residential area of [[Sheffield]] for research that would "benefit humanity".  Various medical experiments were conducted on the volunteers.  No work that had a direct military application was undertaken since this would not have been acceptable to many conscientious objectors.  This establishment became known as the Sorby Research Institute, so named because the leading researcher, [[Kenneth Mellanby]], was a Sorby Research Fellow  of the [[Royal Society]] at [[Sheffield University]].  The fellowship is itself named after [[Henry Clifton Sorby]], a notable Sheffield scientist.  [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] took over the management of the volunteers in 1943 when Mellanby left to work for the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref|Pemberton, p. 556|Sorby Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment was founded on the personal initiative of Mellanby and at first he was free to carry out whatever investigations he chose.  Mellanby's status as a scientist meant that he was in a [[reserved occupation]] and forbidden from joining the armed forces.  Although he wished to do something for the war effort, the military of the time had no use for biologists.  Consequently, Mellanby initiated what he considered useful work himself.&lt;ref name="Dixon, p. 208"&gt;Dixon, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

The first  experiment was an investigation into [[scabies]].  Mellanby had an interest in [[head lice infestation]] and scabies was thus a natural area of research for him.  Another early experiment looked into water deprivation of survivors in lifeboats.  However, the most important work of the Institute was into nutrition, particularly [[vitamin deficiency]].  In a period of severe rationing in Britain, it was important for the government to know how far this could be taken and what the consequences would be.  This work was commissioned by the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] at the request of the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref|Pemberton, pp. 556-557|Sorby Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Sorby Research Institute continued until early 1946.&lt;ref name="Sorby Collection"&gt;Sorby Collection&lt;/ref&gt;  The building is now used as residential accommodation for students from Sheffield University.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

== Volunteers ==
There were initially 12 volunteers at the house.  This eventually grew to 35, including three women.  Walter Bartley acted as technician and assistant to Mellanby and later became a professor at Sheffield University, but he also served as a volunteer experiment subject.  All the volunteers were young; the 19 men and one woman in the vitamin C experiment were aged between 17 and 34.&lt;ref name=Glasgow/&gt;  Some volunteers had regular jobs outside the programme, the rest were expected to carry out domestic tasks in the house.  They were also given duties to perform for the experimenters such as collecting data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref|Pemberton, p. 556| Sorby Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellanby chose to use conscientious objectors because they were the only group of healthy young people who were not likely to be taken away from him for some military purpose in the middle of an experiment.  For their part, the conscientious objectors wished to take part so that they could do something with an equivalent risk to military service.&lt;ref&gt;Melicharova, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unlikely that many of these experiments would be allowed to be repeated under modern ethical guidelines.  Some were dangerous for the volunteers.  However, according to John Pemberton, who worked at the Institute, nobody was permanently harmed in any experiment.  In 2006 Pemberton attempted to trace the surviving volunteers to solicit their views on the work.  Only four still living could be found and all said they thought the work was "worthwhile" and that they would have "volunteered again" if asked.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

===Vitamin deficiency===
A few experiments performed on vitamin deficiency, such as one conducted to determine the effects of Vitamin A deficiency and to optimize its treatment. In that study, 23 men and women volunteered to live on a diet deficient in [[vitamin A]]. However, this experiment lasted considerably longer than expected, from July 1942 to October 1944, and the only specific effect that developed in those deprived of vitamin A was some loss of night vision after about eight months.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, p. 557"&gt;Pemberton, p. 557&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar experiment was conducted on [[vitamin C]]. It lasted from October 1944 to February 1946. Wounds were created on the subjects to study the influence of the vitamin. Ten of the twenty subjects were completely restricted from vitamin C. The wounds of those subjects became hemorrhagic, but the study found that a daily dose of ten milligrams was sufficient to prevent or reverse [[scurvy]] in several cases.&lt;ref name=Glasgow&gt;''Glasgow Herald''&lt;/ref&gt;

The vitamin C research led to the issue of free orange juice for children.  The Medical Research Council established recommended daily intakes of vitamins A and C on the basis of the institute's research.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scabies===
Scabies is a skin disease caused by the burrowing of the mite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''.  It leads to what sufferers have described as an "almost intolerable" itching.  The experiment was carried out in 1941 and its purpose was to investigate the mode of transmission and possible treatments.  The researchers had some difficulty in reliably causing an infection in the volunteers.  One technique that was found to be effective was to require the volunteer to wear the used, unwashed underwear of a scabies victim.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, p. 557"/&gt;

Mellanby subsequently used the results of this research in the treatment and observation of military personnel, amongst whom the disease was rife&lt;ref&gt;Mellanby, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; and for which there was previously no effective treatment.  He set up a military hospital for this purpose and sent army medical officers to the institute for training.&lt;ref name="Sorby Collection"/&gt;

=== Water deprivation ===
The purpose of this experiment, conducted in 1942, was to investigate the minimum requirement for water.  Large amounts of shipping were being sunk in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] by German forces and many surviving sailors spent long periods in lifeboats before being rescued.  For this reason, it was known as ''the shipwreck experiment''.  A key question was how long they could be expected to survive on only the rations available in lifeboats.  The volunteers in this study were deprived of fluids for three and a half days and only allowed to eat the kind of dried food stored as emergency supplies in lifeboats such as [[hardtack|sea biscuits]] and chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref|Pemberton, p. 557|Sorby Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the experiments conducted at the institute, the water deprivation experiment was the one most disliked by the volunteers.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, p. 557"/&gt;

=== Wheat extraction ===
[[Flour extraction|Wheat extraction]] rate is the amount of [[grist]] that becomes flour in a [[flour mill]] (the [[milling yield]]).  A high extraction rate results in brown flour and brown bread.  100% extraction is called [[Whole-wheat flour|wholemeal flour]], 70% extraction results in white bread and flour.  This was an issue for wartime Britain because wheat imports were essential to her survival and the higher the extraction rate, the less grain would need to be imported.  Less grain meant that fewer ships would be needed to transport it, and ships were being sunk at a prodigious rate by German [[U-boat]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Edgerton, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was charged in 1942 with looking into the nutritional value of high extraction wheat.  As a result of this research a "national wheatmeal loaf" of 85% extraction was introduced.  It was priced the same as the staple white bread to encourage the public to use it (in this period brown bread was normally considered a speciality bread and was more expensive).  The reseearch was particularly looking at the issues of digestibility and calcium absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref| Sorby Collection|Edgerton, pp. 179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some objection from nutritionists to this change.  It was known that a high extraction, [[high fibre]], diet leads to poor uptake of vitamin D, and hence can lead to rickets.&lt;ref&gt;Marx ''et al.'', p.267&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the cost in ships and lives was of greater importance during the war than dietary considerations, so long as the effects were not immediately debilitating.  The results of the wheat extraction research made a large difference to Britain's war effort.  It has been calculated that raising the extraction rate from 75% to 85% saved the equivalent of forty [[Liberty ship]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other  experiments ===
One experiment required that blood circulation to limbs was cut off with elastic bands.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;  Others included infection with [[malaria]] and investigations into surgical [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].&lt;ref name="Dixon, p. 208"/&gt;

'''Vibratese''' is a method of communication through touch. It was developed by F. A. Geldard, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Adventures in tactile literacy. Geldard, Frank A. ''[[American Psychologist]]''. '''12'''(3), Mar 1957, 115–124.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] system based on both practical considerations and on results from a set of controlled [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] experiments. Vibratese was composed of 45 basic elements, the tactile equivalent of numerals and letters. The entire [[English alphabet]] and numerals 0 to 9 could be communicated this way. Geldard reported that with proper training, rates of more than 35 [[words per minute]] were possible for reading. {{asof|2009}}, Vibratese is no longer in use, with little literature available on the subject.

WASH (WAter, Sanitation and Hygiene) United is a non-profit organization that works to end the global sanitation and hygiene crisis by making toilets and good hygiene "cool" and "sexy".

What differentiates WASH United from other organizations working in the [[WASH]] sector is that WASH United doesn’t use health-based messaging, but rather harnesses the power of fun, interactive gaming experiences, super star role models and strictly aspirational communication to change attitudes and behaviors on these neglected issues.

WASH United currently works in 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and in India. In Africa, WASH United works in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Tanzania and Uganda. WASH United is registered as a non-profit limited liability company (gGmbH) in Berlin,Germany, where the organization’s international headquarters are. WASH United just opened a regional office.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wash-united.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
WASH United was founded in 2010 by Thorsten Kiefer. Kiefer, a devoted soccer fan, helped WASH gain attention at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa by coordinating promotions featuring soccer stars playing in the World Cup. Now, WASH United is still growing its ties with star athletes, as well as politicians, to help promote the club and achieve its goals. In 2012 they received the Sport for Health Award at the [[Beyond Sport#Awards|Beyond Sport Awards]].

==Purpose==
Access to safe and clean drinking water is a crisis that is both severe and receives an alarmingly small amount of attention by international media. In 2010, the lack of access to drinking water and toilets caused more deaths in children than HIV/AIDS, measles, and malaria combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wash-united.org/the-club/why-wash.html |title=The water and sanitation crisis in a nutshell |work=Wash United |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |  &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; WASH United has the following goals:

1. To give toilets a "sexy" image. In hopes to increase attention around this issue, WASH United aims to inflict an image that promotes desirability for toilets - an item is seemingly commonplace and standard in developed countries.

2. To promote hand-washing. Many diseases and illnesses can be prevented by washing hands with soap and water, especially when handling food. Similarly, they wish to promote menstrual hygiene management, a topic that is highly taboo in certain cultures.

3. To encourage acknowledgement that safe drinking water and sanitization is a human right on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wash-united.org/the-club/why-wash.html |title=The water and sanitation crisis in a nutshell |work=Wash United |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |  &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
WASH United uses the following tactics to promote clean drinking water and hygiene:

1. Using fun and interactive games. People are more prone to remembering things when they can associate them with memorable activities such as storytelling and games.

2. Using sports stars and celebrities to gain attention and utilize their role model statuses to inspire people about this topic.

3. Focusing on the positives and why toilets and clean water are appealing, rather than the damaging impacts that come from a lack of these necessities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wash-united.org/the-club/why-wash.html |title=The water and sanitation crisis in a nutshell |work=Wash United |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |  &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==
Currently, WASH United uses television, radio, and print media to communicate with its audience internationally. Moving forward, they plan to promote clean water and healthy hygiene habits through even more types of media as well as increase their presence in the types currently being utilized. Moving forward, WASH United plans to expand their organization by recruiting more star spokespeople and expanding both their relief efforts and media presence to more countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wash-united.org/about-us/how-it-works.html |title=What we do and how it works |work=Wash United |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |  &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
