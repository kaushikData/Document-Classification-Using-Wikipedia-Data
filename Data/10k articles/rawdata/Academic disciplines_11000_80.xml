&lt;/score&gt;|width=210|caption=The most common accidentals. From left to right: [[flat (music)|flat]], [[natural (music)|natural]], and [[sharp (music)|sharp]].}}
In [[music]], an '''accidental''' is a [[Musical note|note]] of a [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (or [[pitch class]]) that is not a member of the [[Scale (music)|scale]] or [[Mode (music)|mode]] indicated by the [[Modulation (music)|most recently applied]] [[key signature]]. In [[musical notation]], the [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|sharp}}), [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{music|flat}}), and [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{music|natural}}) symbols, among others, mark such notes—and those symbols are also called accidentals.

In the measure (bar) where it appears, an accidental sign raises or lowers the immediately following note (and any repetition of it in the bar) from its normal pitch, overriding sharps or flats in the key signature. A note is usually raised or lowered by a [[semitone]], although [[microtonal music]] may use "fractional" accidental signs. There are also occasionally double sharps or flats, which raise or lower the indicated note by a [[Major second|whole tone]]. Accidentals apply within the [[Bar (music)|measure]] and [[octave]] in which they appear, unless canceled by another accidental sign, or [[Tie (music)|tied]] into the following measure. If a note has an accidental and the note is repeated in a different octave within the same measure, the accidental does ''not'' apply to the same note of the different octave.

The modern accidental signs derive from the two forms of the lower-case letter&amp;nbsp;''b'' used in [[Gregorian chant]] manuscripts to signify the two pitches of B, the only note that could be altered. The "round" ''b'' became the flat sign, while the "square" ''b'' diverged into the sharp and natural signs.

Sometimes the black keys on a [[musical keyboard]] are called accidentals (i.e., ''sharps'' or ''flats''), and the white keys are called ''naturals''.&lt;ref&gt;Palmieri, Robert, and Margaret W. Palmieri. "Ebonies", [https://books.google.com/books?id=g2ZJNN98LFAC ''Piano: An Encyclopedia''], p.118. New York: Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-93796-5}}.&lt;br&gt;"The ebonies are the black keys of a piano, called variously sharps or accidentals, …"&lt;br&gt;"The ivories are the white keys of the piano (also called naturals), ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard use of accidentals==

=== Typical system ===
In most cases, a [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] raises the pitch of a note one [[semitone]] while a [[flat (music)|flat]] lowers it one semitone. A [[natural sign|natural]] is used to cancel the effect of a flat or sharp. This system of accidentals operates in conjunction with the [[key signature]], whose effect continues throughout an entire piece, unless canceled by another key signature. An accidental can also be used to cancel a previous accidental or reinstate the flats or sharps of the key signature

Accidentals apply to subsequent notes on the same [[staff position]] for the remainder of the measure where they occur, unless explicitly changed by another accidental. Once a [[Bar (music)|barline]] is passed, the effect of the accidental ends, except when a note affected by an accidental is tied to the same note across a barline. Subsequent notes at the same staff position in the second or later bars are not affected by the accidental carried through with the tied note. 

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
    \relative c'' {
        \time 3/4
        g4 gis gis | g? ges ges~ | ges gis g
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Under this system, the notes in the example above are: 

* '''{{Abbr|m.|measure}} 1''': G{{music|natural}}, G{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} (the sharp carries over)
* '''m. 2''': G{{music|natural}} (with [[courtesy accidental]]), G{{music|flat}}, G{{music|flat}} (the flat carries over)
* '''m. 3''': G{{music|flat}} (which is tied from the previous note), G{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|natural}} (the natural sign cancels the sharp sign)

=== Note-for-note system ===
Though this convention is still in use particularly in [[Tonality|tonal music]], it may be cumbersome in music that features frequent accidentals, as is often the case in [[Atonality|atonal music]]. As a result, an alternative system of note-for-note accidentals has been adopted, with the aim of reducing the number of accidentals required to notate a [[bar (music)|bar]]. The system is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Kurt.  ''Music Notation in the Twentieth Century:  A Practical Guidebook'', {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

* An accidental carries through the bar affecting both the note it immediately precedes and any following notes on the same line or space in the measure.&lt;ref&gt;Manoff, T: "The Music Kit Workbook", fourth edition (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001): p. 47; Anthony Pryer, "Accidental", ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', edited by Alison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002). {{ISBN|9780198662129}}; Gardner Read, ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'' (Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1969): 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Accidentals are not repeated on tied notes unless the tie goes from line to line or page to page.
* Accidentals are not repeated for repeated notes unless one or more different pitches (or rests) intervene.
* If a sharp or flat pitch is followed directly by its natural form, a natural is used.
* Courtesy accidentals or naturals (in parentheses) may be used to clarify ambiguities but are kept to a minimum

Because seven of the twelve notes of the chromatic equal-tempered scale are naturals (the "white notes", A; B; C; D; E; F; and G on a piano keyboard) this system can significantly reduce the number of naturals required in a notated passage.

Occasionally, an accidental may change the note by more than a semitone: for example, if a G{{Music|sharp}} is followed in the same measure by a G{{Music|flat}}, the flat sign on the latter note means it is two semitones lower than if no accidental were present. Thus, the effect of the accidental must be understood in relation to the "natural" meaning of the note's [[staff position]]. 

In some atonal scores (particularly by composers of the [[Second Viennese School]]), an accidental is notated on every note, including natural notes and repeated pitches. This system was adopted for "the specific intellectual reason that a note with an accidental was not simply an [[Inflection (music)|inflected]] version of a natural note but a pitch of equal status."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701032248|title=Behind Bars: The Definitive Guide to Music Notation|last=Gould|first=Elaine|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=0571514561|location=London|pages=86|oclc=701032248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Double accidentals ==

    }  }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=180|caption=The two double accidentals. From left to right: [[double flat]] and [[double sharp]].}}
Double accidentals raise or lower the pitch of a note by two semitones,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Benward &amp; Marilyn Nadine Saker, ''Music in Theory and Practice'', seventh edition (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2003): vol&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;br /&gt;"''Double Sharp'' ({{music|x}})—raises the pitch two half steps. Double flat ({{music|bb}})—lowers the pitch two half steps."&lt;/ref&gt; an innovation developed as early as 1615.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} This applies to the written note, ignoring key signature. An F with a double sharp applied raises it a [[whole step]] so it is [[enharmonic]]ally equivalent to a G. 

Usage varies on how to notate the situation in which a note with a double sharp (or flat) is followed in the same measure by a note with a single sharp (or flat). Some publications simply use the single accidental for the latter note, whereas others use a combination of a natural and a sharp (shown below), with the natural being understood to apply to only the second sharp.

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
    \relative c'' {
        \time 4/4
        gisis2 gis
    }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The double accidental with respect to a specific key signature raises or lowers the notes containing a sharp or flat by a semitone. For example, when in the key of C{{Music|sharp}} minor or E major, F, C, G, and D contain a sharp. Adding a double accidental (double sharp) to F in this case only raises F{{Music|sharp}} by one further semitone, creating G natural. Conversely, adding a double sharp to any other note not sharped or flatted in the key signature raises the note by two semitones with respect to the chromatic scale. For example, in the aforementioned key signature, any note that is not F, C, G, and D is raised by two semitones instead of one, so an A double sharp raises the note A natural to the enharmonic equivalent of B natural.

==Courtesy accidentals==
{{Image frame|content=&lt;score&gt; {

\override Score.TimeSignature

&lt;/score&gt;|width=180|caption=An A{{music|flat}} followed by an A{{music|natural}} in the next measure. The A{{music|natural}} is given a courtesy accidental to remind the player that the flat sign does not apply to it.}}
In modern scores, a barline cancels an accidental (except for a tied note)—but publishers often use a ''courtesy accidental'' (also called a ''cautionary accidental'' or ''reminder accidental'') to remind the musician of the correct pitch if the same note occurs in the following measure. This practice varies, though a few situations require a courtesy accidental, such as

* When the first note of a measure had an accidental in the previous measure
* After a tie carries an accidental across a barline, and the same note appears in the next measure
Other uses are inconsistent. Courtesy accidentals are sometimes enclosed in parentheses to emphasize their role as reminders.

Publishers of [[free jazz]] music and some [[atonal]] music sometimes eschew all courtesy accidentals.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Wolf (2008). ''Stuff! Good Guitar Players Should Know: An A-Z Guide to Getting Better'', p.59. {{ISBN|9781423430087}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=220|caption=A common notation for quarter tones. From left to right, half-flat, flat-and-a-half, half-sharp, sharp-and-a-half.}}
Composers of [[microtonal music]] have developed a number of notations for indicating the various pitches outside of standard notation. One such system for notating [[quarter tone]]s, used by the Czech [[Alois Hába]] and other composers, is shown on the right.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when Turkish musicians switched from their traditional notation systems—which were not staff-based—to the European staff-based system, they refined the European accidental system so they could notate Turkish scales that use intervals smaller than a tempered semitone. There are several such systems, which vary as to how they divide the octave they presuppose or the graphical shape of the accidentals. The most widely used system (created by [[Rauf Yekta Bey]]) uses a system of four sharps (roughly +25 [[cent (music)|cent]]s, +75 cents, +125 cents and +175 cents) and four flats (roughly −25 cents, −75 cents, −125 cents and −175 cents), none of which correspond to the tempered sharp and flat. They presuppose a Pythagorean division of the octave taking the [[Pythagorean comma]] (about an eighth of the tempered tone, actually closer to 24 cents, defined as the difference between seven octaves and 12 just-intonation fifths) as the basic interval. The Turkish systems have also been adopted by some Arab musicians.

[[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] created a system of [[Musical Notation|notation]] for pieces in [[just intonation]] where the unmarked C, F, and G major chords are just major chords (4:5:6) and accidentals create just tuning in other keys. Between 2000 and 2003, Wolfgang von Schweinitz and [[Marc Sabat]] developed the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation, a modern adaptation and extension of the notation principles first used by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Arthur von Oettingen]], and [[Alexander John Ellis]] that some other musicians use for notating extended just intonation.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==History of notation of accidentals==
The three principal symbols indicating whether a note should be raised or lowered in pitch are derived from variations of the small letter&amp;nbsp;''b'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Niecks|Niecks, Frederick]]. ''The Flat, Sharp, and Natural. A Historical Sketch''. Proceedings of the Musical Association, 16th Sess., (1889&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1890), pp. 79-100.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/765359 (JSTOR)]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|sharp}}) and [[natural (music)|natural]] ({{music|natural}}) signs from the square "[[b quadratum]]", and the [[flat (music)|flat]] sign ({{music|flat}}) from the round "[[b rotundum]]" ''b''.

In the early [[Middle Ages]], a widespread musical tradition was based on the [[hexachord]] system defined by [[Guido of Arezzo]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The basic system, called ''musica recta'', had three overlapping hexachords. Change from one hexachord to another was possible, called a ''mutation''. A major problem with the system was that mutation from one hexachord to another could introduce intervals like the [[tritone]] that musicians of the time considered undesirable. To avoid the dissonance, a practice called [[musica ficta]] arose from the late 12th century onward. This introduced modifications of the hexachord, so that "false" or "feigned" notes could be sung, partly to avoid dissonance. At first only B could be flattened, moving from the ''hexachordum durum'' (the ''hard hexachord'') G–A–B–C–D–E where B is natural, to the ''hexachordum molle'' (the ''soft hexachord'') F–G–A–B{{music|flat}}–C–D where it is flat. The note B is not present in the third hexachord ''hexachordum naturale'' (the ''natural hexachord'') C–D–E–F–G–A.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The different kinds of B were eventually written differently, so as to distinguish them in music theory treatises and in notation. The flat sign {{music|flat}} derives from a round ''b'' that signified the soft hexachord, ''hexachordum molle'', particularly the presence of B{{music|flat}}. The name of the flat sign in French is ''bémol'' from medieval French ''bé mol'', which in modern French is ''bé mou'' ("soft b"). The natural sign {{music|natural}} and the sharp sign {{music|sharp}} derive from variations of a square ''b'' that signified the hard hexachord, ''hexachordum durum'', where the note in question is B{{music|natural}}. The name of the natural sign in French is ''bécarre'' from medieval French ''bé quarre'', which in modern French is ''bé carré'' ("square b"). In German music notation the letter ''B'' or ''b'' always designates B{{Music|flat}} while the letter ''H'' or ''h'' – a deformation of a square ''b'' – designates B{{Music|natural}}.

As polyphony became more complex, notes other than B required alteration to avoid undesirable harmonic or melodic intervals (especially the augmented fourth, or [[tritone]], that music theory writers referred to as ''diabolus in musica'', i.e., "the devil in music"). The first sharp in use was F{{music|sharp}}, then came the second flat E{{music|flat}},{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;!--Source needed: this is counterintuitive given that two-flat signatures are found for at least two centuries before one-sharp signatures.--&gt; then C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, etc.; by the 16th century B{{music|flat}}, E{{music|flat}}, A{{music|flat}}, D{{music|flat}}, G{{music|flat}} and F{{music|sharp}}, C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}} were all in use to a greater or lesser extent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;!--Dubious chronology.--&gt;

However, those accidentals were often not notated in vocal part-books (but the correct pitches were always notated in [[tablature]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The notational practice of not marking implied accidentals—leaving them to the performer to supply instead—was called ''[[musica ficta]]'' ("feigned music").

Strictly speaking the medieval signs {{music|natural}} and {{music|flat}} indicated that the melody is progressing inside a (fictive) ''hexachord'' of which the signed note is the ''mi'' or the ''fa'' respectively. That means they refer to a group of notes ''around'' the marked note, rather than indicating that the note itself is necessarily an accidental. For example, when a  semitone relationship is indicated between F and G, either by placing a mi-sign ({{music|natural}}) on F or a fa-sign ({{Music|flat}}) on G, only the context can determine whether this means, in modern terms, F{{Music|sharp}}-G or F-G{{Music|flat}}, or even F{{Music|flat}}–G{{Music|doubleflat}}. The use of either the mi-sign on F or the fa-sign on G means only that "some kind of F goes to some kind of G, proceeding by a semitone".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Bent, "Diatonic ''Ficta''", ''Early Music History'' 4 (1984): pp.&amp;nbsp;1–48. Citation on pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention of an accidental remaining in force through a measure developed only gradually over the 18th century. Before then, accidentals only applied to immediately repeated notes or short groups when the composer felt it was obvious that the accidental should continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year = 1972|title = Accidentals|encyclopedia = Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher = Harvard University Press|location = |edition = 2nd|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The older practice continued in use well into the 18th century by many composers, notably [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pryer, "Accidental", ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', edited by Alison Latham (Oxford University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The newer convention did not achieve general currency until early in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Don Michael Randel, "Accidental", ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', fourth edition (Harvard University Press, 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-674-01163-2}}; Ian D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20057">In [[zoological nomenclature]], '''author citation''' refers to listing the person (or team) who first makes a [[scientific name]] of a [[taxon]] available. This is done in a scientific publication while fulfilling the formal requirements under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|website=www.nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; hereinafter termed "the Code". According to the Code, "the name of the author does not form part of the name of a taxon and its citation is optional, although customary and often advisable" (Article 51.1), however Recommendation 51A suggests: "The original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name. This is especially important in distinguishing between [[Homonym (biology)|homonyms]] and in identifying species-group names which are not in their original combinations". For the purpose of information retrieval, the author citation and year appended to the scientific name, e.g. genus-species-author-year, genus-author-year, family-author-year, etc., is often considered a "de facto" unique identifier, although for a number of reasons discussed below, this usage may often be imperfect.

== Rank matters ==

The Code recognises three groups of names, according to [[rank (zoology)|rank]]:
*family-group names, at the ranks of superfamily, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe (any rank below superfamily and above genus).
*genus-group names, at the ranks of genus and subgenus.
*species-group names, at the ranks of species and subspecies.

Within each group, the same authorship applies regardless of the taxon level to which the name (with, in the case of a family-group name, the appropriate ending) is applied. For example, the taxa that the red admiral butterfly can be assigned to:
*Family: Nymphalidae Swainson, 1827 so also
** Subfamily: Nymphalinae Swainson, 1827 and
** Tribe: Nymphalini Swainson, 1827
*Genus: ''Vanessa'' Fabricius, 1807 so also
** Subgenus: ''Vanessa (Vanessa)'' Fabricius, 1807
*Species: ''Vanessa atalanta'' (Linnaeus, 1758) so also
** Subspecies: ''Vanessa atalanta atalanta'' ([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]])
*: The parentheses around the author citation indicate that this was not the original taxonomic placement: in this case, Linnaeus published the name as
*: ''Papilio atalanta'' Linnaeus, 1758.

==Identity of the author(s)==
{{tone|date=October 2017}}
The identity of the author had long been a matter of dispute and of secondary importance. In the first attempt to provide international rules for zoological nomenclature in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, R., Maehrenthal, F. von &amp; Stiles, C. W. 1905. Règles internationales de la Nomenclature Zoologique adoptées par les Congrès Internationaux de Zoologie. International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature. Internationale Regeln der Zoologischen Nomenklatur. Paris (Rudeval)&lt;/ref&gt; the author was defined as the author of the scientific description, and not as the person who provided the name (published or unpublished), as had been usual practice in various animal groups before. This had the result that in some disciplines, for example in [[malacology]], most taxonomic names had to change their authorship because they had been attributed to other persons who never published a scientific work.

This new rule was however not sufficiently accurate and did not provide an exact guide, so that in the following decades taxonomic practice continued to diverge among disciplines and authors. The ambiguous situation led a member of the ICZN Commission in 1974 to provide an interpretation of Art. 50 of the second edition of the Code (effective since 1961), where the author had been defined as "the person who first publishes a scientific name in a way that satisfies the criteria of availability", an interpretation following which this should be seen as largely being restricted to providing a description or diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44473 Sabrosky, C. W. 1974.] Article 50 and questions of authorship. Z.N.(S.) 1925. ''Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature'' 31 (4): 206-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently most (but not all) taxonomists accept this view and restrict authorship for a taxonomic name to the person who was responsible for having written the textual scientific content of the original description, or in other words, the visibly responsible person for having written down what the publisher finally published. The author of an image is not recognized as co-author of a name, even if the image was the only base provided for making the name available.

The author is usually the author of the work. But sometimes new zoological names were not established by that author.

If a true author of a written text is not directly recognisable in the original publication, she or he is not the author of a name (but the author of the work is). The text could actually be written by a different person. Some authors have copied text passages from unpublished sources without acknowledging them. In Art. 50.1.1 all these persons are excluded from the authorship of a name, if they were not explicitly mentioned in the work itself for being the responsible persons for making a name available.

Most taxonomists also accept Art. 50.1.1 that the author of a cited previously published source, from which text passages were copied, is not acknowledged as the author of a name.

Not all taxonomists seem to know this, and there are traditions in some animal groups (for example in fish nomenclature) where the "true" author of a work is still occasionally cited in the name of a species ("Walbaum (ex Klein), 1792").

In some cases the author of the description can differ from the author of the work. This must be explicitly indicated in the original publication, either by a general statement ("all zoological descriptions in this work were written by Smith"), or by an individual statement ("the following three descriptions were provided by Jiménez", "this name shall be attributed to me and Wang because she contributed to the description").

In the 1800s it was a usual style to eventually set an abbreviation of another author immediately below the text of the description or diagnosis to indicate authorship for the description. This is commonly accepted today: if the description is attributed to a different person, then that person is the author.

When the name of a different author was only set behind the new name in the headline (and not repeated below the diagnosis to indicate that that diagnosis had been written by that person), this was a convention to indicate authorship only for the new name and not for the description. These authorships for names are not covered by Art. 50.1 and are not accepted. Only authorship for the description is accepted.

Prior to 1900-1920 there were several different conventions concerning the authorships, every animal group had other traditions. This is why we frequently find other authors than today for zoological names in the early zoological literature.
Art. 50.1 has been a quite successful model since it became commonly accepted in the mid-1900s. There is no need to research who the true author was, everyone including young and relatively unexperienced researchers can verify and determine the name of the author in the original work itself.

== Examples to illustrate practical use ==

In citing the name of an author, the surname is given in full, not abbreviated, with no mention of the first name(s). The date (true year) of publication in which the name was established is added, if desired with a comma between the author and date (the comma is not prescribed under the Code, it contains no additional information, however it is included in examples therein and also in the ICZN Official Lists and Indexes).

* ''Balaena mysticetus'' Linnaeus, 1758
:the [[bowhead whale]] was described and named by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' of 1758
* ''Anser albifrons'' (Scopoli, 1769)
: the [[white-fronted goose]] was first described (by [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]]), as ''Branta albifrons'' Scopoli, 1769. It is currently placed in the genus ''Anser'', so author and year are set in parentheses. The taxonomist who first placed the species in ''Anser'' is not recorded (and much less cited), the two different genus-species combinations are not regarded as [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].

An author can have established a name dedicated to oneself. This sounds unusual and is rare, and is against the unwritten conventions, but it is not restricted under the Code.

* ''Xeropicta krynickii'' (Krynicki, 1833)
:a terrestrial [[gastropod]] from Ukraine was first described as ''Helix krynickii'' Krynicki, 1833, who originally attributed the name to another person Andrzejowski. But the description was written by Krynicki, and Andrzejowski had not published this name before.

==Spelling of the name of the author==

In a strict application of the Code the taxon name author string components "genus", "species" and "year" can only have one combination of characters. The major problem in zoology for consistent spellings of names is the author. The Code gives neither a guide nor a detailed recommendation.

Unlike in botany, it is not recommended to abbreviate the name of the author in zoology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|website=www.nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a name was established by more than three authors, it is allowed to give only the first author, followed by the term  "et al." (and others).

There are no approved standards for spellings of authors in zoology, and unlike in botany no one has ever proposed such standards for zoological authors.

It is generally accepted that the name of the author shall be given in the nominative singular case if originally given in a different [[grammatical case|case]], and that the name of the author should be spelled in Latin [[Writing system|script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=51&amp;nfv=|title=ICZN Code - Article 51|website=www.nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no commonly accepted conventions how to [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] names of authors if given in non-Latin script.

It is also widely accepted that names of authors must be spelled with [[Diacritic|diacritic marks]], [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], spaces and [[punctuation|punctuation marks]]. The first letter is normally spelled in upper-case, however initial capitalization and usage of accessory terms can be inconsistent (e.g. de Wilde/De Wilde, d'Orbigny/D'Orbigny, Saedeleer/De Saedeleer, etc.). Co-authors are separated by commas, the last co-author should be separated by "&amp;". In Chinese and Korean names only the surname is generally cited.

Examples: 
* ''Pipadentalium'' Yoo, 1988 ([[Scaphopoda]])
* ''Sinentomon'' Yin, 1965 ([[Protura]])
* ''Belbolla huanghaiensis'' Huang &amp; Zhang, 2005 ([[Nematoda]])

Apart from these, there are no commonly accepted conventions. The author can either be spelled following a self-made standard (Linnaeus 1758, Linnaeus 1766),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org|title=Search FishBase|website=www.fishbase.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as given in the original source which implies that names of persons are not always spelled consistently (Linnæus 1758, Linné 1766),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalbase.org|title=animalbase|website=www.animalbase.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or we are dealing with composed data sets without any consistent standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faunaeur.org|title=Welcome to Fauna Europaea - Fauna Europaea|website=www.faunaeur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inferred and anonymous authorships==

In some publications the author responsible for new names and nomenclatural acts is not stated directly in the original source, but can sometimes be inferred from reliable external evidence. Recommendation 51D of the Code states: "...if the authorship is known or inferred from external evidence, the name of the author, if cited, should be enclosed in square brackets to show the original anonymity".

==Initials==

If the same surname is common to more than one author, initials are sometimes given (for example "A. Agassiz" vs. "L. Agassiz", etc.), but there are no standards concerning this procedure, and not all animal groups / databases use this convention. Although initials are often regarded as useful to disambiguate different persons with the same surname, this does not work in all situations (for example "W. Smith", "C. Pfeiffer", "G. B. Sowerby" and other names occur more than once), and it should be noted that in the examples given in the Code and also the ICZN Official Lists and Indexes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iczn.org/content/official-lists-indexes-1|title=Official Lists &amp; Indexes - International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|website=iczn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; initials are not used.

==Implications for information retrieval==

For a computer, O. F. Müller, O. Müller and Müller are different strings, even the differences between O. F. Müller, O.F. Müller and OF Müller can be problematic. [[Fauna Europaea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faunaeur.org|title=Welcome to Fauna Europaea - Fauna Europaea|website=www.faunaeur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a typical example of a database where combined initials O.F. and O. F. are read as entirely different strings—those who try to search for all taxonomic names described by [[Otto Friedrich Müller]] have to know (1) that the submitted data by the various data providers contained several versions (O. F. Müller, O.F. Müller, Müller and O. Müller), and (2) that in many databases, the search function will not find O.F. Müller if you search for O. F. Müller or Müller, not to mention alternative orthographies of this name such as Mueller or Muller.

Thus, the usage of (e.g.) genus-species-author-year, genus-author-year, family-author-year, etc. as "de facto" unique identifiers for [[biodiversity informatics]] purposes can present problems, on account of variation in cited author surnames, presence/absence/variations in cited initials, and minor variants in style of presentation, as well as variant cited authors (responsible person/s) and sometimes, cited dates for what may be in fact the same nomenclatural act in the same work. In addition, in a small number of cases, the same author may have created the same name more than once in the same year for different taxa, which can then only be distinguished by reference to the title, page and sometimes line of the work in which each name appears.

In Australia a program was created (TAXAMATCH)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/taxamatch-tests.htm|title=TAXAMATCH Functions test Page|website=www.cmar.csiro.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a helpful tool to indicate in a preliminary manner whether two variants of a taxon name should be accepted as identical or not, according to the similarity of the cited author strings. The authority matching function of TAXAMATCH is useful to assign a moderate-to-high similarity to author strings with minor orthographic and/or date differences, such as "Medvedev &amp; Chernov, 1969" vs. "Medvedev &amp; Cernov, 1969", or "Schaufuss, 1877" vs. "L. W. Schaufuss, 1877", or even "Oshmarin, 1952" vs. "Oschmarin in Skrjabin &amp; Evranova, 1952", and a low similarity to author citations which are very different (for example "Hyalesthes Amyot, 1847" vs. "Hyalesthes Signoret, 1865") and are more likely to represent different publication instances, and therefore possibly also different taxa. The program also understands standardized abbreviations as used in Botany and sometimes in Zoology as well, for example "Rchb." for Reichenbach, however may still fail for non-standard abbreviations (such as "H. &amp; A. Ad." for H. &amp; A. Adams, where the normal citation would in fact be "Adams &amp; Adams"); such non-standard abbreviations must then be picked up by subsequent manual inspection after the use of algorithmic approach to pre-sort the names to be matched into groups of either more or less similar names and cited authorities. However, author names which are spelled very similarly but in fact represent different persons, and who independently authored identical taxon names, will not be adequately separated by this program; examples include "O. F. Müller 1776" vs. "P. L. S. Müller 1776", "G. B. Sowerby I 1850" vs. "G. B. Sowerby III 1875" and "L. Pfeiffer 1856" vs. "K. L. Pfeiffer 1956", so additional manual inspection is also required, especially for known problem cases such as those given above.

A further cause of errors that would not be detected by such a program include authors with mult-part surnames which are sometimes inconsistently applied in the literature, and works where the accepted attribution has changed over time. For example, genera published in the anonymously authored work "''Museum Boltenianum sive catalogus cimeliorum...''" published in 1798 were for a long time ascribed to [[Johann Friedrich Bolten|Bolten]], but are now considered to have been authored by [[Peter Friedrich Röding|Röding]] according to a ruling by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/home/reference?id=1610|title=AnimalBase :: Röding [1798] reference homepage|website=www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous problems are encountered in the field of attempting to cross-link medical records by patient name, for relevant discussion see [[record linkage]].

==Author of a ''nomen nudum''==

A new name mentioned without description or indication or figure is a ''[[nomen nudum]]''. A ''[[nomen nudum]]'' has no authorship and date, it is not an available name. If it is desired or necessary to cite the author of such an unavailable name, the nomenclatural status of the name should be made evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=51&amp;nfv=|title=ICZN Code - Article 51|website=www.nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensu names==
A "sensu" name (sensu = "in the sense of", should not be written in italics) is a previously established name that was used by an author in an incorrect sense, for example for a species that was misidentified. Technically this is only a subsequent use of a name, not a new name, and it has no own authorship. Taxonomists often created unwritten rules for authorships of sensu names, to record the first and original source for a misidentification of an animal. But this is not in accordance with the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=51&amp;nfv=|title=ICZN Code - Article 51|website=www.nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:

* For a West Alpine [[snail]] ''Pupa ferrari'' Porro, 1838, Hartmann (1841) used the genus ''Sphyradium'' Charpentier, 1837, which Charpentier had established for some similar species. Westerlund argued in 1887 that this species should be placed in another genus, and proposed the name ''Coryna'' for ''Pupa ferrari'' and some other species. Pilsbry argued in 1922, Westerlund had established ''Coryna'' as a [[Nomen novum|new replacement name]] for ''Sphyradium'', sensu Hartmann, 1841 (therefore "sensu" should not be written in italics, the term ''Sphyradium sensu'' Hartmann, 1841 would be misunderstood as a species name). But since a sensu name is not an available name with its own author and year, Pilsbry's argument is not consistent with the ICZN Code's rules.

A '''bad quarto''', in Shakespearean scholarship, is a [[book size|quarto-sized]] publication of one of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays that is considered spurious, [[pirated]] from a theatre without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or written down later by an actor or group of actors, which, according to a theory, has been termed "[[memorial reconstruction]]". Since the quarto derives from performance and lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Harold. "Introduction". Shakespeare, William.  ''Hamlet''. Arden Shakespeare (1982) {{ISBN|1-903436-67-2}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to a "good quarto", which is considered to be a text that is authorised, one that may have been printed from the author's manuscript, or a scribal copy or prompt copy that is based on the author's manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; "Bad quartos" are considered to include the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''Henry V'', ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', and ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"/&gt;

The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar (play)|The Battle of Alcazar]]'', [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Greene's]] ''Orlando Furioso'', and the collaborative script, ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas.  ''Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist''. Cambridge University Press. (2013) {{ISBN|9781107029651}} p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, Laurie E.  ''Shakespearean Suspect Texts: The 'Bad' Quartos and Their Contexts.'' Cambridge University Press (1996), {{ISBN|9780521473644}}, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Meridian (1995) {{ISBN|0-300-07282-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider the entire theory to be without foundation. Jonathan Bate states that "late twentieth- and early twenty-first century scholars have begun to question the whole edifice".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.playshakespeare.com/library/misc-documents/33-case-for-the-folio-jonathan-bate Bate, Jonathan. "The Case for the Folio"]. (2007) Playshakespeare.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of bad quarto theory==
The concept of the "bad quarto" as a category of text was created by bibliographer [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in his book ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos'' (1909).  The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors, [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], which appears at the beginning of Shakespeare's First Folio and is titled, "To the Great Variety of Readers". Heminges and Condell refer to "diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies" of the plays. It had been thought that that reference was generally to quarto editions of the plays.

Pollard, however, claims that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to "bad" quartos, and Pollard lists as "bad" the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1597), ''Henry V'' (1600), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (1602), ''Hamlet'' (1603), and ''Pericles'' (1609). Pollard pointed out that not only the texts contained "badness" but also there was badness in those who pirated the plays.&lt;ref&gt;De Grazia, Margreta. "The essential Shakespeare and the material book." Orgel, Stephe and others, editors. ''Shakespeare and the Literary Tradition''. Courier Corporation (1999) {{ISBN|9780815329671}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[W. W. Greg]] worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'',&lt;ref&gt;Greg, W. W. editor. [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001373658 ''Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor''], 1602. Oxford; At the Clarendon Press (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; which is a work that is significant in the history of the "bad quarto" theory. Greg described how the text may have been copied, and he identified the actor who played the role of "Host" as the culprit. Greg called the process that the actor may have used "[[memorial reconstruction]]", a phrase later used by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Alfred W. ''Shakespeare folios and quartos: a study in the bibliography of Shakespeare's plays'', 1594–1685. University of Michigan Library (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas. ''Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist''. Cambridge University Press (2013) {{ISBN|9781107029651}}. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|320px|Comparison of the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet]]

For Shakespeare, the [[First Folio]] of 1623 is the crucial document; of the 36 plays contained in that collection, 18 have no other source. The other 18 plays had been printed in [[Quarto (text)|quarto]] form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio.

It was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented [[shorthand]] reporting, a practice mentioned by [[Thomas Heywood]] in the Prologue to his 1605 play ''If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody''; reporters would surreptitiously take down a play's text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest. Greg and R. C. Rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory: since some of the minor speeches varied less than those of major characters, their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had [[memorial reconstruction|reconstructed the play texts from memory]] and gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played but a less correct report of the other actors' parts.

The idea caught on among Shakespeare scholars. Peter Alexander added ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (1594) and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (1595), the earliest versions of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' to the roster of bad quartos; they had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeare's later versions of the same stories. The concept of the bad quarto was extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare, and by the second half of the 20th century, the idea was widely being used.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, dissenting views had been published, such as the work of Laurie Maguire, then at the [[University of Ottawa]].

==Criticism and alternative hypotheses==
Some problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis. The first quarto of [[Richard III (play)|''Richard III'']] is considered a bad quarto "even though it is an unusually 'good' bad quarto".&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays that he studied, which possessed problematical features that could not be explained. He maintained that the quartos of the two early histories were "partial" memorial reconstructions.

Some critics, including [[Eric Sams]] and [[Hardin Craig]], dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that unlike shorthand reporting, no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory. They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction. Individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts such as revision. Steven Urkowitz has argued the hypothesis that ''[[King Lear]]'' is a revised work in ''Shakespeare's Revision of "King Lear"''. Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon, like ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote at one time and later revised.

Steven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis in preference to a bad-quarto hypothesis for ''The Taming of a Shrew'', the alternative version of Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]].''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 6–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Burkhart's 1975 study ''Shakespeare's Bad Quartos: Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast'' provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction. Other studies have questioned the "orthodox view" on bad quartos, as in David Farley-Hills's work on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.

==Maguire study==
In 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, L. ''Shakespeare's Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and their context'' Cambridge Univ Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the [[BBC TV]] Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. However, the larger-scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos. The study, however, uncovered some circumstantial evidence for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]''. According to Maguire, virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that "merit our attention as valid texts in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 17 March 1996, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of other playwrights==
Though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts, scholars have also applied it to non-Shakespearean play texts of the [[English Renaissance]] era. In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum published "A Census of Bad Quartos" and included 20 play texts.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire's 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos, including the first editions of ''[[Arden of Feversham]]'', ''[[The Merry Devil of Edmonton]]'', and ''[[Fair Em]]'', plays of the [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]], plus [[George Chapman]]'s ''[[The Blind Beggar of Alexandria]]'', [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'', ''Part 1'' of Heywood's ''[[If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody]]'' and [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 227–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''blast wave''' is the increased pressure and flow resulting from the deposition of a large amount of energy in a small, very localised volume. The flow field can be approximated as a lead [[shock wave]], followed by a self-similar subsonic flow field. In simpler terms, a blast wave is an area of pressure expanding supersonically outward from an explosive core. It has a leading shock front of compressed gases. The blast wave is followed by a blast wind of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], which sucks items back in towards the center. The blast wave is harmful especially when one is very close to the center or at a location of constructive interference. High explosives that [[detonation|detonate]] generate blast waves.

==Sources==
High-order explosives (HE) are more powerful than low-order explosives (LE). HE [[Detonation|detonate]] to produce a defining supersonic over-pressurization shock wave. Several sources of HE include [[trinitrotoluene]], [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]], [[Semtex]], [[nitroglycerin]], and ammonium nitrate fuel oil ([[ANFO]]). LE [[Deflagration|deflagrate]] to create a subsonic explosion and lack HE’s over-pressurization wave. Sources of LE include pipe bombs, gunpowder, and most pure petroleum-based incendiary bombs such as Molotov cocktails or aircraft improvised as guided missiles. HE and LE induce different injury patterns. Only HE produce true blast waves.

==History==
The classic flow solution—the so-called "similarity solution"—was independently devised by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, John von, "The point source solution," ''John von Neumann. Collected Works,'' edited by A. J. Taub, Vol. 6 [Elmsford, N.Y.: Permagon Press, 1963], pages 219 - 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bethe,H.A., et al, BLAST WAVE, Los Alamos Report LA-2000, Ch. 2, (1947).

I. Taylor'', [Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 1996], pages 202 - 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early theoretical work more than 50 years ago, both theoretical and experimental studies of blast waves have been ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey JM. 53 years of blast wave research, a personal history. 21st International Symposium on Military and Blast, Israel, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart EJ, et al.

==Characteristics and properties==
[[Image:Friedlander waveform.jpg|300px|left | thumb | A Friedlander waveform is the simplest form of a blast wave.]]

The simplest form of a blast wave has been described and termed the Friedlander waveform.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey JM. THE SHAPE OF THE BLAST WAVE: STUDIES OF THE FRIEDLANDER EQUATION. Presented at the 21st International Symposium on Military Aspects of Blast and Shock, Israel 2010 [http://www.blastanalysis.com/WordDocuments/MABS21/Dewey%20Presentation%20%2323.ppt read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  It occurs when a high explosive [[Detonation|detonates]] in a free field, that is, with no surfaces nearby with which it can interact.
Blast waves have properties predicted by the [[Wave#Physical properties|physics of waves]]. For example, they can [[Diffraction|diffract]] through a narrow opening, and [[Refraction|refract]] as they pass through materials. Like light or sound waves, when a blast wave reaches a boundary between two materials, part of it is transmitted, part of it is absorbed, and part of it is reflected. The [[Acoustic impedance|impedances]] of the two materials determine how much of each occurs.

The equation for a Friedlander waveform describes the pressure of the blast wave as a function of time:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=P_se^{-\frac{t}{t^*}}\left(1-\frac{t}{t^*}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the peak pressure and t* is the time at which the pressure first crosses the horizontal axis (before the negative phase).

Blast waves will wrap around objects and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Remmenikov AM. Modelling blast loads on buildings in complex city geometries. Computers and Structures, 2005, 83(27), 2197-2205. [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1359&amp;context=engpapers&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22Analysis%20blast%20loads%20buildings.%22 read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, persons or objects behind a large building are not necessarily protected from a blast that starts on the opposite side of the building. Scientists use sophisticated mathematical models to predict how objects will respond to a blast in order to design effective barriers and safer buildings.&lt;ref&gt;for example,Cullis IG. Blast waves and how they interact with structures. J.R. Army Med Corps 147:16-26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mach stem formation===
[[Image:Mach effect sequence.svg|250px|right| thumb | A blast wave reflecting from a surface and forming a mach stem.]] Mach stem formation occurs when a blast wave reflects off the ground and the reflection catches up with the original shock front, therefore creating a high pressure zone that extends from the ground up to a certain point called the triple point at the edge of the blast wave. Anything in this area experiences peak pressures that can be several times higher than the peak pressure of the original shock front.

===Constructive and destructive interference===
[[Image:Constructive interference.svg|250px|left | thumb | An example of constructive interference.]] In physics, interference is the meeting of two correlated waves and either increasing or lowering the net amplitude, depending on whether it is constructive or destructive interference. If a crest of a wave meets a crest of another wave at the same point then the crests interfere constructively and the resultant crest wave amplitude is increased; forming a much more powerful wave than either of the beginning waves. Similarly two troughs make a trough of increased amplitude. If a crest of a wave meets a trough of another wave then they interfere destructively, and the overall amplitude is decreased; thus making a wave that is much smaller than either of the parent waves.

The formation of a mach stem is one example of constructive interference. Whenever a blast wave reflects off of a surface, such as a building wall or the inside of a vehicle, different reflected waves can interact with each other to cause an increase in pressure at a certain point (constructive interference) or a decrease (destructive interference). In this way the interaction of blast waves is similar to that of sound waves or water waves.

==Damage==

Blast waves cause damage by a combination of the significant compression of the air in front of the wave (forming a [[shock front]]) and the subsequent wind that follows.&lt;ref&gt;Neff M. A visual model for blast waves and fracture. Master's Thesis, University of Toronto, Canada, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound and the passage of the shock wave usually lasts only a few milliseconds. Like other types of explosions, a blast wave can also cause damage to things and people by the blast wind, debris, and fires. The original explosion will send out fragments that travel very fast. Debris and sometimes even people can get swept up into a blast wave, causing more injuries such as penetrating wounds, impalement, broken bones, or even death. The blast wind is the area of low pressure that causes debris and fragments to actually rush back towards the original explosions. The blast wave can also cause fires or even secondary explosions by a combination of the high temperatures that result from detonation and the physical destruction of fuel-containing objects.

==Applications==

===Bombs===
In response to an inquiry from the British [[MAUD Committee]], G. I. Taylor estimated the amount of energy that would be released by the explosion of an atomic bomb in air.  He postulated that for an idealized point source of energy, the spatial distributions of the flow variables would have the same form during a given time interval, the variables differing only in scale.  (Thus the name of the "similarity solution.")  This hypothesis allowed the partial differential equations in terms of r (the radius of the blast wave) and t (time) to be transformed into an ordinary differential equation in terms of the similarity variable  &lt;math&gt;\frac{r^{5}\rho_{o}}{t^{2}E}&lt;/math&gt; ,

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the air and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the energy that's released by the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of similarity solutions, including G. I. Taylor's:
[[Buckingham Pi theorem]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derivation of G. I. Taylor's similarity solution:
http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/codoban/PHY138/Mechanics/dimensional.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of G. I. Taylor's research, including his similarity solution:
http://www.deas.harvard.edu/brenner/taylor/physic_today/taylor.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This result allowed G. I. Taylor to estimate the yield of the first atomic explosion in New Mexico in 1945 using only photographs of the blast, which had been published in newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref name="Batchelor"/&gt;  The yield of the explosion was determined by using the equation:  &lt;math&gt;E = \left(\frac{\rho_{o}}{t^2}\right)\left(\frac{r}{C}\right)^5&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless constant that is a function of the ratio of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to the specific heat of air at constant volume. The value of C is also affected by radiative losses, but for air, values of C of 1.00-1.10 generally give reasonable results. In 1950, G. I. Taylor published two articles in which he revealed the yield E of the first atomic explosion,&lt;ref name=taylor_1950/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor_1950a/&gt; which had previously been classified and whose publication therefore caused a great to-do.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

While nuclear explosions are among the clearest examples of the destructive power of blast waves, blast waves generated by exploding conventional bombs and other weapons made from high explosives have been used as weapons of war due to their effectiveness at creating polytraumatic injury.  During World War II and the U.S.’s involvement in the Vietnam War, [[blast lung]] was a common and often deadly injury.  Improvements in vehicular and personal protective equipment have helped to reduce the incidence of blast lung.  However, as soldiers are better protected from penetrating injury and surviving previously lethal exposures, limb injuries, eye and ear injuries, and traumatic brain injuries have become more prevalent.

===Effects of blast loads on buildings===
Structural behaviour during an explosion depends entirely on the materials used in the construction of the building. Upon hitting the face of a building, the shock front from an explosion is instantly reflected. This impact with the structure imparts momentum to exterior components of the building. The associated kinetic energy of the moving components must be absorbed or dissipated in order for them to survive. Generally, this is achieved by converting the kinetic energy of the moving component to strain energy in resisting elements.&lt;ref name="Dusenberry"&gt;Dusenberry, Donald. 'Handbook for Blast Resistant Design of Buildings', 2010, pages 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the resisting elements, such as windows, building facades and support columns fail, causing partial damage through to progressive collapse of the building.

===Astronomy ===
The so-called '''Sedov-Taylor''' solution {{see above|Bombs|mid=y}} has become useful in [[astrophysics]]. For example, it can be applied to quantify an estimate for the outcome from [[supernova]]-explosions. The Sedov-Taylor expansion is also known as the 'Blast Wave' phase, which is an adiabatic expansion phase in the life cycle of supernova. The temperature of the material in a supernova shell decreases with time, but the internal energy of the material is always 72% of E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the initial energy released. This is helpful for astrophysicists interested in predicting the behavior of supernova remnants.

===Research===

Blast waves are generated in research environments using explosive or compressed-gas driven [[shock tube]]s in an effort to replicate the environment of a military conflict to better understand the physics of blasts and injuries that may result, and to develop better protection against blast exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, Dr. E. J., Henny, Dr. R. W., Thomsen, J. M., Duray, J. P.  DTRA Weapons Effects Testing: A Thirty Year Perspective. Applied Research and Associates, Shock Physics Division&lt;/ref&gt; Blast waves are directed against structures (such as vehicles),&lt;ref&gt;for example, Bauman, R. A., Ling, G., Tong, L., Januszkiewicz, A., Agoston, D., Delanerolle, N., Kim, Y., Ritzel, D., Bell, R., Ecklund, J., Armonda, R., Bandak, F., Parks, S. An Introductory Characterization of a Combat-Casualty-Care Relevant Swine Model of Closed Head Injury Resulting from Exposure to Explosive Blast. Journal of Neurotrauma, June 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; materials, and biological specimens&lt;ref&gt;Cernak, I. The importance of systematic response in the pathobiology of blast-induced Neurotrauma. Frontiers in Neurology December, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or surrogates.  High-speed [[pressure sensor]]s and/or [[high speed camera]]s are often used to quantify the response to blast exposure.  Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs or [[crash test dummy|test dummies]]) initially developed for the automotive industry are being used, sometimes with added instrumentation, to estimate the human response to blast events.  For examples, personnel in vehicles and personnel on demining teams have been simulated using these ATDs.&lt;ref&gt;Makris, A. Nerenberg, J., Dionne, J. P., Bass, C. R., Chichester. Reduction of Blast Induced Head Acceleration in the Field of Anti-Personnel Mine Clearance. Med-Eng Systems Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with experiments, complex mathematical models have been made of the interaction of blast waves with inanimate and biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;for example, Stuhmiller JH. Mathematical Modeling in Support of Military Operational Medicine Final Report J3150.01-06-306 prepared for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5012 OMB No. 0704-0188, July, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Validated models are useful for "what if" experiments – predictions of outcomes for different scenarios.  Depending on the system being modeled, it can be difficult to have accurate input parameters (for example, the material properties of a rate-sensitive material at blast rates of loading).  Lack of experimental validation severely limits the usefulness of any numerical model.

In [[computer science]], the '''Boolean satisfiability problem''' (sometimes called '''propositional satisfiability problem''' and abbreviated '''SATISFIABILITY''' or '''SAT''') is the problem of determining if there exists an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] that [[Satisfiability|satisfies]] a given [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula [[Validity (logic)|evaluates to TRUE]]. If this is the case, the formula is called ''satisfiable''. On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is [[Contradiction#Contradiction in formal logic|FALSE]] for all possible variable assignments and the formula is ''unsatisfiable''. For example, the formula "''a'' AND NOT ''b''" is satisfiable because one can find the values ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;TRUE and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, which make (''a'' AND NOT ''b'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;TRUE. In contrast, "''a'' AND NOT ''a''" is unsatisfiable.

SAT is the first problem that was proven to be [[NP-complete]]; see [[Cook–Levin theorem]]. This means that all problems in the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], which includes a wide range of natural decision and optimization problems, are at most as difficult to solve as SAT. There is no known algorithm that efficiently solves each SAT problem, and it is generally believed that no such algorithm exists; yet this belief has not been proven mathematically, and resolving the question of whether SAT has a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm is equivalent to the [[P versus NP problem]], which is a famous open problem in the theory of computing.

Nevertheless, as of 2007, heuristic SAT-algorithms are able to solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and &lt;!---"clauses" hasn't been introduced here:---&gt;formulas consisting of millions of symbols,&lt;ref name="Codish.Ohrimenko.Stuckey.2007"/&gt; which is sufficient for many practical SAT problems from, e.g., [[artificial intelligence]], [[circuit design]], and [[automatic theorem proving]].

==Basic definitions and terminology==
A ''[[propositional logic]] formula'', also called ''Boolean expression'', is built from [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], operators AND ([[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], also denoted by ∧), OR ([[logical disjunction|disjunction]], ∨), NOT ([[negation]], ¬), and parentheses.
A formula is said to be ''satisfiable'' if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate [[logical value]]s (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables.
The ''Boolean satisfiability problem'' (SAT) is, given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable.
This [[decision problem]] is of central importance in many areas of [[computer science]], including [[theoretical computer science]], [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], [[algorithmics]], [[cryptography]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

There are several special cases of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which the formulas are required to have a particular structure. A ''literal'' is either a variable, called ''positive literal'', or the negation of a variable, called ''negative literal''.
A ''clause'' is a disjunction of literals (or a single literal). A clause is called a ''[[Horn clause]]'' if it contains at most one positive literal.
A formula is in ''[[conjunctive normal form]]'' (CNF) if it is a conjunction of clauses (or a single clause).
For example, {{math|size=100%|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a positive literal, {{math|size=100%|¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a negative literal, {{math|size=100%|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a clause, and {{math|size=100%|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a formula in conjunctive normal form; its first and third clauses are Horn clauses, but its second clause is not. The formula is satisfiable, by choosing ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; arbitrarily, since (FALSE ∨ ¬FALSE) ∧ (¬FALSE ∨ FALSE ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬FALSE evaluates to (FALSE ∨ TRUE) ∧ (TRUE ∨ FALSE ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ TRUE, and in turn to TRUE ∧ TRUE ∧ TRUE (i.e. to TRUE). In contrast, the CNF formula ''a'' ∧ ¬''a'', consisting of two clauses of one literal, is unsatisfiable, since for ''a''=TRUE or ''a''=FALSE it evaluates to TRUE ∧ ¬TRUE (i.e., FALSE) or FALSE ∧ ¬FALSE (i.e., again FALSE), respectively.

For some versions of the SAT problem,&lt;!---need not list them in detail here---(viz. [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]], [[#XOR-satisfiability|XOR-satisfiability]], and, more general, [[#Schaefer's dichotomy theorem|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], discussed below),---&gt; it is useful to define the notion of a ''generalized conjunctive normal form'' formula, viz. as a conjunction of arbitrarily many ''generalized clauses'', the latter being of the form {{math|''R''(''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for some boolean operator ''R'' and (ordinary) literals {{mvar|''l''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Different sets of allowed boolean operators lead to different problem versions.&lt;!---, see [[#Complexity and restricted versions|below]].---&gt;As an example, ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') is a generalized clause, and ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') ∧ ''R''(''b'',''y'',''c'') ∧ ''R''(''c'',''d'',¬''z'') is a generalized conjunctive normal form. This formula is used [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|below]], with ''R'' being the ternary operator that is TRUE just when exactly one of its arguments is.
&lt;!---need not explain that already here---If ''R'' is the ternary operator that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is, then a satisfying assignment for the latter formula can be found starting from every possible combination of truth values for ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', except ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;FALSE, and choosing the values of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' appropriately; cf. the left table under [[#Exactly-1 3-satisfiability|Exactly-1 3-satisfiability]] below.---&gt;

Using the laws of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], every propositional logic formula can be transformed into an equivalent conjunctive normal form, which may, however, be exponentially longer. For example, transforming the formula
(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∧''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ∨ (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∧''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∨ ... ∨ (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;∧''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
into conjunctive normal form yields
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ... ∧}}
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧}}
:{{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}};
while the former is a disjunction of ''n'' conjunctions of 2 variables, the latter consists of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; clauses of ''n'' variables.

==Complexity and restricted versions==

===Unrestricted satisfiability (SAT)===
{{Main article|Cook–Levin theorem}}

SAT was the first known [[NP-complete]] problem, as proved by [[Stephen Cook]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Stephen A. | authorlink1=Stephen Cook| title = The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures | pages = 151–158 | year = 1971 | url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/1971.pdf| doi = 10.1145/800157.805047| journal = Proceedings of the 3rd Annual ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently by [[Leonid Levin]] at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences#The Academy of Sciences of the USSR|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Leonid|authorlink=Leonid Levin|title = Universal search problems (Russian: Универсальные задачи перебора, Universal'nye perebornye zadachi)|journal = Problems of Information Transmission (Russian: Проблемы передачи информа́ции, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii)|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 115–116|year = 1973}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=914&amp;volume=9&amp;year=1973&amp;issue=3&amp;fpage=115&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng (pdf)] {{ru icon}}, translated into English by {{cite journal|last=Trakhtenbrot|first=B. A.|title = A survey of Russian approaches to ''perebor'' (brute-force searches) algorithms|journal = Annals of the History of Computing |volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 384–400|year = 1984|doi=10.1109/MAHC.1984.10036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, the concept of an NP-complete problem did not even exist.
The proof shows how every decision problem in the [[complexity class]] [[NP (complexity)|NP]] can be [[reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to the SAT problem for CNF&lt;ref group=note&gt;The SAT problem for ''arbitrary'' formulas is NP-complete, too, since it is easily shown to be in NP, and it cannot be easier than SAT for CNF formulas.&lt;/ref&gt; formulas, sometimes called '''CNFSAT'''.
A useful property of Cook's reduction is that it preserves the number of accepting answers. For example, deciding whether a given [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] has a [[Graph coloring#Vertex coloring|3-coloring]] is another problem in NP; if a graph has 17 valid 3-colorings, the SAT formula produced by the Cook–Levin reduction will have 17 satisfying assignments.

NP-completeness only refers to the run-time of the worst case instances.  Many of the instances that occur in practical applications can be solved much more quickly.  See [[#Algorithms for solving SAT|Algorithms for solving SAT]] below.

SAT is trivial if the formulas are restricted to those in '''[[disjunctive normal form]]''', that is, they are disjunction of conjunctions of literals. Such a formula is indeed satisfiable if and only if at least one of its conjunctions is satisfiable, and a conjunction is satisfiable if and only if it does not contain both ''x'' and NOT ''x'' for some variable ''x''. This can be checked in linear time. Furthermore, if they are restricted to being in '''full disjunctive normal form''', in which every variable appears exactly once in every conjunction, they can be checked in constant time (each conjunction represents one satisfying assignment).  But it can take exponential time and space to convert a general SAT problem to disjunctive normal form; for an example exchange "∧" and "∨" in the [[#Basic definitions and terminology|above]] exponential blow-up example for conjunctive normal forms.

===3-satisfiability===
[[File:Sat reduced to Clique from Sipser.svg|thumb|The 3-SAT instance (''x''∨''x''∨''y'') ∧ (¬''x''∨¬''y''∨¬''y'') ∧ (¬''x''∨''y''∨''y'') reduced to a [[clique problem]]. The green vertices form a 3-clique and correspond to the satisfying assignment ''x''=FALSE, ''y''=TRUE.]]
Like the satisfiability problem for arbitrary formulas, determining the satisfiability of a formula in conjunctive normal form where each clause is limited to at most three literals is NP-complete also; this problem is called '''3-SAT''', '''3CNFSAT''', or '''3-satisfiability'''.
To reduce the unrestricted SAT problem to 3-SAT, transform each clause {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to a conjunction of ''n'' − 2 clauses
:{{math|(''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ⋯ ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ }}
:{{math|(¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}
where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;thinsp;⋯&amp;thinsp;,&amp;thinsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are fresh variables not occurring elsewhere.
Although the two formulas are not [[logically equivalent]], they are [[equisatisfiable]]. The formula resulting from transforming all clauses is at most 3 times as long as its original, i.e. the length growth is polynomial.&lt;ref name="Aho.Hopcroft.Ullman.1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred V. Aho |author2=John E. Hopcroft |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms| year=1974| publisher=Addison-Wesley}}; here: Thm.10.4&lt;/ref&gt;

3-SAT is one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]], and it is used as a starting point for proving that other problems are also [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. at least as hard as every other problem in NP. A decision problem is NP-complete if and only if it is in NP and is NP-hard.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by [[polynomial-time reduction]] from 3-SAT to the other problem. An example of a problem where this method has been used is the [[clique problem]]: given a CNF formula consisting of ''c'' clauses, the corresponding [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] consists of a vertex for each literal, and an edge between each two non-contradicting&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. such that one literal is not the negation of the other&lt;/ref&gt; literals from different clauses, cf. picture. The graph has a ''c''-clique if and only if the formula is satisfiable.{{refn|Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman&lt;ref name="Aho.Hopcroft.Ullman.1974"/&gt; (1974); Thm.10.5}}

There is a simple randomized algorithm due to Schöning (1999) that runs in time (4/3)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''n'' is the number of variables in the 3-SAT proposition, and succeeds with high probability to correctly decide 3-SAT.&lt;ref name="Schoning.1999"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Schöning | first1 = Uwe| chapter = A Probabilistic Algorithm for ''k''-SAT and Constraint Satisfaction Problems | title = Proc. 40th Ann. Symp. Foundations of Computer Science| pages = 410–414 | date=Oct 1999 | url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/schoning99.pdf| doi = 10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[exponential time hypothesis]] asserts that no algorithm can solve 3-SAT (or indeed ''k''-SAT for any ''k &gt; 2'') in {{math|exp([[Small o notation#Little-o notation|''o'']](''n''))}} time (i.e., fundamentally faster than exponential in ''n'').

Selman, Mitchell, and Levesque (1996) give empirical data on the difficulty of randomly generated 3-SAT formulas, depending on their size parameters.
Difficulty is measured in number recursive calls made by a [[#Algorithms for solving SAT|DPLL algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bart Selman |author2=David Mitchell |author3=Hector Levesque | title=Generating Hard Satisfiability Problems| journal=Artificial Intelligence| year=1996| volume=81| pages=17–29| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=3CBEAB7E11BF4B2283E9F383810060C1?doi=10.1.1.37.7362&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf| doi=10.1016/0004-3702(95)00045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3-satisfiability can be generalized to '''k-satisfiability''' ('''k-SAT''', also '''k-CNF-SAT'''), when formulas in CNF are considered with each clause containing up to ''k'' literals.
However, since for any ''k''≥3, this problem can neither be easier than 3-SAT nor harder than SAT, and the latter two are NP-complete, so must be k-SAT.

Some authors restrict k-SAT to CNF formulas with '''exactly k literals'''. This doesn't lead to a different complexity class either, as each clause {{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with ''j''&lt;''k'' literals can be padded with fixed dummy variables to
{{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋯ ∨ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
After padding all clauses, 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-1 extra clauses&lt;ref group=note&gt;viz. all [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)#Maxterms|maxterms]] that can be built with {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,⋯,''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, except {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∨⋯∨''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; have to be appended to ensure that only {{math|1=''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=⋯=''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;=FALSE}} can lead to a satisfying assignment. Since ''k'' doesn't depend on the formula length, the extra clauses lead to a constant increase in length. For the same reason, it does not matter whether '''duplicate literals''' are allowed in clauses (like e.g. {{math|¬''x'' ∨ ¬''y'' ∨ ¬''y''}}), or not.

===Exactly-1 3-satisfiability===
[[File:Schaefer's 3-SAT to 1-in-3-SAT reduction.gif|thumb|x100px|'''Left:''' Schaefer's reduction of a 3-SAT clause ''x''∨''y''∨''z''. The result of ''R'' is {{fontcolor|#00a000|TRUE (1)}} if exactly one of its arguments is TRUE, and {{fontcolor|#a00000|FALSE (0)}} otherwise. All 8 combinations of values for ''x'',''y'',''z'' are examined, one per line. The fresh variables ''a'',...,''f'' can be chosen to satisfy all clauses (exactly one {{fontcolor|#00a000|green}} argument for each ''R'') in all lines except the first, where ''x''∨''y''∨''z'' is FALSE. '''Right:''' A simpler reduction with the same properties.]]
A variant of the 3-satisfiability problem is the '''one-in-three 3-SAT''' (also known variously as '''1-in-3-SAT''' and '''exactly-1 3-SAT''').
Given a conjunctive normal form with three literals per clause, the problem is to determine whether there exists a truth assignment to the variables so that each clause has ''exactly'' one TRUE literal (and thus exactly two FALSE literals). In contrast, ordinary 3-SAT requires that every clause has ''at least'' one TRUE literal.
Formally, a one-in-three 3-SAT problem is given as a generalized conjunctive normal form with all generalized clauses using a ternary operator ''R'' that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is. When all literals of a one-in-three 3-SAT formula are positive, the satisfiability problem is called '''one-in-three positive 3-SAT'''.

One-in-three 3-SAT, together with its positive case, is listed as NP-complete problem "LO4" in the standard reference, ''Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness''
by [[Michael R. Garey]] and [[David S. Johnson]].  One-in-three 3-SAT was proved to be NP-complete by [[Thomas Jerome Schaefer]] as a special case of [[Schaefer's dichotomy theorem]], which asserts that any problem generalizing Boolean satisfiability in a certain way is either in the class P or is NP-complete.&lt;ref name="schaefer"&gt;{{Cite conference | last1 = Schaefer | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1978 | title = The complexity of satisfiability problems | booktitle = Proceedings of the 10th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing | place = San Diego, California | journal =  | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 216–226 | publisher =  | jstor =  | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/courses/csg260/f06/materials/papers/max-sat/p216-schaefer.pdf | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaefer gives a construction allowing an easy polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to one-in-three 3-SAT.  Let "(''x'' or ''y'' or ''z'')" be a clause in a 3CNF formula.  Add six fresh boolean variables ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'', and ''f'', to be used to simulate this clause and no other.
&lt;!---now introduced already above---Let ''R''(''u'',''v'',''w'') be a predicate that is TRUE if and only if exactly one of the booleans ''u'', ''v'', and ''w''
is TRUE.---&gt;
Then the formula ''R''(''x'',''a'',''d'') ∧ ''R''(''y'',''b'',''d'') ∧ ''R''(''a'',''b'',''e'') ∧ ''R''(''c'',''d'',''f'') ∧ ''R''(''z'',''c'',FALSE) is satisfiable by some setting of the fresh variables if and only if at least one of ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' is TRUE, see picture (left).  Thus any 3-SAT instance with ''m'' clauses and ''n'' variables may be converted into an [[equisatisfiable]] one-in-three 3-SAT instance with 5''m'' clauses and ''n''+6''m'' variables.&lt;ref&gt;(Schaefer, 1978), p.222, Lemma 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reduction involves only four fresh variables and three clauses: ''R''(¬''x'',''a'',''b'') ∧ ''R''(''b'',''y'',''c'') ∧ R(''c'',''d'',¬''z''), see picture (right).

===Not-all-equal 3-satisfiability===
{{main|Not-all-equal 3-satisfiability}}
Another variant is the '''not-all-equal 3-satisfiability''' problem (also called '''NAE3SAT''').
Given a conjunctive normal form with three literals per clause, the problem is to determine if an assignment to the variables exists such that in no clause all three literals have the same truth value. This problem is NP-complete, too, even if no negation symbols are admitted, by Schaefer's dichotomy theorem.&lt;ref name="schaefer"/&gt;

===2-satisfiability===
{{Main article|2-satisfiability}}

SAT is easier if the number of literals in a clause is limited to at most 2, in which case the problem is called '''[[2-SAT]]'''. This problem can be solved in polynomial time, and in fact is [[NL-complete|complete]] for the complexity class [[NL (complexity)|NL]]. If additionally all OR operations in literals are changed to [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operations, the result is called '''exclusive-or 2-satisfiability''', which is a problem complete for the complexity class [[SL (complexity)|SL]] = [[L (complexity)|L]].

===Horn-satisfiability===
{{Main article|Horn-satisfiability}}

The problem of deciding the satisfiability of a given conjunction of Horn clauses is called '''Horn-satisfiability''', or '''HORN-SAT'''.
It can be solved in polynomial time by a single step of the [[Unit propagation]] algorithm, which produces the single minimal model of the set of Horn clauses (w.r.t. the set of literals assigned to TRUE).
Horn-satisfiability is [[P-complete]]. It can be seen as [[P (complexity)|P's]] version of the Boolean satisfiability problem.
Also, deciding the truth of quantified Horn formulas can be done in polynomial time.
&lt;ref name="buningkarpinski"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buning | first1 = H.K. | last2 = Karpinski| first2 =  Marek| last3=Flogel|first3=A.|year = 1995 | title = Resolution for Quantified Boolean Formulas | place =  | journal = Information and Computation | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–18 | publisher = Elsevier | jstor =  | doi= 10.1006/inco.1995.1025| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horn clauses are of interest because they are able to express [[Entailment|implication]] of one variable from a set of other variables. Indeed, one such clause ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ... ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''y'' can be rewritten as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ... ∧ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''y'', that is, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are all TRUE, then ''y'' needs to be TRUE as well.

A generalization of the class of Horn formulae is that of renameable-Horn formulae, which is the set of formulae that can be placed in Horn form by replacing some variables with their respective negation.
For example, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is not a Horn formula, but can be renamed to the Horn formula (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by introducing ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as negation of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
In contrast, no renaming of (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a Horn formula.
Checking the existence of such a replacement can be done in linear time; therefore, the satisfiability of such formulae is in P as it can be solved by first performing this replacement and then checking the satisfiability of the resulting Horn formula.

Another special case is the class of problems where each clause contains XOR (i.e. [[exclusive or]]) rather than (plain) OR operators.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally, generalized conjunctive normal forms with a ternary boolean operator ''R'' are employed, which is TRUE just if 1 or 3 of its arguments is. An input clause with more than 3 literals can be transformed into an equisatisfiable conjunction of clauses á 3 literals similar to [[#3-satisfiability|above]]; i.e. XOR-SAT can be reduced to XOR-3-SAT.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is in [[P (complexity class)|P]], since an XOR-SAT formula can also be viewed as a system of linear equations mod 2, and can be solved in cubic time by [[Gaussian elimination]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Nature of Computation|first1=Cristopher|last1=Moore|author1-link=Cristopher Moore|first2=Stephan|last2=Mertens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199233212|page=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4zMiZyAE1kC&amp;pg=PA366}}.&lt;/ref&gt; see the box for an example. This recast is based on the [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Boolean rings|kinship between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings]], and the fact that arithmetic modulo two forms a [[finite field]]. Since ''a'' XOR ''b'' XOR ''c'' evaluates to TRUE if and only if exactly 1 or 3 members of {''a'',''b'',''c''} are TRUE, each solution of the 1-in-3-SAT problem for a given CNF formula is also a solution of the XOR-3-SAT problem, and in turn each solution of XOR-3-SAT is a solution of 3-SAT, cf. picture. As a consequence, for each CNF formula, it is possible to solve the XOR-3-SAT problem defined by the formula, and based on the result infer either that the 3-SAT problem is solvable or that the 1-in-3-SAT problem is unsolvable.

Provided that the [[P = NP problem|complexity classes P and NP are not equal]], neither 2-, nor Horn-, nor XOR-satisfiability is NP-complete, unlike SAT.

===Schaefer's dichotomy theorem===
{{Main article|Schaefer's dichotomy theorem}}
The restrictions above (CNF, 2CNF, 3CNF, Horn, XOR-SAT) bound the considered formulae to be conjunctions of subformulae; each restriction states a specific form for all subformulae: for example, only binary clauses can be subformulae in 2CNF.

Schaefer's dichotomy theorem states that, for any restriction to Boolean operators that can be used to form these subformulae, the corresponding satisfiability problem is in P or NP-complete.  The membership in P of the satisfiability of 2CNF, Horn, and XOR-SAT formulae are special cases of this theorem.&lt;ref name="schaefer"/&gt;

==Extensions of SAT==
An extension that has gained significant popularity since 2003 is '''[[satisfiability modulo theories]]''' ('''SMT''') that can enrich CNF formulas with linear constraints, arrays, all-different constraints, [[uninterpreted function]]s,&lt;ref name="Bryant.German.Velev.1999"&gt;R. E. Bryant, S. M. German, and M. N. Velev, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=709275 Microprocessor Verification Using Efficient Decision Procedures for a Logic of Equality with Uninterpreted Functions], in Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–13, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''etc.'' Such extensions typically remain NP-complete, but very efficient solvers are now available that can handle many such kinds of constraints.

The satisfiability problem becomes more difficult if both "for all" ([[∀]]) and "there exists" ([[∃]]) [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s are allowed to bind the Boolean variables.
An example of such an expression would be {{math|size=100%|∀''x'' ∀''y'' ∃''z'' (''x'' ∨ ''y'' ∨ ''z'') ∧ (¬''x'' ∨ ¬''y'' ∨ ¬''z'')}}; it is valid, since for all values of ''x'' and ''y'', an appropriate value of ''z'' can be found, viz. ''z''=TRUE if both ''x'' and ''y'' are FALSE, and ''z''=FALSE else.
SAT itself (tacitly) uses only ∃ quantifiers.
If only ∀ quantifiers are allowed instead, the so-called '''[[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] problem''' is obtained, which is [[co-NP-complete]].
If both quantifiers are allowed, the problem is called the '''[[quantified Boolean formula problem]]''' ('''QBF'''), which can be shown to be [[PSPACE-complete]]. It is widely believed that PSPACE-complete problems are strictly harder than any problem in NP, although this has not yet been proved. Using highly parallel ''[[P system]]s'', QBF-SAT problems can be solved in linear time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alhazov | first1 = Artiom | last2 = Martín-Vide | first2 = Carlos | last3 = Pan | first3 = Linqiang | title = Solving a PSPACE-Complete Problem by Recognizing P Systems with Restricted Active Membranes | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2371013 | journal = Fundamenta Informaticae | volume = 58 | pages = 67–77 | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinary SAT asks if there is at least one variable assignment that makes the formula true. A variety of variants deal with the number of such assignments:
* '''MAJ-SAT''' asks if the majority of all assignments make the formula TRUE. It is known to be complete for [[PP (complexity)|PP]], a probabilistic class.
* '''[[Sharp-SAT|#SAT]]''', the problem of counting how many variable assignments satisfy a formula, is a counting problem, not a decision problem, and is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]].
* '''UNIQUE-SAT''' is the problem of determining whether a formula has exactly one assignment. It is complete for [[US (complexity)|US]], the [[complexity class]] describing problems solvable by a non-deterministic polynomial time [[Turing machine]] that accepts when there is exactly one nondeterministic accepting path and rejects otherwise.
* '''UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT''' is the name given to the satisfiability problem when the input is [[Promise problem|restricted]] to formulas having at most one satisfying assignment. A solving algorithm for UNAMBIGUOUS-SAT is allowed to exhibit any behavior, including endless looping, on a formula having several satisfying assignments. Although this problem seems easier, Valiant and Vazirani have [[Valiant-Vazirani theorem|shown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Valiant | first1 = L. | last2 = Vazirani | first2 = V.| doi = 10.1016/0304-3975(86)90135-0 | title = NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions | url = http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall05/cos528/handouts/NP_is_as.pdf| journal = Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 47 | pages = 85–93 | year = 1986 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that if there is a practical (i.e. [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|randomized polynomial-time]]) algorithm to solve it, then all problems in [[NP (complexity class)|NP]] can be solved just as easily.
* '''MAX-SAT''', the [[maximum satisfiability problem]], is an [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]] generalization of SAT. It asks for the maximum number of clauses, which can be satisfied by any assignment. It has efficient [[approximation algorithm]]s, but is NP-hard to solve exactly. Worse still, it is [[APX]]-complete, meaning there is no [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for this problem unless P=NP.

Other generalizations include satisfiability for [[first-order predicate calculus|first]]- and [[second-order logic]], [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, [[0-1 integer programming]].

==Self-reducibility==
The SAT problem is '''self-reducible''', that is, each algorithm which correctly answers if an instance of SAT is solvable can be used to find a satisfying assignment. First, the question is asked on the given formula Φ. If the answer is "no", the formula is unsatisfiable. Otherwise, the question is asked on the partly instantiated formula Φ[[substitution (logic)|{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE}]], i.e. Φ with the first variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; replaced by TRUE, and simplified accordingly. If the answer is "yes", then ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=TRUE, otherwise ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=FALSE. Values of other variables can be found subsequently in the same way. In total, ''n''+1 runs of the algorithm are required, where ''n'' is the number of distinct variables in Φ.

This property of self-reducibility is used in several theorems in complexity theory:

: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⊆ [[P/poly]] ⇒ [[PH (complexity)|PH]] = [[Polynomial hierarchy#Definitions|Σ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Karp–Lipton theorem]])
: [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⊆ [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]] ⇒ [[NP (complexity)|NP]] = [[RP (complexity)|RP]]
: [[P (complexity)|P]] = [[NP (complexity)|NP]] ⇒ [[FP (complexity)|FP]] = [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]]

==Algorithms for solving SAT==

Since the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade{{When|date=July 2016}} and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses).&lt;ref name="Codish.Ohrimenko.Stuckey.2007"&gt;{{citation|title=Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming – CP 2007|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=4741|year=2007|pages=544–558|contribution=Propagation = Lazy Clause Generation|first1=Olga|last1=Ohrimenko|first2=Peter J.|last2=Stuckey|first3=Michael|last3=Codish|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74970-7_39|quote=modern SAT solvers can often handle problems with millions of constraints and hundreds of thousands of variables|citeseerx=10.1.1.70.5471}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such problems in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) include [[formal equivalence checking]], [[model checking]], [[formal verification]] of [[microprocessor|pipelined microprocessors]],&lt;ref name="Bryant.German.Velev.1999"/&gt; [[automatic test pattern generation]], [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] of [[FPGA]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gi-Joon Nam | last2 = Sakallah | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Rutenbar | first3 = R. A. | title = A new FPGA detailed routing approach via search-based Boolean satisfiability | journal = IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 674 | year = 2002 | url = http://cs-rutenbar.web.engr.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/rutenbar-sattranscad02.pdf| doi = 10.1109/TCAD.2002.1004311}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], and [[Scheduling algorithm|scheduling problems]], and so on. A SAT-solving engine is now considered to be an essential component in the [[electronic design automation|EDA]] toolbox.

There are two classes of high-performance [[algorithms]] for solving instances of SAT in practice: the [[conflict-driven clause learning]] algorithm, which can be viewed as a modern variant of the [[DPLL algorithm]] (well known implementations include [[Chaff algorithm|Chaff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Moskewicz | first1 = M.

P. | last2 = Sakallah | first2 = K. A. | title = GRASP: a search algorithm for propositional satisfiability | journal = IEEE Transactions on Computers | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 506 | year = 1999 | url = http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/Alumni/wjiang/ee219b/grasp.pdf| doi = 10.1109/12.769433}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[stochastic]] [[Local search (constraint satisfaction)|local search]] algorithms, such as [[WalkSAT]].

A DPLL SAT solver employs a systematic backtracking search procedure to explore the (exponentially sized) space of variable assignments looking for satisfying assignments. The basic search procedure was proposed in two seminal papers in the early 1960s (see references below) and is now commonly referred to as the [[Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm]] ("DPLL" or "DLL").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = H. | title = A Computing Procedure for Quantification Theory | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 201 | year = 1960 | doi = 10.1145/321033.321034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = M. |authorlink1=Martin Davis| last2 = Logemann | first2 = G. | last3 = Loveland | first3 = D. | title = A machine program for theorem-proving | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 394–397 | year = 1962 | url = http://www.ensiie.fr/~blazy/ipr/article2.pdf| doi = 10.1145/368273.368557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, exponential lower bounds have been proved for the DPLL family of algorithms.

In contrast, randomized algorithms like the PPSZ algorithm by Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, and Zane set variables in a random order according to some heuristics, for example bounded-width [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. If the heuristic can't find the correct setting, the variable is assigned randomly. The PPSZ algorithm has a runtime of &lt;math&gt;O(2^{0.386n})&lt;/math&gt; for 3-SAT with a single satisfying assignment. Currently this is the best-known runtime for this problem. In the setting with many satisfying assignments the randomized algorithm by Schöning has a better bound.&lt;ref name="Schoning.1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppsz_algorithm"&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1066101 "An improved exponential-time algorithm for k-SAT"], Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, Zani&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern SAT solvers (developed in the last ten years{{When|date=July 2016}}) come in two flavors: "conflict-driven" and "look-ahead".{{clarify|reason=3 paragraphs before here, 'two classes', viz. 'conflict-driven clause learning DPLL' and 'stochastic local search' were named. Please indicate if the latter essentially means the same as 'look-ahead' here.|date=September 2013}} Conflict-driven solvers augment the basic DPLL search algorithm with efficient conflict analysis, clause learning, non-[[chronological backtracking]] (a.k.a. [[backjumping]]), as well as [["two-watched-literals" unit propagation]], adaptive branching, and random restarts. These "extras" to the basic systematic search have been empirically shown to be essential for handling the large SAT instances that arise in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vizel | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weissenbacher | first2 = G. | last3 = Malik | first3 = S. | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 103 | issue = 11 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455034|title=Boolean Satisfiability Solvers and Their Applications in Model Checking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Look-ahead solvers have especially strengthened reductions (going beyond unit-clause propagation) and the heuristics, and they are generally stronger than conflict-driven solvers on hard instances (while conflict-driven solvers can be much better on large instances which actually have an easy instance inside).

Modern SAT solvers are also having significant impact on the fields of software verification, constraint solving in artificial intelligence, and operations research, among others. Powerful solvers are readily available as [[free and open source software]]. In particular, the conflict-driven [http://minisat.se/ MiniSAT], which was relatively successful at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2005 SAT competition], only has about 600 lines of code. A modern Parallel SAT solver is [http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~jabbour/manysat.htm ManySAT]. It can achieve super linear speed-ups on important classes of problems. An example for look-ahead solvers is [http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/sat/march_dl.php march_dl], which won a prize at the [http://www.satcompetition.org/ 2007 SAT competition].

Certain types of large random satisfiable instances of SAT can be solved by [[survey propagation]] (SP). Particularly in [[hardware design]] and [[hardware verification|verification]] applications, satisfiability and other logical properties of a given propositional formula are sometimes decided based on a representation of the formula as a [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD).

Almost all SAT solvers include time-outs, so they will terminate in reasonable time even if they cannot find a solution.
Different SAT solvers will find different instances easy or hard, and some excel at proving unsatisfiability, and others at finding solutions.
All of these behaviors can be seen in the SAT solving contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satcompetition.org/ |title=The international SAT Competitions web page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAT problem format===
A SAT problem is often described in the [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/uploads/ResearchProjects/Spear/dimacs-cnf.pdf DIMACS-CNF] format: an input file in which each line represents a single disjunction. For example, a file with the two lines
 1 -5 4 0
 -1 5 3 4 0
represents the formula "(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) ∧ (¬''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)".

Another common format for this formula is the 7-bit [[ASCII]] representation "(x1 | ~x5 | x4) &amp; (~x1 | x5 | x3 | x4)".

== History ==
Hunter &amp; Ready initiated the first known bug bounty program in 1983 for their [[Versatile Real-Time Executive]] operating system. Anyone who found and reported a bug would receive a Volkswagen Beetle (aka Bug) in return. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cybersecuritysf/status/883829319604293632|title=The  first “bug” bounty program|date=8 July 2017|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A little over a decade later in 1995, Jarrett Ridlinghafer, a technical support engineer at [[Netscape|Netscape Communications Corporation]] coined the phrase 'Bugs Bounty'.

Netscape encouraged its employees to push themselves and do whatever it takes to get the job done. Ridlinghafer recognized that Netscape had many enthusiasts and evangelists for their products, some of whom to him seemed even fanatical, particularly for the Mosaic/Netscape/Mozilla browser. He started to investigate the phenomenon in more detail and discovered that many of Netscape's enthusiasts were actually software engineers who were fixing the product's bugs on their own and publishing the fixes or workarounds:
* in the news forums that had been set up by Netscape's technical support department to enable "self-help through collaboration" (another one of Ridlinghafer's ideas during his four-year stint at Netscape); or 
* on the unofficial "Netscape U-FAQ" website, where every known bug and feature of the browser was listed, as well as instructions regarding workarounds and fixes.

Ridlinghafer thought the company should leverage these resources and sat down and wrote out a proposal for the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program', which he presented to his manager who in turn suggested that Ridlinghafer present it at the next company executive team meeting.

At the next executive team meeting, which was attended by [[Jim Barksdale|James Barksdale]], [[Marc Andreessen]] and the VPs of every department including product engineering, each member was given a copy of the 'Netscape Bugs Bounty Program' proposal and Ridlinghafer was invited to present his idea to the Netscape Executive Team.

Everyone at the meeting embraced the idea except the VP of Engineering, who did not want it to go forward believing it to be a waste of time and resources. However, the VP of Engineering was overruled and Ridlinghafer was given an initial $50k budget to run with the proposal and the first official 'Bugs Bounty' program was launched in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www101.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease48.html |title=Netscape announces Netscape Bugs Bounty with release of netscape navigator 2.0 |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=21 Jan 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970501041756/http://www101.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease48.html |archivedate=May 1, 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cobalt.io/blog/the-history-of-bug-bounty-programs|title=Cobalt Application Security Platform|website=Cobalt|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/centurylink/2015/04/30/why-companies-like-pinterest-run-bug-bounty-programs-through-the-cloud/#284751034867|title=CenturyLinkVoice: Why Companies Like Pinterest Run Bug Bounty Programs Through The Cloud|last=CenturyLink|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was such a huge success it's mentioned in many of the books detailing Netscape's successes.

== Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Violations ==

In August 2013, a Computer Science student named Khalil used an exploit to post a letter on the [[Facebook]] timeline of site founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. According to the hacker, he had tried to report the vulnerability using Facebook's bug bounty program, but because of the vague and incomplete report the response team told him that his vulnerability was not actually a bug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/facebook-post-exploit-hacker-zuckerberg-621/|title=Hacker posts Facebook bug report on Zuckerberg’s wall|date=18 August 2013|publisher=RT|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Facebook t-shirt with whitehat debit card for Hackers.jpg|thumb|A Facebook "White Hat" debit card, given to researchers who report security bugs]]

[[Facebook]] started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded “White Hat” debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws. “Researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare, and we value them and have to find ways to reward them,” Ryan McGeehan, former manager of Facebook’s security response team, told [[CNET]] in an interview. “Having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them. They can show up at a conference and show this card and say ‘I did special work for Facebook.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitehat|first=Facebook|title=Facebook whitehat Debit card|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-hands-out-white-hat-debit-cards-to-hackers/|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Facebook stopped issuing debit cards to researchers.

In 2016, ride sharing company [[Uber]] experienced a security incident when an individual accessed the personal information of 57 million Uber users worldwide. The individual supposedly demanded a ransom of $100,000 in order to destroy the users’ data. In Congressional testimony, Uber CISO indicated that the company verified that the data had been destroyed before paying the $100,000. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7d70e53e-73e9-4336-a100-67b233084f12/75728554E990488D71625DFA69B05494.uber---john-flynn---testimony.pdf|title=Testimony of John Flynn, Chief Information Security Officer, Uber Technologies, Inc.|date=6 February 2018|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Flynn expressed regret that Uber did not disclose the incident in 2016. As part of their response to this incident, Uber worked with partner HackerOne to update their bug bounty program policies to, among other things, more thoroughly explain good faith vulnerability research and disclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://threatpost.com/uber-tightens-bug-bounty-extortion-policies/131512/|title=Uber Tightens Bug Bounty Extortion Policy|date=27 April 2018|publisher=Threat Post|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India]], which has either the first or second largest number of bug hunters in the world, depending on which report one cites, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://factordaily.com/india-bug-bounty-superpower/|title=Bug hunters aplenty but respect scarce for white hat hackers in India|date=8 February 2018|publisher=Factor Daily|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also tops the Facebook Bug Bounty Program with the largest number of valid bugs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/2017-highlights-880000-paid-to-researchers/1918340204846863/|title=Facebook Bug Bounty 2017 Highlights: $880,000 Paid to Researchers|date=11 January 2018|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; “India came out on top with the number of valid submissions in 2017, with the United States and Trinidad &amp; Tobago in second and third place, respectively”, Facebook quoted in a post. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-bug-bounty/2017-highlights-880000-paid-to-researchers/1918340204846863/|title=Facebook Bug Bounty 2017 Highlights: $880,000 Paid to Researchers|date=11 January 2018|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo!]] was severely criticized for sending out Yahoo! T-shirts as reward to the Security Researchers for finding and reporting security vulnerabilities in Yahoo!, sparking what came to be called ''T-shirt-gate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=T-shirt Gate|first=Yahoo!|title=Yahoo! T-shirt gate|url=http://www.zdnet.com/yahoo-changes-bug-bounty-policy-following-t-shirt-gate-7000021508|publisher=[[ZDNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-Tech Bridge]], a Geneva, Switzerland-based security testing company issued a press release saying Yahoo! offered $12.50 in credit per vulnerability, which could be used toward Yahoo-branded items such as T-shirts, cups and pens from its store. Ramses Martinez, director of Yahoo's security team claimed later in a blog post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bug Bounty|first=Yahoo!|title=So I’m the guy who sent the t-shirt out as a thank you.|url=http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/62953984019/so-im-the-guy-who-sent-the-t-shirt-out-as-a-thank-you|publisher=Ramses Martinez|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was behind the voucher reward program, and that he basically had been paying for them out of his own pocket. Eventually, Yahoo! launched its new bug bounty program on October 31 of the same year, that allows security researchers to submit bugs and receive rewards between $250 and $15,000, depending on the severity of the bug discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BugBounty Program|first=Yahoo!|title=Yahoo! launched its Bug Bounty Program|url=http://yahoodevelopers.tumblr.com/post/65622522325/the-bug-bounty-program-is-now-live|publisher=Ramses Martinez|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable programs ==

In October 2013, [[Google]] announced a major change to its Vulnerability Reward Program. Previously, it had been a bug bounty program covering many [[Google]] products. With the shift, however, the program was broadened to include a selection of high-risk [[free software]] applications and [[Library (computing)|libraries]], primarily those designed for [[Computer networking|networking]] or for low-level [[operating system]] functionality. Submissions that Google found adherent to the guidelines would be eligible for rewards ranging from $500 to $3133.70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/google-offers-leet-cash-prizes-for-updates-to-linux-and-other-os-software/|title=Google offers "leet" cash prizes for updates to Linux and other OS software|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=9 October 2013|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2013/10/going-beyond-vulnerability-rewards.html|title=Going beyond vulnerability rewards|last=Zalewski|first=Michal|date=9 October 2013|publisher=Google Online Security Blog|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Google expanded their program to cover vulnerabilities found in applications developed by third parties and made available through the Google Play Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/22/16516670/google-play-security-rewards-program-vulnerabilities-bug-bounty/|title=Google launched a new bug bounty program to root out vulnerabilities in third-party apps on Google Play|date=22 October 2017|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Microsoft]] and [[Facebook]] partnered in November 2013 to sponsor The Internet Bug Bounty, a program to offer rewards for reporting hacks and exploits for a broad range of Internet-related software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/now-theres-a-bug-bounty-program-for-the-whole-internet/|title=Now there’s a bug bounty program for the whole Internet|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=6 November 2013|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[GitHub]] and The [[Ford Foundation]] sponsored the initiative, which is managed by volunteers from Uber, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, and HackerOne. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/21/facebook-github-and-the-ford-foundation-donate-300000-to-bug-bounty-program-for-internet-infrastructure/|title=Facebook, GitHub, and the Ford Foundation donate $300,000 to bug bounty program for internet infrastructure|date=21 July 2017|publisher= VentureBeat|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software covered by the IBB includes [[Adobe Flash]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[Ruby on Rails]], [[Perl]], [[OpenSSL]], [[Nginx]], [[Apache HTTP Server]], and [[Phabricator]]. In addition, the program offered rewards for broader exploits affecting widely used operating systems and [[web browser]]s, as well as the Internet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hackerone.com/ibb|title=The Internet Bug Bounty|publisher=HackerOne|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, [[Peter Cook (press secretary)|Peter Cook]] announced the US federal government's first bug bounty program, the "Hack the Pentagon" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/684616/dod-invites-vetted-specialists-to-hack-the-pentagon|title=DoD Invites Vetted Specialists to ‘Hack’ the Pentagon|website=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program ran from April 18 to May 12 and over 1400 people submitted 138 unique valid reports through [[HackerOne]]. In total, the US [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] paid out $71,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackerone.com/hackthepentagon|title=Vulnerability disclosure for Hack the Pentagon|website=HackerOne|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the Secretary of Defense, [[Ash Carter]], met with two participants, David Dworken and Craig Arendt, to honor them for their participation in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/18-year-old-hacker-honored-at-pentagon-1.415197|title=18-year-old hacker honored at Pentagon|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Open Bug Bounty]]'' is a crowd security bug bounty program established in 2014 that allows individuals to post website security vulnerabilities in the hope of a reward from affected website operators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4946">The '''National Calibration Reference Centre''' for Bioassay and ''In Vivo'' Monitoring (NCRC) is administered by the Radiation Protection Bureau of the Canadian Federal [[Health Canada|Department of Health]]. It was created in 1982 through a [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) signed between the regulator of the nuclear industry, the Canadian [[Nuclear safety|Nuclear Safety]] Commission (CNSC), formerly the [[Atomic Energy Control Board]], and the Department of Health with the specific mission of providing "practical reference standards" for measurements used for internal dosimetry. Two other Reference Centres were created at the same time. These were to have equivalent roles for (1) external dosimetry and (2) radon and radioactive atmospheres, and were administered, respectively, by the Canadian [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] and the federal Department of Energy, Mines and Resources. The choice of the three agencies to act as Reference Centres was based on their expertise acquired over years of work in their respective fields and the fact that they operate independently of both the CNSC and the nuclear industry.

The role of the NCRC is in keeping with Health Canada's mandate to protect and preserve the health of Canadians. Specifically, its focus is to provide:
# Independent external [[quality control]] on a regular basis through regularly scheduled intercomparisons;
# Improvement of measurement techniques through advice and training; and
# Information on improving calibrations by supplying practical reference standards and the necessary techniques.

While the provision of intercomparison programs is its principal function, the NCRC also provides the following:
# Advice and assistance;
# Bioassay measurements and internal dose assessments of suspected radionuclide intakes;
# Research in collaboration with other agencies on radionuclide metabolism and biokinetics; and
# Methods development in support of its intercomparison programs and research studies.

The NCRC provides a national calibration reference service to universities, hospitals, [[Public utility|public utilities]] and private firms in Canada. This calibration is a critical step in ensuring that measurements of internal [[Absorbed dose|radiation doses]] to workers are accurate.

==Quality==
The National Calibration Reference Centre (NCRC) was registered to [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001:2000]] by the Canadian General Services Board (CGSB) in December 2003. The Centre has adopted a set of standards containing [[Specification|technical specifications]] and criteria which are used as rules and guidelines to ensure that the materials, processes, and products meet the provided services.

In addition to having an in-house [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] program, Canadian Internal Dosimetry Services are required by the nuclear regulator, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), through its Regulatory Standard S-106: "Technical and Quality Assurance Standard for Dosimetry Services in Canada", to undergo independent testing by participating in the intercomparison programs provided by the National Calibration Reference Center for Bioassay and ''In Vivo'' Monitoring (NCRC). Dosimetry services must obtain passing results prior to receiving CNSC approval to operate as a licensed service, and at least once per year thereafter, in order to demonstrate continuing capability.

==Intercomparison programmes==
===In Vitro===
The Bioassay intercomparison program is concerned with the calibration of measurements for [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] in [[human urine]] samples. This program offers intercomparison samples for measurement of the following materials in urine:
# Uranium
# Tritium
# [[Carbon-14]]
# Tritium and Carbon-14
# Fission and Activation Products

===In Vivo===
The ''In Vivo'' Monitoring intercomparison program is concerned with the calibration of measurement for radioactive isotopes directly in the human body. Phantoms or mannequins shaped to resemble parts of the human body are prepared which contain known quantities of radioactivity. Three programs are offered:
# Thyroid
# Lung
# Whole Body

===Internal Dosimetry===
Cases are sent to participating facilities, chosen by the CNSC, that must be evaluated for the internal dose received. The results are collated by the NCRC and reported back to the regulator.

'''Clinical psychology''' is an integration of science, theory and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or [[mental illness|dysfunction]] and to promote subjective [[mental health|well-being]] and personal development.&lt;ref name="apa1"&gt;American Psychological Association, Division 12, [http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html About Clinical Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plante"&gt;[[Thomas G. Plante|Plante, Thomas]]. (2005). ''Contemporary Clinical Psychology.'' New York: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-47276-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to its practice are [[psychological testing|psychological assessment]], [[clinical formulation]], and [[psychotherapy]], although clinical psychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated [[mental health professional|mental health profession]].

The field is generally considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological [[clinic]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] by [[Lightner Witmer]]. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research),&lt;ref name="McFall2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McFall|first1=Richard M.|title=Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=2|issue=1|year=2006|pages=21–49|issn=1548-5943|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095245}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Scientist-Practitioner Model of Clinical Psychology|Ph.D. science-practitioner model]] (integrating research and practice), and the [[Doctor of Psychology|Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model]] (focusing on clinical practice). In the UK and the Republic of Ireland the [[Doctor of Clinical Psychology|Clinical Psychology Doctorate]] falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic. Clinical psychologists are expert in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations—[[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)]], and [[family therapy|systems or family therapy]].

==History==
{{main|History of psychology|History of psychotherapy}} {{further|Eastern philosophy and clinical psychology|Islamic psychology}}
[[Image:Phrenology1.jpg|thumb|right|Many 18th c. treatments for psychological distress were based on pseudo-scientific ideas, such as [[Phrenology]].]]
The earliest recorded approaches to assess and treat mental distress were a combination of religious, magical and/or medical perspectives.&lt;ref name="benjamin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin, Ludy|year=2007|title=A Brief History of Modern Psychology|location=Malden, MA|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|ISBN=978-1-4051-3206-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of such physicians included [[Patañjali]], [[Padmasambhava]],&lt;ref&gt;T. Clifford and Samuel Wiser (1984), ''Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]], [[Avicenna]],&lt;ref&gt;Afzal Iqbal and A. J. Arberry, ''The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi-Rumi|Rumi]].&lt;ref&gt;Rumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, one approach to study mental conditions and behavior was using [[phrenology]], the study of personality by examining the shape of the skull. Other popular treatments at that time included the study of the shape of the face ([[physiognomy]]) and [[Franz Anton Mesmer|Mesmer's]] treatment for mental conditions using magnets ([[mesmerism]]). [[Spiritualism]] and [[Phineas Quimby]]'s "mental healing" were also popular.&lt;ref name="benjamin2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benjamin, Ludy|year=2005|title=A history of clinical psychology as a profession in America (and a glimpse at its future)|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume= 1|pages=1–30|pmid=17716080|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.143758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods for treating mental illness, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. The study of mental illness was already being done in the developing fields of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] within the [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] movement.&lt;ref name="benjamin"/&gt; It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when [[Sigmund Freud]] was first developing his "[[psychoanalysis|talking cure]]" in [[Vienna]], that the first scientific application of clinical psychology began.

===Early clinical psychology===
[[File:Psychologicalcliniccover.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover of ''The Psychological Clinic,'' the first journal of clinical psychology, published in 1907 by [[Lightner Witmer]]]]
[[Image:Penn campus 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[University of Pennsylvania]] was the first to offer formal education in clinical psychology.]]
By the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for an applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on "pure" science as the only respectable practice.&lt;ref name="benjamin"/&gt; This changed when [[Lightner Witmer]] (1867–1956), a past student of [[Wundt]] and head of the psychology department at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer's opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name="heiden"&gt;Alessandri, M., Heiden, L., &amp; Dunbar-Welter, M. (1995). "History and Overview" in Heiden, Lynda &amp; Hersen, Michel (eds.), ''Introduction to Clinical Psychology''. New York: Plenum Press. {{ISBN|0-306-44877-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, ''The Psychological Clinic'', where he coined the term "clinical psychology", defined as "the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change".&lt;ref name="compass"&gt;Compas, Bruce &amp; Gotlib, Ian. (2002). ''Introduction to Clinical Psychology.'' New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Higher Education. {{ISBN|0-07-012491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was slow to follow Witmer's example, but by 1914, there were 26 similar clinics in the U.S.&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, Rand. (1999). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec99/ss12.html Clinical psychology born and raised in controversy.] ''APA Monitor'', 30(11).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] and [[neurology|neurologists]].&lt;ref name="routh"&gt;{{cite book|author=Routh, Donald|year=1994|title=Clinical psychology since 1917: Science, practice, and organization|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|ISBN=0-306-44452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at [[psychological assessment]]. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during [[World War I]] with the development of two intelligence tests, ''Army Alpha'' and ''Army Beta'' (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits.&lt;ref name="benjamin2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heiden"/&gt; Due in large part to the success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of clinical psychology for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.

===Early professional organizations===
The field began to organize under the name "clinical psychology" in 1917 with the founding of the American Association of Clinical Psychology. This only lasted until 1919, after which the [[American Psychological Association]] (founded by [[G. Stanley Hall]] in 1892) developed a section on Clinical Psychology, which offered certification until 1927.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; Growth in the field was slow for the next few years when various unconnected psychological organizations came together as the American Association of Applied Psychology in 1930, which would act as the primary forum for psychologists until after World War II when the APA reorganized.&lt;ref name="apa100"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=American Psychological Association|year=1999|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec99/ss13.html|title= APA: Uniting psychologists for more than 100 years|magazine=APA Monitor Online|volume=30|issue=11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001021204931/http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec99/ss13.html|archivedate=October 21, 2000|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the APA created what is now called Division 12, its division of clinical psychology, which remains a leading organization in the field. Psychological societies and associations in other English-speaking countries developed similar divisions, including in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

===World War II and the integration of treatment===

When [[World War II]] broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. As soldiers began to return from combat, psychologists started to notice symptoms of psychological trauma labeled "shell shock" (eventually to be termed [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]) that were best treated as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="heiden"/&gt; Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition.&lt;ref name="reisman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reisman, John|year=1991|title=A History of Clinical Psychology|location=UK|publisher=Taylor Francis|ISBN=1-56032-188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, female psychologists (who were excluded from the war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving young mothers advice on child rearing.&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt; After the war, the [[Veterans Administration]] in the U.S. made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists to help treat the thousands of veterans needing care. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt;

WWII helped bring dramatic changes to clinical psychology, not just in America but internationally as well. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 [[Scientist–practitioner model|scientist-practitioner model]], known today as the ''Boulder Model'', for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Routh, Donald|year=2000|title=Clinical Psychology Training: A History of Ideas and Practices Prior to 1946|journal=American Psychologist|volume=55|issue=2|pages=236–41|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.2.236|pmid=10717971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical psychology in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the [[National Health Service]]&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hall, John|author2=Llewelyn, Susan|lastauthoramp=y|year=2006|title=What is Clinical Psychology?|edition=4th|location=UK|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0-19-856689-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the [[British Psychological Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henry, David|year=1959|title=Clinical psychology abroad|journal=American Psychologist|volume=14|issue=9|pages=601–604|doi=10.1037/h0038711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the Doctor of Psychology degree===
By the 1960s, psychotherapy had become embedded within clinical psychology, but for many the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the [[University of Illinois]] starting in 1968.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Murray, Bridget|year=2000|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed1.html|title=The degree that almost wasn't: The PsyD comes of age|magazine=Monitor on Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008102440/http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan00/ed1.aspx|archivedate=October 8, 2010|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the [[Vail Conference]] on Professional Training in Psychology, the [[practitioner–scholar model]] of clinical psychology—or ''Vail Model''—resulting in the Doctor of Psychology ([[Psy.D.]]) degree was recognized.&lt;ref name="norcrosspsyd"&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=Norcross, J.|author2=Castle, P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|url=http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp|title=Appreciating the Psy.D: The Facts|magazine=[[Eye on Psi Chi]]|volume=7|issue=1|pages=22–26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060927062930/http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp|archivedate=2006-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name="murray"/&gt; Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.&lt;ref name="norcrosspsyd"/&gt;

===A changing profession===
Since the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Menninger, Roy|author2=Nemiah, John|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=American psychiatry after World War II: 1944-1994|location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Psychiatric Press|ISBN=0-88048-866-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is [[health psychology]], the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade.&lt;ref name="benjamin2"/&gt; Other major changes include the impact of [[managed care]] on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication.

==Professional practice==
Clinical psychologists engage in a wide range of activities. Some focus solely on [[research]] into the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]], [[Psychotherapy|treatment]], or cause of [[mental illness]] and related conditions. Some teach, whether in a [[medical school]] or [[hospital]] setting, or in an academic department (e.g., psychology department) at an [[University|institution of higher education]]. The majority of clinical psychologists engage in some form of clinical practice, with professional services including psychological assessment, provision of psychotherapy, development and administration of clinical programs, and [[forensic psychology|forensics]] (e.g., providing expert testimony in a [[legal proceeding]]).&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt;

In clinical practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Clinical psychologists who provide clinical services may also choose to specialize. Some specializations are codified and credentialed by regulatory agencies within the country of practice.&lt;ref&gt;American Board of Professional Psychology, [http://www.abpp.org/abpp_certification_specialties.htm Specialty Certification in Professional Psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214135515/http://www.abpp.org/abpp_certification_specialties.htm |date=2006-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States such specializations are credentialed by the [[American Board of Professional Psychology]] (ABPP).

==Training and certification to practice==

Clinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deakin.edu.au/hmnbs/psychology/pdf-docs/pathways-melb.pdf Pathways to register as a psychologist including clinical psychologist in Australia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819231047/http://www.deakin.edu.au/hmnbs/psychology/pdf-docs/pathways-melb.pdf |date=August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html|title=Page Not Found|author=|date=|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in [[scientist-practitioner model|Ph.D.]] programs—a model that emphasizes research—with the other half in [[Psy.D.]] programs, which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).&lt;ref name="norcrosspsyd"/&gt; Both models are accredited by the [[American Psychological Association]]&lt;ref&gt;APA. (2005). [http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/qrg_doctoral.html Guidelines and Principles for Accreditation of Programs in Professional Psychology: Quick Reference Guide to Doctoral Programs].&lt;/ref&gt; and many other English-speaking psychological societies. A smaller number of schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a [[Masters degree]], which usually take two to three years post-Bachelors.

In the U.K., clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (D.Clin.Psych.), which is a practitioner [[doctorate]] with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time salaried program sponsored by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) and based in universities and the NHS. Entry into these programs is highly competitive, and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. It is not unusual for applicants to apply several times before being accepted onto a training course as only about one-fifth of applicants are accepted each year.&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire, K. &amp; Pilgrim, D. (2004). ''A short introduction to clinical psychology.'' London; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-4768-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clinical psychology doctoral degrees are accredited by the [[British Psychological Society]] and the Health Professions Council ([[health professions council|HPC]]). The [[health professions council|HPC]] is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. Those who successfully complete clinical psychology doctoral degrees are eligible to apply for registration with the HPC as a clinical psychologist.

The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the U.S. states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:&lt;ref name="ASPPB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asppb.org/|title=Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards|accessdate=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Graduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree
#Completion of supervised clinical experience or internship
#Passing a written examination and, in some states, an oral examination

All U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination.&lt;ref name="ASPPB"/&gt; Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained though various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. Clinical psychologists require the Psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), [[Licensed Professional Counselor]] (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychotherapyguild.com/disciplines.html|title=Professional Disciplines|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.K. registration as a clinical psychologist with the Health Professions Council [[health professions council|(HPC)]] is necessary. The [[health professions council|HPC]] is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the U.K. In the U.K. the following titles are restricted by law "registered psychologist" and "practitioner psychologist"; in addition the specialist title "clinical psychologist" is also restricted by law.

==Assessment==
An important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is [[psychological assessment]], and there are indications that as many as 91% of [[psychologist]]s engage in this core clinical practice.&lt;ref name="groth"&gt;Groth-Marnat, G. (2003). ''Handbook of Psychological Assessment,'' 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-471-41979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming [[hypotheses]] about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than [[diagnoses]]) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination.&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt;

===Measurement domains===
There exist hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high [[validity (psychometric)|validity]] (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and [[reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] (i.e., consistency). These measures generally fall within one of several categories, including the following:
*'''Intelligence &amp; achievement tests''' – These tests are designed to measure certain specific kinds of cognitive functioning (often referred to as [[intelligence quotient|IQ]]) in comparison to a norming-group. These tests, such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC-IV]], attempt to measure such traits as general knowledge, verbal skill, memory, attention span, logical reasoning, and visual/spatial perception. Several tests have been shown to predict accurately certain kinds of performance, especially scholastic.&lt;ref name="groth"/&gt;
*'''Personality tests''' – [[Personality test|Tests of personality]] aim to describe patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings. They generally fall within two categories: [[objective test|objective]] and [[projective test|projective]]. Objective measures, such as the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]], are based on restricted answers—such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale—which allow for computation of scores that can be compared to a normative group. Projective tests, such as the [[Rorschach inkblot test]], allow for open-ended answers, often based on ambiguous stimuli. 
*'''Neuropsychological tests''' – [[Neuropsychological tests]] consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure psychological functions known to be linked to a particular [[brain]] structure or pathway. They are typically used to assess impairment after an injury or illness known to affect [[neurocognitive]] functioning, or when used in research, to contrast neuropsychological abilities across experimental groups. 
*'''Clinical observation''' – Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior. The clinical interview is a vital part of assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the [[mental status examination]], which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.&lt;ref name="groth"/&gt;

===Diagnostic impressions===
{{See also|Mental disorder}}

After assessment, clinical psychologists may provide a [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] impression. Many countries use the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (ICD-10) while the U.S. most often uses the ''[[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. Both are [[nosology|nosological]] systems that largely assume categorical disorders diagnosed through the application of sets of criteria including [[symptom]]s and signs.&lt;ref name="jablensky"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jablensky, Assen|year=2005|title=Categories, dimensions and prototypes: Critical issues for psychiatric classification|journal=Psychopathology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=201–5|pmid=16145275|doi=10.1159/000086092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several new models are being discussed, including a "dimensional model" based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor model]] of personality&lt;ref name="jablensky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="widiger"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Widiger, Thomas|author2=Trull, Timothy|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Plate tectonics in the classification of personality disorder: shifting to a dimensional model|journal=American Psychologist|volume=62|issue=2|pages=71–83|pmid=17324033|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.62.2.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a "psychosocial model", which would take changing, intersubjective states into greater account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mundt, Christoph|author2=Backenstrass, Matthias|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title= Psychotherapy and classification: Psychological, psychodynamic, and cognitive aspects|journal=Psychopathology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=219–22|pmid=16145279|doi=10.1159/000086096}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proponents of these models claim that they would offer greater diagnostic flexibility and clinical utility without depending on the medical concept of illness.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, they also admit that these models are not yet robust enough to gain widespread use, and should continue to be developed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Clinical psychologists do not tend to diagnose, but rather use ''[[clinical formulation|formulation]]''—an individualized map of the difficulties that the patient or client faces, encompassing predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kinderman, P.|author2=Lobban, F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Evolving formulations: Sharing complex information with clients|journal=Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy|volume=28|issue=3|pages=307–310|doi=10.1017/S1352465800003118|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27557001_Evolving_formulations_Sharing_complex_information_with_clients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical v. mechanical prediction ===
Clinical assessment can be characterized as a [[prediction]] problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior.&lt;ref name="GroveMeehl1996"/&gt; For example, many [[psychotherapy|therapy]] decisions are made on the basis of what a [[clinical psychologist|clinician]] expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., [[psychological test]] results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, [[X-ray]], etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, [[diagnosis]], or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an [[algorithm]]ic, or "mechanical" fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., [[therapeutic effect|treatment response]]). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm.&lt;ref name="GroveMeehl1996"/&gt; The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]]. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|decision-making]] processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.&lt;ref name="Meehl1954"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Meehl|title=Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Echo Point Books &amp; Media|isbn=978-0-9638784-9-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GroveMeehl1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grove|first1=William M.|last2=Meehl|first2=Paul E.|title=Comparative efficiency of informal (subjective, impressionistic) and formal (mechanical, algorithmic) prediction procedures: The clinical-statistical controversy.|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law| volume=2| issue=2|year=1996| pages=293–323| issn=1076-8971| doi=10.1037/1076-8971.2.2.293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What has come to be called the "clinical versus statistical prediction" debate was first described in detail in 1954 by [[Paul Meehl]],&lt;ref name="Meehl1954" /&gt; where he explored the claim that mechanical (formal, algorithmic) methods of data combination could outperform clinical (e.g., subjective, informal, "in the clinician's head") methods when such combinations are used to arrive at a prediction of behavior. Meehl concluded that mechanical modes of combination performed as well or better than clinical modes.&lt;ref name="Meehl1954"/&gt; Subsequent [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of studies that directly compare mechanical and clinical predictions have born out Meehl's 1954 conclusions.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grove | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Zald | first2 = D.H. | last3 = Hallberg | first3 = A.M. | last4 = Lebow | first4 = B. | last5 = Snitz | first5 = E. | last6 = Nelson | first6 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Clinical versus mechanical prediction: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Assessment | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 19–30 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.12.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=M.

==Intervention==
{{main|Psychotherapy}}
Psychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabbard"/&gt;

Clinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy ([[cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]]) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a [[psychoanalyst]] might encourage [[free association (psychology)|free association]], while a psychologist trained in [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt;
*Insight – emphasis is on gaining greater understanding of the motivations underlying one's thoughts and feelings (e.g. psychodynamic therapy)
*Action – focus is on making changes in how one thinks and acts (e.g. [[brief therapy|solution focused therapy]], cognitive behavioral therapy)
*In-session – interventions center on the here-and-now interaction between client and therapist (e.g. humanistic therapy, Gestalt therapy)
*Out-session – a large portion of therapeutic work is intended to happen outside of session (e.g. bibliotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy)
 
The methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. brief or long-term therapy).&lt;ref name="gabbard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laroche"&gt;{{cite journal|author=La Roche, Martin|year=2005|title=The cultural context and the psychotherapeutic process: Toward a culturally sensitive psychotherapy |journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|volume=15|issue=2|pages=169–185|doi=10.1037/1053-0479.15.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four main schools===
Many clinical psychologists are [[Integrative psychotherapy|integrative]] or [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] and draw from the evidence base across different models of therapy in an integrative way, rather than using a single specific model.

In the UK, clinical psychologists have to show competence in at least two models of therapy, including CBT, to gain their doctorate. The [[British Psychological Society]] Division of Clinical Psychology has been vocal about the need to follow the evidence base rather than being wedded to a single model of therapy.

In the USA, intervention applications and research are dominated in training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: [[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]], [[behavioral]]/[[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral]], and [[family therapy|systems or family therapy]].&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt;

====Psychodynamic====
{{main|Psychodynamic psychotherapy}}
The psychodynamic perspective developed out of the [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]]. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious—to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various [[defense mechanisms|defenses]] used to keep them in check.&lt;ref name="gabbard"&gt;Gabbard, Glen. (2005). ''Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice'', 4th Ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|1-58562-185-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essential tools of the psychoanalytic process are the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]] and an examination of the client's [[transference]] towards the therapist, defined as the tendency to take unconscious thoughts or emotions about a significant person (e.g. a parent) and "transfer" them onto another person. Major variations on Freudian psychoanalysis practiced today include [[self psychology]], [[ego psychology]], and [[object relations theory]]. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term ''psychodynamic psychology'', with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client's current psychological state.&lt;ref name="gabbard"/&gt;

====Humanistic====
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}
Humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the [[person-centered psychotherapy|person-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]] (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and [[existential psychology]] developed by [[Viktor Frankl]] and [[Rollo May]].&lt;ref name="plante"/&gt; Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement—congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McMillan, Michael|year=2004|title=The Person-Centred Approach to Therapeutic Change|location=London, Thousand Oaks|publisher=SAGE Publications|ISBN=0-7619-4868-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[intersubjective|intersubjectivity]] and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rowan, John|year=2001|title=Ordinary Ecstasy: The Dialectics of Humanistic Psychology|location=London, UK|publisher=Brunner-Routledge|ISBN=0-415-23633-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called ''self-actualization''. From 1980, [[Hans-Werner Gessmann]] integrated the ideas of humanistic psychology into group psychotherapy as ''humanistic psychodrama''.&lt;ref&gt;Gessmann, Hans-Werner (2013;2), Humanistische Psychologie und Humanistisches Psychodrama. In: Humanistisches Psychodama Band 4, Verlag des PIB Duisburg, pp. 27–84.&lt;/ref&gt; According to humanistic thinking,&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schneider, K.|author2=Bugental, J.|author3=Pierson, J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=The handbook of humanistic psychology: leading edges in theory, research, and practice|edition=2nd|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=Sage Publications|ISBN=978-0-7619-2121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.

====Behavioral and cognitive behavioral====
{{main|Cognitive behavioral therapy|Behaviour therapy}}
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed from the combination of [[cognitive therapy]] and [[rational emotive behavior therapy]], both of which grew out of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[behaviorism]]. CBT is based on the theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through ''schemas'' or ''beliefs'') can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beck, A.|author2=Davis, D.|author3=Freeman, A.|year=2007|title=Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders|edition=2nd |location= New York|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-476-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many techniques used, such as [[systematic desensitization]], [[socratic questioning]], and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including [[dialectical behavior therapy|dialectic behavior therapy]] and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|year=2006|quote=Albert Ellis is often referred as the "grandfather" of CBT for his influential work in this field.|url=http://www.aabt.org/What%20are/What%20Are%20Behavioral%20and%20Cognitive%20Therapies.html|title=What is CBT?|accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior therapy is a rich tradition. It is well researched with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in [[behaviorism]]. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict the way we think and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called [[applied behavior analysis|applied behavior analysts]] or behavioral health counselors. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[anxiety disorders]]. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Donohue W, Ferguson KE |year=2006 |title= Evidence-based practice in psychology and behavior analysis |journal= Behav Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–50|format=PDF|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/7/3/335.pdf&amp;productCode=pa |doi=10.1037/h0100155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including [[functional analysis (psychology)]], which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], [[functional analytic psychotherapy]], including [[dialectical behavior therapy|dialectic behavior therapy]] and [[behavioral activation]]. In addition, specific techniques such as [[contingency management]] and [[exposure therapy]] have come from this tradition.

====Systems or family therapy====
{{main|Family therapy}}
Systems or [[family therapy]] works with couples and families, and emphasizes family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. The central focus tends to be on interpersonal dynamics, especially in terms of how change in one person will affect the entire system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bitter, J.|author2=Corey, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|chapter=Family Systems Therapy|editor=Gerald Corey|title=Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy|location=Belmost, CA|publisher=Brooks/Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy is therefore conducted with as many significant members of the "system" as possible. Goals can include improving communication, establishing healthy roles, creating alternative narratives, and addressing problematic behaviors.

===Other therapeutic perspectives===
{{see also|List of psychotherapies}}
There exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy—the list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client.

*'''Existential''' – [[Existential therapy|Existential psychotherapy]] postulates that people are largely free to choose who we are and how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client’s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.&lt;ref&gt;Van Deurzen, Emmy. (2002). ''Existential Counseling &amp; Psychotherapy in Practice.'' London; Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-6223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gestalt''' - [[Gestalt therapy]] was primarily founded by [[Fritz Perls]] in the 1950s. This therapy is perhaps best known for using techniques designed to increase self-awareness, the best-known perhaps being the "empty chair technique." Such techniques are intended to explore resistance to "authentic contact", resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete "unfinished business".&lt;ref name="woldt"&gt;Woldt, Ansel and Toman, Sarah. (2005). ''Gestalt Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice''. Thousand Oaks, CA.: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|0-7619-2791-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Postmodern''' – Postmodern psychology says that the experience of reality is a subjective construction built upon language, social context, and history, with no essential truths.&lt;ref&gt;Slife, B., Barlow, S. and Williams, R. (2001). ''Critical issues in psychotherapy: translating new ideas into practice.'' London: SAGE. {{ISBN|0-7619-2080-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since "mental illness" and "mental health" are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blatner Adam | year = 1997 | title = The Implications of Postmodernism for Psychotherapy | url = http://www.blatner.com/adam/level2/pmodpsy198.htm | journal = Individual Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 476–482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include [[narrative therapy]], [[solution focused brief therapy|solution-focused therapy]], and [[coherence therapy]].
*'''Transpersonal''' – The [[transpersonal psychology|transpersonal perspective]] places a stronger focus on the [[spirituality|spiritual]] facet of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Boorstein, Seymour. (1996). ''Transpersonal Psychotherapy.'' Albany: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-2835-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] states of consciousness. It also is concerned with helping clients achieve their highest potential.
*'''Multiculturalism''' – Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration.&lt;ref name="laroche"/&gt; Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of [[acculturation]] can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Mark|year=2005|title=Learning the Art of Helping|edition=3rd|chapter=Helping Someone Who is Different|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=0-13-111753-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Price, Michael|year=2008|title= Culture matters: Accounting for clients' backgrounds and values makes for better treatment|magazine=Monitor on Psychology|volume= 39|issue=7|pages=52–53|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/07-08/culture.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Feminism''' – [[Feminist therapy]] is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hill, Marcia|author2=Ballou, Mary|year=2005|title=The foundation and future of feminist therapy|location=New York|publisher=Haworth Press|isbn=0-7890-0201-9|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Positive psychology''' – [[Positive psychology]] is the scientific study of human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of [[Martin Seligman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Seligman, Martin|author2=Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly|year=2000|title=Positive psychology: An introduction|journal=American Psychologist|volume=55|issue=1|pages=5–14|pmid=11392865|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.5|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; then president of the APA. The [[history of psychology]] shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing [[mental illness]] rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology's main focus, therefore, is to increase one's positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as optimism about the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Snyder, C.|author2=Lopez, S.|year=2001|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|location=New York, Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|ISBN=0-19-513533-4|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Linley, Alex|displayauthors=etal|year=2006|title=Positive psychology: Past, present, and (possible) future|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–16|url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/positive.pdf|doi=10.1080/17439760500372796|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman's three components of happiness—positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)—positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Seligman, M.|author2=Rashid, T.|author3=Parks, A.|year=2006|title=Positive Psychotherapy. |journal=American Psychologist|volume=61|issue=8|pages=774–788|lastauthoramp=y|pmid=17115810|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.61.8.774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===
{{main|Integrative psychotherapy}}
In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as [[neuroscience]], [[behavioral genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[psychopharmacology]]. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norcross, John|author2=Goldfried, Marvin|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=The Future of Psychotherapy Integration: A Roundtable|journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|volume=15|issue=4|pages=392–471|doi=10.1037/1053-0479.15.4.392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional ethics==
{{globalize/US|date=February 2016}}
The field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. In the U.S., professional ethics are largely defined by the APA ''Code of Conduct'', which is often used by states to define licensing requirements. The APA Code generally sets a higher standard than that which is required by law as it is designed to guide responsible behavior, the protection of clients, and the improvement of individuals, organizations, and society.&lt;ref name="apa3"&gt;APA. (2003). ''[http://www.apa.org/ethics/code2002.html Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct].'' Retrieved July 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code is applicable to all psychologists in both research and applied fields.

The APA Code is based on five principles: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence, Fidelity and Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, and Respect for People's Rights and Dignity.&lt;ref name="apa3"/&gt; Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy.

In the UK the [[British Psychological Society]] has published a Code of Conduct and Ethics for clinical psychologists. This has four key areas: Respect, Competence, Responsibility and Integrity.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.bps.org.uk/sites/beta.bps.org.uk/files/Policy%20-%20Files/Code%20of%20Ethics%20and%20Conduct%20%282009%29.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other European professional organisations have similar codes of conduct and ethics.

==Comparison with other mental health professions==
{{See also|Mental health professional}}

===Psychiatry===
[[File:Prozac.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Fluoxetine hydrochloride]], branded by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]] as Prozac, is a [[antidepressant]] [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] prescribed by [[physician]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s, and some [[nurse]]s.]]
Although clinical psychologists and [[psychiatrist]]s can be said to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the [[medical model]] to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]] as the chief method of addressing the illness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Graybar, S.|author2= Leonard, L.|year=2005|title=In Defense of Listening|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=59|issue=1|pages=1–19|pmid=15895765}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although many also employ [[psychotherapy]] as well. Psychiatrists and [[medical psychology|medical psychologists]] (who are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and [[EEG]]s, and may order brain imaging studies such as [[computed tomography|CT]] or [[computed tomography|CAT]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and [[positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning.

Clinical psychologists generally do not [[medical prescription|prescribe]] medication, although there is a growing movement for psychologists to have [[prescriptive authority for psychologists movement|prescribing privileges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klusman, Lawrence|year=2001|title=Prescribing Psychologists and Patients' Medical Needs; Lessons From Clinical Psychiatry|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=32|issue=5|pages=496–500|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.32.5.496|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These medical privileges require additional training and education. To date, [[medical psychology|medical psychologists]] may prescribe psychotropic medications in Guam, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, New Mexico, Louisiana, the Public Health Service, the Indian Health Service, and the United States Military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Halloway, Jennifer|year=2004|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jun04/gaining.aspx|title=Gaining prescriptive knowledge|magazine=Monitor on Psychology|volume=35|issue=6|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling psychology===
[[Counseling psychology|Counseling psychologists]] undergo the same level of rigor in study and use many of the same interventions and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists helped people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;&lt;ref name="compass"/&gt; However, that distinction has faded over time, and of the counseling psychologists who do not go into academia (which does not involve treatment or diagnosis), the majority of counseling psychologists treat mental illness alongside clinical psychologists. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling.

Counseling psychology as a field values multiculturalism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div17.org/about-cp/what-is-counseling-psychology/|title=What is Counseling Psychology - Society of Counseling Psychology, Division 17|author=|date=|website=div17.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social advocacy, often stimulating research in multicultural issues. There are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. Counseling psychologists tend to be more frequently employed in university counseling centers compared to hospitals and private practice for clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norcross, John |year=2000 |url=http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_73.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20030415061149/http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_73.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-04-15 |title=Clinical versus counseling psychology: What's the diff? |journal=Eye on Psi Chi |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, counseling and clinical psychologists can be employed in a variety of settings, with a large degree of overlap (prisons, colleges, community mental health, non-profits, corporations, private practice, hospitals and Veterans Affairs). Distinctions between the two fields continue to fade.

===School psychology===
[[School psychology|School psychologists]] are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. In the U.K., they are known as "educational psychologists". Like clinical (and counseling) psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Common degrees include the [[Educational Specialist|Educational Specialist Degree]] (Ed.S.), [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.), and [[Doctor of Education]] (Ed.D.).

Traditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Silva, Arlene|year=2003|url=http://www.nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx|title=Who Are School Psychologists?|publisher=National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|url=http://www.apa.org/crsppp/schpsych.html|title=Archival Description of School Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical social work===
[[Social work]]ers provide a variety of services, generally concerned with social problems, their causes, and their solutions. With specific training, clinical social workers may also provide psychological counseling (in the U.S. and Canada), in addition to more traditional social work. The Masters in Social Work in the U.S. is a two-year, sixty credit program that includes at least a one-year practicum (two years for clinicians).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cswe.org/NR/rdonlyres/111833A0-C4F5-475C-8FEB-EA740FF4D9F1/0/EPAS.pdf {{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational therapy===
[[Occupational therapy]]—often abbreviated OT—is the "use of productive or creative activity in the treatment or rehabilitation of physically, cognitively, or emotionally disabled people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition |year=2000 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/19/O0021900.html |title=Occupational Therapy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208123505/http://www.bartleby.com/61/19/O0021900.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, [[cognitive]] and environmental components of illness and injury. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT's use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities.

==Criticisms and controversies==
Clinical psychology is a diverse field and there have been recurring tensions over the degree to which clinical practice should be limited to treatments supported by empirical research.&lt;ref name="observing"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pilgram, D.|author2=Treacher, A. |lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Clinical Psychology Observed|publisher=Routledge|location=London &amp; USA/Canada|ISBN=0-415-04632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some evidence showing that all the major therapeutic orientations are about of equal effectiveness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leichsenring, Falk|author2=Leibing, Eric|lastauthoramp=y|year=2003|title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=160|issue=7|pages=1223–1233|pmid=12832233|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reisner, Andrew|year=2005|title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change|journal=The Psychological Record|volume=55|issue=3|pages=377–400|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&amp;context=tpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; there remains much debate about the efficacy of various forms treatment in use in clinical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lilienfeld, Scott|displayauthors=etal|year=2014|title=Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press|ISBN=978-1462517510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that clinical psychology has rarely allied itself with [[consumer/survivor movement|client groups]] and tends to individualize problems to the neglect of wider economic, political and social inequality issues that may not be the responsibility of the client.&lt;ref name="observing"/&gt; It has been argued that therapeutic practices are inevitably bound up with power inequalities, which can be used for good and bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kyuken, W.|title=Power and clinical psychology: a model for resolving power-related ethical dilemmas|journal=Ethics Behav.|year=1999|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–37|pmid=11657486|doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0901_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[critical psychology]] movement has argued that clinical psychology, and other professions making up a "psy complex", often fail to consider or address inequalities and power differences and can play a part in the social and moral control of disadvantage, deviance and unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Smail, D. |url=http://www.davidsmail.freeuk.com/introfra.htm|title=Power, Responsibility and Freedom|type=Internet Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispn-psych.org/docs/11-01prescriptive-authority.pdf|author=International Society of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses|year=2001|title=''Response to Clinical Psychologists Prescribing Psychotropic Medications''|accessdate=2007-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614091424/http://www.ispn-psych.org/docs/11-01prescriptive-authority.pdf|archive-date=2007-06-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An October 2009 editorial in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggests that a large number of clinical psychology practitioners in the United States consider scientific evidence to be "less important than their personal – that is, subjective – clinical experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Psychology: a reality check|type=Editorial|journal=Nature |page=847|date=15 October 2009|doi=10.1038/461847a|volume=461}} Published online 14 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''commentary of a philosophical text''' is the analysis of a philosophical text that is undertaken from different angles and points of view, and that enables the study of its nature and characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Frank. (1998). From Metaphysics to Ethics: A Defense of Conceptual Analysis. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentary has been a very important and useful tool. A large portion of the philosophical schools was originated through the analysis that different commentarists carried out of renowned philosophical texts. In [[ancient Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], renowned [[schools of thought]] were started by commenting on texts from [[Plato]] and [[Aristoteles]]. A significant portion of [[Thomas Aquinas]] philosophical ideas were the result of commentaries to some of Aristoteles ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, E. &amp; Laurence, S. (2006). "Concepts". The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentary of philosophical text tracks its roots to the importance and relevance that philosophy assigns to the analysis of the language and the interpretation of texts.

The '''conservation and restoration of human remains''' involves the [[Preventive conservation|long-term preservation and care]] of human remains in various forms which exist within [[Collection (artwork)|museum collections]]. This category can include [[bones]] and [[soft tissue]]s as well as ashes, hair, and teeth.&lt;ref name="Complying with NAGPRA" /&gt; Given the organic nature of the human body, special steps must be taken to halt the deterioration process and maintain the integrity of the remains in their current state.&lt;ref name="Pouliot"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Pouliot|author1-first=Bruno P.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|chapter=Organic Materials|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover|date=2000|pages=45–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of museum artifacts have great merit as tools for education and scientific research, yet also have unique challenges from a cultural and ethical standpoint. Conservation of human remains within museum collections is most often undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]&lt;ref name="Wesche"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wesche|editor1-first=Anne|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|date=2013|publisher=Deutscher Museumsbund e.V.|location=Germany|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[archaeologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan|page=10|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other specialists related to this area of conservation include [[Osteology|osteologists]] and [[taxidermists]].

== Types of human remains found in museum collections ==
Museum collections contain human remains in many forms, including entire preserved bodies, discrete parts of the anatomy, and even art and artifacts created out of human body parts.

[[File:Human skull.jpg|thumb|left|Human skull on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]] in Oklahoma City.]]

=== Osteological specimens ===

Museum collections, especially those of the natural history variety, often contain [[osteological]] specimens derived from humans. These can include individual [[bones]], bone fragments, entire [[skeletons]], and [[teeth]] from both ancient and contemporary sources. Reconstruction of bone fragments should be conducted with great care and consideration. Due to the porous nature of bones, few adhering substances can be used on bone with an adequate level of reversibility, which is a key component of all conservation treatments.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, pp117-118"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=LaRoche|author1-first=Cheryl J.|author2-last=McGowan|author2-first=Gary S.|title=The Ethical Dilemma Facing Conservation: Care and Treatment of Human Skeletal Remains and Mortuary Objects|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=35, No. 2|pages=117–118|date=1996|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/davidson/arch%20of%20death/Week%2014/McGowan%20and%20LaRoche%201996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mummies and preserved bodies ===
The word "[[mummy]]" can refer to both intentionally and naturally preserved bodies and is not limited to one geographic area or culture.&lt;ref name="David, p113"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=David|author1-first=A. Rosalie|title=Benefits and Disadvantages of Some Conservation Treatments for Egyptian Mummies|date=2001|journal=Chungara: Revista de Antropología Chilena|page=113|publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca|jstor=27802173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage of mummified remains can be caused by several main factors, including poor environmental conditions, physical damage, and improper methods of preservation that have been applied in the past.&lt;ref name="David, p113" /&gt;

==== Mummies ====
[[Mummies]], though most often thought of as an Egyptian phenomenon, exist in many cultures and have been found on nearly every continent. For examples of non-Egyptian mummies, see "[[Mummies#Mummification in other cultures|Mummification in other cultures]]".

Controlling environmental conditions is highly important in preserving the integrity of mummies. Fungi, pests, and  microorganisms that cause decay are some of the possible repercussions of inadequate storage and environmental factors. There are a number of ways to mitigate the effects of improper conditions, however. Methods of stabilizing mummies and halting the deterioration process include [[inert gas]] control, where the mummy is placed in a chamber or bag into which [[fumigants]] are introduced; wet sterilization, where solutions are applied to the mummy to repel insects and the growth of fungi; controlled drying, which reduces the relative humidity in order to stop growth of microorganisms; and ultra-violet [[irradiation]], which affects microorganisms by altering their cells.&lt;ref name="David, p114"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=David|author1-first=A. Rosalie|title=Benefits and Disadvantages of Some Conservation Treatments for Egyptian Mummies|date=2001|journal=Chungara: Revista de Antropología Chilena|page=114|publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca|jstor=27802173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some previous treatments which were thought to help in the preservation of mummified remains but ultimately led to further damage include curing the remains by smoking them and applying solutions of copper salts to exposed skin.&lt;ref name="David, p113" /&gt;

For examples and images of mummy preservation, see the [http://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/ Artifact Lab] at the [[Penn Museum]], which provides insight into ongoing conservation projects for mummies in their collection and their related artifacts.

==== Bog bodies ====
[[File:Huldremosekvinnan.jpg|thumb|Bog body of the Huldremose Woman, on display at the [[National Museum of Denmark]].]]
[[Bog Body|Bog Bodies]] are human remains which have been found in peat bogs in various locations around the world. They have been preserved naturally in varying degrees due to the specific conditions of peat bogs. Despite their natural preservation, these remains are sensitive to deterioration after being removed from their original locations. Freeze-drying is an accepted method of preserving bog bodies in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Omar|author1-first=S.|author2-last=McCord|author2-first=M.|author3-last=Daniels|author3-first=V.|title=The Conservation of Bog Bodies by Freeze-Drying|date=1989|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=34, No. 3|pages=101–109|publisher=Maney Publishing|jstor=1506225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable bog body discoveries include the [[Tollund Man]] of Denmark, the [[Elling Woman]] of Denmark, the [[Cashel Man]] of Ireland, the [[Huldremose Woman]] of Denmark, the [[Girl of the Uchter Moor]] of Germany, the [[Lindow Man]] of England, and the [[Yde Girl]] of the Netherlands. For a more comprehensive list of examples, see [[List of bog bodies]].

A record of the preservation of the Tollund Man's head, which took place in 1951 and involved replacing the bog water in the cells with liquid paraffin wax, can be read on the [http://www.tollundman.dk/konservering.asp Tollund Man's website] hosted by the Silkeborg Public Library, [[Silkeborg Museum]], and Amtscentret for Undervisning.

=== Other human remains in museums ===
There are innumerable types of artifacts present in museum collections that include or are composed of human remains, some with great scientific or medical merit and others with great cultural importance. Not only do the body parts vary greatly, but their methods of preservation do as well.
[[File:A tattoo on a piece of human skin showing a lady Wellcome L0036394.jpg|thumb|One of the many preserved tattoos on a section of human skin in the [[Wellcome Collection]].]]

==== Soft tissues ====
Soft tissues are usually in some sort of state of preservation prior to entering a museum collection, but still require periodic care.

* Plastination: One method of preserving tissues is [[plastination]], invented by [[Gunther von Hagens]] and made famous by the exhibition [[Body Worlds]]. The process of plastination involves replacing the water and fat of a specimen with a curable polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=von Hagens|author1-first=Gunther|author2-last=Tiedemann|author2-first=Klaus|author3-last=Kriz|author3-first=Wilhelm|date=1987|title=The current potential of plastination|journal=Anatomy and Embryology|issue=175|volume=4|pages=411–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of preservation requires little upkeep in terms of conservation, outside of periodic surface cleaning. 
* Wet specimens: A more classic form of soft tissue preservation is in a solution of [[formaldehyde]], creating what is known as a wet specimen. The [[Mütter Museum]] in Philadelphia, PA has an extensive [http://muttermuseum.org/collections/wet-specimens/ collection of wet specimens] of human body parts, including both normal specimens and medical abnormalities. Care and hazards of wet specimens can be found on the website of the [http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/fluid-preserved-specimens American Museum of Natural History].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/fluid-preserved-specimens|title=Fluid Preserved Specimens|publisher=American Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Skin ====
Sections of human skin can be found in the collections of some museums. Some examples of this include books bound with human skin ([[anthropodermic bibliopegy]]) and preserved tattoos. The largest collection of the latter can be found in the [[Wellcome Collection]] at the [[Science Museum, London]].&lt;br /&gt;
American artist Andrew Krasnow has caused controversy in recent decades by creating pieces of contemporary art made of human skin. His works, which often make political statements, are composed of pieces of flesh from individuals who have donated their bodies to science. The skin itself has been preserved through the process of tanning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1-last=Johnson|author1-first=Andrew|title=Body art. Literally|publisher=Independent|date=23 October 2011|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/body-art-literally-1690128.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hair ====
Hair is considered human remains by some definitions, but not all. It is not uncommon within museum collections due to the trend of creating "hairwork", most popular during the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Hair Art|publisher=Leila's Hair Museum|url=http://www.leilashairmuseum.net/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locks of hair, hair wreaths, and jewelry made of hair are some of the most commonly found forms.

== Caring for human remains ==
Though there is great variety in human remains within museum collections as well as the ways in which they can be preserved, there are a number of best practices to be observed in the [[preventive care]] of these types of artifacts. Preventive care is the best method of preserving human remains in the long term, as active conservation work should be limited both by conservators' policy to interfere as little as possible and the beliefs of many indigenous tribes and groups who disapprove of altering human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|page=29|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the greatest threats to the long-term well being of human remains in museum collections is improper storage and packing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|page=34|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper storage of human remains is not only necessary for their physical preservation, but it also demonstrates the respect that sensitive materials such as these should be accorded.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p116"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=LaRoche|author1-first=Cheryl J.|author2-last=McGowan|author2-first=Gary S.|title=The Ethical Dilemma Facing Conservation: Care and Treatment of Human Skeletal Remains and Mortuary Objects|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=35, No. 2|page=116|date=1996|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/davidson/arch%20of%20death/Week%2014/McGowan%20and%20LaRoche%201996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal storage location for sacred artifacts and human remains is a designated space away from the rest of the collection; however, there are often many constraints which prevent this from being possible.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p53"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|page=53|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the minimum, ethical guidelines suggest that remains from different individuals should be stored in separate boxes or compartments from each other.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p52"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|pages=52|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally speaking, human remains are best preserved in cool, dark, dry conditions while wrapped in acid-free (non-buffered) tissue and packing materials.&lt;ref name="Preserving Ethnographic Objects"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Rose|author1-first=Carolyn L.|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|chapter=Preserving Ethnographic Objects|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, D.C.|date=1992|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporeal materials should not be stored in or near any wood or in any containers which previously housed wood due to potentially increased [[lignin]] levels, which produce an acid that can lead to the deterioration of DNA and proteins in the remains.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p52" /&gt; Excessive exposure to light should be avoided in order to prevent bleaching of materials, especially bone.&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt;

=== Temperature and relative humidity ===
Organic materials are porous by nature, which means that they are greatly affected by changes in the moisture levels of their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt; Overly moist conditions can lead to growth of fungi on protein materials like human remains, which is one of the most common risks they face.&lt;ref name="Preserving Ethnographic Objects" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, low-humidity conditions can potentially cause protein materials to crack, split, and shrink.&lt;ref name="Preserving Ethnographic Objects" /&gt;
Ideal storage conditions for bones is 35% to 55% relative humidity with minimal fluctuations,&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt; while ideal conditions for the preservation of mummies are 50 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 15 degrees Celsius) with a relative humidity of 40% to 55%.&lt;ref name="David, p113" /&gt;

=== Handling ===
Embrittlement is a risk for many human remains, and as a result handling should be limited. When possible, artifacts should be lifted by their storage container or tray. To avoid transfer of oils to the remains, nitrile or latex gloves should be worn during their handling. If a body is to be lifted, it must be supported under all of its appendages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Neilson|author1-first=Dixie|chapter=Object Handling|title=Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition|editor1-last=Buck|editor1-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Gilmore|editor2-first=Jean Allman|date=2010|pages=209–218|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cleaning ===
Cleaning of human remains varies by type. If necessary, surface cleaning of bone can be done with a very mild detergent and water solution, but bones should never be soaked in order to prevent dirt from becoming embedded in pores.&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt; The possibility of cleaning human remains is highly dependent on the fragility of the specimen.

== Cultural and ethical considerations ==
There are many challenges surrounding human remains accessioned by museums, including legal complications involved in dealing with human remains, involvement of living relatives or tribes, and potential repatriation and issues such as [[NAGPRA]].&lt;ref name="Complying with NAGPRA"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=McKeown|author1-first=C. Timothy|author2-last=Murphy|author2-first=Amanda|author3-last=Schansberg|author3-first=Jennifer|chapter=Complying with NAGPRA|title=Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition|editor1-last=Buck|editor1-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Gilmore|editor2-first=Jean Allman|date=2010|pages=449–457|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NAGPRA|The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] of 1990 requires any federal or federally-funded institution, with the exception of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], to submit full inventories of their Native American funerary and sacred objects and human remains and to repatriate these objects to their tribe of origin should a request be made to do so.&lt;ref name="Complying with NAGPRA" /&gt; Should a museum possess human remains which have a direct living relative or group (Native American or otherwise), it is their ethical obligation to involve these individuals in the care and treatment of the remains.&lt;ref name="Wesche, pp54-55"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|pages=54–55|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of human remains by museums can happen in a number of ways, some of which are considered to be unethical today. Many museums have human remains in their collections which have been there for over a hundred years, in which case they may likely have been acquired in ethically or morally unsound ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Edwards|author1-first=Alison|chapter=Care of Sacred and Culturally Sensitive Objects|title=Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition|editor1-last=Buck|editor1-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Gilmore|editor2-first=Jean Allman|date=2010|pages=408|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.45.5 | issue=45 | title=The Insta-Dead: The rhetoric of the human remains trade on Instagram | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | author=Huffer Damien, Graham Shawn }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most institutions and museum associations have their own policies on the acquisition of human remains. Some guidelines for the care of human remains including acceptable means of acquisition can be found below.

=== Scientific analyses ===
Cultural considerations can sometimes interfere with the conservation of human remains, particularly when it comes to physical and chemical analyses, which play an important role in their care.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p109"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=LaRoche|author1-first=Cheryl J.|author2-last=McGowan|author2-first=Gary S.|title=The Ethical Dilemma Facing Conservation: Care and Treatment of Human Skeletal Remains and Mortuary Objects|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=35, No. 2|page=109|date=1996|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/davidson/arch%20of%20death/Week%2014/McGowan%20and%20LaRoche%201996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing conducted on human remains, especially ancient ones, can include [[DNA testing]], [[Isotope analysis|isotope analyses]], and [[carbon 14 dating]].&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p109" /&gt; The benefits of such testing is sometimes outweighed by the cultural or sacred importance of the remains as well as the risk of damaging them too greatly.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p109" /&gt; According to the Deutscher Museumsbund, there are only three circumstances in which scientific research should be conducted on human remains:
# there is a great deal of scientific interest
# the human remains have a known provenance, and
# the method of acquisition of the human remains is no source for concern.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p55"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|pages=55|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Case study ====
The [[Kennewick Man]] is a notable example of human remains caught in a struggle between scientific merit and cultural traditions. Since his discovery in 1996, his fate has been the topic of great controversy. As one of the oldest well-preserved ancient skeletons found in America, scientists are eager to conduct various testing on the remains. Native American groups, however, have been adamantly calling for his repatriation and reburial, as per their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1-last=Preston|author1-first=Douglas|date=September 2014|title=The Kennewick Man Finally Freed to Share His Secrets|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/kennewick-man-finally-freed-share-his-secrets-180952462/?no-ist=&amp;preview=_page%3D3_page%3D3_no-ist_page%3D2_page%3D2_page%3D2_page%3D2&amp;page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12105">The '''Critical Incident Technique''' (or '''CIT''') is a set of [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] used for collecting direct observations of [[human behavior]] that have critical significance and meet methodically defined criteria. These observations are then kept track of as incidents, which are then used to solve practical problems and develop broad [[psychological]] principles. A critical incident can be described as one that makes a  contribution—either positively or negatively—to an activity or phenomenon. Critical incidents can be gathered in various ways, but typically respondents are asked to tell a story about an experience they have had.

CIT is a flexible method that usually relies on five major areas. The first is determining and reviewing the incident, then fact-finding, which involves collecting the details of the incident from the participants. When all of the facts are collected, the next step is to identify the issues. Afterwards a decision can be made on how to resolve the issues based on various possible solutions. The final and most important aspect is the evaluation, which will determine if the solution that was selected will solve the root cause of the situation and will cause no further problems.

==History==
The studies of [[Sir Francis Galton]] are said to have laid the foundation for the Critical Incident Technique, but it is the work of Colonel [[John C. Flanagan]], that resulted in the present form of CIT. &lt;ref&gt; Flanagan, John C. ''Psychological Bulletin'', Vol. 51, No. 4, July 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;
Flanagan defined the Critical Incident Technique as:

{{quote|[A] set of procedures for collecting direct observations of human behaviour in such a way as to facilitate their potential usefulness in solving practical problems and developing broad psychological principles ... By an incident is meant any specifiable human activity that is sufficiently complete in itself to permit inferences and predictions to be made about the person performing the act. To be critical the incident must occur in a situation where the purpose or intent of the act seems fairly clear to the observer and where its consequences are sufficiently definite to leave little doubt concerning its effects.&lt;ref name="Flanagan54"&gt; Page 327.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Flanagan's work was carried out as part of the Aviation Psychology Program &lt;ref&gt; "Charged with recruiting other psychologists, Dr. Flanagan was asked to develop the Army Air Corp's program, and, by the end of the war, he had overseen the commissioning of over 150 psychologists. Within its ranks were some of the finest psychologists of the day, including five forthcoming presidents of the American Psychological Association and 11 members of its board of directors. Toward the close of the war, this group of psychologists was involved not only in conducting research regarding the selection and classification of aviators but was also involved in developing training programs and human factors engineering." http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/publications/newsletters/military/2014/04/aviation-psychology.aspx, paragraph 6&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], where Flanagan conducted a series of studies focused on differentiating effective and ineffective work behaviors. Flanagan went on to found [[American Institutes for Research]] continuing to use the Critical Incident Technique in a variety of research.&lt;ref&gt;A Timeline of AIR History, American Institutes for Research http://www.air.org/page/air-history&lt;/ref&gt; Since then CIT has spread as a method to identify job requirements, develop recommendations for effective practices, and determine competencies for a vast number of professionals in various disciplines. In particular, it has been used in service research.

==Principal uses==
CIT can be used in training, [[systems design]] and [[accident investigation]]. It is an integral part of large scale [[task analysis]]. It identifies the most costly happenings in a complex environment where people and machines work as a system. Its origin in investigating [[pilot error]]s in wartime,&lt;ref name="Flanagan54"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;328 et seq&lt;/sup&gt; and other life-and-death situations, means it identifies top priorities in a man-machine system or other complex action-oriented situation. These priorities then feed into procedures for selection and training, and also (continuing the pilot example) into cockpit instrument design.&lt;ref&gt;Fitts P.M. &amp; Jones R.E 1947. ''Psychological aspects of instrument display: I. Analysis of 270 "pilot-error" experiences in reading and interpreting aircraft instruments''. U.S. Air Forces Materiel Command, Report No. TSEAA-694-12A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapanis, Alphonse 1959. ''Research techniques in human engineering''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, Chapter 3, Methods for the study of accidents and near-accidents.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[healthcare]], CIT is used in situations where direct examination of clinical staff and researchers can help them better understand their roles and help them solve practical problems. CIT allows clinical staff to better understand their roles in the clinical setting. Another advantage is that it helps them gain better knowledge about their interactions with patients and other clinicians. It also helps clinical staff better understand their practice from a variety of roles (e.g., [[physician]], [[nurse]], clinical educator, nurse informatician, faculty member). In healthcare research, CIT can be a good resource in identifying the experiences of a patient in the healthcare setting, exploring the dimensions of patient–provider interactions and determining patient responses to illnesses and treatments.

CIT is also widely used in [[organizational development]] as a research technique for identification of organizational problems and is suitable for knowledge management in project-based organizations&lt;ref&gt;Haussner et al (2018). [https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0000626 "Exploring Internationally Operated Construction Projects through the Critical Incident Technique"]. ''Journal of Management in Engineering'' 34(5).&lt;/ref&gt;. CIT is used as an interview technique, where the informants are encouraged to talk about unusual organizational incidents instead of answering direct questions. Using CIT deemphasizes the inclusion of general opinions about management and working procedures, instead focusing on specific incidents. 

In [[market research]], CIT has been used more frequently in the last ten years. Although the CIT method first appeared in the marketing literature thirty years ago, the major catalyst for use of the CIT method in service research appears to have been a ''Journal of Marketing'' study conducted by Bitner, Booms, and Tetreault (1990) that investigated sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in service encounters. Since the Bitner et al. article, nearly 200 CIT studies have appeared in marketing-related literature.&lt;ref&gt;Gremler's article in ''Journal of Service Research'', Vol. 7, No. 1, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

CIT has also been used in studies of information-seeking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;"How senior managers acquire and use information in environmental scanning" by Ethel Auster and Chun Wei Choo (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Information sources used by lawyers in problem-solving: An empirical exploration" by Margaret Ann Wilkinson (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Is 'Enough' Enough? Modeling the Information-Seeking and Stopping Behavior of Senior Arts Administrators" by Lisl Zach (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The employment of CIT may also allow construction of typical scenarios of user behavior when they interact with various technologies including information systems. For this, researchers should solicit:

# the cause, description and outcome of a critical incident;
# users' feelings and perceptions of the situation;
# actions taken during the incident;
# changes (if any) in their future behavior.

The typical scenarios may be presented visually as a diagram or a [[causal model]].&lt;ref&gt;Serenko, A. (2006). [http://www.aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_CIT_Agents.pdf "The use of interface agents for email notification in critical incidents"]. ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' 64(11): 1084–1098.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
By identifying possible problems associated with major user–system or product complications, CIT recommendations try to ensure that the same type of situations do not result in a similar loss. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using this method, as shown below.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Overall, however, CIT has been demonstrated to be a sound method since first presented in 1954.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Relatively few modifications have been suggested to the method in the more than 50 years since it was introduced, and only minor changes have been made to Flanagan's original approach, indicating reasonable robustness.

===Advantages===
* Flexible method that can be used to improve multi-user systems.
* Data is collected from the respondent's perspective and in his or her own words.
* Does not force the respondents into any given framework.
* Identifies even rare events that might be missed by other methods which only focus on common and everyday events.
* Useful when problems occur but the cause and severity are not known.
* Inexpensive and provides rich information.
* Emphasizes the features that will make a system particularly vulnerable and can bring major benefits (e.g. safety).
* Can be applied using questionnaires or interviews.
* Easy to understand.

===Disadvantages===
* A first problem comes from the type of the reported incidents. The Critical Incident Technique will rely on events being remembered by users and will also require the accurate and truthful reporting of them. Since critical incidents often rely on [[memory]], incidents may be imprecise or may even go unreported.
* The method has a built-in bias towards incidents that happened recently, since these are easier to recall.
* Respondents may not be accustomed to or willing to take the time to tell (or write) a complete story when describing a critical incident.
* Since this method is based on incidents it does not say anything about the everyday situation so it is not very representative.

'''Critical data studies''' is the systematic study of data and its criticisms. The field was named by scholars [[Craig Dalton]] and [[Jim Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalton|first1=Craig|last2=Thatcher|first2=Jim|title=What does a Critical Data Studies look like and why do we care?|url=http://societyandspace.org/2014/05/12/what-does-a-critical-data-studies-look-like-and-why-do-we-care-craig-dalton-and-jim-thatcher/#|website=Society + Space|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its naming, significant interest in critical data studies was generated by [[danah boyd]] and [[Kate Crawford]], who posed a set of research questions for the critical study of [[big data]] and its impacts on society and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=boyd|first1=danah|last2=Crawford|first2=Kate|title=Critical questions for Big Data|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|date=10 May 2012|volume=15|issue=5|pages=662–679|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name implies, critical data studies draws heavily on the influence of [[critical theory]] which it applies to the study of [[data]]. Subsequently, others have worked to further solidify a field called critical data studies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iliadis|first=Andrew|last2=Russo|first2=Federica|date=2016-10-17|title=Critical data studies: An introduction|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=205395171667423|doi=10.1177/2053951716674238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other key scholars in this discipline include [[Rob Kitchin]] and [[Tracey P. Lauriault]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitchin, Rob, and Tracey P. Lauriault, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kitchin, Rob, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have attempted to make sense of data through different theoretical frameworks, some of which include analyzing data technically, ethically, politically/economically, temporally/spatially, and philosophically.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the key academic journals related to critical data studies include the ''[[Journal of Big Data]]'' and ''[[Big Data and Society]]''.

==Motivation==

In their article in which they coin the term 'critical data studies,' Dalton and Thatcher also provide several justifications as to why data studies is a discipline worthy of a critical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Craig, and Jim Thatcher, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, 'big data' is an important aspect of twenty-first century society, and the analysis of 'big data' allows for a deeper understanding of what is happening and for what reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, big data as a technological tool and the information that it yields are not neutral, according to Dalton and Thatcher, making it worthy of critical analysis in order to identify and address its biases. Building off this idea, another justification for a critical approach is that the relationship between big data and society is an important one, and therefore worthy of study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Dalton and Thatcher stress how the relationship is not an example of [[technological determinism]], but rather how big data can shape the lives of individuals. Big data technology can cause significant changes in society's structure and in the everyday lives of people,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and being a product of society, big data technology is worthy of sociological investigation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, data sets are almost never completely raw, that is to say without any influences. Rather, data are shaped by the vision or goals of a research team, and during the data collection process, certain things are quantified, stored, sorted and even discarded by the research team.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Mike|last2=Lupton|first2=Deborah|date=2015-10-13|title=Toward a manifesto for the 'public understanding of big data'|journal=Public Understanding of Science|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=104–116|doi=10.1177/0963662515609005|pmid=26468128|url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/researchrepository/items/0649f4e2-e43e-4e60-b8f7-a5f12801ebcd/1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical approach is thus necessary in order to understand and reveal the intent behind the information being presented. Moreover, data alone cannot speak for itself; in order to possess any concrete meaning, data must be accompanied by theoretical insight or alternative quantitative or qualitative research measures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-Yam|first=Yaneer|date=2016-11-01|title=From big data to important information|journal=Complexity|language=en|volume=21|issue=S2|pages=73–98|doi=10.1002/cplx.21785|issn=1099-0526|arxiv=1604.00976|bibcode=2016Cmplx..21S..73B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalton and Thatcher argue that if one were to only think of data in terms of its exploitative power, there is no possibility of using data for revolutionary, liberatory purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, Dalton and Thatcher propose that a critical approach in studying data allows for 'big data' to be combined with older, 'small data,' and thus create more thorough research, opening up more opportunities, questions and topics to be explored.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abreu|first1=Amelia|last2=Acker|first2=Amelia|title=Context and collection: A research agenda for small data|journal=IConference 2013 Proceedings|date=2013|pages=549–554|doi=10.9776/13275|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/39750|accessdate=17 January 2018|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and concerns for critical data scholars==

The use of data in modern society brings about new ways of understanding and measuring the world, but also brings with it certain concerns or issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Data scholars attempt to bring some of these issues to light in their quest to be critical of data. Rob Kitchin identifies both technical and organizational issues of data, as well as some normative and ethical questions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Technical and organization issues concerning data range from the scope of datasets, access to the data, the quality of the data, the integration of the data, the application of analytics and ecological fallacies, as well as the skills and organizational capabilities of the research team.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some of the normative and ethical concerns addressed by Kitchin include surveillance through one's data ([[dataveillance]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), the privacy of one's data, the ownership of one's data, the security of one's data, anticipatory or corporate governance, and profiling individuals by their data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All of these concerns must be taken into account by scholars of data in their objective to be critical.

Following in the tradition of critical urban studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brenner | first1 = Neil| title = What is critical urban theory? | journal = City | volume = 13| issue = 2–3| pages = 198–207| doi = 10.1080/13604810902996466 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have raised similar concerns around data and digital information technologies in the urban context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Joe Shaw and Mark Graham | title = Our Digital Rights to the City | url = http://meatspacepress.org/ | website = meatspacepress.org | publisher = Meatspace Press | date = 15 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Kate|last2=Finn|first2=Megan|date=2015-08-01|title=The limits of crisis data: analytical and ethical challenges of using social and mobile data to understand disasters|journal=GeoJournal|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|pages=491–502|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z|issn=0343-2521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickren|first=Graham|date=2016-10-12|title=The global assemblage of digital flow|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=42|issue=2|pages=225–243|language=en|doi=10.1177/0309132516673241}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Joe Shaw and Mark Graham have examined these in light of [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s '[[right to the city]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Joe|last2=Graham|first2=Mark|date=February 2017|title=An Informational Right to the City?

'''Decentralized wastewater systems''' (also referred to as '''decentralized wastewater treatment systems''') convey, treat and dispose or reuse [[wastewater]] from small communities, buildings and dwellings in remote areas, individual public or private properties. [[Wastewater]] flow is generated when appropriate water supply is available within the buildings or close to them.

Decentralized wastewater systems treat, reuse or dispose the effluent in relatively close vicinity to its source of generation. They have the purpose to protect [[public health]] and the [[natural environment]] by reducing substantially health and environmental hazards.

They are also referred as "decentralized wastewater treatment systems" because the main technical challenge is the adequate choice of a treatment and/or disposal facility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wastewatereducation.org/watertowaste/epa_septic_program_strategy.pdf|title=Decentralized wastewater systems: a program strategy, EPA, Washington DC, USA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.borda-sea.org/basic-needs-services/dewats-decentralized-wastewater-treatment.html|title=DEWATS/Decentralized wastewater treatment, BORDA, South-east Asia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly used acronym for decentralized wastewater treatment system, is DEWATS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Comparison to centralized systems ===
Centralized wastewater systems are the most widely applied in well-developed urban environments and the oldest approach to the solution of the problems associated with wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Karman D. (2007) [http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/waters/article.html The 'Cloaka Maxima' and the monumental manipulation of water in archaic Rome], On-line journal ''&amp;nbsp;The Water of Rome,'' retrieved on the 18 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;They collect wastewater in large and bulk pipeline networks, also referred as [[sewerage]], which transport it at long distances to one or several treatment plants.  [[Stormwater|Storm water]] can be collected in either [[combined sewer]]s or in a separate storm water drains.  The latter consists of two separate pipeline systems, one for the wastewater and one for the storm water. The treated effluent is disposed in different ways, most often discharged into natural water bodies. The treated effluent may also be used for beneficial purposes and in this case it is referred as [[reclaimed water]].

The main difference between decentralized and centralized systems is in the conveyance structure. In decentralized systems the treatment and disposal or reuse of the effluent is close to the source of generation. This results in a small conveyance network, in some cases limited only to one pipeline. The size of the network allows for applications of different conveyance methods, in addition to the well-known gravity sewers, such as pressurized sewers and [[vacuum sewer]]s. The quantity of the effluent is low and is characterized by significant fluctuations.

=== Applications ===
In locations with developed infrastructure, decentralized wastewater systems could be a viable alternative of the conventional centralized system, especially in cases of upgrading or retrofitting existing systems.&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt; Many different combinations and variations of ''hybrid'' systems are possible. The development of new treatment technologies allows for decentralized solutions, which are technically and aesthetically sound and acceptable.

Decentralized applications are a necessity in cases of new urban developments, where the construction of the infrastructure is not ready or will be executed in future. In many countries and locations, the infrastructure development (roads, water supply and especially wastewater/drainage systems) is executed years after the housing development. In such cases decentralized wastewater facilities are considered as a temporary solution, but they are mandatory, in order to prevent public health and ecological problems.

Decentralized systems allow for flow separation or source separation, which segregates different types of wastewater, based on their origin, such as: [[Blackwater (waste)|black water]], [[greywater]] and [[urine]].&lt;ref name="Leverenz"&gt;Tchobanoglous G., Leverenz H. (2013) The rationale for decentralization of wastewater infrastructure, in: [https://books.google.bg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=juicry4LaRgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=decentralized+wastewater+systems&amp;ots=CHVe6w98Wu&amp;sig=VvTMLtDYXrW60pGHm0xKI_HTpPs&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=decentralized%20wastewater%20systems&amp;f=false Source separation and decentralization for wastewater management], ed: Larsen T.A., Udert K.M., Lienert J., ''IWA publishing'', London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; This approach requires separate parallel pipeline/plumbing systems to convey the segregated flows and the purpose is to apply different level of treatment and handling of each flow and to enhance the safe reuse and disposal of the end products.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2006). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1004 WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Grey water] . World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[Developing country|developing countries]], where localities with poor infrastructure are common, decentralized wastewater treatment has been promoted extensively because of the possibility to apply technologies with low operation and maintenance requirements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sasse, L. (1998). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1933 DEWATS Decentralised Wastewater Treatment in Developing Countries]. Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association (BORDA), Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, decentralized approaches require smaller scale investments, compared to centralized solutions.

== Types ==

Based on the size of the served area, different scales of decentralization could be found:
* Decentralization at the level of a suburb or satellite township in an urban area – these systems could be defined as small centralized systems when applied to small towns or rural communities. But if they are applied only to selected suburbs or districts in medium or large population centres, with existing centralized system,&amp;nbsp;the whole system could be defined as a ''hybrid'' system, where decentralization is applied to parts of the whole drained area.&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt;
* Decentralization at the level of a neighbourhood – this category includes clusters of homes, gated communities, small districts and areas, which are served by vacuum sewers.  
* Decentralization at “on-site” level ([[Onsite sewage facility|on-site sanitation]]) – in these cases the whole system lays within one property and serves one or several buildings.

== Wastewater treatment options ==
[[File:Biogas digester at Meru prison (3504698658).jpg|thumb|Biogas digester for decentralized wastewater treatment at Meru Prison, Kenya]]
Treatment/disposal facilities requiring effluent infiltration: usually they are applied at on-site level and are adequate because of the very low wastewater quantity generated. However, they require suitable soil conditions, permitting [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of the excess water, and low [[Water table|ground water table]]. If not applied properly, they may be a serious source of ground water pollution.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;''[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/2004_07_07_septics_septic_2002_osdm_all.pdf Onsite wastewater treatment systems manual]'' (2002), EPA 625/R-00/008, Washington DC, USA&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pit latrine]]s are applied when the water supply is very scarce and wastewater flow can hardly be generated. They are the most common sanitation technique in under-developed areas.
* [[Septic tank]]s are the most common on-site treatment technology used, which can be applied successfully where an adequate water supply is available and the soil/groundwater conditions are acceptable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leverenz" /&gt;
Treatment facilities resembling natural purification processes: their application requires significant surface area, because of the slow pace of the biological processes applied. For the same reason they are more suitable for warmer climates, because the rate of the purification process is temperature dependent. These technologies are more resilient to fluctuating loads and do not require complex maintenance and operation.&lt;ref&gt;Scholzel &amp; Bowel (1999) [http://www.pacificwater.org/userfiles/file/TR0288.pdf Small scale treatment plant project – report on project criteria, guidelines and technologies], SOPAC TR288, retrieved on the 18 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constructed wetland]]s are more suitable for applications at on-site or at neighbourhood level, while [[stabilization pond]]s could be a viable alternative for decentralized systems at the level of small towns or rural communities.

Engineered wastewater treatment technologies: there is a large variety of [[wastewater treatment plants]] where different treatment processes and technologies are applied.&lt;ref&gt;''Wastewater engineering&amp;nbsp;: treatment and reuse (4th ed.). Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA. 2003. &amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-07-112250-8}}.''&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale treatment facilities in decentralized systems, apply similar technologies as medium or large plants.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Crites R., Tchobanoglous G. (1998) Small and decentralized &amp;nbsp;wastewater management, ''WCB/McGraw-Hill'', {{ISBN|0-07-289087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For on-site applications package plants are developed, which are compact and have different compartments for the different processes. However, the design and operation of small treatment plants, especially at neighbourhood or on-site level,  present significant challenges to wastewater engineers, related to flow fluctuations, necessity of competent and specialized operation and maintenance, required to deal with a large number of small plants, and relatively high per capita cost.&lt;ref&gt;Boller. M. (1997) Small wastewater plants- a challenge to wastewater engineers, ''Water Science and Technology,'' Vol 35, issue 6, p.1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations and management ==
[[Regulation and monitoring of pollution#Water pollution|Water pollution regulations]] in the form of [[legislation]] documents, [[guideline]]s or [[Local ordinance|ordinance]]s prescribe the necessary level of treatment, so that the treated effluent meets the requirements for safe disposal or reuse. Effluent may be disposed by discharging into a natural water body or infiltrated in the ground. In addition, regulations  mention requirements regarding the design and operation of wastewater systems, as well as the penalties and other measures for their enforcement. Centralized systems are designed, built and operated in order to fulfil the existing regulations. Their management usually is executed by [[Local Authorities|local authorities]]. In hybrid systems and small centralized systems in towns or rural communities management can be executed in the same way.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In the case of decentralization at on-site level and clusters of buildings, the whole wastewater system is located within private premises. The costs and responsibility for the design, construction, operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the owner. In many cases specialized companies might execute the operation and maintenance procedures. The local authorities issue permits and may provide support for the operation and management in the form of collecting wastes, issuing certificates/licenses for standardized treatment equipment, or for selected qualified private companies. From regulatory point of view, the control of the quality of treated effluent for reuse, discharge or disposal is entirely the responsibility of local or national government authorities. This might be a challenge if a large number of systems must be controlled and inspected. It is in the owner's interest to operate and maintain the system properly, especially in the case of reuse of the treated effluent. Most often the operational problems are associated with clogging of the treatment facilities as result of irregular removal of the sludge or hydraulic overloading due to increased number of population served or increased water consumption.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Urban planning and infrastructure issues ==
Wastewater systems are part of the [[infrastructure]] of urban or rural communities and the [[urban planning]] process. Urban planning data and information, such as plots of individual dwellings, roads/streets, storm water drainage, water supply, and electricity systems are essential for the design and implementation of a sustainable wastewater system. In decentralized wastewater systems, which collect and treat wastewater only, storm water might be overlooked and cause flooding problems. If planned decentralized solutions are applied, storm water drainage should be executed together with the roads system.

In under-developed population centres where no infrastructure is available, is difficult to provide sustainable sanitation measures; e.g. pit latrines/septic tanks need periodic cleansing, usually executed by [[Vacuum Tracks|vacuum tracks]], which have to access the latrine and need a basic road for this purpose. [[Fecal sludge management]] deals with the organization and implementation of this practice in a sustainable way, including collection, transport, treatment and disposal/reuse of faecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;WSTF (2015). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2448 Design and Technologies of Decentralised Treatment Facilities] - Manuals and further documents developed in the context of GIZ’s Water Sector Reform Programme. Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF), Nairobi, Kenya&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cases of new urban/rural developments, or the retrofitting of  existing ones, it is advisable  to consider different alternatives regarding the design of the wastewater system, including decentralized solutions. A sustainable approach would require optimal technical solutions in terms of reliability and cost effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; From this perspective, centralized solutions might be more appropriate in many cases, depending on existing sizes of plots, [[topography]], [[geology]], ground water tables  and climatic conditions. But when applied adequately, decentralized systems allow for the application of more environmentally friendly solutions and reuse of the treated effluent, including recovery and reuse of specific elements. In this way alternative water resources are provided and the environment is protected. In addition [[Public awareness of science|public awareness]], perceptions and support are an important  part of the urban planning process in general, and the choice of adequate wastewater system in specific.,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Anderson K., Dickin S., Rosemarin A. (2017) [http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289/htm Towards "sustainable" sanitation: challenges and opportunities in urban areas",] ''Sustainability,'' 8, doi: 10-3390/su8121289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2757 Wastewater - the untapped resource], The UN world water development report 2017, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
One example of decentralized treatment is the "DEWATS technology" which has been promoted under this name by the German NGO [[Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association|BORDA]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been applied in many countries in South East Asia and in South Africa.&lt;ref name="ESCAP"&gt;ESCAP, UN-Habitat, AIT (2015).

This technology was researched and tested in South Africa where it was shown that the treatment efficiency was lower than expected.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Reynaud, N. (2015). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2415 Operation of Decentralised Wastewater Treatment Systems (DEWATS) under tropical field conditions.] PhD thesis, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Technical University, Dresden&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study of a decentralized wastewater system at on-site level with treated effluent reuse was performed at the Botswana Technology Centre in Gaborone, Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;Hranova R (2005) The Wastewater Reuse Practice in Botswana – a Challenge for the Development of the Water Sector, ''Proceedings of the BIE annual conference – 19–21 October 2005, Gaborone, Botswana.'' (Proceedings in CD format)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of a decentralized wastewater system, which serves one institutional building, located in an area served by municipal sewerage. Wastewater from the building is treated in a plant consisting of: septic tank, followed by planted rock filter, [[Biofilter|bio-filter]] and a surface flow wetland. The treated effluent is reused for irrigation of the surrounding green areas, but the study registered outflow from the wetland only during periods of heavy rains. This example shows the need for careful estimation of the expected quantity, quality and fluctuations of the generated wastewater when designing decentralized wastewater systems.

{{short description| A pattern of daily vertical movement characteristic of many aquatic species }}

'''Diel vertical migration (DVM)''', also known as '''diurnal vertical migration''', is a pattern of movement used by some organisms, such as [[copepod]]s, living in the [[ocean]] and in [[lake]]s. The [[Animal migration|migration]] occurs when organisms move up to the [[epipelagic]] zone at night and return to the [[mesopelagic]] zone of the oceans or to the [[hypolimnion]] zone of lakes during the day. The word ''diel'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''dies'' [[day]], and means a 24-hour period. In terms of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], it is the greatest migration in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diel Vertical Migration (DVM)|url=http://funwithkrill.blogspot.com/2011/08/diel-vertical-migration-dvm.html|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from [[crustacean]]s ([[copepod]]s),&lt;ref name="P.B.

==Discovery==
During [[World War II]] the [[U.S. Navy]] was taking [[sonar]] readings of the ocean when they discovered the [[deep scattering layer]] (DSL). While performing sound propagation experiments the University of California's Division of War Research (UCDWR), consistently had results of the [[Echo sounding|echo-sounder]] that showed a distinct reverberation that they attributed to mid-water layer scattering agents, there was speculation these readings may be attributed to enemy submarines. By collaborating with biologists from Scripps Institution and the UCDWR, they were able to confirm that the observed reverberations from the echo-sounder were in fact related to the diel vertical migration of marine animals. The DSL was caused by large, dense groupings of organisms, like zooplankton,&amp;nbsp;that scattered the sonar to create a false or second bottom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physical Oceanography|last=Hill|first=M.N.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once scientists started to do more research on what was causing the DSL, it was discovered that a large range of organisms were vertically migrating. Most types of [[plankton]] and some types of [[nekton]] have exhibited some type of vertical migration, although it is not always diel. These migrations may have substantial effects on [[mesopredator]]s and [[apex predators]] by modulating the concentration and accessibility of their prey (e.g., impacts on the foraging behavior of [[pinnipeds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Horning, M. |author2=Trillmich, F. |title=Lunar cycles in diel prey migrations exert a stronger effect on the diving of juveniles than adult Galapagos fur seals|year=1999|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|volume=266|issue=1424 |pages=1127–1132|doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0753 |pmid=10406130 |pmc=1689955}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Types of vertical migration==
;Diel:This is the most common form of vertical migration. Organisms migrate on a daily basis through different depths in the water column. Migration usually occurs between shallow surface waters of the epipelegic zone and deeper mesopelagic zone of the ocean or hypolimnion zone of lakes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: Furthermore, there are three recognized types of diel vertical migration. This includes nocturnal vertical migration, the most common form, where organisms ascend to the surface around dusk, remaining at the surface for the night, then migrating to depth again around dawn. The second form is reverse migration, which occurs with organisms ascending to the surface at sunrise and remaining high in the water column throughout the day until descending with the setting sun. The third form is twilight diel vertical migration, involving two separate migrations in a single 24-hour period, with the first ascent at dusk followed by a descent at midnight, often known as the "midnight sink". The second ascent to the surface and descent to the depths occurs at sunrise.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;
;Seasonal: Organisms are found at different depths depending on what season it is.&lt;ref name="Visser, Andre"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Visser | first=Andre |author2=Sigrun Jonasdottir |year=1999 | title=Lipids, buoyancy and the seasonal vertical migration of Calanus finmarchicus | journal=Fisheries Oceanography | volume=8 | pages=100–106 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2419.1999.00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal changes to the environment may influence changes to migration patterns. Normal diel vertical migration occur in species of [[foraminifera]] throughout the year in the polar regions; however, during the midnight sun, no differential light cues exist so they remain at the surface to feed upon the abundant phytoplankton, or to facilitate photosynthesis by their symbiotes.&lt;ref name="C. Manno, A.K. Pavlov 285–295"/&gt;
;Ontogenetic: Organisms spend different stages of their life cycle at different depths.&lt;ref name="Kobari, Toru"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kobari | first=Toru |author2=Tsutomu Ikeda |year=2001 | title=Octogenetic vertical migration and life cycle of Neocalanus plumchrus (Crustacea:Copepoda) in the Oyashio region, with notes on regional variations in body size | journal=Journal of Plankton Research | volume=23 | pages=287–302 | url= http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/287.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1093/plankt/23.3.287 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are often pronounced differences in migration patterns of adult female copepods, like ''Eurytemora affinis,'' which stay at depth with only a small upward movement at night, compared to the rest of its life stages which migrate over 10 meters. In addition, there is a trend seen in other copepods, like ''Acartia spp''. That have an increasing amplitude of their DVM seen with their progressive life stages. This is possibly due to increasing body size of the copepods and associated risk of visual predators, like fish, as being larger makes them more noticeable.&lt;ref name="P.B. Holliland, I. Ahlbeck, E. Westlund, S. Hansson 298–307"/&gt;

==Vertical migration stimuli==
There are two different factors that are known to play a role in vertical migration, [[endogenous]] and [[exogenous]]. Endogenous factors originate from the organism itself; sex, age, [[biological rhythms]], etc. Exogenous factors are environmental factors acting on the organism such as light, gravity, oxygen, temperature, predator-prey interactions, etc.

=== Endogenous factors ===
'''Endogenous rhythm'''

Biological clocks are an ancient and adaptive sense of time innate to an organism that allows them to anticipate environmental changes and cycles so they are able to physiologically and behaviorally respond to the expected change. Evidence of circadian rhythms controlling DVM, metabolism, and even gene expression have been found in copepod species, ''Calanus finmarchicus''. These copepods were shown to continue to exhibit these daily rhythms of vertical migration in the laboratory setting even in constant darkness, after being captured from an actively migrating wild population.&lt;ref name="N.S. Hafker, B. Meyer, K.S. Last, D.W. Pond, L. Huppe, M. Taschke 2194–2201"/&gt; An experiment was done at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] which kept organisms in column tanks with light/dark cycles. A few days later the light was changed to a constant low light and the organisms still displayed diel vertical migration. Thus suggestions that some type of internal response was causing the migration.&lt;ref name="Enright, J.T.."&gt;{{cite journal | last=Enright | first=J.T. |author2=W.M. Hammer |year=1967 | title=Vertical Diurnal Migration and Endogenous Rhythmicity | journal=Science | volume=157 | pages=937–941 | jstor= 1722121 | doi=10.1126/science.157.3791.937 | pmid=17792830 | issue=3791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clock gene expression'''

Many organisms including the copepod ''C. finmarchicus'', has genetic material devoted to maintaining its biological clock. The expression of these genes varies temporally with the expression significantly increasing following dawn and dusk at times of greatest vertical migration seen in this species. These finding may indicate they work as a molecular stimulus for vertical migration.&lt;ref name="N.S. Hafker, B. Meyer, K.S. Last, D.W. Pond, L. Huppe, M. Taschke 2194–2201"/&gt;

'''Body size'''

The relative body size of an organism has been found to effect DVM. Bull trout express daily and seasonal vertical migrations with smaller individuals always staying at a deeper layer than the larger individuals. This is most likely due to a predation risk but is dependent on the individuals own size such that smaller animals may be more inclined to remain at depth.&lt;ref name="L.F.G. Gutowsky, P.M. Harrison, E.G. Martins, A. Leake, D.A. Patterson, M. Power, S.J. Cooke 365–373"/&gt;

===Exogenous factors===
'''Light'''

Light is the most common and critical cue for vertical migration.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;Organisms want to find an optimum light intensity ([[isolume]]). Whether it is no light or a large amount of light, an organism will travel to where it is most comfortable. Studies have shown that during a full moon organisms will not migrate up as far or during an eclipse they will start to migrate.&lt;ref name="Richards, Shane."&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richards | first=Shane |author2=Hugh Possingham |author3=John Noye  |year=1996 | title=Diel vertical migration: modeling light-mediated mechanisms | journal=Journal of Plankton Research| volume=18 | pages=2199–2222 | url= http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/12/2199.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1093/plankt/18.12.2199 | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temperature'''

Organisms will migrate to a water depth with suitable temperatures that best suit the organisms needs, for example some fish species migrate to warmer surface waters in order to aid digestion. Temperature changes can influence swimming behavior of some copepods. In the presence of a strong thermocline some zooplankton may be inclined to pass through it, and migrate to the surface waters, though this can be very variable even in a single species. The marine copepod, ''Calanus finmarchicus,'' will migrate through gradients with temperature differences of 6&amp;nbsp;°C over George's Ban''k;'' whereas, in the North Sea they are observed to remain below the gradient.&lt;ref name="Ringelberg 2010 122–127"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diel Vertical Migration of Zooplankton in Lakes and Oceans|last=Ringelberg|first=Joop|publisher=Springer Science|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-3092-4|location=London New York, USA|pages=122–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salinity'''

Changes in salinity may promote organism to seek out more suitable waters if they happen to be [[stenohaline]] or unequipped to handle regulating their osmotic pressure. Areas that are impacted by tidal cycles accompanied by salinity changes, estuaries for example, may see vertical migration in some species of zooplankton.&lt;ref name="Barnes 1993 327–329"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oceanography and Marine Biology, An Annual Review|last=Barnes|first=Margaret|publisher=CRC Press|year=1993|isbn=|volume=31|location=Boca Raton, Florida, USA|pages=327–329}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas such as the Arctic, melting ice causes a layer of freshwater which organisms cannot cross.

'''Pressure'''

Pressure changes have been found to produce differential responses that result in vertical migration. many zooplankton will react to increased pressure with positive phototaxis, a negative geotaxis, and/or a kinetic response that results in ascending in the water column. Likewise, when there is a decrease in pressure, the zoo plankton respond by passively sinking or active downward swimming to descend in the water column.&lt;ref name="Barnes 1993 327–329"/&gt;

'''Predator kairomones'''

A predator might release a [[kairomone|chemical cue]] which could cause its prey to vertically migrate away.&lt;ref name="von Elert, Eric."&gt;{{cite journal | last=von Elert | first=Eric | author2=Georg Pohnert | year=2000 | title=Diel Predator specificity of kairomones in diel vertical migration of Daphnia: a chemical approach | journal=OIKOS | volume=88 | pages=119–128 | url=http://0-www.jstor.org.helin.uri.edu/sici?sici=0030-1299%282000%2988%3A1%3C119%3APSOKID%3E2.0.CO%3B2-X&amp;origin=serialsolutions | issn=0030-1299 | issue=1 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880114.x }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may stimulate the prey to vertically migrate to avoid said predator. The introduction of a potential predator species, like a fish, to the habitat of diel vertical migrating zooplankton has been shown to influence the distribution patterns seen in their migration. For example, a study used ''Daphnia'' and a fish that was too small to prey of them (''Lebistus reticulatus''), found that with the introduction of the fish to the system the ''Daphnia'' remained below the [[thermocline]], where the fish was not present. This demonstrates the effects of kairomones on ''Daphnia'' DVM''.&lt;ref name="Ringelberg 2010 122–127"/&gt;''

'''Tidal Patterns'''

Some organisms have been found to move with the tidal cycle. A study looked at the abundance of a species of small shrimp, ''Acetes sibogae,'' and found that they tended to move further higher in the water column and in higher numbers during flood tides than during ebb tides experiences at the mouth of an estuary. It is possible that varying factors with the tides may be the true trigger for the migration rather than the movement of the water itself, like the salinity or minute pressure changes.&lt;ref name="Barnes 1993 327–329"/&gt;

==Reasons for vertical migration==
There are many hypotheses as to why organisms would vertically migrate, and several may be valid at any given time.&lt;ref name="Kerfoot, WC"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerfoot |first=WC |year=1985 |title=Adaptive value of vertical migration: Comments on the predation hypothesis and some alternatives |journal=Contributions in Marine Science |volume=27 |pages=91–113 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=1587950 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Predator avoidance: Light-dependent predation by fish is a common pressure that causes DVM behavior in zooplankton. A given body of water may be viewed as a risk gradient whereby the surface layers are riskier to reside in during the day than deep water, and as such promotes varied longevity among zooplankton that settle at different daytime depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Depth-selection behavior and longevity in Daphnia: an evolutionary test for the predation-avoidance hypothesis|journal = Hydrobiologia|date = 2012-11-23|issn = 0018-8158|pages = 87–91|volume = 715|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10750-012-1393-5|first = Piotr|last = Dawidowicz|first2 = Piotr|last2 = Prędki|first3 = Barbara|last3 = Pietrzak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in many instances it is advantageous for zooplankton to migrate to deep waters during the day to avoid predation and come up to the surface at night to feed. 
;Metabolic advantages: By feeding in the warm surface waters at night and residing in the cooler deep waters during the day they can conserve energy.  Alternatively, organisms feeding on the bottom in cold water during the day may migrate to surface waters at night in order to digest their meal at warmer temperatures.
;Dispersal and transport: Organisms can use deep and shallow currents to find food patches or to maintain a geographical location.
;Avoid UV damage: The sunlight can penetrate into the water column. If an organism, especially something small like a [[microbe]], is too close to the surface the UV can damage them. So they would want to avoid getting too close to the surface, especially during daylight.
'''Water transparency'''

A recent theory of DVM, termed the Transparency Regulator Hypothesis, argues that water transparency is the ultimate variable that determines the exogenous factor (or combination of factors) that causes DVM behavior in a given environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Web of Science [v.5.20]  -      Web of Science Core Collection Full Record|url = http://apps.webofknowledge.com/InboundService.do?product=WOS&amp;SID=4AjAFO8aQteDGye4TkR&amp;UT=WOS%253A000294603500005&amp;SrcApp=EndNote&amp;DestFail=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.webofknowledge.com&amp;action=retrieve&amp;Init=Yes&amp;SrcAuth=ResearchSoft&amp;Func=Frame&amp;customersID=ResearchSoft&amp;IsProductCode=Yes&amp;mode=FullRecord|website = apps.webofknowledge.com|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less transparent waters, where fish are present and more food is available, fish tend to be the main driver of DVM. In more transparent bodies of water, where fish are less numerous and food quality improves in deeper waters, UV light can travel farther, thus functioning as the main driver of DVM in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does the fish presence influence the diurnal vertical distribution of zooplankton in high transparency lakes?|journal = Hydrobiologia|date = 2012-12-09|issn = 0018-8158|pages = 27–39|volume = 709|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10750-012-1405-5|first = Rocco|last = Tiberti|first2 = Rocco|last2 = Iacobuzio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unusual events ==
Due to the particular types of stimuli and cues used to initiate vertical migration, anomalies can change the pattern drastically.

For example, the occurrence of midnight sun in the Arctic induces changes to planktonic life that would normally perform DVM with a 24-hour night and day cycle. In the summers of the Arctic the Earth's north pole is directed toward the sun creating longer days and at the high latitude continuous day light for more than 24-hours. Species of foraminifera found in the ocean cease their DVM pattern, and rather remain at the surface in favor of feeding on the phytoplankton, for example ''Neogloboquadrina pachyderma'', and for those species that contain symbionts, like ''Turborotalita quinqueloba'', remain in sunlight to aid photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="C. Manno, A.K. Pavlov 285–295"/&gt;

There is also evidence of changes to vertical migration patterns during solar eclipse events. In the moments that the sun is obscured during normal day light hours, there is a sudden dramatic decrease in light intensity. The decreased light intensity, replicates the typical lighting experienced at night time that stimulate the planktonic organisms to migrate. During an eclipse, some copepod species distribution is concentrated near the surface, for example ''Calanus finmarchicus'' displays a classic diurnal migration pattern but on a much shorter time scale during an eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K. Sherman, K.A. Honey|first=|date=May 1970|title=Vertical movements of zooplankton during a solar eclipse|url=http://www.nature.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/2271156a0.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=227|issue=5263|pages=1156–1158|doi=10.1038/2271156a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance for the biological pump==

The [[biological pump]] is the conversion of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and inorganic nutrients by plant photosynthesis into [[Particle (ecology)|particulate]] organic matter in the [[euphotic zone]] and transference to the deeper ocean.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Deborah."&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steinberg | first= Deborah |author2=Sarah Goldthwait |author3=Dennis Hansell  |year=2002 | title=Zooplankton vertical migration and the active transport of dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen in the Sargasso Sea| journal=Deep-Sea Research Part I| volume=49 | pages=1445–1461 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VGB-46HFXF2-5&amp;_user=657938&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2002&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1493597039&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000035679&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=657938&amp;md5=cce92453ae63045d33db450ec07edbf1&amp;searchtype=a | issn=0967-0637 | doi=10.1016/S0967-0637(02)00037-7 | issue=8 | citeseerx= 10.1.1.391.7622 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major process in the ocean and without vertical migration it wouldn’t be nearly as efficient. The deep ocean gets most of its nutrients from the higher water column when they  sink down in the form of [[marine snow]]. This is made up of dead or dying animals and microbes, fecal matter, sand and other inorganic material.

Organisms migrate up to feed at night so when they migrate back to depth during the day they defecate large sinking fecal pellets.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Deborah."/&gt; Whilst some larger fecal pellets can sink quite fast, the speed that organisms move back to depth is still faster. At night organisms are in the top 100 metres of the water column, but during the day they move down to between 800–1000 meters. If organisms were to defecate at the surface it would take the fecal pellets days to reach the depth that they reach in a matter of hours. Therefore, by releasing fecal pellets at depth they have almost 1000 metres less to travel to get to the deep ocean. This is something known as [[active transport]]. The organisms are playing a more active role in moving organic matter down to depths. Because a large majority of the deep sea, especially marine microbes, depends on nutrients falling down, the quicker they can reach the ocean floor the better.

[[Zooplankton]] and [[salps]] play a large role in the active transport of fecal pellets. 15–50% of zooplankton biomass is estimated to migrate, accounting for the transport of 5–45% of particulate organic nitrogen to depth.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Deborah."/&gt; Salps are large gelatinous plankton that can vertically migrate 800 meters and eat large amounts of food at the surface. They have a very long gut retention time, so fecal pellets usually are released at maximum depth. Salps are also known for having some of the largest fecal pellets. Because of this they have a very fast sinking rate, small [[detritus]] particles are known to aggregate on them. This makes them sink that much faster. So while currently there is still much research being done on why organisms vertically migrate, it is clear that vertical migration plays a large role in the active transport of dissolved organic matter to depth.&lt;ref name="Wiebe, P.H"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wiebe | first=P.H |author2=L.P.

'''Crustal evolution''' involves the formation, destruction and renewal of the rocky outer shell at the [[Earth]]'s surface.

The variation in composition within the Earth's crust is much greater than other [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial planets]]. [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and other planetary bodies have relatively quasi-uniform crusts unlike that of the Earth which contains both oceanic and continental plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albarède|first=Francis|last2=Blichert-Toft|first2=Janne|date=2007-12-19|title=The split fate of the early Earth, Mars, Venus, and Moon|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642761|journal=Geochemistry (Cosmochemistry)|volume=339|issue=14–15|pages=917–927|doi=10.1016/j.crte.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique property reflects the complex series of crustal processes that have taken place throughout the planet's history, including the ongoing process of [[plate tectonics]].

The proposed mechanisms, regarding Earth's crustal evolution, take a theory-orientated approach. Fragmentary geologic evidence and observations provide the basis for hypothetical solutions to problems relating to the early Earth system. Therefore a combination of these theories creates both a framework of current understanding and also a platform for future study.

== Early crust ==

=== Mechanisms of early crust formation ===
The early Earth was entirely molten. This was due to high temperatures created and maintained by the following processes:

* Compression of the early atmosphere
* Rapid axial rotation
* Regular impacts with neighbouring planetesimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EIrwxgpc9GsC|title=Historical Geology: Understanding Our Planet's Past|last=Erickson|first=Jon|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438109640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] remained hotter than modern day temperatures throughout the [[Archean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-01|title=A great thermal divergence in the mantle beginning 2.5 Ga: Geochemical constraints from greenstone basalts and komatiites|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116000311|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=543–553|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.01.006|issn=1674-9871|last1=Condie|first1=Kent C.|last2=Aster|first2=Richard C.|last3=Van Hunen|first3=Jeroen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the Earth began to cool as [[planetary accretion]] slowed and heat stored within the [[magma ocean]] was lost to space through [[radiation]].

A theory for the initiation of magma solidification states that once cool enough, the cooler base of the magma ocean would begin to crystallise first. This is because pressure of 25GPa at the surface cause the [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] to lower.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-09-15|title=Early Earth differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X04004285|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=225|issue=3–4|pages=253–269|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2004.07.008|issn=0012-821X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a thin 'chill-crust' at the extreme surface would provide thermal insulation to the shallow sub surface, keeping it warm enough to maintain the mechanism of crystallisation from the deep magma ocean.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Phasediagram.png|thumb|310x310px|A phase diagram showing the order of crystallisation within the early mantle to form the early crust. 

An [[Adiabatic process|adiabat]] represents a change of temperature with pressure if no heat was lost through convection.

The early mantle adiabats show crystallisation took place from from the base; above approximately 25GPa (deep mantle) perovskites would begin to crystallise, below 25GPa (upper mantle) olivine would crystallise.]]

The composition of the crystals produced during the crystallisation of the magma ocean varied with depth. Experiments involving the melting of [[peridotite]] magma show that deep in the ocean (&gt;≈700m), the main mineral present would be Mg-[[perovskite]]. Whereas [[olivine]] would dominate in the shallower areas along with its high pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s e.g. [[garnet]] and [[majorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-06-15|title=Melting experiments of mantle materials under lower mantle conditions with implications for magma ocean differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920104000718|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=143-144|pages=397–406|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2003.09.016|issn=0031-9201|last1=Ito|first1=E.|last2=Kubo|first2=A.|last3=Katsura|first3=T.|last4=Walter|first4=M.J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing theory to the formation of the first continental crust is through intrusive [[pluton]]ic volcanism. The product of these eruptions formed a hot, thick lithosphere which underwent regular cycling with the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=Generation of felsic crust in the Archean: A geodynamic modeling perspective|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030192681500337X|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=271|pages=198–224|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2015.10.005|issn=0301-9268|last1=Sizova|first1=E.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.|last3=Stüwe|first3=K.|last4=Brown|first4=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat released by this form of volcanism, as well as assisting [[mantle convection]], increased the geothermal gradient of the early crust.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-01|title=Early Earth plume-lid tectonics: A high-resolution 3D numerical modelling approach|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370716300503|journal=Journal of Geodynamics|language=en|volume=100|pages=198–214|doi=10.1016/j.jog.2016.03.004|issn=0264-3707|last1=Fischer|first1=R.|last2=Gerya|first2=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crustal dichotomy ==
Crustal dichotomy represents the distinct contrast in composition and nature of the oceanic and continental plates, which together form the overall crust.

=== Timing ===
Oceanic and continental crusts are, at the present day, produced and maintained through plate tectonic processes. However the same mechanisms are unlikely to have produced the crustal [[dichotomy]] of the early lithosphere. This is thought to be true on the basis that sections of the thin, low density continental lithosphere could not have been sub-ducted under each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequently, a proposed relative timing for crustal dichotomy is put forward stating that dichotomy took place before the commencement of global plate tectonics. This is so a difference in crustal density could be established to facilitate plate subduction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1980-02-01|title=Crustal evolution of the early earth: The role of major impacts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301926880900121|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=3–4|pages=195–216|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(80)90012-1|issn=0301-9268|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert|hdl=2060/19790015389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation ===
[[File:Complex Impact Crater Formation.png|thumb|Development of a the base of an impact crater on the Earth's surface showing infill of basaltic partial melts from mantle. This solidified to form the early differentiated oceanic crust.|317x317px]]
==== Impact cratering ====
Large and numerous impact craters can be recognised on planetary bodies across the Solar System. These craters are thought to date back to a period where there was an increased frequency and intensity of asteroid impacts with terrestrial planets, known as the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which terminated approximately 4Ga.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/collections/pjfmznbgbx|title=Bombardment of the early Solar System : Nature Geoscience|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal goes on, claiming the Earth would have also sustained the same relative intensity of cratering as other planetesimals in the [[Solar System]]. It is therefore only due to Earth's high erosional rates and constant plate tectonics that the craters are not visible today. By scaling up the number and size of impact craters seen on the Moon to fit the size of Earth, it is predicted that at least 50% of the Earth's initial crust was covered in impact basins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This estimate provides a lower limit of the effect impact cratering had on the Earth's surface. 

======&lt;small&gt;Effects&lt;/small&gt;======
The main effects of impact cratering on the early lithosphere were:

* Formation of large craters. [[Isostasy|Isostatic rebound]] would adjust the depth of the craters making them relatively shallow in comparison to their diameter;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1977-10-01|title=Origin of the Earth's ocean basins|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103577900641|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=235–250|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(77)90064-1|issn=0019-1035|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; some reaching 4&amp;nbsp;km deep and 1000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Topography|Topographic]] division between the low-lying impact basins and the now elevated surface.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Release in pressure at the surface from the removal of [[overburden]]. This produced a greater increase in temperature with depth below the surface. Increased surface temperatures caused the [[partial melting]] of mantle which erupted and deposited within the surface basins. The [[pyrolite]] mantle would have produced [[basalt]]ic partial melts, compositionally contrasting to the existing [[sial]]ic crust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The magnitude of these impacts is interpreted, with a high level of uncertainty, to have converted roughly half of the 'continental' crust into terrestrial [[Lunar mare|maria]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Stuart Ross|date=1989-04-20|title=Growth of planetary crusts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195189901510|journal=Tectonophysics|language=en|volume=161|issue=3–4|pages=147–156|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90151-0|issn=0040-1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore providing a method for the formation of crustal dichotomy, as seen today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Types of crust ==

==== Primordial crust ====
The initial crystallisation of minerals from the [[magma ocean]] formed the primordial crust. 

A potential explanation of this process states the resultant solidification of the mantle edge took place approximately 4.43Ga. This would subsequently produce continents composed of [[komatiite]], an ultramafic rock rich in [[magnesium]] with a high melting point and low [[dynamic viscosity]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nna-Mvondo|first=Delphine|last2=Martinez-Frias|first2=Jesus|date=2007-02-15|title=Review komatiites: from Earth's geological settings to planetary and astrobiological contexts|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|language=en|volume=100|issue=3–4|pages=157–179|doi=10.1007/s11038-007-9135-9|issn=0167-9295|hdl=10261/8082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of research follows up on this, proposing that differences in the densities of newly formed crystals caused separation of crustal rocks; upper crust largely composed of fractionated [[gabbro]]s and lower crust composed of [[anorthosite]]s.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Santosh|first1=M.|last2=Arai|first2=T.|last3=Maruyama|first3=S.|date=2017-03-01|title=Hadean Earth and primordial continents: The cradle of prebiotic life|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116300834|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=309–327|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.07.005|issn=1674-9871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall result of initial crystallisation formed a primordial crust roughly 60&amp;nbsp;km in depth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The lack of certainty regarding the formation of primordial crust is due to there being no remaining present day examples. This is due to Earth's high erosional rates and the [[subduction]] and subsequent destruction of tectonic plates throughout its 4.5 Ga history.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Furthermore, during its existence the primordial crust is thought to have been regularly broken and re-formed by impacts involving other planetesimals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This continued for several hundred million years after [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], which concluded approximately 4.4Ga.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The outcome of this would be the constant alteration in the composition of the primordial crust, increasing the difficulty in determining its nature.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

==== Secondary crust ====
Recycling of existing primordial crust contributes to the production of secondary crust. Partial melting of the existing crust increases the [[mafic]] content of the melt producing basaltic secondary crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L8OM3NDrttsC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=secondary+crust#v=onepage&amp;q=secondary%20crust&amp;f=false|title=Earth as an Evolving Planetary System|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|date=2011-08-25|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123852274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further method of formation due to the decay of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] elements within the Earth releasing heat energy and eventually causing the partial melting of upper mantle, also producing basaltic lavas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RtC-nQEACAAJ|title=The Continental Crust: Its Composition and Evolution|last=Taylor|first=Stuart Ross|date=1985|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most secondary crust on Earth is formed at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid ocean ridges]] forming the oceanic crust.

==== Tertiary crust ====
The present day continental crust is an example of a tertiary crust. Tertiary crust is the most differentiated type of crust and so has a composition vastly different to that of the bulk Earth.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S. R.|last2=McLennan|first2=S. M.|date=1985-01-01|title=The continental crust: Its composition and evolution|language=English|osti=6582885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tertiary crust contains over 20% of the abundance of [[incompatible element]]s, which are elements a size or charge that prevent them from being included in mineral structure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This a result of its generation from the subduction and partial melting of secondary crust where it undergoes further [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallisation]]. Two stages of evolution produce an increased proportion of incompatible elements.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Initiation of plate tectonics ==
[[File:Plumeinducedsubduction.png|thumb|357x357px|A schematic evolutionary diagram showing the impact of a mantle plume on the early lithosphere (dark blue) and surface proto-crust (brown). This initiated subduction and subsequent global plate tectonics within a previously unseparated lithosphere that had no lateral surface movement.Modified from &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-12-01|title=Subduction initiation by thermal–chemical plumes: Numerical studies|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920108001581|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=171|issue=1-4|pages=296–312|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.06.032|issn=0031-9201}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Plume induced subduction ===
The formation and development of [[Mantle plume|plumes]] in the early mantle contributed to triggering the lateral movement of crust across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kröner|first=A.|last2=Layer|first2=P. W.|date=1992-06-05|title=Crust Formation and Plate Motion in the Early Archean|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/256/5062/1405|journal=Science|language=en|volume=256|issue=5062|pages=1405–1411|doi=10.1126/science.256.5062.1405|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17791608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of upwelling mantle plumes on the lithosphere can be seen today through local depressions around [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] such as [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]. The scale of this impact is much less than that exhibited in the Archean eon where mantle temperatures were much greater. Localised areas of hot mantle rose to the surface through a central plume wedge, weakening the damaged and already thin lithosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once the plume head breaks the surface, crust either side of the head is forced downwards through the conservation of mass, initiating subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X14002391|journal=Gondwana Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=38–63|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.07.011|issn=1342-937X|last1=Whattam|first1=Scott A.|last2=Stern|first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical modelling shows only strongly energetic plumes are capable of weakening the lithosphere enough to rupture it, such plumes would have been present in the hot Archean mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerya|first=T. V.|last2=Stern|first2=R. J.|last3=Baes|first3=M.|last4=Sobolev|first4=S. V.|last5=Whattam|first5=S. A.|date=2015-11|title=Plate tectonics on the Earth triggered by plume-induced subduction initiation|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15752#ref8|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=527|issue=7577|pages=221–225|doi=10.1038/nature15752|pmid=26560300|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-tectonic subduction can also be inferred from the internal volcanism on Venus. [[Artemis Corona]] is a large plume formed by the upwelling of mantle derived magma and is on a scale potentially comparable to that in the [[Archean]] mantle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Models using its known characteristics showed that continued magmatism from [[Thermal conduction|conductive]] heat through the plume caused gravitational collapse. The weight of collapse caused the spreading of the surrounding crust outwards and subsequent subduction around the margins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Kranendonk|first=Martin J|date=2010|title=Two types of Archean continental crust: Plume and plate tectonics on early Earth|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/310/10/1187.full.pdf+html|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=310|pages=1187–1209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anhydrous]] nature of the crust on Venus prevents it from sliding past each other, whereas through the study of oxygen isotopes, the presence of water on Earth can be confirmed from 4.3Ga.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-07-15|title=Magmatic δ18O in 4400–3900 Ma detrital zircons: A record of the alteration and recycling of crust in the Early Archean|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05002773|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=235|issue=3–4|pages=663–681|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.04.028|issn=0012-821X|last1=Cavosie|first1=A.J.|last2=Valley|first2=J.W.|last3=Wilde|first3=S.A.|last4=e.i.m.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this model helps provide a mechanism for how plate tectonics could have been triggered on Earth, although it does not demonstrate that subduction was initiated at the earliest confirmed presence of water on Earth. Based on these models, the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is dated at 3.6Ga.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Late Heavy Bombardment ===
Impact cratering also had consequences for both the development of plume-induced subduction and the establishment of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The steepening of geothermal gradients could have directly enhanced convective mantle transport which now beneath an increasingly fractured lithosphere could have created stresses great enough to cause rifting and the separation of crust into plates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Crustal growth rates ==
[[File:Growthcurve.png|thumb|331x331px|Plots showing the rate of continental crustal growth over time as a percentage of the total mass, along with associated thickness of the newly generated crust. The plot of crustal reworking represents the amount of post formational alteration undergone by the crust. The dramatic increase in crustal reworking and reduction in the rate of crustal growth at approximately 3.6Ga represents the onset of subduction and plate tectonics. Modified from &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;]]

=== Lithological dating ===
Crustal growth rates can be used to calculate estimates for the age of the continental crust. This can be done through analysis of [[igneous rock]]s with the same [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition as initial mantle rock. These igneous rocks are dated and assumed to be direct evidence of new continental crust formation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resulting ages of isotopically juvenile igneous rocks give distinct peaks, representing an increased proportion of igneous rock and therefore increased crust growth, at 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Ga. The validity of these results is questioned as the peaks could represent periods of preservation rather than increased continental crust generation. This is reinforced by the fact that such peaks are not observed in recent geologic time where it is given that [[magmatism]] resulting from the plate subduction has strongly contributed to producing new crust.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=C. J.|last2=Kemp|first2=A. I. S.|date=2006-10-19|title=Evolution of the continental crust|journal=Nature|volume=443|issue=7113|pages=811–817|doi=10.1038/nature05191|issn=1476-4687|pmid=17051208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustal growth rates from igneous rocks can be compared to the rates generated from [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic]] isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks. Projections of growth rates using these techniques does not produce staggered peaks, instead smooth shallow curves presenting a more constant rate of crustal growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although representative of large periods of time, limitations are found where samples do not solely represent magmatic production events. Instead samples include the mixing of sediments which produces a mix of original and altered isotope ratios.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zircon dating ===
[[Zircon]] minerals can be both [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] grains from sedimentary rocks and crystals in igneous rocks. Therefore, a combination of zircon forms can provide a more accurate estimate of crustal growth rates. Further to this, zircon minerals can be subject to [[Hafnium|Hf]] and [[Oxygen|O]] isotope ratio analysis.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is important as Hf isotopes indicate whether a rock originates from the mantle or an existing rock. High δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values of zircons represent rock recycled at the Earth's surface and thus potentially producing mixed samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condie|first=K. C.|date=2014-06|title=Growth of continental crust: a balance between preservation and recycling|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/minmag/article/78/3/623/85695/growth-of-continental-crust-a-balance-between|journal=Mineralogical Magazine|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=623–637|doi=10.1180/minmag.2014.078.3.11|issn=0026-461X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this combined analysis is valid zircons showing periods of increased crustal generation at at 1.9 and 3.3Ga, the latter of which representing the time period following the commencement of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Ecogenetics&lt;/big&gt;''' is a branch of [[genetics]] that studies [[trait (biology)|genetic trait]]s related to [[environmental science|the response to environmental substances]].&lt;ref name="Cummings"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Michael R.|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Human Heredity: Principles and Issues |publisher=|date=|location=|pages=264–265 |url=|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or, a contraction of [[ecological genetics]], the study of the relationship between a natural population and its genetic structure.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Ecogenetics principally deals with effects of preexisting genetically-determined variability on the response to environmental agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akhilautismfoundation.org/UserFiles/Image/Ecogenetics_Model.jpg |title=Ecogenetics Model |website=akhilautismfoundation.org |format=image |access-date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word environmental is defined broadly to include the physical, chemical, biological, atmospheric, and climate agents. Ecogenetics, therefore, is an all-embracing term, and concepts such as pharmacogenetics are seen as subcomponents of ecogenetics. This work grew logically from the book entitled ''Pollutants and High Risk Groups'' (1978), which presented an overview of the various host factors i.e. age, heredity, diet, preexisting diseases, and lifestyles which affect environmentally-induced disease.

It should be emphasized the primary intention of ecogenetics is to provide an objective and critical evaluation of the scientific literature pertaining to genetic factors and differential susceptibility to environmental agents, with particular emphasis on those agents typically considered pollutants. It is important to realize though that ones genetic makeup, while important, is but one of an array of host factors contributing to overall adaptive capacity of the individual. In many instances, it is possible for such factors to interact in ways that may enhance or offset the effect of each other.

'''Red blood cell conditions'''
There is a broad group of genetic diseases that result in either producing or predisposing affected individuals to the development of hemolytic anemias. These diseases include abnormal hemoglobin, inability to manufacture one or the other of the peptide globin chains of the hemoglobin, and deficiencies of the Embden-Meyerhoff monophosphate.

'''Liver metabolism'''
Individuals lacking the ability to detoxify and excrete PCB’s may have a high risk of total liver failure in conjunction with certain ecological conditions.

'''Cardiovascular diseases'''
The pathologic lesion of atherosclerosis is a plaque-like substance that thickens the innermost and middle of the three layers of the artery wall. The thickening of the intimal and medial layers results from the accumulation of the proliferating smooth muscle cells that are encompassed by interstitial substances such as collagen, elastin, glycosamninoglycans, and fibrin.

'''Respiratory diseases'''
There are three genetically-based respiratory diseases that can directly correspond with ecological functions and induce disease. These include lung cancer and the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with a serum Ig A deficiency.

&lt;!-- Please ensure you note the difference between **Essential** amino acids and **common** or proteinogenic amino acids before editing this article --&gt;
An '''essential amino acid''', or '''indispensable amino acid''', is an [[amino acid]] that cannot be [[de novo synthesis|synthesized ''de novo'']] (from scratch) by the organism, and thus must be supplied in its diet. The nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=J.

Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board. usda.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Six other amino acids are considered '''conditionally essential''' in the human diet, meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt; These six are [[arginine]], [[cysteine]], [[glycine]], [[glutamine]],&lt;!-- Histidine is essential according to the Dietary Reference Intakes published by the USDA --&gt; [[proline]], and [[tyrosine]]. Five amino acids are '''dispensable''' in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These five are [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]], [[asparagine]], [[glutamic acid]] and [[serine]].&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

[[Eukaryotes]] can synthesize some of the amino acids from other substrates. Consequently, only a subset of the amino acids used in protein synthesis are [[essential nutrient]]s.

==Recommended daily intake==

The recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10% to 20% higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150% higher in the first year of life. [[Cysteine]] (or sulfur-containing amino acids), [[tyrosine]] (or aromatic amino acids), and [[arginine]] are always required by infants and growing children.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf |title=PROTEIN AND AMINO ACID REQUIREMENTS IN HUMAN NUTRITION |author=FAO/WHO/UNU |publisher=WHO Press |year=2007}}, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Imura K, Okada A |title=Amino acid metabolism in pediatric patients |journal=Nutrition |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=143–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9437700 |url= |doi=10.1016/S0899-9007(97)00230-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative amino acid composition of protein sources===
{{Main|Protein quality}}
Various attempts have been made to express the "quality" or "value" of various kinds of protein. Measures include the [[biological value]], [[net protein utilization]], [[protein efficiency ratio]], [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score|protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score]] and [[Complete protein|complete proteins concept]]. These concepts are important in the livestock industry, because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in animal feeds would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on [[feed conversion ratio]]. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a supplement of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.

Although [[plant]]s tend to have less protein per weight than animal sources such as eggs or milk, they are nevertheless "complete" in that, as a whole, they contain all of the amino acids essential in human nutrition.&lt;ref name=McD&gt;[[John A. McDougall|McDougall J.]] [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/105/25/e197 Plant foods have a complete amino acid composition.] [[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]. 2002;105(25):e197&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true for algae and marine [[phytoplankton]].  Eating various plant foods in combination can provide a protein of higher biological value.&lt;ref name="vProtein"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Woolf |first1=P. J. |last2=Fu |first2=L. L. |last3=Basu |first3=A. | editor1-last = Haslam | editor1-first = Niall James |title=VProtein: Identifying Optimal Amino Acid Complements from Plant-Based Foods |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018836 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=e18836 |year=2011 |pmid=21526128 |pmc=3081312}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain native combinations of foods, such as corn and beans, soybeans and rice, or red beans and rice, contain the essential amino acids necessary for humans in adequate amounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/organic/essam.html Essential Amino Acids]. phy-astr.gsu.edu: "Tillery points out that a number of popular ethnic foods involve such a combination, so that in a single dish, one might hope to get the ten essential amino acids. Mexican corn and beans, Japanese rice and soybeans, and Cajun red beans and rice are examples of such fortuitous combinations."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein per calorie===

Protein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie.  For instance, the USDA lists 6 grams of protein per large whole egg (a 50-gram serving) rather than 84&amp;nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (71 calories total).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=SDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference |date=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |edition=Release 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, there are 3 grams of protein in a serving of raw broccoli (91 grams) or 96&amp;nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (31 calories total).  An egg contains twice as much protein per serving, but 12&amp;nbsp;mg less protein per calorie.  The ratio of essential amino acids (the quality of protein) is not taken into account.  It can be shown that common vegetable sources contain adequate protein, often more protein per calorie than the standard reference, whole raw egg, while other plant sources, particularly fruits contain less. It is recommended that adult humans obtain 10–35% of their calories as protein, or roughly 11–39&amp;nbsp;mg of protein per cal per day (22–78 g for 2000 cal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/protein |title=Web MD Protein: Are You Getting Enough? |publisher=webmd.com |date=2014-09-05 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carrot has 23&amp;nbsp;mg protein per cal or twice the minimum recommendation, a banana meets the minimum, and an apple is below recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods |title=USDA National Nutrient Database |publisher=USDA.gov |date=2015-03-31 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complete proteins in non-human animals==
Scientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was [[zein]], which comes from [[maize]] (corn), but recovered if they were fed [[casein]] from cow's milk. This led [[William Cumming Rose]] to the discovery of the essential amino acid [[threonine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rose WC, Haines WJ, Warner DT, Johnson JE |title=The amino acid requirements of man. II. The role of threonine and histidine |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=188 |issue=1 |pages=49–58 |pmid=14814112 |year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: [[lysine]], [[tryptophan]], [[histidine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[methionine]], [[valine]], and [[arginine]], in addition to threonine. Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants.  Longer term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kopple JD, Swendseid ME |date=May 1975 |title=Evidence that histidine is an essential amino acid in normal and chronically uremic man. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=881–891 |pmid=1123426 |pmc=301830 |doi=10.1172/JCI108016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interchangeability==
The distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The [[sulfur]]-containing amino acids, [[methionine]] and [[homocysteine]], can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized ''de novo'' in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the [[aromatic]] amino acid pair, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Likewise [[arginine]], [[ornithine]], and [[citrulline]], which are interconvertible by the [[urea cycle]], are considered a single group.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Effects of deficiency==
{{Main|Protein-energy malnutrition}}
If one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than what it usually is, even in the presence of adequate total nitrogen intake.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, including the brain and brain function of infants and young children; the immune system, thus elevating risk of infection; gut mucosal function and permeability, which affects absorption and vulnerability to systemic disease; and kidney function.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt; The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low serum albumin and low serum transferrin.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

The amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by [[William Cumming Rose]]. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of cornstarch, sucrose, butterfat without protein, corn oil, inorganic salts, the known vitamins, a large brown "candy" made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was [[nitrogen balance]]. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=WC |last2=Haines |first2=WJ |last3=Warner |first3=DT |title=The amino acid requirements of man. III. The role of isoleucine; additional evidence concerning histidine |journal=J Biol Chem |year=1951 |volume=193 |issue=2 |pages=605–612 |format=PDF |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/193/2/605.full.pdf |accessdate=15 Dec 2012 |pmid=14907749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essential amino acid deficiency should be distinguished from [[protein-energy malnutrition]], which can manifest as [[marasmus]] or [[kwashiorkor]]. Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories ("sugar baby syndrome"). However, this theory has been challenged by the finding that there is no difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to kwashiorkor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed T, Rahman S, Cravioto A |title=Oedematous malnutrition |journal=The Indian Journal of Medical Research |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=651–4 |pmid=20090122 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, for instance in [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRI) maintained by the [[USDA]], lack of one or more of the essential amino acids is described as [[protein-energy malnutrition]].&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnohistory''' is the study of cultures and [[indigenous peoples]]' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the [[history of the Americas]].

Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi=10.2307/481465| jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Scholars studying the history of [[Mexico]]'s indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]'', edited by archeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] was involved with creating a multiple volumes on [[Mesoamerican]] ethnohistory, published as ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', appearing in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the volumes were published, "both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 12, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources "which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the [[New Philology]]. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the [[history of Mexico]] that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html | title=Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood, editors (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist [[Howard F. Cline]], who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and [[Jicarilla Apache]].  

The field has also reached into [[Melanesia]], where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. [[Michael Harkin]] argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Harkin, "Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory," ''Social Science History,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | year = 1961 | title = Ethnohistory: An Ethnological Point of View | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 83 | doi=10.2307/480349| jstor = 480349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/482586 | last1 = DeMallie | first1 = Raymond J. | year = 1993 | title = These Have No Ears": Narrative and the Ethnohistorical Method | jstor = 482586| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 515–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related [[methodology|methodologies]] in that it embraces [[emic]] perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.

The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically "the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material," as described by [[William N. Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenton | first1 = W. N. | year = 1966 | title = Field Work, Museum Studies, and Ethnohistorical Research | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 13 | issue = 1/2| page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[James Axtell]] described ethnohistory as "the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories."&lt;ref name="Axtell1979" /&gt; Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. [[Ed Schieffelin]] asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), ''History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as "a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow." He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a [[holistic]], [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] approach that is most rewarding when it can be "joined to the memories and voices of living people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = W.

Reflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1215/01455532-2009-022 | last1 = Harkin | first1 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up | url = | journal = Social Science History | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: European Glass Experience (logo).jpg|thumb|European Glass Experience Logo]]
'''European Glass Experience''' is a project coordinated by the City of [[Venice]] in collaboration with Consorzio Promovetro Murano and the [[Murano Glass Museum]]. It represents an international celebration of contemporary glass art and, most of all, of its makers.

==The project==
EGE was officially launched on September 11, 2013 during a press conference at [[Ca' Farsetti]] in [[Venice]], and its aim is to valorise the glass art on a European level, and to promote the works of local and international young artists. European Glass Experience was established to reinforce glass production and to improve the artistic heritage of traditional glass working experience. The project has among its partners The Finnish Glass Museum, [[Riihimaki]], [[Finland]], and the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, La Granja de San Idelfonso, [[Segovia]], [[Spain]]. Associated partners are the Glass Factory in Boda Glasbruk, [[Sweden]], the Muzeum Witrazu (Stained Glass Museum) in [[Krakow]], the International Festival of Glass in [[Stourbridge]], [[England]] and the Glass Museum of Marinha Grande (Portugal). European Glass Experience project is co-financed by a prestigious two-year grant from the Culture Program 2007 – 2013 of the [[European Union]]. The project will last two years, and it is composed by an exhibition which will take place in three different museums, divided into two sections: 40 unreleased glass artworks and 20 sketches which will become artworks, realised by Promovetro’s Murano glass masters.

==The exhibition==

The exhibition began at The Finnish Glass Museum, Riihimaki, Finland, in March 2014, curated by Uta Laurén, and then continued to the Fundación Centro Nacional del Vidrio, Spain, under the directorship of Paloma Pastor. The final venue will be the Murano Glass Museum, directed by Chiara Squarcina in March 2015. Further additional venues, among the associated partners, will possibly follow. European Glass Experience team panel, made of museum directors, curators, and glass experts, selected nearly 80 sketches and artworks, coming from young artists of different cultures. Murano Glass masters associated with Promovetro are going to realize a selection of the most peculiar sketches in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egeglass.eu/|title=EGE - European Glass Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''expert system''' is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert.&lt;ref name="Jackson1998"&gt;{{Citation |title= Introduction To Expert Systems |year= 1998 |publisher= Addison Wesley |edition= 3 |last= Jackson |first= Peter |isbn= 978-0-201-87686-4 |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by [[automated reasoning|reasoning]] through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as [[Rule-based system|if–then rules]] rather than through conventional [[Procedural programming|procedural code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=conventional+programming&amp;i=40325,00.asp |title=Conventional programming |publisher=Pcmag.com |access-date=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="durkinhistory"&gt;{{cite book |first= Cornelius T. |last= Leondes |title= Expert systems: the technology of knowledge management and decision making for the 21st century |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-12-443880-4 |pages= 1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) software.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|date=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-13-103805-2|pages=22–23|url=http://stpk.cs.rtu.lv/sites/all/files/stpk/materiali/MI/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf|access-date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–331}}{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=327–335, 434–435}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=145–62, 197−203}} However, some experts point out that expert systems were not part of true [[artificial intelligence]] since they lack the ability to learn autonomously from external data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas and Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land? On the Interpretations, Illustrations and Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Business Horizons, 62(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the [[inference engine]] and the [[knowledge base]]. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrmars.com/admin/pics/261.pdf Nwigbo Stella and Agbo Okechuku Chuks], School of Science Education, Expert system: a catalyst in educational development in Nigeria: "''Knowledge-based systems collect the small fragments of human know-how into a knowledge-base which is used to reason through a problem, using the knowledge that is appropriated''"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Expert systems were introduced around 1965&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology.kenyon.edu/slonc/bio3/AI/TIMELINE/timeline.html kenyon.edu: AI Timeline], retrieved October 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by [[Edward Feigenbaum]], who is sometimes termed the "father of expert systems"; other key early contributors were Bruce Buchanan and Randall Davis. The Stanford researchers tried to identify domains where expertise was highly valued and complex, such as diagnosing infectious diseases ([[Mycin]]) and identifying unknown organic molecules ([[Dendral]]). The idea that "intelligent systems derive their power from the knowledge they possess rather than from the specific formalisms and inference schemes they use"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Feigenbaum, 1977. Paraphrased by Hayes-Roth, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; – as Feigenbaum said – was at the time a significant step forward, since the past research had been focused on heuristic computational methods, culminating in attempts to develop very general-purpose problem solvers (foremostly the conjunct work of [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert_A._Simon|Herbert Simon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|pages=6–7|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert systems became some of the first truly successful forms of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) software.&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster"/&gt;{{sfn|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=227–331}}{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 17.4}}{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=327–335, 434–435}}{{sfn|Crevier|1993|pp=145–62, 197−203}}

Research on expert systems was also active in France. While in the US the focus tended to be on rule-based systems, first on systems hard coded on top of [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] programming environments and then on expert system shells developed by vendors such as [[IntelliCorp (software)|Intellicorp]], in France research focused more on systems developed in [[Prolog]]. The advantage of expert system shells was that they were somewhat easier for nonprogrammers to use.  The advantage of Prolog environments was that they weren't focused only on ''if-then'' rules; Prolog environments provided a much fuller realization of a complete [[First Order Logic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Luger and William A. Stubblefield, Benjamin/Cummings Publishers, Rule Based Expert System Shell: example of code using the Prolog rule based expert system shell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/engdep1/download/prolog/htm_docs/prolog.htm A. Michiels], Université de Liège, Belgique: "PROLOG, the first declarative language&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, expert systems proliferated.  Universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the [[Fortune 500]] companies applied the technology in daily business activities.&lt;ref name=durkinhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durkin, J. Expert Systems: Catalog of Applications. Intelligent Computer Systems, Inc., Akron, OH, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was international with the [[Fifth generation computer|Fifth Generation Computer Systems project]] in Japan and increased research funding in Europe.

In 1981, the first [[IBM PC]], with the [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] operating system, was introduced. The imbalance between the high affordability of the relatively powerful chips in the PC, compared to the much more expensive cost of processing power in the mainframes that dominated the corporate IT world at the time, created a new type of architecture for corporate computing, termed the [[client-server model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfali|first=Robert|title=The Essential Client/Server Survival Guide|year=1996|publisher=Wiley Computer Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-471-15325-7|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calculations and reasoning could be performed at a fraction of the price of a mainframe using a PC. This model also enabled business units to bypass corporate IT departments and directly build their own applications. As a result, client server had a tremendous impact on the expert systems market. Expert systems were already outliers in much of the business world, requiring new skills that many IT departments did not have and were not eager to develop. They were a natural fit for new PC-based shells that promised to put application development into the hands of end users and experts. Until then, the main development environment for expert systems had been high end [[Lisp machine]]s from [[Xerox]], [[Symbolics]], and [[Texas Instruments]]. With the rise of the PC and client server computing, vendors such as Intellicorp and Inference Corporation shifted their priorities to developing PC based tools. Also, new vendors, often financed by [[venture capital]] (such as Aion Corporation, [[Neuron Data]], Exsys, and many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|title=Smart or Lucky: How Technology Leaders Turn Chance into Success|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Son|isbn=1118033787|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KrTQzQHl7AC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=expert+systems+failed+to+live+up+to+hype#v=onepage&amp;q=expert%20systems%20failed%20to%20live%20up%20to%20hype&amp;f=false|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert J. |last=Dunn |date=September 30, 1985 |title=Expandable Expertise for Everyday Users |page=30 |journal=InfoWorld |volume=7 |issue=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iS8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |access-date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;), started appearing regularly.

The first expert system to be used in a design capacity for a large-scale product was the SID (Synthesis of Integral Design) software program, developed in 1982. Written in [[LISP]], SID generated 93% of the [[VAX 9000]] CPU logic gates.&lt;ref name="SIDDTJ"&gt;Carl S. Gibson, et al, VAX 9000 SERIES, Digital Technical Journal of Digital Equipment Corporation, Volume 2, Number 4, Fall 1990, pp118-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Input to the software was a set of rules created by several expert logic designers. SID expanded the rules and generated software [[logic synthesis]] routines many times the size of the rules themselves. Surprisingly, the combination of these rules resulted in an overall design that exceeded the capabilities of the experts themselves, and in many cases out-performed the human counterparts.  While some rules contradicted others, top-level control parameters for speed and area provided the tie-breaker. The program was highly controversial, but used nevertheless due to project budget constraints. It was terminated by logic designers after the VAX 9000 project completion.

In the 1990s and beyond, the term ''expert system'' and the idea of a standalone AI system mostly dropped from the IT lexicon. There are two interpretations of this. One is that "expert systems failed": the IT world moved on because expert systems didn't deliver on their over hyped promise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainewsletter.com/newsletters/aix_0501.htm#w AI Expert Newsletter: W is for Winter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejlt.org//article/view/14/1 Leith P., "The rise and fall of the legal expert system", in European Journal of Law and Technology, Vol 1, Issue 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the mirror opposite, that expert systems were simply victims of their success: as IT professionals grasped concepts such as rule engines, such tools migrated from being standalone tools for developing special purpose ''expert'' systems, to being one of many standard tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haskin|first=David|title=Years After Hype, 'Expert Systems' Paying Off For Some|journal=Datamation|date=January 16, 2003|url=http://www.datamation.com/netsys/article.php/1570851/Years-After-Hype-Expert-Systems-Paying-Off-For-Some.htm|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the leading major business application suite vendors (such as [[SAP (software)|SAP]], [[Siebel Systems|Siebel]], and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) integrated expert system abilities into their suite of products as a way of specifying business logic – rule engines are no longer simply for defining the rules an expert would use but for any type of complex, volatile, and critical business logic; they often go hand in hand with business process automation and integration environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SAP News Desk|title=SAP News Desk IntelliCorp Announces Participation in SAP EcoHub|url=http://laszlo.sys-con.com/node/946452|work=laszlo.sys-con.com |publisher=LaszloTrack|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pegasystems|title=Smart BPM Requires Smart Business Rules|url=http://www.pega.com/business-rules |work=pega.com|access-date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Zhao |first=Kai |first2=Shi |last2=Ying |first3=Linlin |last3=Zhang |first4=Luokai |last4=Hu |title=Achieving business process and business rules integration using SPL |book-title=Future Information Technology and Management Engineering (FITME) |date=9–10 Oct 2010 |volume=2 |pages=329–332 |location=Changzhou, China |publisher=IEEE |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5656297&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5656297 |doi=10.1109/fitme.2010.5656297 |isbn=978-1-4244-9087-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software architecture ==
An expert system is an example of a [[knowledge-based system]]. Expert systems were the first commercial systems to use a knowledge-based architecture. A knowledge-based system is essentially composed of two sub-systems: the [[knowledge base]] and the [[inference engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Reid |title=Knowledge-Based Systems Concepts, Techniques, Examples |url=http://www.reidgsmith.com/Knowledge-Based_Systems_-_Concepts_Techniques_Examples_08-May-1985.pdf |website=Reid G. Smith |access-date=9 November 2013|date=May 8, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge base represents facts about the world. In early expert systems such as Mycin and Dendral, these facts were represented mainly as flat assertions about variables. In later expert systems developed with commercial shells, the knowledge base took on more structure and used concepts from object-oriented programming. The world was represented as classes, subclasses, and instances and assertions were replaced by values of object instances. The rules worked by querying and asserting values of the objects.

The inference engine is an [[automated reasoning system]] that evaluates the current state of the knowledge-base, applies relevant rules, and then asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base. The inference engine may also include abilities for explanation, so that it can explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted in the assertion.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth 1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are mainly two modes for an inference engine: [[forward chaining]] and [[backward chaining]]. The different approaches are dictated by whether the inference engine is being driven by the antecedent (left hand side) or the consequent (right hand side) of the rule. In forward chaining an antecedent fires and asserts the consequent. For example, consider the following rule:

&lt;math&gt;R1: \mathit{Man}(x) \implies \mathit{Mortal}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

A simple example of forward chaining would be to assert Man(Socrates) to the system and then trigger the inference engine. It would match R1 and assert Mortal(Socrates) into the knowledge base.

Backward chaining is a bit less straight forward. In backward chaining the system looks at possible conclusions and works backward to see if they might be true. So if the system was trying to determine if Mortal(Socrates) is true it would find R1 and query the knowledge base to see if Man(Socrates) is true. One of the early innovations of expert systems shells was to integrate inference engines with a user interface. This could be especially powerful with backward chaining. If the system needs to know a particular fact but doesn't, then it can simply generate an input screen and ask the user if the information is known. So in this example, it could use R1 to ask the user if Socrates was a Man and then use that new information accordingly.

The use of rules to explicitly represent knowledge also enabled explanation abilities. In the simple example above if the system had used R1 to assert that Socrates was Mortal and a user wished to understand why Socrates was mortal they could query the system and the system would look back at the rules which fired to cause the assertion and present those rules to the user as an explanation. In English if the user asked "Why is Socrates Mortal?" the system would reply "Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man".  A significant area for research was the generation of explanations from the knowledge base in natural English rather than simply by showing the more formal but less intuitive rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccis2k.org/iajit/PDF/vol.4,no.1/9-Nabil.pdf Nabil Arman], Polytechnic University of Palestine, January 2007, Fault Detection in Dynamic Rule Bases Using Spanning Trees and Disjoin Sets: ""&lt;/ref&gt;

As expert systems evolved, many new techniques were incorporated into various types of inference engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8 |issue= 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most important of these were:

* Truth maintenance. These systems record the dependencies in a knowledge-base so that when facts are altered, dependent knowledge can be altered accordingly. For example, if the system learns that Socrates is no longer known to be a man it will revoke the assertion that Socrates is mortal.
* Hypothetical reasoning. In this, the knowledge base can be divided up into many possible views, a.k.a. worlds. This allows the inference engine to explore multiple possibilities in parallel. For example, the system may want to explore the consequences of both assertions, what will be true if Socrates is a Man and what will be true if he is not?
* Fuzzy logic. One of the first extensions of simply using rules to represent knowledge was also to associate a probability with each rule. So, not to assert that Socrates is mortal, but to assert Socrates ''may'' be mortal with some probability value. Simple probabilities were extended in some systems with sophisticated mechanisms for uncertain reasoning and combination of probabilities.
* Ontology classification. With the addition of object classes to the knowledge base, a new type of reasoning was possible. Along with reasoning simply about object values, the system could also reason about object structures. In this simple example, Man can represent an object class and R1 can be redefined as a rule that defines the class of all men.  These types of special purpose inference engines are termed [[Deductive classifier|classifiers]]. Although they were not highly used in expert systems, classifiers are very powerful for unstructured volatile domains, and are a key technology for the Internet and the emerging [[Semantic Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|access-date=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages  ==
The goal of knowledge-based systems is to make the critical information required for the system to work explicit rather than implicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|page=6|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a traditional computer program the logic is embedded in code that can typically only be reviewed by an IT specialist. With an expert system the goal was to specify the rules in a format that was intuitive and easily understood, reviewed, and even edited by domain experts rather than IT experts. The benefits of this explicit knowledge representation were rapid development and ease of maintenance.

Ease of maintenance is the most obvious benefit. This was achieved in two ways. First, by removing the need to write conventional code, many of the normal problems that can be caused by even small changes to a system could be avoided with expert systems.  Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine. This also was a reason for the second benefit: [[rapid prototyping]]. With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.

A claim for expert system shells that was often made was that they removed the need for trained programmers and that experts could develop systems themselves. In reality, this was seldom if ever true. While the rules for an expert system were more comprehensible than typical computer code, they still had a formal syntax where a misplaced comma or other character could cause havoc as with any other computer language. Also, as expert systems moved from prototypes in the lab to deployment in the business world, issues of integration and maintenance became far more critical. Inevitably demands to integrate with, and take advantage of, large legacy databases and systems arose. To accomplish this, integration required the same skills as any other type of system.&lt;ref name="Wong 1995 141–152"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=Bo K.|first2=John A.|last3=Monaco|title=Expert system applications in business: a review and analysis of the literature|journal=Information and Management|date=September 1995|volume=29|issue=3|pages=141–152|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218565&amp;CFID=383824649&amp;CFTOKEN=44575196|access-date=29 November 2013|doi=10.1016/0378-7206(95)00023-p|last2=Monaco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
The most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the [[knowledge acquisition]] problem. Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult, but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization. As a result of this problem, a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition, to help automate the process of designing, debugging, and maintaining rules defined by experts. However, when looking at the life-cycle of expert systems in actual use, other problems – essentially the same problems as those of any other large system – seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition: integration, access to large databases, and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Performance could be especially problematic because early expert systems were built using tools (such as earlier Lisp versions) that interpreted code expressions without first compiling them. This provided a powerful development environment, but with the drawback that it was virtually impossible to match the efficiency of the fastest compiled languages (such as [[C (programming language)|C]]). System and database integration were difficult for early expert systems because the tools were mostly in languages and platforms that were neither familiar to nor welcome in most corporate IT environments – programming languages such as Lisp and Prolog, and hardware platforms such as [[Lisp machine]]s and personal computers. As a result, much effort in the later stages of expert system tool development was focused on integrating with legacy environments such as [[COBOL]] and large database systems, and on porting to more standard platforms. These issues were resolved mainly by the client-server paradigm shift, as PCs were gradually accepted in the IT environment as a legitimate platform for serious business system development and as affordable [[minicomputer]] servers provided the processing power needed for AI applications.&lt;ref name="Wong 1995 141–152"/&gt;

== Applications ==
Hayes-Roth divides expert systems applications into 10 categories illustrated in the following table. The example applications were not in the original Hayes-Roth table, and some of them arose well afterward. Any application that is not footnoted is described in the Hayes-Roth book.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Roth 1983"/&gt; Also, while these categories provide an intuitive framework to describe the space of expert systems applications, they are not rigid categories, and in some cases an application may show traits of more than one category.

Hearsay was an early attempt at solving voice recognition through an expert systems approach. For the most part this category or expert systems was not all that successful. Hearsay and all interpretation systems are essentially pattern recognition systems—looking for patterns in noisy data. In the case of Hearsay recognizing phonemes in an audio stream. Other early examples were analyzing sonar data to detect Russian submarines. These kinds of systems proved much more amenable to a [[artificial neural network|neural network]] AI solution than a rule-based approach.

CADUCEUS and [[MYCIN]] were medical diagnosis systems. The user describes their symptoms to the computer as they would to a doctor and the computer returns a medical diagnosis.

Dendral was a tool to study hypothesis formation in the identification of organic molecules. The general problem it solved—designing a solution given a set of constraints—was one of the most successful areas for early expert systems applied to business domains such as salespeople configuring [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[VAX]] computers and mortgage loan application development.

The '''eye–hand span''' is the distance across part of a text, usually a linguistic text that is being copied via typing or a piece of [[Music notation|notated music]] that is being performed, defined as the distance between the position of the [[human eye|eye]]s acquiring that information and the [[hand]](s) typing or performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Land |first=Michael F. |last2=Tatler |first2=Benjamin W. |title=Looking and Acting |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2009 |page=67 |isbn=978-0-19-857094-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the eye–hand span is typically measured from the location of [[Fovea centralis|central visual input]], and stretches between the [[syllable]] or [[Chord (music)|chord]] currently being typed or performed, and the lateral location of the simultaneous fixation.  This distance may be measured either in units of linear measurement or in characters or other "bits" of data.  Some authors refer to the eye–hand span as the "perceptual span" for the visual information perceivable around the region of center of vision used in reading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Rayner|title=Eye Movements in Reading: Perceptual and Language Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx51Brw60cMC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-14628-9|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases including [[peripheral vision|peripheral input]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Keith |last=Rayner |first2=Alexander |last2=Pollatsek |title=Eye Movements, the Eye-Hand Span, and the Perceptual Span during Sight-Reading of Music |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=49–53 [p. 49] |jstor=20182443 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep11512647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eye–hand span is analogous to the eye–voice span in [[Reading (process)|reading]] [[language]] aloud and in [[singing]].

'''''Gestell''''' (or sometimes '''''Ge-stell''''') is a [[German language|German]] word used by twentieth-century German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Martin Heidegger]] to describe what lies behind or beneath modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was derived from the root word ''stellen'', which means "to put" or "to place" and combined with the German prefix ''Ge-'', which denotes a form of "gathering" or "collection".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger on Technology|last=Wendland|first=Aaron|last2=Merwin|first2=Christopher|last3=Hadjioannou|first3=Christos|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138674615|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Heidegger's notion of ''Gestell''==
Heidegger applied the concept of ''Gestell'' to his exposition of the [[essence]] of [[technology]]. He concluded that technology is fundamentally '''Enframing''' (''Gestell'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As such, the essence of technology is ''Gestell''. Indeed, "''Gestell'', literally 'framing', is an all-encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of [[human]] [[existence]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110153844/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |archivedate=2006-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this "mode of ordering" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Bodies and New Technologies: Rethinking Embodiment in a Cyber-era|last=du Preez|first=Amanda|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443813235|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defining the essence of technology as ''Gestell'', Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the "standing-reserve." Heidegger writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays'' (New York: Harper, 1977), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving ''Gestell'' an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, ''Gestell'' is literally a challenging forth, or ''perform''ative "gathering together", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, "standing reserve" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal-mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Boetzkes|first=Amanda|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409456131|location=Oxon|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, "it drives out every other possibility of revealing" and that it "conceals that revealing which, in the sense of ''[[poiesis]]'', lets what presences come forth into appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger's Later Philosophy|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521809223|location=Cambridge|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Tara''' is a 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat [[Majapahit]] period gold image of a Hindu goddess discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan]] in 1918. When it was purchased by the Field Museum of Chicago, they renamed it as '''Agusan Gold Image''', though this name is rejected by scholars in the Philippines.

[[H. Otley Beyer]] believed that the image was that of a [[Hindu]] [[Shaivism|Sivaite goddess]], but with the religiously important hand signals improperly copied by local workmen.  Thus it suggests that Hinduism was already in the Philippines before [[Ferdinand Magellan]] arrived, but also suggests that the early Filipinos had an imperfect version of Hinduism which they got from the Majapahit.

{{Quote|A study of this image was made by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, of Batavia, in 1920, who came to the conclusion that it was made by local workmen in Mindanao, copying a [[Nganjuk Regency|Nganjuk]] images of the early Majapahit period - except that the local artist overlooked the distinguishing attributes held in the hand. It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century. The image is apparently that of a Sivaite goddess, and fits in well with the name "Butuan" (signifying "phallus").|[[H. Otley Beyer]]|1947&lt;ref name=ob&gt;H. Otley Beyer, "Outline Review of Philippine Archaeology by Islands and Provinces," Philippine Journal of Science, Vol.77,Nos.34 (July–August 1947),pp. 205-374&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After its discovery in 1918 by a [[Manobo]] woman named Bilay Campos, it was stolen while being safeguarded inside a hidden chest inside her traditional Manobo house. Before being stolen, the tribe of Manobos, where Campos belonged to, viewed the Golden Tara as a ''diwata'', a nature spirit deemed to protect the vastness of their ancestral domain's rainforests and waterways. Later on, the artifact would land in the possession of the area's governor for unknown links. The artifact would later be sold in a multinational company, where the governor was indebted to with a large sum of money. For unknown reasons, the artifact eventually landed for auction, prompting H. Otley Beyer to demand the Philippine government to buy the artifact for the sake of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] and the Philippine nation. However, during that time, the country was in deep financial constraint, and was unable to buy the artifact. The Golden Tara was purchased by the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] of Chicago, Illinois in 1922 for a sum of approximately 4,000 pesos. According to the Field Museum, the artifact was purchased to save it from being melted at the time because the Philippines was having a hard time with its finances, which may have led to the minting of the artifact to aid in the country's financial losses. The purchase was funded through a campaign in Chicago to buy the artifact, with the aid of the American government, which at the time was also the colonial government in the Philippines. By 2010, the artifact's price has risen to approximately 1.5 million Philippine pesos.

[[File:Golden Tara - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|left|A statue of the Golden Tara in [[Butuan]]]]
The artifact has been a source of conflict between Filipinos and Americans for many years as many Filipino scholars have demanded for the return of the Golden Tara, as it is a national treasure of the country, unreported during the time of discovery, and sold to Americans during a great financial loss to the country - the very reason why the Philippine government at the time was not able to buy the artifact when it was auctioned. Scholars have argued that if the reason why the Field Museum took the artifact was because they fear that it may have been melted down, why has the Field Museum not returned or at least let the Philippines buy the artifact back since no group in the Philippines advocates for its melting anymore. On top of the argument is the cunning way the artifact was bought by an American museum during a time when the Philippines was in financial constraint under the colonial government of America. One of the major protesters for the return of the Golden Tara to Philippine possession is former senator [[Aquilino Pimentel Jr.]], who made his last privilege speech in the Senate specifically for the purpose of returning the Golden Tara to the Philippines. The Field Museum in Chicago has said that it may return the Golden Tara if it is 'strongly requested' by the Philippine government. In April 2018, a documentary from GMA Network featured the Golden Tara again, this time showing the people of [[Agusan del Sur]] supporting the return of the Golden Tara into the Philippines. Scholars have also found the document proving the right to claim of the Philippines on the Golden Tara. The scholars, in partnership with the government, have been tasked to pursue the Philippine claim on the Golden Tara, housed in the Field Museum in Chicago, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippines.fieldmuseum.org/heritage/narrative/4820|title=Agusan Gold Vajralasya|work=Philippine Heritage Collection|publisher=[[Field Museum of Natural History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''government platform''' is a [[political platform]] of a government. A new government, when entering office, lists their objectives to be accomplished while in office.

Government platforms are especially important in [[coalition government]]s, where several parties with possibly conflicting [[political platform]]s agree on a compromise. The distinction between a party platform and a government platform may be blurred in countries where single parties often form governments, but the distinction is still significant.

'''HED meteorites''' are a clan (subgroup) of [[achondrite]] meteorites. HED stands for "[[howardite]]–[[eucrite]]–[[diogenite]]".
These achondrites came from a differentiated parent body and experienced extensive igneous processing not much different from the magmatic rocks found on Earth and for this reason they closely resemble terrestrial igneous rocks.&lt;ref name="meteoritefrcarb"&gt;[http://www.meteorite.fr/en/classification/carbonaceous.htm All about Meteorites]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
HED meteorites are broadly divided into:
* [[Howardite]]s
* [[Eucrite]]s
* [[Diogenite]]s
Several subgroups of both eucrites and diogenites have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Delaney |first=J.

==Origin==

[[File:JohnstownDiogenite.jpg|thumb|[[Johnstown (meteorite)|Johnstown]], diogenite]]
These are all thought to have originated from the crust of the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], their differences being due to different geologic histories of the parent rock. Their crystallization ages have been determined to be between 4.43 and 4.55 billion years from [[radioisotope]] ratios. HED meteorites are [[Igneous differentiation|differentiated meteorites]], which were created by igneous processes in the crust of their parent asteroid.

It is thought that the method of transport from Vesta to [[Earth]] is as follows:&lt;ref name="meteorics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drake |first=Michael J. |title=The eucrite/Vesta story |journal=Meteoritics and Planetary Science |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=501–513 |date=2001 |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2001.tb01892.x |bibcode = 2001M&amp;PS...36..501D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An impact on Vesta ejected debris, creating small ({{convert|10|km}} [[diameter]] or less) [[V-type asteroid]]s. Either the asteroidal chunks were ejected as such, or were formed from smaller debris. Some of these small asteroids formed the [[Vesta family]], while others were scattered somewhat further.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Binzel |first=R.

The amount of rock that was excavated there is many times more than enough to account for all known V-type asteroids.
# Some of the more far-flung asteroid debris ended up in the 3:1 [[Kirkwood gap]]. This is an unstable region due to strong perturbations by [[Jupiter]], and asteroids which end up here get ejected onto far different orbits on a timescale of about 100 million years. Some of these bodies are perturbed into near-Earth orbits forming the small V-type [[near-Earth asteroid]]s such as e.g. [[3551 Verenia]], [[3908 Nyx]], or [[4055 Magellan]].
# Later smaller impacts on these near-Earth objects dislodged rock-sized meteorites, some of which later struck Earth. On the basis of [[cosmic ray]] exposure measurements, it is thought that most HED meteorites arose from several distinct impact events of this kind, and spent from about 6 million to 73 million years in space before striking the Earth.&lt;ref name="geochimica"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eugster |first=O. |last2=Michel |first2=Th. |bibcode=1995GeCoA..59..177E |title=Common asteroid break-up events of eucrites, diogenites, and howardites, and cosmic-ray production rates for noble gases in achondrites |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=177–199 |date=1995 |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(94)00327-I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''higher-order abstract syntax''' (abbreviated '''HOAS''') is a technique for the representation of [[abstract syntax tree]]s for languages with variable [[name binding|binders]].

==Relation to first-order abstract syntax==

An abstract syntax tree is ''abstract'' because it is a [[mathematical object]] that has certain structure by its very nature. For instance, in ''[[first-order abstract syntax]]'' (''FOAS'') trees, as commonly used in [[compiler]]s, the tree structure implies the subexpression relation, meaning that no parentheses are required to disambiguate programs (as they are in the [[concrete syntax]]). HOAS exposes additional structure: the relationship between variables and their binding sites. In FOAS representations, a variable is typically represented with an identifier, with the relation between binding site and use being indicated by using the ''same'' identifier. With HOAS, there is no name for the variable; each use of the variable refers directly to the binding site.

There are a number of reasons why this technique is useful. First, it makes the binding structure of a program explicit: just as there is no need to explain operator precedence in a FOAS representation, there is no need to have the rules of binding and scope at hand to interpret a HOAS representation. Second, programs that are 
[[lambda calculus|alpha-equivalent]] (differing only in the names of bound variables) have identical representations in HOAS, which can make equivalence checking more efficient. &lt;!-- other uses? --&gt;

==Implementation==

One mathematical object that could be used to implement HOAS is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] where variables are associated with their binding sites via [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. Another popular way to implement HOAS (in, for example, compilers) is with [[de Bruijn index|de Bruijn indices]].

==Use in logical frameworks==
In the domain of [[logical framework]]s, the term higher-order abstract syntax is usually used to refer to a specific representation that uses the binders of the [[metalanguage|meta-language]] to encode the binding structure of the [[object language]].

For instance, the logical framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]] has a λ-construct, which has arrow
(→) type. A first-order encoding of an object language construct &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; would be (using [[Twelf]]
syntax):

 exp : type.
 var : type.
 v : var -&gt; exp.
 let : exp -&gt; var -&gt; exp -&gt; exp.

Here, &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; is the family of object language expressions. The family &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; is the representation of variables (implemented perhaps as natural numbers, which is not shown); the constant &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; witnesses the fact that variables are expressions. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is an expression that takes three arguments: an expression (that is being bound), a variable (that it is bound to) and another expression (that the variable is bound within).

The [[canonical form|canonical]] HOAS representation of the same object language would be:

 exp : type.
 let : exp -&gt; (exp -&gt; exp) -&gt; exp.

In this representation, object level variables do not appear explicitly. The constant &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; takes an expression (that is being bound) and a meta-level function &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; 
(the body of the let). This function is the ''higher-order'' part: an expression with a free variable is
represented as an expression with ''holes'' that are filled in by the meta-level function when applied. As a concrete example, we would construct the object level expression

 let x = 1 + 2
 in x + 3

(assuming the natural constructors for numbers and addition) using the HOAS signature above as

 let (plus 1 2) ([y] plus y 3)

where &lt;code&gt;[y] e&lt;/code&gt; is Twelf's syntax for the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda y.e&lt;/math&gt;.

This specific representation has advantages beyond the ones above: for one, by reusing the meta-level notion of binding, the encoding enjoys properties such as type-preserving ''substitution'' without the need to define/prove them. In this way using HOAS can drastically reduce the amount of [[boilerplate code]] having to do with binding in an encoding.

Higher-order abstract syntax is generally only applicable when object language variables can be understood as variables in the mathematical sense (that is, as stand-ins for arbitrary members of some domain). This is often, but not always, the case: for instance, there are no advantages to be gained from a HOAS encoding of [[scope (programming)#Dynamic scoping|dynamic scope]] as it appears in some dialects of [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] because dynamically scoped variables do not act like mathematical variables.

'''Holozoic nutrition''' (Greek: ''holo''-whole ; ''zoikos''-of animals) is a type of [[heterotrophic nutrition|heterotrophic]] [[nutrition]] that is characterized by the internalization ([[ingestion]]) and internal processing of gaseous, liquid or solid food particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Integrated Principles of Zoology, 14th ed.|vauthors=Hickman C, Roberts L, Keen S, Larson A, I'Anson H, Eisenhour D |publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Protozoa]], such as [[amoeba]]s, and most of the free living animals,such as animals, exhibit this type of nutrition. 

In Holozoic nutrition the energy and organic building blocks are obtained by ingesting and then digesting other organisms or pieces of other organisms, including blood and decaying organic matter.  This contrasts with [[holophytic nutrition]], in which energy and organic building blocks are obtained through [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemosynthesis]], and with saprozoic nutrition, in which [[digestive enzyme]]s are released externally and the resulting [[monomer]]s (small organic molecules) are absorbed directly from the environment.

There are several stages of holozoic nutrition, which often occur in separate compartments within an organism (such as the stomach and intestines):
#[[Ingestion]]: In animals, this is merely takes place by engulfing the food totally in the mouth.  In protozoa, this most commonly occurs through [[phagocytosis]].
#[[Digestion]]: The physical breakdown of complex large and organic food particles and the [[Enzyme|enzymatic]] breakdown of complex organic compounds into small, simple molecules.
#[[Digestion#Overview of vertebrate digestion|Absorption]]: The [[Active transport|active]] and [[passive transport]] of the chemical products of digestion out of the food-containing compartment and into the body or cytoplasm.[[Assimilation (biology)|Assimilation]]: Utilization of the absorbed molecules for various [[Metabolism|metabolic]] processes.
#[[Egestion]]: The expulsion of undigested material, commonly called [[defecating]]

'''Intimacy''' is the degree to which a person can share feelings with another in a [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]. Intimacy is occasionally linked with [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] but it can also occur in a [[Platonic love|nonsexual]] or unromantic relationship. The [[dialectic]]s of connection-autonomy and openness-closedness manipulate the communication of intimacy between partners.

{{rape}}
{{Main article|Rape}}
'''Rape''' is a type of [[sexual assault]] initiated by one or more persons against another person without that person's [[consent]]. The act may be carried out by physical force, or where the person is under threat or manipulation, or with a person who is incapable of valid consent.'''&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|date=15 April 2011|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape%5B3%5D}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual violence chapter 6|work=[[World Health Organization]]|date=15 April 2011|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|date=15 April 2011|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape|publisher=legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com|date=15 April 2011|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/rape}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the name of a [[statutory]] crime in jurisdictions such as [[England and Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[California]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], and is a legal term of art used in the definition of the offence of [[sexual violation]] in [[New Zealand]].

Definitions of ''rape'' vary, and though rape is usually dependent upon whether or not consent was present during the act,&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=who.int/&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary.reference.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary.com/&gt; the term "consent" varies as well. [[Minor (law)|Minors]], for example, are often considered too young to consent to sexual relations with older persons (see [[statutory rape]] and [[age of consent]]).&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary.com/&gt; Consent is also considered invalid if obtained under [[duress]], or from a person who does not have the ability to understand the nature of the act, due to factors such as young age, mental disability, or substance intoxication.&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary.com/&gt;

Many jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], and the several [[U.S. state|US]] and [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]], have abandoned the term 'rape' in favor of other terms such as 'sexual assault', 'sexual intercourse without consent', 'criminal sexual conduct', etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/25.%20Sexual%20Offences/%E2%80%98rape%E2%80%99-penetrative-sexual-offence&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and definitions==

===Classification===
Depending on the jurisdiction, rape may be characterized as a [[sexual offence]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[offence against the person]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] and the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rape may also be characterized as a form of [[aggravated assault]] or [[Battery (crime)|battery]], or both, [[indecent assault]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, in [[England and Wales]] before the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act 2003: R v Hodgson [1973] QB 565 (indecent assault on a woman held to be an alternative verdict to rape in a case where the accused was acquitted of rape on grounds of the consent of the victim, who was aged under 16, which was not, by virtue of section 14(2) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, a defence to indecent assault)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[sexual assault]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, in [[England and Wales]] after the enactment of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; or battery, or both.

===Actus reus===
To sustain a conviction, rape might require proof that the defendant had [[sexual penetration]] with another person. Depending on the jurisdiction, the [[actus reus]] of rape may consist of "having [[carnal knowledge]] of" a woman,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under the [[common law]] of England, and at common law in [[Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt; or "having [[Sexual intercourse#Consent and sexual offenses|sexual intercourse]] with" a woman (including a girl) specifically,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976]] as read with section 46 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]]&lt;/ref&gt; or either a woman or a man (including a girl or a boy) generally,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 1 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]], as substituted by section 142 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]], and read with section 46 of the former mentioned Act&lt;/ref&gt; or engaging in sexual intercourse with a person (which term includes an [[intersex]] person who might arguably be neither a woman nor a man)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 261 of the California Penal Code,&lt;/ref&gt; or having "sexual connection" with a person affected by penile penetration of that person's genitalia,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 128(2) of the [[Crimes Act 1961]]&lt;/ref&gt; or penile penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth (these terms construed as including surgically constructed organs) of a person.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, under section 1 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Prosecutor v. Anto Furundžija'', the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] included [[fellatio]] in the definition of rape, because [para 183]: "The Trial Chamber holds that the forced penetration of the mouth by the male sexual organ constitutes a most humiliating and degrading attack upon human dignity. The essence of the whole corpus of international humanitarian law as well as human rights law lies in the protection of the human dignity of every person, whatever his or her gender".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/furundzija/tjug/en/fur-tj981210e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mens rea===
Countries around the world differ in how they deal with the [[mens rea]] element in the law regarding rape, (i.e. the belief of the accused that the victim is not consenting or might not be consenting), and in how they place the onus of proof with regard to belief of consent.

For example, under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], the belief must be "reasonable" and "Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions the mens rea is quite complex, such as in [[New South Wales]], where the law reads:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61ha.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 61HA Consent in relation to sexual assault offences

(3) Knowledge about consent

A person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person ''knows that the other person does not consent''&lt;ref&gt;the expression "knows that the other person does not consent" refers to its use in section 61I Sexual assault [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61i.html]&lt;/ref&gt; to the sexual intercourse if:

:(a) the person knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse, or

:(b) the person is reckless as to whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, or

:(c) the person has no reasonable grounds for believing that the other person consents to the sexual intercourse.

For the purpose of making any such finding, the trier of fact must have regard to all the circumstances of the case:

:(d) including any steps taken by the person to ascertain whether the other person consents to the sexual intercourse, but

:(e) not including any self-induced intoxication of the person.

The Explanatory Report of the Istanbul Convention, states at para 189: "The interpretation of the word “intentionally” is left to domestic law, but the requirement for intentional conduct relates to all the elements of the offence". [in regard to Article 36 of the Convention – Sexual violence, including rape].&lt;ref&gt;http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendant circumstances===
Rape has been defined so as to require proof that the sexual act in question was done without the victim's [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by section 1 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; or so as to require proof that it was done either without their consent or, alternatively, against their will.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, by section 261 of the California Penal Code&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not always a requirement that the victim did not consent. In the England and Wales, section 5 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] creates the offence of "rape of a child under 13" and contains no reference to consent. After describing the sexual act the offence prohibits, the explanatory notes to the Act say "whether or not the child consented to this act is irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Offences Act 2003: Explanatory Notes, paragraph 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M.C. v. Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22dmdocnumber%22:[%22699398%22],%22itemid%22:[%22001-61521%22]}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the victim does not necessarily have to resist physically for the crime of rape to be committed [para 166]:
:"[T]he Court is persuaded that any rigid approach to the prosecution of sexual offences, such as requiring proof of physical resistance in all circumstances, risks leaving certain types of rape unpunished and thus jeopardising the effective protection of the individual's sexual autonomy. In accordance with contemporary standards and trends in that area, the member States' positive obligations under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention [Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] must be seen as requiring the penalisation and effective prosecution of any non-consensual sexual act, including in the absence of physical resistance by the victim."

Some circumstances, such as where the victim is kidnapped or in detention, or under conditions of war or genocide, may be viewed as so coercive, that they presume non-consent altogether; for example in ''ICTY, The Prosecutor v. Kunarac, Kovac and Vukovic'', it was ruled, in regard to the [[rape during the Bosnian War]], where women were kept in detention centers, under extremely harsh conditions, and were selected for sex by soldiers and policemen, that [para 132]: "Such detentions amount to circumstances that were so coercive as to negate any possibility of consent".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icrc.org/casebook/doc/case-study/icty-kunarac-kovac-vukovic-case-study.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue arises in law as who can legally consent, for example with regard to persons who suffer from mental or physical disability. Although laws differ by jurisdiction, emerging international standards suggest that a person's mental or physical disability, should not, ''in and of itself'', render the sexual interaction illegal, but rather ''the exploitation or abuse'' of such disability by the perpetrator should do so: in the [[European Union]], the ''Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011'' reads (with regard to the determination of legal consent of a child who is above the [[age of consent]]): "(10) Disability, by itself, does not automatically constitute an impossibility to consent to sexual relations. However, the abuse of the existence of such a disability in order to engage in sexual activities with a child should be criminalised".&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:335:0001:0014:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redefinitions and statute ===

==== General ====
{{Further information|History of rape}}
From the second part of the 20th century onwards, the crime of rape has undergone major changes in definition in many countries, especially in [[Western countries]]. It has evolved from its narrow traditional definition of forced penetration of a vagina by a penis, outside of [[marriage]], to a broader definition, which includes forced sex in marriage ([[marital rape]]), and may also include other sexual acts (such as [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sexual penetration); the latter were traditionally dealt with under [[sodomy law]]s. This redefinition of rape had the effect of defining [[male rape]]. There have also been changes in the legal definition of consent/coercion.&lt;ref name="The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology"&gt;{{Google books |id=VWttAAAAQBAJ |page=1 |title=The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different changes have been made in recent decades in many jurisdictions in regard to the criminal offense of rape as it relates to marital status:

*the criminalization of rape between spouses ('marital rape')
*the removal of the stipulation that, if after the act of rape the victim and the perpetrator get married to each other, the prosecution ends ('marry-your-rapist law')

==== Marital rape ====
{{Main article|Marital rape}}
Throughout much of the history, rape in marriage was not a crime. Most cultures subscribed to the idea of the existence of 'conjugal rights' to sexual intercourse with one's spouse, and, until well into the 20th century, most legal systems generally accepted, overtly or tacitly, that such 'rights' could be taken by force, against the will of the wife. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Several countries in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]] made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking [[Western World]] outlawed it much later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="The Routledge Handbook of European Criminology"/&gt;

Marital rape is included in the 1993 [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] as a form of [[violence against women]], which reads:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, ''marital rape'', female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation [...]";

It is also included in the [https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence], which reads:

:"This [violence against women] includes, but is not limited to, the following: a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, ''rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants'', crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages [...]".

In addition, the [[World Health Organization]], defines sexual violence as: "any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion, ''by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim'', in any setting, including but not limited to home and work".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The countries which choose to ratify the [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women,&lt;ref name="oas.org"&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; are bound by its provisions to ensure that non-consensual sexual acts committed against a spouse or partner are illegal.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Article 36 – Sexual violence, including rape'' para 3; and ''Article 43 – Application of criminal offences''. [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm] Also see the Explanatory Report, para 194, para 219 and para 220. [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The convention came into force in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a crime of abduction==
Originally, in [[Ancient Rome]], 'rape' was a crime-defining primarily the act of a male [[Kidnapping|abducting]] a female without the consent of the man under whose authority she was (typically father or husband); sexual intercourse was not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Diana C. Moses, "Livy's Lucretia and the Validity of Coerced Consent in Roman Law," in ''Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies'' (Dunbarton Oaks, 1993), p. 50; Gillian Clark, ''Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Life-styles'' (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in many legal systems (such as 17th century France) the consent of the woman to sexual intercourse was not a defense - the act was still a crime if done without the consent of her father.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked'' p 36 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; While the laws on rape differed by historical period and culture, some elements were common to most jurisdictions until the second part of the 20th century (when rape laws underwent major changes): 'rape' was a crime that could be committed only between parties who were not married to each other, and only by a male against a female.

==Common law==

Rape was an offense under the [[common law]] of England. That offense became an offense under the law of other countries, including Australia and the United States, as a result of colonization or conquest, or the following cession (see [[British Empire]]). It is discussed at [[Rape in English law#History]].

Under this law, rape traditionally describes the act of a male forcing a female to have sexual intercourse (sexual penetration of the vagina by the penis) with him. Common law rape required the utmost physical resistance by the victim, as well as substantial force by the defendant. The common law crime of rape was collectively adopted by the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Until the late twentieth century, [[spousal rape]] was not considered a true rape case because both spouses were deemed to have consented to a lifelong sexual relationship through the wedding vows. However, with changes to the marital rape exemption, as well as with the significant development of women's rights, the belief of a marital right to force sexual intercourse has become less widely held.

Rape was also an offense at common law in [[Scotland]]. This offense was not derived from the English offense as Scotland retained its own system of criminal law under the terms of the [[Acts of Union 1707]].

==International guidelines, recommendations, and obligations==
In recent years, there have been various guidelines and recommendations from international [[human rights]] organizations in regard to rape and sexual violence. One view that is advanced is that the offense of 'rape' should be replaced with a broader offense of 'sexual assault'. For instance, the ''Handbook for Legislation on Violence against Women'' from the [[UN]] Department of Economic and Social Affairs
Division for the Advancement of Women gives these suggestions about legislation on sexual violence:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/handbook/Handbook%20for%20legislation%20on%20violence%20against%20women.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Legislation should:
* Define sexual assault as a violation of bodily integrity and sexual autonomy;
* Replace existing offences of rape and “indecent” assault with a broad offence of sexual assault graded based on harm;
* Provide for aggravating circumstances including, but not limited to, the age of the survivor, the relationship of the perpetrator and survivor, the use or threat of violence, the presence of multiple perpetrators, and grave physical or mental consequences of the attack on the victim;
* Remove any requirement that sexual assault be committed by force or violence, and any requirement of proof of penetration, and minimize secondary victimization of the complainant/survivor in proceedings by enacting a definition of sexual assault that either:
:: Requires the existence of “unequivocal and voluntary agreement” and requiring proof by the accused of steps taken to ascertain whether the complainant/survivor was consenting; or
:: Requires that the act take place in “coercive circumstances” and includes a broad range of coercive circumstances; and
* Specifically criminalize sexual assault within a relationship (i.e., “marital rape”), either by:
:: Providing that sexual assault provisions apply “irrespective of the nature of the relationship” between the perpetrator and complainant; or
:: Stating that “no marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defence to a charge of sexual assault under the legislation.”
}}

The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, which creates legally binding obligations for countries which choose to ratify it,&lt;ref name="oas.org"/&gt; reads:&lt;ref&gt;http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Article 36 – Sexual violence, including rape

:1 Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the following intentional conducts are criminalised:
:a engaging in non-consensual vaginal, anal or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object;
:b engaging in other non-consensual acts of a sexual nature with a person;
:c causing another person to engage in non-consensual acts of a sexual nature with a third person.

:2 Consent must be given voluntarily as the result of the person’s free will assessed in the context of the surrounding circumstances.

:3 Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that the provisions of paragraph 1 also apply to acts committed against former or current spouses or partners as recognised by internal law.

Article 36 must also be read together with Article 43 &lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm See paragraphs 219 and 220 of the Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; which reads:

Article 43 – Application of criminal offences
: The offences established in accordance with this Convention shall apply irrespective of the nature of the relationship between victim and perpetrator.

Punishment for rape in most countries today is imprisonment. [[Castration]] is sometimes a punishment for rape and, controversially, some U.S. jurisdictions allow shorter sentences for sex criminals who agree to voluntary [[chemical castration]].

In the past, rape was often punished with death, and it is punishable by death in at least 10 countries today: [[China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Egypt]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]], and [[North Korea]]. In some of these instances, special circumstances apply. For example, rape is only punishable by death in India if the victim dies or is put in a persistent vegetative state, and/or if the rapist is a repeat offender, and in Iran, a death sentence for rape can be substituted with compensation, with or without imprisonment and flogging, if the victim so chooses.

In 1977, in ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the death penalty for the crime of rape of an adult woman was cruel and unusual punishment, and thus banned it as a violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and in 2008 in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'' it ruled the same in regard to [[child sexual abuse|rape of a child]].

Prison sentences for rape are not uniform. A study made by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] of prison releases in 1992, involving about 80 percent of the prison population, found that the average sentence for convicted rapists was 9.8 years, while the actual time served was 5.4 years. This follows the typical pattern of violent crimes in the US, where those convicted typically serve no more than half of their sentence.&lt;ref&gt;http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/PSATSFV.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2002 and 2003, more than one in ten convicted rapists in Victoria, Australia, served a wholly [[suspended sentence]], and the average total effective sentence for rape was seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One in Ten Rapists Walks Free|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/15/1097784044926.html?from=storylhs|first=Ian|last=Munro|publisher=The Age Company|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=16 October 2004|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the average sentence given for rape is 5 – 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/rape-sentencing-ireland-772129-Jan2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punishment of victims===
{{main article|Victim blaming|Honor killing|Slut-shaming}}
While the practice is condemned as barbaric by many present-day societies{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}, some societies punish the victims of rape as well as the perpetrators. According to such cultures, being raped dishonors the victim and, in many cases, the victim's family. In some countries (e.g. Libya, Afghanistan) rape victims are sometimes killed to restore honor to the family's name.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khaama.com/honor-killing-afghan-man-and-woman-killed-in-ghazni-1254&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] drama ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', the title character kills his raped, maimed daughter in what he believes to be a [[mercy killing]].

Certain cultures have historically promoted a system of [[honor]], dishonor, and shame, which was applied with particular strictness to females. A victim of rape would be considered to have lost her honorable reputation and place in society, a loss of honor which entailed [[shame]] on the woman's family group as well. In early [[ancient Rome]], [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], and other cultures, a pressure has existed which has led women to commit suicide after becoming victims of rape. The iconic Roman instance is that of [[Lucretia]]. Likewise, the suicide of female rape victims for reasons of shame is also historically documented in Chinese and Japanese culture.

In countries which outlaw [[fornication]] or [[adultery]], rape victims may become subject to these laws (if they cannot prove the rape case and/or if it is revealed they were not [[virgins]] at the time of the assault - in the case of unmarried victims).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutan==
Chapter 14 (Sexual Offenses) of the 2004 Penal Code of Bhutan outlaws rape and other sexual offenses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unodc.org/tldb/pdf/Bhutan_Penal_Code_2004_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the criminal code, there are several categories of rape, which are punished differently, depending on factors such as the age of the victim, the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, the number of participants (gang rape), whether the victim was pregnant, whether the injury occurred. [[Marital rape|Marital Rape]] is also recognized as an offense under the 2004 laws, being classified as a petty misdemeanour. The most serious form of rape is [[Gang rape]] of a child under twelve years of age, classified as a felony of the first degree.

{{Quotation|Rape

Rape
345.(a)

If a person had intercourse with a woman

(1)without her freely given consent;

(4)by exploiting the woman's state of unconsciousness or other condition that prevents her from giving her free consent;

(5)by exploiting the fact that she is mentally
ill or deficient, if –because of her illness or mental deficiency–her consent to
intercourse did not constitute free consent;

then he committed rape and is liable to sixteen years
imprisonment.

==New Zealand==
Rape is part of the statutory offence of sexual violation. Sexual violation is created by section 128 of the [[Crimes Act 1961]].

;Definition of sexual violation (and rape)
Sexual violation is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329051.html#DLM329051 |title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 18 April 2012), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
(1) Sexual violation is the act of a person who—
:(a) rapes another person; or
:(b) has unlawful sexual connection with another person.

}}

===Consent===
The mere fact that a person ''allows'' sexual connection to be performed on them, does not automatically mean that they are legally ''consenting''. If that person allows sexual connection due to coercion (e.g., under force, threats or fear of force; when he/she is asleep or very intoxicated; if he/she is affected by an intellectual, mental, or physical condition or impairment of a certain nature and degree; when he/she is mistaken about the partner's identity), then he/she is not legally consenting.

128A Allowing sexual activity does not amount to consent in some circumstances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329057.html |title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 18 April 2012), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) A person does not consent to sexual activity just because he or she does not protest or offer physical resistance to the activity.

(2) A person does not consent to sexual activity if he or she allows the activity because of—
:(a) force applied to him or her or some other person; or
:(b) the threat (express or implied) of the application of force to him or her or some other person; or
:(c) the fear of the application of force to him or her or some other person.

(3) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is asleep or unconscious.

(4) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is so affected by alcohol or some other drug that he or she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity.

(5) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is affected by an intellectual, mental, or physical condition or impairment of such a nature and degree that he or she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity.

(6) One person does not consent to sexual activity with another person if he or she allows the sexual activity because he or she is mistaken about who the other person is.

(7) A person does not consent to an act of sexual activity if he or she allows the act because he or she is mistaken about its nature and quality.

(8) This section does not limit the circumstances in which a person does not consent to sexual activity.

(9) For the purposes of this section,—
:allows includes acquiesces in, submits to, participates in, and undertakes sexual activity, in relation to a person, means—
:(a) sexual connection with the person; or
:(b) the doing on the person of an indecent act that, without the person's consent, would be an indecent assault of the person.

''Attempted sexual violation and assault with intent to commit sexual violation'' are also punished (Article 129).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329070.html |title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 18 April 2012), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a person is guilty of this crime "if (and only if) he or she knows that the other person has been induced to consent" to the sexual connection/indecent act "by an express or implied threat".

==Norway==

In Norway, rape is defined under the Norwegian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English translation of the Norwegian penal code (unofficial)|url=http://www.ub.uio.no/ujur/ulovdata/lov-19020522-010-eng.pdf|publisher=University of Oslo|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; § 192 as either:
* 1. engaging in sexual activity by means of violence or threatening behaviour,
* 2. engaging in sexual activity with somebody who is unconscious or for any other reason incapable of resisting the act, or
* 3. by means of violence or threatening behaviour compelling any person to engage in sexual activity with another person, or to carry out similar actions with him- or herself.

When any of these circumstances occur, a person guilty of rape is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. However, if a person is guilty of rape through [[gross negligence]] he or she is liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years.

If the activity in question was sexual intercourse or the offender has rendered a person unconscious or unable to resist the sexual activity, the penalty imposed shall be no less than three years imprisonment.

Further, the same section defines ''aggravated rape'' as a rape committed
* a. by multiple persons in cooperation (gang rape)
* b. in a particularly painful or offensive manner
* c. by a person previously convicted of rape under § 192 or of sexual activity with a child under the age of 14 (as per § 195 of the penal code)
* d. in such a way that the victim either dies or receives grievous bodily harm.

The section recognizes [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (defined in the ''Infection Protection Act'') as grievous bodily harm.

==Philippines==
Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (Title Eight of Act No. 3815) provides that:

Rape: When And How Committed. – Rape is committed:
:1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
::a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
::b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
::c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and,
::d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joselito Guianan Chan, Managing Partner, Chan Robles &amp;amp; Associates Law Firm |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8353.htm |title=Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes – Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |publisher=Chanrobles.com |date=30 September 1997|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 3 of this Code, which relates to rape, was inserted by the [[Anti-Rape Law of 1997]]. By section 2 of that Act, the crime of rape is classified as a crime against persons under that Code.

==Russia==
According to the Article 131 of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]], rape is defined as heterosexual vaginal intercourse using violence or threat of violence or if the victim is in a helpless state. The other forms of a violent sexual intercourse (male-male, female-male, female-female and non-vaginal male-female) are called "coercive sexual actions" and are punishable by the Article 132. These two crimes, however, are punishable identically. Besides, such crimes as sexual relations with a person under the age of consent (16 years as of 2013, article 134) and depraved actions (Article 135), if committed against a person under 12 years since 2012 are considered rape or coercive sexual actions (depending on sex of the offender and the victim and the type of intercourse) and punished according to the articles 131 or 132, because such victim is deemed to be in a helpless state due to his/her age. However, the Article 134 punishes sexual activity between same-sex pairings '''harsher''' than sexual activity between opposite-sex pairings when one of the persons is under 16 years old.

Rape or coercive sexual actions without any [[aggravating circumstance]]s are punishable with 3 to 6 years of imprisonment. If the crime:
* was committed repeatedly (against 1 or more than 1 victim)

==South Africa==
In South Africa, rape is defined by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]] (Act No. 32 of 2007).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This act has repealed the [[common law]] offence of rape and replaced it with a new expanded statutory offence of rape, applicable to all forms of sexual penetration without consent, irrespective of gender. Rape is defined in section 3 of the act as follows:
{{Quotation|Any person ("A") who unlawfully and intentionally commits an act of sexual penetration with a complainant ("B"), without the consent of B, is guilty of the offence of rape.}}
and "sexual penetration" is defined as:
{{Quotation|any act which causes penetration to any extent whatsoever by—
:(a) the genital organs of one person into or beyond the genital organs, anus, or mouth of another person;
:(b) any other part of the body of one person or, any object, including any part of the body of an animal, into or beyond the genital organs or anus of another person; or
:(c) the genital organs of an animal, into or beyond the mouth of another person[.]}}
The law also clarifies that marital rape is illegal; section 56 of the Act provides that:
{{Quotation|Whenever an accused person is charged with an offence under section 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 it is not a valid defence for that accused person to contend that a marital or other relationship exists or existed between him or her and the complainant.}}

==Switzerland==
Rape is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/3/311.0.en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Art. 190

:Any person who forces a person of the female sex by threats or violence, psychological pressure or by being made incapable of resistance to submit to sexual intercourse is liable to a custodial sentence of from one to ten years.}}

Marital rape was made illegal in 1992, and since 2004 marital rape is prosecutable ex-officio (meaning it can be prosecuted even if the wife doesn't complain).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialinfo.ch/cgi-bin/dicoposso/show.cfm?id=432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centrelavi-ge.ch/index.php?q=victimes-que-faire/violences-sexuelles/que-faire-specifiquement-en-cas-de-viol-ou-de-contraintes&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape of a male is considered a heavy sexual assault/thread and is prosecuted under Art. 189 of the Swiss Penalty Code.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
Rape under the law of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] is an [[indictable offence]], created by section 4 of the Sexual Offenses Act:&lt;ref&gt;http://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/laws2/alphabetical_list/lawspdfs/11.28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://caribbean.unwomen.org/en/caribbean-gbv-law-portal/country-resources/trinidad-and-tobago&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 4. Rape

(1) Subject to subsection (2), a person (“the accused”) commits the offence of rape when he has sexual intercourse with another person (“the complainant”)—
:(a) without the consent of the complainant where he knows that the complainant does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether the complainant consents; or
:(b) with the consent of the complainant where the consent—
::(i) is extorted by threat or fear of bodily harm to the complainant or to another;
::(ii) is obtained by personating someone else;
::(iii) is obtained by false or fraudulent representations as to the nature of the intercourse; or

}}

;Rape of a young child:
This offence is created by section 18 of the [[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]].

;History:
Prior to [[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]], rape in [[Scots Law]] differed from the definition of rape in other legal systems. In [[Scotland]], rape was defined as "a crime at [[common law]] which consisted of the [[carnal knowledge]] of a female by a male person without her consent". Under Scots law, rape could only be carried out by a male who penetrated a female's vagina. If a man's anus was penetrated by another man's penis, this was called [[sodomy]] and was tried under indecent assault, a form of aggravated assault. Likewise, if a male penetrated a female's anus by his penis without her consent, he would also be charged with indecent assault.

In Scotland, rape can only be prosecuted in the [[High Court of Justiciary]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]], section 3&lt;/ref&gt; and if convicted, the maximum penalty available to the court is life imprisonment. Evidence of distress can be used as [[corroborating evidence]]. Evidence of distress would be recognised by the first person or friend that the victim sees after the event. This should not be confused with [[hearsay]] evidence, which is not normally allowed to be led.

One of the key elements to prosecute a male for rape is to prove that the male had sexual intercourse without the female's consent. For sexual intercourse not to be rape, the ''active'' consent of the female is needed. This means it is not enough for a woman to be 'passive', she must actively consent and was established by [[Lord Advocate's Reference]] (No. 1 of 2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/Refence%201.html Link to reference] at Scottish Court Service.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a male could still be convicted of rape, even though the female did not say anything or show any resistance. This is a change in the law, as previously men who had sexual intercourse with sleeping women (as in the case of Charles Sweenie) or women who were unconscious due to voluntarily taking drugs or alcohol (see HMA v Logan) were charged with the lesser crime of indecent assault, rather than rape, as they had not used force to achieve penetration. Lord Advocate's Reference (No 1 of 2001), by requiring "active consent", had opened up the law to decide whether a voluntarily drunk or intoxicated woman can consent to sexual intercourse. This was clarified under the new laws of 2009 which state that sexual intercourse is non-consensual, and therefore considered rape if it occurs :(...) where the conduct occurs at a time when B is incapable because of the effect of alcohol or any other substance of consenting to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/section/13 |title=Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penetration is sufficient for a sexual intercourse to be deemed rape: there needs not to be any excretion of semen and the female's [[hymen]] does not have to be ruptured.

In [[Scotland]], rape continued to be a gender-specific crime until the [[Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8092157.stm MSPs pass major sex crime reforms] BBC News 10 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This Act came into force on 1 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/ssi/ssi2010/pdf/ssi_20100357_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Act expanded the definition of rape to include [[male rape]].

==United States==
{{see also|Rape in the United States#Criminal punishment}}

===State laws===
There is no national rape law in the United States, due to the [[United States v. Morrison]] ruling that parts of the [[Violence Against Women Act of 1994]] were unconstitutional. Each state has its own laws concerning sexual aggression. Nor is there any national standard in the US for defining and reporting male-male or female-perpetrated rapes. State laws vary considerably, and in most states, the term "rape" is no longer used, and the offense has been replaced by crimes such as "[[sexual assault]]", "[[Criminal Sexual Conduct|criminal sexual conduct]]", "sexual abuse", "[[Battery (crime)|sexual battery]]" etc. The US laws on [[sexual violence]] are complex, with states having numerous sex offenses, dealing with different situations. The laws on sex crimes have been changed and modernized significantly during the last decades and they continue to change.

===Uniform Code of Military Justice===

[[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] [USC Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 47X, Section 920, Article 120] defines rape as:

{{cquote|(a) Rape.— Any person subject to this chapter who commits a sexual act upon another person by:

(1) using unlawful force against that other person;

(2) using force causing or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to any person;

(3) threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, grievous bodily harm, or kidnapping;

(4) first rendering that other person unconscious; or

(5) administering to that other person by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or consent of that person, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the ability of that other person to appraise or control conduct;

is guilty of rape and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/920- United States Code: Title 10,920. Art. 120. Rape, sexual assault, and other sexual misconduct | LII / Legal Information Institute]. Law.cornell.edu (2013-03-03). Retrieved on 2013-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marital rape is banned; the law states: "Marriage is not a defense for any conduct in issue in any prosecution under this section."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/920 |title=10 USC § 920 - Art. 120. Rape and sexual assault generally &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape reporting===

According to the [[USA Today]] reporter Kevin Johnson, "no other major category of crime – not murder, assault or robbery – has generated a more serious challenge to the credibility of national crime statistics" as has the crime of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://junksciencearchive.com/nov98/rape2.html|title=Rape statistics not crystal clear|website=junksciencearchive.com|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says: &lt;blockquote&gt; "There are good reasons to be cautious in drawing conclusions from reports on rape. The two most accepted studies available – the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report and the Justice Department's annual National Crime Victimization Survey – each have widely acknowledged weaknesses." &lt;/blockquote&gt; The FBI's report fails to report rapes with male victims, both adults and children, fails to report non-forcible rapes of either gender ''by either gender'', and reflects only the number of rapes reported to police. The Justice Department's survey solicits information from people 12 and older, excluding the youngest victims of rape (and [[incest]]). However, by using a random national telephone survey of households, the National Crime Victimization Survey could pick up rapes unreported to the police. In addition, since both official reports collect rape data from states with widely divergent standards and definitions on what constitutes rape, uniform reporting is impossible.

A recent attempt to improve the tracking of rape, the National Violence Against Women survey was first published in 1998 by the National Institute of Justice and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its authors have acknowledged that they used different methodologies with "relatively high" margins of error. The 2000 report notes that "because annual rape [[victimization]] estimates (''nationwide'') are based on responses from ''only 24 women and 8 men'' (emphasis added) who reported being raped, they should be viewed with caution." The report goes on to note that it fails to report rapes perpetrated against children and adolescents, was well as those who were homeless, or living in institutions, group facilities, or in households without telephones.

The 2006 report of the National Violence Against Women survey was based on the much larger sample size of 8,000 men and 8,000 women. It estimated that "17.7 million women and 2.8 million men in the United States were forcibly raped at some time in their lives, with 302,091 women and 92,748 men forcibly raped in the year preceding the survey." The report defines "rape" to include completed and attempted rapes. However, the vast majority of rapes were completed: "Among all respondents, 14.8 percent of the women and 2.1 percent of the men said they were victims of a completed rape at some time in their life, whereas 2.8 percent of the women and 0.9 percent of the men said they were victims of an attempted rape only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/pubs-sum/210346.htm |title=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice, "Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey," January 2006 |publisher=Ojp.usdoj.gov |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many states define sexual crimes other than male-on-female penetration as sexual assault rather than rape. There are no national standards for defining and reporting male-on-male, female-on-female or female-on-male offenses, so such crimes are generally not included in rape statistics unless these statistics are compiled using information from states which count them as rape.

'''Life Beyond Tourism'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org&lt;/ref&gt;  (in short LBT) is a [[nonprofit]] worldwide portal free of banners, based in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The portal dates back to 2008 and stems from an orientation by the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]]. The portal is an international platform for exchange of experiences and good practices in the framework of a [[tourism]] based on values and not only on services and consumerism.

==History==

The portal originates from an orientation of the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]]. In 20 years of activity, the Foundation elaborated a new concept of the [[cultural heritage]] as an instrument of understanding among cultures. According to this orientation, [[cultural heritage]] is not only to be safeguarded and enhanced, but also to be “used and enjoyed” to foster intercultural dialogue.
In September 2008 the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]] announced the establishment of the association Life Beyond Tourism for Intercultural Dialogue. Soon after, a Declaration of Intents &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/imported/Declaration%20of%20Intents%20with%20Signatories(1).pdf |title=Declaration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215190757/http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/imported/Declaration%20of%20Intents%20with%20Signatories%281%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed (March 2008) by 59 experts of the Foundation from 20 different countries. In February 2011 the association developed the Life Beyond Tourism Non-Profit Portal. 
According to the LBT Manifesto &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/en/488-2/|title=Manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; “the tourist is a potential harbinger of knowledge and of intercultural dialogue” and therefore “the tourist destination is a workshop of knowledge, providing all visitors with an opportunity for cultural growth”
The Province of Florence welcomed the LBT orientation and decided to promote it. Many other cultural institutions and public administrations in Central Europe and Eurasia also joined the initiative.

===Main features===
Life Beyond Tourism gathers the cultural expressions representing a given region to provide a good picture of its “cultural personality” resulting from the interaction between its [[cultural heritage]] and ongoing developments.  The aim of the portal is to convey a territory’s specific features and to emphasize the way in which tangible and intangible heritage is combined to human and environmental levels.  
The portal is addressed to all cultural institutions, companies, professional and individuals who share the philosophy of the portal. In particular there are some typologies of members:
* cultural institutions, academies, foundations, associations, local authorities that operates in the field of cultural heritage;
* enterprises and companies rooted in the territory
* individuals that share the values of the LBT Manifesto and are willing to understand the cultural personality of a given territory
The portal is non-profit: the profits of memberships are reinvested into for cultural and development initiatives in the territory itself.
The supporters of Life Beyond Tourism promote a tourism of high cultural quality with a special focus on intercultural dialogue.

===Patronage and members===
Many organizations granted their patronage to Life Beyond Tourism. Among them: [[ICCROM]], [[ICOMOS]] Italia, the [[Council of Europe]], the Società Italiana per la Protezione dei Beni Culturali (CIPBC), the Borsa Mediterranea del Turismo Archeologico, the Associazione Città e Siti Italiani Patrimonio Mondiale [[UNESCO]]. Among the Italian local authorities: The Region of [[Tuscany]],  the Province of [[Florence]], the Municipality of Florence, many municipalities in Tuscany ([[Castelfiorentino]], [[Forte dei Marmi]], [[Montecatini Terme|Montecatini]], [[Reggello]], San Piero a Sieve, [[Scarperia]]. For the moment also the [[Krakow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krakow.pl/otwarty_na_swiat/start/florencja/3890,155,komunikat,zapowiedz_wspolpracy_z_ramach_projektu__life_beyond_tourism.html/|title=Communication by the Krakow Municipality}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Tbilisi]] municipalities granted their patronage.

'''Logistics engineering''' is a  field of engineering dedicated to the scientific organization of the [[purchase]], [[transport]], storage, [[distribution (business)|distribution]], and [[warehousing]] of materials and finished goods. Logistics engineering is a complex science that considers trade-offs in component/system design, repair capability, training, [[Spare parts management|spares inventory]], demand history, storage and distribution points, transportation methods, etc., to ensure the "thing" is where it's needed, when it's needed, and operating the way it's needed all at an acceptable cost.

==Overview==

[[Logistics]] is generally concerned with [[Cost centre (business)|cost centre]] service activities, but provides [[value (economics)|value]] via improved [[efficiency]] and customer satisfaction. It can quickly lose that value if the customer becomes dissatisfied. The end customer can include another process or work center inside of the manufacturing facility, a [[warehouse]] where items are stocked or the final customer who will use the product. Another approach which has appeared in recent years is the [[supply chain management]]. The supply chain  also looks at an efficient chaining of the supply / purchase and distribution sides of an [[organization]]. While logistics looks at single echelons with the immediate supply and distribution linked up, supply chain looks at multiple echelons/stages, right from [[procurement]] of the [[raw material]]s to the final distribution of finished goods up to the customer. It is based on the basic premise that the supply and distribution activities if integrated with the manufacturing / logistic activities, can result in better profitability for the organization. The [[local minimum]] of total cost of the manufacturing operation is getting replaced by the [[global minimum]] of total cost of the whole chain, resulting in better profitability for the chain members and hence lower costs for the products.

Logistics engineering as a discipline is a very important aspect of [[systems engineering]] that also includes [[reliability engineering]]. It is the science and process whereby [[Reliability_engineering|reliability]], [[maintainability]], and [[availability]] are designed into products or systems. It includes the supply and physical distribution considerations above as well as more fundamental engineering considerations. Logistics engineers work with complex mathematical models that consider elements such as [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), [[statistical distribution]]s, [[queueing theory]], and a host of other considerations. For example, if we want to produce a system that is 95% reliable (or improve a system to achieve 95% reliability), a logistics engineer understands that total system reliability can be no greater than the least reliable subsystem or component. Therefore our logistics engineer must consider the reliability of all subcomponents or subsystems and modify system design accordingly. If a subsystem is only 50% reliable, one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that subsystem, design in multiple subsystems in parallel (5 in this case would achieve approximately 97% reliability of that subsystem), purchase and store spare subsystems for rapid change out, establish repair capability that would get a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time, and/or choose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs. reliability solution.  Then the engineer moves onto the next subsystem.

===The name: logistics engineering===

The are few differences between the terms [[business logistics]] and logistics engineering. Logistics engineering is more focused on the mathematical or scientific application of logistics.&lt;ref&gt;G. Don Taylor, Logistics Engineering Handbook, CRC Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fields and topics===

The various fields and topics that logistics engineers are involved with include:

*[[Customer Service]]: provision of services to customers before, during and after a purchase
*[[Purchasing]]: acquiring goods or services to accomplish its goals
*[[Outsourcing|Sourcing]]: procurement practices, aimed at finding, evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services
*[[Demand forecasting]]: the art and science of forecasting customer demand to drive holistic execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management
*[[Facility location problem|Facility Location]]: the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing, and competitors' facilities
*Layout Design
*[[Inventory control]]: the activity of checking a shop’s stock
*[[Material Handling]]: short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle
*[[Warehousing]]
*Distribution System Design
*[[Reliability Engineering]]: sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product
*[[Reverse logistics]]: the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal
*[[Green logistics]]: attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities
*[[Intermodal freight transport|Intermodal transport]]
*Supportability analysis

===Performance metrics===
{{main|Performance metric}}

Different [[performance metric]]s (measures of performance) are used to examine the efficiency of an organization's logistics. The most popular and widely used performance metric is the landed cost. The landed cost is the total cost of purchasing, transporting, warehousing and distributing raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods.

Another performance metric equally important is the end customer [[Service level#.CE.B2 service level .28type 2.2C also known as .22fill rate.22.29|fill rate]]. It is the percentage of customer demand which is satisfied immediately off-the-shelf (from on-site inventory).  An alternative to fill rate, is system [[availability]].

In recent years, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has advocated the use of [[performance-based logistics]] (PBL) contracts to manage costs for support of [[weapon system]]s.

A '''manta trawl''' is a net system for sampling the surface of the ocean.  It resembles a [[manta ray]], with metal wings and a broad mouth. The net it pulls is made of thin mesh, and the whole [[trawl]] is towed behind a scientific [[research vessel]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Charles.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_9_112/ai_110737008/pg_3/ "Trashed: across the Pacific Ocean, plastics, plastics, everywhere"], ''Natural History'', November, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The manta trawl is useful for collecting samples from the surface of the ocean, such as sampling the plastic pieces making up the [[great Pacific garbage patch]] as well as the associated [[plankton]].

[[File:Blue-tailed damselflies (Ischnura elegans) mating, female typica 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Blue-tailed damselfly|Blue-tailed damselflies]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ischnura elegans'') mating]]

In [[biology]], '''mating''' (or '''mateing''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) is the pairing of either opposite-[[sex]] or [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[organism]]s, usually for the purposes of [[sexual reproduction]]. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mating|title=Mate|author=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. ''[[Fertilization]]'' is the fusion of both [[Germ cell|sex cell]] or [[gamete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary|title='Fertilization' - definition of|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fertilization|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Copulation (zoology)|Copulation]]'' is the union of the [[sex organ]]s of two sexually reproducing animals for [[insemination]] and subsequent [[internal fertilization]]. Mating may also lead to [[external fertilization]], as seen in [[amphibians]], [[fish]]es and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization ([[Reproduction#Autogamy|autogamy]]); for example, [[banana slug]]s.

The term ''mating'' is also applied to related processes in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[virus]]es.  Mating in these cases involves the pairing of individuals, accompanied by the pairing of their [[homologous chromosomes]] and then exchange of genomic information leading to formation of [[Genetic recombination|recombinant]] progeny (see [[mating systems]]).

==Animals==
{{Main|Animal sexual behaviour}}
{{See also|Copulation (zoology)|Human mating strategies}}

For animals, mating strategies include [[random mating]], [[disassortative mating]], [[assortative mating]], or a [[mating pool]]. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as [[nest]]-building and [[nutrition|feed]]ing offspring. The human practice of mating and [[Artificial_insemination#Artificial_insemination_in_livestock_and_pets|artificially inseminating domesticated animals]] is part of [[animal husbandry]].

In some [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[arthropod]]s, including [[insect]]s representing [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] (primitive) [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] clades, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure.  [[Courtship display|Courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as [[dragonflies]] and many [[spider]]s, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified [[sternite]]s on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male [[pedipalp]]s). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its [[aedeagus]], a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a "[[spermatophore]]") into the female's reproductive tract.

Other animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s. Vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) reproduce with internal fertilization through [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]),{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while [[Mating behavior of mammals|mammals copulate vagina]]lly.&lt;ref name="Hyman1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Libbie Henrietta Hyman|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=copulate&amp;f=false|date=15 September 1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants and fungi==
{{Main|Mating systems#In plants|Mating in fungi|Mating of yeast}}

Like in animals, mating in other Eukaryotes, such as [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], denotes {{clarify span|sexual conjugation|date=April 2013}}. However, in vascular plants this is mostly achieved without physical contact between mating individuals (see [[pollination]]), and in some cases, e.g., in fungi no distinguishable male or female organs exist (see [[isogamy]]); however, [[mating type]]s in some fungal species are somewhat analogous to [[sexual dimorphism]] in animals, and determine whether or not two individual isolates can mate. ''[[Yeasts]]'' are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s classified in the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[fungus|Fungi]], with 1,500 [[species]] currently described.&lt;ref name="YeastRef2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |title=What are yeasts? |work=Yeast Virtual Library |date=13 September 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226151906/http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, under high stress conditions like [[nutrient]] starvation, [[haploid]] cells will die; under the same conditions, however, [[diploid]] cells of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction ([[meiosis]]) and produce a variety of haploid [[spore]]s, which can go on to [[mating of yeast|mate]] (conjugate) and reform the [[diploid]].&lt;ref name=Neiman2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neiman, A.M. |title=Ascospore formation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=565–584 |year=2005 |pmid=16339736 |pmc=1306807 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.69.4.565-584.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protists==

Protists are a large group of diverse [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] animals and plants, that do not form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].  Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid11452306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javaux EJ, Knoll AH, Walter MR |title=Morphological and ecological complexity in early eukaryotic ecosystems |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6842 |pages=66–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11452306 |doi=10.1038/35083562 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant eukaryotes including protists such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''. In many eukaryotic species, mating is promoted by [[sex pheromones]] including the protist ''[[Blepharisma japonicum]].'' Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger&lt;ref name="pmid10229582"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/pl00013156|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes.  A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain [[pathogen]]ic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree.  However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for [[meiosis]] and hence mating.  To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]]'' was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.  However, ''G. intestinalis'' was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid15668177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in ''G. intestinalis''.&lt;ref name="pmid17980591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper MA, Adam RD, Worobey M, Sterling CR |title=Population genetics provides evidence for recombination in Giardia |journal=Curr.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/evolutionary-origin-and-adaptive-function-of-meiosis Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

In [[epidemiology]], an "immigration study" is a method of understanding the relative importance of inherited genetics and environmental factor in medical conditions whose incidence varies around the world. It examines the incidence of conditions in populations who have moved (or whose recent ancestors have moved) between places at different rates. Often the immigrant population can be shown to have similar rates to the population of the new location, suggesting that environmental factors such as diet, obesity and exercise are the dominant determinants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer Incidence in U.S. Immigrant Populations - Landmark Studies|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/archive/studies/surveillance/study5.html|website=National Institutes of Health|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">'''Mitochondrial toxicity''' is a condition in which the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] of a body's cells become damaged or decline significantly in number; it occurs as a side effect of certain [[antiretroviral drug]]s used to treat human immunodeficiency virus, or [[HIV]].

==Causes==
While the exact causes of mitochondrial toxicity are unknown, research has shown that a certain group of anti-viral drugs used to treat HIV, specifically nucleoside analog [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs), interfere with an enzyme needed in the production of mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebody.com/pinf/mitochondrial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The disruption of cell function that accompanies the condition can cause both mild and severe problems in people suffering from mitochondrial toxicity.  The most commonly observed symptom is muscle weakness, or [[myopathy]].  Others include [[peripheral neuropathy]] (numbness in the fingers and toes) and [[pancreatitis]] (inflammation of the pancreas), with the most severe being [[lactic acidosis]], in which a build-up of lactic acid in the tissues of the body leads to loss of energy, organ failure, and eventually death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002195329/http://www.projinf.org/fs/mito_b.html |archivedate=2006-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mustahabb''' ({{Lang-ar|مستحبّ|lit=recommended}}) is an [[Islamic term]] referring to recommended, favoured or [[virtue|virtuous]] actions.

Mustahabb actions are those whose status of approval in Islamic law (''[[ahkam]]'') falls between ''[[mubah]]'' (neither encouraged nor discouraged) and ''[[wajib]]'' (compulsory). One definition is "duties recommended, but not essential; fulfilment of which is rewarded, though they may be neglected without punishment".&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Levy, ''The Social Structure of Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;202&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms of ''mustahabb'' include ''masnun'' and ''mandub''. The opposite of ''mustahabb'' is ''[[makruh]]'' (discouraged).

==Examples==
There are thousands of mustahabb acts,&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Colin|title=Islam: The Basics|publisher=Routledge|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=utxkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Mustahabb+example#v=onepage&amp;q=Mustahabb%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2014|isbn=9781134296910|date=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: 

* [[As-Salamu Alaykum]] (a traditional Islamic [[greeting]],(the islamic greeting is FARD on the believers) Arabic for "peace be upon you") 
* [[Sadaqah]] (charity outside of [[zakat]])
* [[Umrah]]
* two Rakat before Fajr
* tayyitul masjid (two Rakat when entering the mosque); some scholars hold it to be fard due to certain evidences and Allah knows best.
* salatul witr
One must know that mustahabb are acts that increase or bring reward, but there is no sin if left off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">The [[Norway|Norwegian]] '''Institute of Marine Research''' ({{lang-no|Havforskningsinstituttet}}) is a national consultative research institute which is owned by the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs. The Institute performs research and provides advisory services in the fields of marine ecosystems and aquaculture. 

With a staff of almost 750, the Institute of Marine Research is the largest centre of marine research in Norway. The Institute has a highly qualified scientific staff, high-technology research stations and laboratories in [[Austevoll]], [[Bergen]] (head office), Flødevigen ([[Arendal]]) and [[Matre]], a department in [[Tromsø]] and several vessels.

The primary responsibility of the Institute of Marine Research is to provide advice to national authorities, society and industry regarding questions related to the ecosystems of the [[Barents Sea]], the [[Norwegian Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and the Norwegian coastal zone and in the field of aquaculture. The Institute is heavily engaged in development aid activities through its [http://www.cdcf.no Centre for Development Cooperation in Fisheries].

Norwegian Fisheries Investigations ("Norske Fiskeriundersøgelser") was initiated in [[Oslo]] in 1864. In 1900 the investigations was located to Bergen, and in 1947, the institute was separated as a research institute under directorate of fisheries. To further ensure its independence, the institute became an independent institution in 1989.

Among important scientific contributions was [[Johan Hjort]]'s pivotal work on «Fluctuations in the Great Fisheries of Northern Europe» (1914). Einar Lea's use of [[ASDIC]] to find [[herring]] schools (1947) and the use of Echo Integration for estimating fish abundance (Midtun &amp; Hoff, 1962) are also notable.

'''Oligotyping''' is a [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] method for classification of [[organism]]s by short intervals of primary [[DNA sequence]].  

Oligotyping 'systems' are sets of recognized target sequences which identify the members of the categories within the classification.  The classification may be for the purpose of primary biological [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], or for a functional classification.

The [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of [[Optical disc|optical media]] is essential because it is a resource in libraries, and stores audio, video, and computer data to be accessed by patrons. While optical discs are generally more reliable and durable than older media types, (magnetic tape, LPs and other records) environmental conditions and/or poor handling can result in lost information. This article will introduce the different types of optical media discs and offer a discussion of strategies for preservation of these materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlmann, K. C. (1992). ''The compact disc handbook''. Madison, Wisconsin: A-R Editions INC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of media==
The two broad types of optical discs are [[Compact Disc]]s (CDs) and [[DVD]]s. Data is retrieved by both CDs and DVDs by devices that focus a laser light beam against the reflective layer allowing data to be read. The data layer, supported by the [[polycarbonate]] substrate can be metallic or dye-based, depending on the disc type.

The reflective and data layers of CDs are just below the label and a thin sheet of polycarbonate substrate. A much thicker layer of the substrate supports and protects the bottom of the disc. The reflective and data layers of double-sided DVDs are in the center of the disc structure, housed between two equal layers of polycarbonate substrate. Because the data layer of CDs is more exposed than double-sided DVDs, a thin lacquer layer is used to protect the surface of the CD. The top of a CD is delicate and fragile; the bottom is merely a transparent protective covering.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;Bennett, H. (2003). [http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa12.htm Understanding CD-R and CD-RW.] Cupertino California: Optical Storage Technology Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

For preservation purposes: Gold CD-R (Compatible Disc-Recordable) and DVD-R (Digital Video Disc-Recordable or Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable) discs are preferred by experts over aluminium and silver for reliable long-term backup storage—the reflective layer of the optical disc is gold.

Permanent and long-term storage are distinct. “[D]igital archiving experts commonly acknowledge that no carrier is permanent. Instead, one must maintain data transferred to storage and provide access and ensure integrity of the information for the long-term.” As technology changes data can be migrated from an older to a newer type of media to avoid media failure or “format obsolescence”—a real threat for technology when it is no longer supported. If the machine required to play and read the discs is not kept in working order and maintained, data loss may result.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Kevin. (2006) [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147782E.pdf ''Memory of the World Programme: Sub-Committee on Technology: Risks Associated with the Use of Recordable CDs and DVDs as Reliable Storage Media in Archival Collections–Strategies and Alternatives'']. pp. 3–4. Paris: UNESCO. Accessed on October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Risks involved with optical media are covered below.

Issues which affect data longevity of nominally archival-grade discs include the following: dye failure (discs with premium organic and pthalocyanine-based long-life dyes are more suitable); bonding failure (premium bonding agents and edge-to-edge coverage improve longevity); scratches,minimised by careful handling and a scratch-resistant coating; production quality (some factories have better quality control standards, and discs from a batch known to be good may be more reliable than another batch).&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Ronald W. (December 6, 2006) [''Document on Using CD’s and DVD’s for Long Term Storage.''] Online posting. The Archives &amp; Archivists (A&amp;A) List. Accessed on October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Testing is required since conditions vary from machine to machine and from disc to disc; environmental control is required to prevent damaging conditions. When these conditions are met it is believed that the life of an archival-quality CD-R or DVD-R can be as long as 100 years, compared to the typical five to ten years for non-archival quality optical discs. The [[ISO 9660]] standard specifies a stable room temperature of 18 - 23&amp;nbsp;°C (64-73&amp;nbsp;°F) with relative humidity of 30% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;The University of the State of New York. ''Guidelines for Ensuring the Long-Term Accessibility and Usability of Records Stored as Digital Images: Government Records Technical Information Series''. p. 5. Albany: University of the State of New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping multiple copies of discs is necessary for added protection. “One Master, stored under optimal conditions, one Working copy to be used for access purposes or copying, and one Safety copy to be stored at a different location.”&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Kevin. (2006) [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147782E.pdf ''Memory of the World Programme: Sub-Committee on Technology: Risks Associated with the Use of Recordable CDs and DVDs as Reliable Storage Media in Archival Collections–Strategies and Alternatives'']. p. 11. Paris: UNESCO. Accessed on October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Institute of Conservation]] the container most suitable for storage is a rigid high-quality case made from inert polyester placed vertically.&lt;ref&gt;ICON Conservation Register. (2006) [http://www.conservationregister.com/caring.asp?id=4 ''Caring for Digital and Electronic Media''] Accessed on October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still speculation on how reliable optical media is. There are no accepted standards for blank discs and recording devices, so acceptable performance cannot be relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Kevin. (2006) [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147782E.pdf ''Memory of the World Programme: Sub-Committee on Technology: Risks Associated with the Use of Recordable CDs and DVDs as Reliable Storage Media in Archival Collections–Strategies and Alternatives'']. pp. 6–7. Paris: UNESCO. Accessed on October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The longevity of rewritable formats—CD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and DVD+RW—is less well known; they are also susceptible to accidental overwriting.

==Optical disc types==
[[CD-ROM]]s/[[DVD-ROM]]s (read-only-memory) are commercial grade discs and use a metallic data layer created using a molding machine that stamps pits (depressions) and lands (flat surfaces) into a polycarbonate substrate base. The metal layer is then applied to the base, creating the data layer. While aluminium is most frequently used, it can potentially oxidize and lose data, a process sometimes called "[[disk rot]]". For archival discs, silver or gold layers are preferred because of longer life expectancies and better reflectivity.
DVD-ROMs can also support a double layer of data, using two metal layers, one semi-reflective and the other fully reflective. Laser light beams can read the two layers separately. If both sides of a DVD are used, double-layer technology provides four data layers.

[[CD-R]]s/[[DVD-R]]s (recordable) are recordable, write-once discs which use [[photosensitive]] organic dye just below the reflective layer; the dye undergoes a chemical change when exposed to specific laser light beams, creating bits (marks) containing data.

Dyes used in DVD-Rs and CD-Rs include [[Phthalocyanine]] (greenish) [[Cyanine]] (blue) and [[Azo compound|Azo]] (dark blue). Silver, silver alloys and gold are used as reflective layers on recordable CDs and DVDs. Both gold and silver will outlast the organic dyes, which will decay over time. Aluminium is not used because it may cause reactions with the dyes.

[[CD-RW]]/[[DVD-RW]]s (rewritable) are recordable, erasable and re-recordable discs that use a [[phase changing film]] data layer that reacts to heat. Laser light beams melt bits into the film to create data. These bits can be erased and re-recorded by adjusting the temperature of the laser. Rewritable CDs and DVDs usually use aluminium reflective layers, because the phase changing film degrades faster than aluminium [[oxidize]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/contents.html Byers, F. (2003). Care and handling of CDs and DVDs: A guide for librarians and archivists.] Council on Library and Information Resources and National Institute of Standards and Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blu-ray Disc]]s/[[HD DVD]]s represent a new generation of optical media. Both disc types use unique blue-violet laser beams to read data, and are not compatible with equipment for other formats. Blu-ray Discs and HD DVDs are incompatible, and were engaged in a [[format war]] until Toshiba announced its discontinuation of the HD DVD format on February 19. 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Toshiba Corporation (2008). [http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm ''Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses''] Accessed on July 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of HD DVDs is similar to normal DVDs, with the data layer protected by layers of substrate on each side. The structure of Blu-ray discs is more similar to CDs, with the information stored directly beneath the surface. Early Blu-ray discs were easily damaged, but a protective layer that made them less delicate was developed.

==Damage to optical discs==
Optical discs are not subject to wear as they are read without mechanical contact with the surface, but are susceptible to scratches from handling. The risk of scratching is minimised by handling discs only by their edges and the center hole or hub.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. (2002). [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/record.html Cylinder, disc and tape care in a nutshell.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Machines used to read discs can damage them if mechanically faulty.

===Scratches===
====Scratches on the laser-reading side of an optical disc====
Data recorded on discs has [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]], so that [[error detection and correction]] can compensate for some degree of damage.
The depth and width of scratches as well as the direction in which scratches on the bottom run all determine whether or not the data on the optical disc will be readable. Small scratches on the substrate generally have no effect on the readability of a disc as the laser is reading through the substrate to the data layer. If a scratch is deep or wide enough to affect laser focus, error correction is usually possible, but scratches can be too deep and wide or too close together for error correction to be successful. If a scratch runs along a track or is deep enough to scratch the data layer, data may be lost.

====Scratches on the top of an optical disc====
Because a CD's reflective metal layer and data layer are both directly beneath the thin lacquer surface of the label, data can be destroyed by even a small scratch on the top of a CD. The instrument used to label CDs should be seriously considered. Pens or markers with hard tips, or with solvents that can affect the protective layers, can scratch or damage the data layer; water-based felt-tip pens are safest.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; The data layer of a double-sided DVD is in the middle of the disc, surrounded by the substrate on both sides so scratches to either side are equivalent.

===Environmental considerations===
Optical discs can be damaged by exposure to extreme temperatures; direct sunlight may overheat the disc or damage the data layer with [[UV ray]]s{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. Exposure to heat and light have different effects on discs with data and metal layers of different composition. In all optical discs high temperatures can cause the substrate to soften and the disc to warp. Ambient heat, heat build-up, and light do little to damage the data layer of a ROM disc as it is made of aluminium; the only known problem occurring with the prolonged exposure of ROM discs to light is "clouding" or "coloring" of the polycarbonate substrate. CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM discs are all affected by exposure to ambient heat as well as heat build-up due to direct sunlight. A CD-R’s data layer is made of dye that degrades at high temperatures, becoming less transparent so that pits and lands are read incorrectly, making the data unreadable. UV rays in sunlight are energetic enough to produce a [[photochemical reaction]] that changes the optical properties of the dye.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; RW and RAM discs' data layers are composed of a phase-changing film that is even more sensitive to heat than the dye found in R discs, so that they degrade even faster when subjected to ambient heat or direct sunlight. The phase-changing film in RW and RAM discs is not light-sensitive, and UV rays do not affect the optical properties of the film. After being exposed to freezing temperatures a disc’s separate layers may warm at different speeds, causing separation of the layers. If heated or cooled significantly a disc should be allowed to return to room temperature before use.

The polycarbonate substrate of discs exposed to high humidity or immersion may absorb some water, and should be allowed to dry out in a less humid environment before being used. After drying discs should be usable unless minerals left behind from the water react with the components of the disc, damaging the layers and making it unreadable, as sometimes happens.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt;

==Cleaning of optical discs ==
Optical media discs often require professional preventative or routine cleaning to ensure data accuracy and accessibility; those with no professional experience may scratch the disc surface in their attempt to clean the disc. Build up of dust and oily contaminants on the disc surface, and fingerprints can typically impede the laser beam’s ability to penetrate the substrate to read the data layer, and more often impede writing. Minor interferences with reading is handled by error correction technology. If an audio CD (with a much lower accuracy threshold than a data disc) becomes dirty, it can be cleaned safely with a dry, soft lint-free cloth, holding the disc by the edges or by the center hole. Light dirt that is not removed by this method can be removed with a cloth dampened with water or a suitable optical disc-cleaning fluid. It has been advised that excess dust be blown off an optical disc before reading, to avoid buildup of dust in the reader, particularly on the laser.&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;Henderson, K. L., &amp; Henderson, W. T. (1991). ''Conserving and preserving materials in nonbook formats''. Urbana-Champaign, Illinois: University of Illinois&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage of optical discs==
Individual storage containers protect optical discs from scratches and dust. It has been recommended that discs be stored vertically, if possible in a cabinet or drawer less susceptible to changes in temperature or humidity. For long-term storage it has been advised that any paper inside the case—liner, booklet—be removed to minimise the collection and retention of moisture inside the case.&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt;

==Repair and reclamation of data from optical discs==
If scratches on the laser-reading side of an optical disc prevent it from being read, it may be possible to recover all or most of the content once, and transfer it to another storage medium. There are software packages that analyse data on a damaged storage medium and can recover some or all otherwise inaccessible information.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; Commercial companies offer data recovery services.

Also, the disc itself can be repaired. There are various machines that will repair discs by polishing, buffing or grinding the playable surface. Usually the disc will appear like new and most importantly the data can once again be read by the laser. Some game shops, pawnbrokers and supermarkets provide a disc repair service. However, since this is an ablative process in which a layer of the substrate is removed, it is only safe to do a few times before risking the loss of the whole disc.

==Nature of mathematics==
*[[Definitions of mathematics]] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
*[[Philosophy of mathematics]] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

===Mathematics is===
*an [[academic discipline]] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
*a [[formal science]] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

'''Proof-of-space''' ('''PoSpace'''), also called '''Proof-of-capacity''' ('''PoC'''), is a means of showing that one has a legitimate interest in a service (such as sending an email) by allocating a non-trivial amount of memory or disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider.
The concept was formulated by Dziembowski ''et al.''&lt;ref name="DziembowskiFaust2015"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1=Dziembowski | first1=Stefan
 | last2=Faust       | first2=Sebastian
 | last3=Kolmogorov  | first3=Vladimir
 | last4=Pietrzak    | first4=Krzysztof
 | title=Proofs of Space
 | volume=9216 |year=2015 | pages=585–605
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015.

Proofs of space are very similar to [[proof-of-work system|proofs of work]], except that instead of computation, storage is used. Proof-of-space is related to, but also considerably different from, memory-hard functions and proofs of retrievability.

After the release of Bitcoin, alternatives to its PoW mining mechanism were researched and PoSpace was studied in the context of [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]]. Proofs of space are seen as a fairer and greener alternative due to the general-purpose nature of storage and the lower energy cost required by storage. Several theoretical and practical implementations of PoSpace have been released and discussed, such as SpaceMint and Burstcoin.

== Concept description ==
A proof-of-space is a piece of data that a prover sends to a verifier to prove that the prover has reserved a certain amount of space. For practicality, the verification process needs to be efficient, namely, consumes a small amount of space and time. For soundness, it should be hard for the prover to pass the verification if it does not actually reserve the claimed amount of space. One way of implementing PoSpace is by using [[Graph pebbling|hard-to-pebble graphs]].&lt;ref name="DziembowskiFaust2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ren2016"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1=Ren      | first1=Ling
 | last2=Srinivas | first2=Devadas
 | title=Proof of Space from Stacked Expanders
 | year=2016
 | url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/333.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verifier asks the prover to build a labeling of a hard-to-pebble graph. The prover commits to the labeling. The verifier then asks the prover to open several random locations in the commitment.

== Uses ==
Proofs of space could be used as an alternative to proofs of work in the traditional [[Client Puzzle Protocol|client puzzle]] applications such as anti-spam measures and denial of service attack prevention. Proof-of-Space has also been used for malware detection, by determining whether the L1 cache of a processor is empty (e.g., has enough space to evaluate the PoSpace routine without cache misses) or contains a routine that resisted being evicted.&lt;ref name="JakobssonStewart13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakobsson|first1=Markus|title=Mobile Malware: Why the Traditional AV Paradigm is Doomed, and How to Use Physics to Detect Undesirable Routines, BlackHat|last2=Stewart|first2=Guy|year=2013|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4194/e4f5fccaac653f00ebb80f51f01e6c7fd80a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Jakobsson [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/031.pdf Secure Remote Attestation] ''Cryptology ePrint Archive.'' Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs of space have been developed further in several concept papers and in one live cryptocurrency implementation.

=== Implementations ===

==== Burstcoin ====
Proof of space or Proof of capacity is used in the Burstcoin cryptocurrency founded in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.newsbtc.com/burstcoin-celebrates-birthday-with-release-of-new-energy-efficient-hdd-mining-wallet/|title=BURSTCOIN Celebrates Birthday With Release Of New Energy Efficient HDD Mining Wallet|accessdate=1 November 2016|publisher=NewsBTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proof of capacity consumes disk space rather than computing resources to mine a block. Unlike PoW, where the miners keep changing the block header and hash to find the solution, the Proof of capacity implementation in Burstcoin generates random solutions, also called plots, using the Shabal cryptographic algorithm in advance and stores it on hard drives. This stage is called plotting and it may take days or even weeks depending on the storage capacity of the drive. In the next stage - mining, miners match their solutions to the most recent puzzle and the node with the fastest solution gets to mine the next block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wahab|first=Abdul|last2=Waqas|first2=Memood|date=October 2018|title=Survey of Consensus Protocols|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.03357.pdf|journal=Survey of Consensus Protocols|volume=|pages= 6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-capacity-cryptocurrency.asp|title=BREAKING DOWN 'Proof of Capacity (Cryptocurrency)'|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salimitari|first=Mehrdad|last2=Chatterjee|first2=Mainak|date=September 2018|title=An Overview of Blockchain and Consensus Protocols for IoT Networks|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05613|journal=An Overview of Blockchain and Consensus Protocols for IoT Networks|pages=III-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concepts ===

==== SpaceMint ====
In 2015, a paper proposed a cryptocurrency called SpaceMint.&lt;ref name="SpaceMint"&gt;Park et al. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/528 SpaceMint: A Cryptocurrency Based on Proofs of Space.] ''Cryptology ePrint Archive.'' Retrieved 31 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to solve some of the practical design problems associated with the pebbling-based PoSpace schemes. In using PoSpace for decentralized cryptocurrency, the protocol has to be adapted to work in a non-interactive protocol since each individual in the network has to behave as a verifier.&lt;ref name="SpaceMint" /&gt;

==== Chia ====
In 2018, a proposed cryptocurrency Chia presented two papers presenting a new protocol based on proof of space&lt;ref name="Abusalah2017"&gt;

'''Rhizome''' is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–1980) project. It is what Deleuze calls an "image of thought," based on the [[rhizome|botanical rhizome]], that apprehends [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicities]].

==As a mode of knowledge and model for society==
Deleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', they oppose it to an [[arborescent]] (hierarchic, tree-like) conception of knowledge, which works with dualist categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with planar and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the "orchid and the wasp" is taken from the biological concept of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], in which two different species interact together to form a [[multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). [[Hybridisation (biology)|Hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]] would also be good illustrations.

"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things.' A rhizome, on the other hand, is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.' Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation.

"In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue5/poke/glossary.html Rhizomes.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

Deleuze and Guattari introduce ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from ''A Thousand Plateaus''):

*1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: "...any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be";
*3. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity", that it ceases to have any relation to the One;
*4. Principle of asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines;
*5 and 6. Principle of cartography and [[decalcomania]]: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a "map and not a tracing".

{{no footnotes|date=June 2009}}

In [[database]] technologies, a '''rollback''' is an operation which returns the database to some previous state. Rollbacks are important for database [[data integrity|integrity]], because they mean that the database can be restored to a clean copy even after erroneous operations are performed. They are crucial for recovering from database server crashes; by rolling back any [[Database transaction|transaction]] which was active at the time of the crash, the database is restored to a consistent state.

The rollback feature is usually implemented with a [[Database log|transaction log]], but can also be implemented via [[multiversion concurrency control]].

==Cascading rollback==
A ''cascading rollback'' occurs in database systems when a transaction (T1) causes a failure and a rollback must be performed. Other transactions dependent on T1's actions must also be rollbacked due to T1's failure, thus causing a cascading effect. That is, one transaction's failure causes many to fail.

Practical database recovery techniques guarantee cascadeless rollback, therefore a cascading rollback is not a desirable result.

==SQL==
In [[SQL]], &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; is a command that causes all data changes since the last &lt;code&gt;[[Begin work (SQL)|BEGIN WORK]]&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;[[Start transaction (SQL)|START TRANSACTION]]&lt;/code&gt; to be discarded by the [[relational database management systems]] (RDBMS), so that the state of the data is "rolled back" to the way it was before those changes were made.

A &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; statement will also release any existing [[savepoint]]s that may be in use.

In most SQL dialects, &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt;s are connection specific.  This means that if two connections are made to the same database, a &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; made in one connection will not affect any other connections.  This is vital for proper [[Concurrent programming|concurrency]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5996">In [[computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]] and [[proof theory]], the '''slow-growing hierarchy''' is an ordinal-indexed family of slowly increasing functions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;: '''N''' → '''N''' (where '''N''' is the set of [[natural numbers]], {0, 1, ...}). It contrasts with the [[fast-growing hierarchy]].

== Definition ==
Let μ be a [[large countable ordinal]] such that a [[fundamental sequence (ordinals)|fundamental sequence]] is assigned to every [[limit ordinal]] less than μ.  The '''slow-growing hierarchy''' of functions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;: '''N''' → '''N''', for α &lt; μ, is then defined as follows:

*&lt;math&gt; g_0(n) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; g_{k+1}(n) = g_k(n) + 1 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; g_\alpha(n) = g_{\alpha[n]}(n)&lt;/math&gt; for limit ordinal α.

Here α[''n''] denotes the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal α.

The article on the [[Fast-growing hierarchy#Definition|Fast-growing hierarchy]] describes a standardized choice for fundamental sequence for all α &lt; ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Relation to fast-growing hierarchy ==
The slow-growing hierarchy grows much more slowly than the fast-growing hierarchy. Even ''g''&lt;sub&gt;[[epsilon zero (mathematics)|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; is only equivalent to ''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; only attains the growth of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (the first function that [[Peano arithmetic]] cannot prove [[total function|total]] in the hierarchy) when α is the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]].&lt;ref name="girard81"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Girard | first1=Jean-Yves | author1-link=Jean-Yves Girard | title=Π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-logic.

However, Girard proved that the slow-growing hierarchy eventually ''catches up'' with the fast-growing one.&lt;ref name="girard81" /&gt; Specifically, that there exists an ordinal α such that for all integers ''n''
:''g''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &lt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &lt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'' + 1)
where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; are the functions in the fast-growing hierarchy. He further showed that the first α this holds for is the ordinal of the theory ''ID''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition.&lt;ref name="wainer89"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2274873 |pages=608–614 |last1=Wainer |first1=S. S. |title=Slow Growing Versus Fast Growing |volume=54 |issue=2 |journal=The Journal of Symbolic Logic |year=1989 |doi=10.2307/2274873}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the assignment of fundamental sequences found in &lt;ref name="cichon" /&gt; the first match up occurs at the level ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="weier1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0168-0072(97)00033-X |title=Sometimes slow growing is fast growing |year=1997 |last1=Weiermann |first1=A |journal=Annals of Pure and Applied Logic |volume=90 |pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Buchholz style tree ordinals it could be shown that the first match up even occurs at &lt;math&gt;\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Extensions of the result proved&lt;ref name="wainer89" /&gt; to considerably larger ordinals show that there are very few ordinals below the ordinal of transfinitely iterated &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt;-comprehension where the slow- and fast-growing hierarchy match up.&lt;ref name="weier1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiermann |first=A. |year=1995 |title= |journal=Archives of Mathematical Logic |volume= 34 |pages=313–330 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slow-growing hierarchy depends extremely sensitively on the choice of the underlying fundamental sequences.&lt;ref name="weier1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weier1999"&gt;Weiermann, A.

'''Source Water Protection''' is protecting source water (including water from lakes, rivers and underground aquifers) from overuse and contamination.

Source water protection is part of a [[multi-barrier approach]] to protecting municipal sources of drinking water that was recommended by the Canadian Justice [[Dennis O'Connor (judge)|Dennis O'Connor]] in his Walkerton reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/walkerton/&lt;/ref&gt; This study was released in 2002 as a response to the [[Walkerton Tragedy]], in which the town of Walkerton, Ontario's drinking water became contaminated with ''[[E. coli]]'' bacteria.

'''Teratology''' is the study of abnormalities of [[physiological development]]. It is often thought of as the study of human [[congenital abnormalities]], but it is broader than that, taking into account other non-birth developmental stages, including [[puberty]]; and other organisms, including plants. The related term [[developmental toxicity]] includes all manifestations of abnormal development that are caused by environmental insult. These may include growth retardation, delayed mental development or other [[congenital disorder]]s without any structural malformations.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, J.M., Kavlock, R.J. (1996). "Developmental toxicology". In C.D. Klaassen (ed.): ''Casarett &amp; Doull's Toxicology'', (5th ed.). pp.&amp;nbsp;301-331. New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-105476-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teratogens'''&lt;!--MOS:BOLD - term redirects here--&gt; are substances that may cause [[birth defects]] via a [[toxic]] effect on an embryo or fetus.&lt;ref name="Teratogens"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Thall Bastow BD, Holmes JL|title=Teratology and drug use during pregnancy|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/260725-overview#showall|website=Medscape|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term ''teratology'' stems from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τέρας}} ''teras'' ([[genitive]] {{lang|grc|τέρατος}} ''teratos''), meaning "monster" or "marvel", and {{lang|grc|λόγος}} ''[[logos]]'', meaning "the word" or, more loosely, "the study of".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=logos |publisher= Etymologyonline.com|accessdate= 8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 17th century, ''teratology'' referred to a discourse on prodigies and marvels of anything so extraordinary as to seem abnormal. In the 19th century it acquired a meaning more closely related to biological deformities, mostly in the field of botany. Currently, its most instrumental meaning is that of the medical study of teratogenesis, [[Congenital disorder|congenital malformations]] or individuals with significant malformations. Historically, people have used many pejorative terms to describe/label cases of significant physical malformations.
In the 1960s [[David Weyhe Smith|David W. Smith]] of the [[University of Washington]] Medical School (one of the researchers who became known in 1973 for the discovery of [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]&lt;ref name=Jonesetal1973&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jones K.L. |author2=Smith D.W |author3=Ulleland C.N. |author4=Streissguth A.P. | year = 1973 | title = Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcoholic mothers | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7815| pages = 1267–1271 | pmid = 4126070 | doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(73)91291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;), popularized the term ''teratology''.  With the growth of understanding of the origins of birth defects, the field of teratology {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} overlaps with other fields of science, including [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], and [[genetics]].
Until the 1940s teratologists regarded birth defects as primarily hereditary. In 1941 the first well-documented cases of environmental agents being the cause of severe birth defects were reported.{{by whom|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teratogenesis ===
{{anchor|Wilson's 6 principles}}
Along with this new awareness of the ''[[in utero]]'' vulnerability of the developing [[mammal]]ian [[embryo]] came the development and refinement of ''The Six Principles of Teratology'' which are still applied today. These principles of teratology were put forth by [[James G. Wilson|Jim Wilson]] in 1959 and in his monograph ''Environment and Birth Defects''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-757750-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=James G. Wilson |title=Environment and Birth Defects (Environmental Science Series) |publisher=Academic Pr |location=London |year=1973 |pages= |isbn=0-12-757750-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms:

# Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the [[genotype]] of the [[conceptus]] and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.
# Susceptibility to teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents.
# Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events.
# The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes.
# There are four manifestations of deviant development (Death, Malformation, Growth Retardation and Functional Defect).
# Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the [[No Observable Adverse Effect Level]] (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% Lethality (LD100).

Studies designed to test the teratogenic potential of environmental agents use animal model systems (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey). Early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to environmental agents and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities. While this is still part of the teratological evaluation procedures today, the field of Teratology is moving to a more [[molecular]] level, seeking the mechanism(s) of action by which these agents act. [[Genetically modified]] mice are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, pregnancy registries are large, prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births. These studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies.

Understanding how a '''teratogen''' causes its effect is not only important in preventing congenital abnormalities but also has the potential for developing new therapeutic drugs safe for use with pregnant women.

===Humans===
{{Main|Congenital disorder}}
In [[human]]s, [[congenital disorder]]s resulted in about 510,000 deaths globally in 2010.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=December 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3% of newborns have a "major physical anomaly", meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Abbas and Fausto (eds.), ''Robbins and Cotran's Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th edition'', p.&amp;nbsp;470.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vaccinating while pregnant====
In [[human]]s, vaccination has become readily available, and is important to the prevention of some diseases like polio, rubella, and smallpox, among others. There has been no association between congenital malformations and vaccination, as shown in Finland in which expecting mothers received the oral polio vaccine and saw no difference in infant outcomes than mothers who had not received the vaccine.&lt;ref name=Harj1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harjulehto-Mervaala|first=T|title=Oral Polio Vaccination during Pregnancy: No Increase in the Occurrence of Congenital Malformations|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1993|volume=138|issue=6|pages=407–414|pmid= 8213746}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still not recommended to vaccinate for polio while pregnant unless there is risk of infection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html#polio|website=cdc.gov|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|quote=Although no adverse effects of IPV have been documented among pregnant women or their fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided on theoretical grounds. However, if a pregnant woman is at increased risk for infection and requires immediate protection against polio, IPV can be administered in accordance with the recommended schedules for adults.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Another important implication of this includes the ability to get the influenza vaccine while pregnant. During the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, mortality in pregnant women was 45%. However, even with prevention through vaccination, influenza vaccination in pregnant women remains low at 12%. Munoz et al. demonstrated that there was no adverse outcomes observed in the new infants or mothers.&lt;ref name=Mun2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munoz|first=F|title=Safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=2005|volume=192|pages=1098–1106|doi= 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.12.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
{{Further|Congenital disorder}}
Causes of teratogenesis can broadly be classified as:
*Toxic substances, such as, for humans, [[drugs in pregnancy]] and [[Environmental toxins and fetal development|environmental toxins in pregnancy]].
**[[Potassium iodide]] is a possible '''teratogen'''. [[Potassium iodide]] in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid.
*[[Vertically transmitted infection]]
*Lack of nutrients. For example, lack of folic acid in the [[nutrition in pregnancy]] for humans can result in [[spina bifida]].
*Physical restraint. An example is [[Potter syndrome]] due to [[oligohydramnios]] in humans.
*[[Genetic disorder]]s
*[[Alcohol and Pregnancy|Alcohol consumption]] during pregnancy.

===Fossil record===
{{Further|Paleopathology}}
Evidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life's developmental processes. For instance, because a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen has been discovered with a [[block vertebra]], it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, ''[[Troodon]]'', the tip of whose jaw was twisted.&lt;ref name="molnar-pathology"&gt;Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University  Press, p. 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notably deformed fossil was a specimen of the [[choristodere]] ''[[Hyphalosaurus]]'', which had two heads- the oldest known example of [[polycephaly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ji Q. |author2=Wu X.-C. |author3=Cheng Y.-N. | year = 2010 | title = Cretaceous choristoderan reptiles gave birth to live young | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 97 | issue = 4| pages = 423–428 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-010-0654-2 | pmid=20179895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plantae==
In [[botany]], teratology investigates the theoretical implications of abnormal specimens. For example, the discovery of abnormal flowers—for example, flowers with leaves instead of petals, or flowers with staminoid pistils—furnished important evidence for the "[[ABC model of flower development|foliar theory]]", the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves.

The '''Triad''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triadcentral.org Triad Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to decision-making for [[Hazardous waste|hazardous-waste]] [[waste dump|site]] cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;pp.91-111, Crumbling, Griffith, Powell&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, technology advocates from the environmental sector in the United States developed the approach by combining innovations in management and technology with ideas from hazardous-waste site cleanup experience.

Their goal was to form a framework for real-time [[environmental sensor]]s and tools, to improve decision-making at contaminated sites. This resulted in a more formalized set of ideas in [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html 2001] that soon became known as the Triad approach. The ideas spawned a [[Community of practice|Community of Practice]] by 2005.

The Triad Community of Practice&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/user/cop/&lt;/ref&gt; includes representatives of federal, state, and private sector organizations in the U.S. and abroad. By 2008, a European CoP had been formed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cysense.com/index.asp?pageID=133 European CoP Info]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a technical conference led largely by the CoP and covering the Triad Approach was held at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, "Triad Investigations: New Approaches and Innovative Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html 2008 Triad Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314225529/http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html |date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The term Triad represents three elements: systematic project planning (SPP), dynamic work strategies, and innovative rapid sampling and analytical technologies. While elements of the Triad have long been used for site cleanup, Triad packages these [[best practices|best management practices]] together with the guiding principles:

# Use a planning process, which includes participation of all stakeholders (including a multidisciplinary project team, federal and state regulators, legal counsel, community members, and other environmental professionals), to determine the types of data required and to evaluate whether the site could benefit from real-time measurement technologies.
# Discussion of uncertainty management, data representativeness, and site closure strategies.
# Use of a site model that recognizes site characterization is an element used at all stages of remediation.   
# Use of sampling, measurement, and data management technologies to support [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html uncertainty management strategies].  
# Project teams that have communication, trust, discussion of individual interests and goals, and expertise in the appropriate fields.

Triad is an open-marketplace idea that is not owned by one entity. There is considerable U.S. Multiagency support for Triad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/multiagency/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation expressed support of Triad by requesting the cooperation of its regional managers to expand the use of Triad at Superfund sites, where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/Triad_Policy_Memo.pdf EPA Memo OSWER-9200.1-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of the Triad==
Although the following elements are the legs that gave the impetus for calling the process "Triad," the goal of the Triad approach is to infuse the concepts into hazardous-waste site cleanups, no matter what the lead organization calls the process. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Technical Project Planning Process (TPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715135918/http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for systematic planning, for example.)

===Systematic Project Planning===
Project planning identifies the problems and encourages stakeholders to negotiate the steps necessary to mediate the risks the environmental contamination pose to human health and ecology. The specific goals of a project (redevelopment, revitalization, etc.) may differ, but the specific objectives during the SPP process are:

*Frame the problem: identify project objectives, constraints, stakeholders, the regulatory framework, and primary/secondary decisions.
*Develop a site model: construct and maintain a site model that captures information pertinent to the primary/secondary decisions that must be made. The term CSM is updated by identifying data gaps, and developing a dynamic work strategy to fill in the data gaps.
*Evaluate and manage uncertainty: evaluate and manage the uncertainty associated with decision-making in the context of the CSM so that decisions can be made with acceptable levels of confidence.

===Dynamic work strategies===
Dynamic work strategies are strategies that can be adapted to site conditions as new information becomes available while work is underway. This adaptation may be in response to data collection activities designed to address CSM unknowns, or it may be in response to completely unexpected site conditions encountered during the course of work.

Dynamic work strategies as part of a Triad approach can be included in almost every activity associated with hazardous waste site characterization and remediation. This includes overall project strategies, dynamic sampling and analysis programs (DSP,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Robbat, Jr., 1997, A Guideline for Dynamic Workplans and Field Analytics: The Keys to Cost-Effective Site Characterization and Cleanup [http://ase.tufts.edu/chemistry/robbat/documents/DynamicWorkplans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ASAP &lt;ref&gt;US-DOE, 2001. Adaptive Sampling and Analysis Programs (ASAPs). Report DOE/EM-0592 [https://frtr.gov/pdf/asap_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) for characterization purposes, remedial action design, implementation, and performance monitoring, long-term monitoring for sites that require it, closure plans, and quality assurance/quality control activities.

===Innovative rapid sampling===
Sometimes referred to as 'real-time' measurement systems, these are analytical or measurement technologies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char1_tech.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; capable of producing data quickly enough to direct the progress of field activities (characterization or remediation) while they are underway [http://www.triadcentral.org/mgmt/meas/key/index.cfm], analogous to [[Real time business intelligence|Real-time business intelligence]]. Example analytical methods include portable or handheld X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF [http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/xrf.cfm XRF]), portable gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technologies, and [[immunoassay]] [[test kit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/immunoassay.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; New field analytical methods are fast developing. However, some have used standard laboratory approaches with quick turn-around results. The analysis enables in-field decision-making ''and'' ensures logical internal consistency among Triad concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/tio/download/char/epa542f07001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual site models==
At the core of each project is the conceptual site model (CSM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/CSM_checklist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term CSM is sometimes used to only describe pieces of the whole model. Geological, hydrogeological, contaminant fate and transport all may have computer models referred to as 'conceptual,' and a risk assessment may contain a CSM, but in a Triad sense, a CSM is the holistic model that can effectively portray site concerns significant to the decisions that must be made.
