      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2990">'''Abortion in Montenegro''' is legal on request during the first ten weeks of pregnancy. Between ten and 20 weeks, abortions must be approved a committee, and may only be performed for medical reasons, if the child is expected to be born with serious disabilities, if the pregnancy is the result of a crime, or if the woman could face serious family circumstances during pregnancy or after birth. Between 20 and 32 weeks, abortions must be approved by an ethics committee, and are only granted for medical reasons or in the case of serious fetal defects; after 32 weeks, abortions can only be permitted to save the pregnant woman's life. The current abortion law, which dates from 2009, repealed the previous 1977 law enacted by Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite web | title = Law on the conditions and procedures for abortion, 27 July 2009. | date = 27 July 2009 | language = sr | url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/abortion/MONTENEGRO.abo.htm | publisher=Harvard School of Public Health | deadurl=no | archivedate=5 June 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605205812/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/abortion/MONTENEGRO.abo.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman must pay for an abortion performed on request, and abortions can only be performed in medical institutions that meet certain minimum standards. [[Sex-selective abortion]] is specifically prohibited, as are tests of the fetus's sex during the first ten weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="law"/&gt; However, the ratio of males to females at birth was 109.8 over 2009-2011, an abnormally high number that, according to a report by the [[United Nations Population Fund]], suggests sex selection is occurring.&lt;ref name="unfpa"&gt;{{cite book |last= Guilmoto |first=Christophe Z. |date=2012 |title=Sex Imbalances at Birth: Current trends, consequences and policy implications |url=https://www.unfpa.org/public/cache/offonce/home/publications/pid/12405 |location= |publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund]] Asia and Pacific Regional Office |pages= |isbn= |accessdate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tomovic |first= Dusica  |date=24 March 2014 |title=Montenegro Urged to Stop Gender-Selective Abortions |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/council-of-europe-urges-montenegro-to-quit-gender-selective-abortions |newspaper=Balkan Insight |location= |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 6.3 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afra Airlines''' was a privately owned [[Ghana]]ian [[airline]], established in 2003 in [[Accra]]. It was intended as a new consumer airline to be focused on providing low-cost air services to and from destinations within Ghana, [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]].  It had management connections with [[Global Air (Australian airline)|Global Air Group]], which was also unsuccessful.  Afra Airlines itself ceased trading in 2005.

==History==
Afra Airlines was established in 2003 by Luke and Simone Butler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050128005484/en/Global-Air-Afra-Airlines-Signing-Babcock-Brown|title=Global Air and Afra Airlines: Signing of Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Engagement Letter For FF-1080-300 Fleet Purchase|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had moved to Accra to establish Afra Airlines, Afra Resorts &amp; Holdings and Afra Air Cargo.  The airline was awarded its Air Carriers licence for cargo and passenger operations by the [[Ghana Civil Aviation Authority]], and an Air Tour Operators Licence from the [[Ghana Tourist Board]].

In January 2005 it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050128005484/en/Global-Air-Afra-Airlines-Signing-Babcock-Brown|title=Global Air and Afra Airlines: Signing of Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Engagement Letter For FF-1080-300 Fleet Purchase|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Afra Airlines was to merge with [[Boeing 747]] owner and charter operator, [[Global Air (Australian airline)|Global Air Group]], to complete financing arrangements for the purchase of 100 [[Utilicraft Aerospace Industries]] new [[Utilicraft FF-1080|FF-1080-300]] Freight Feeder aircraft, for deliveries starting in 2007.

Afra Airlines also entered a co-operative agreement with [[CTK - CiTylinK]] on new regional services. The new service, [[AfraCityLink]], was scheduled to start domestic services on 15 February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''Airliner World'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Afra Airlines claimed official frustration and corruption by the then [[Government of Ghana]] prevented it from operating. As a direct consequence Afra Airlines laid off 40 Ghanaian staff, closed its offices and put its investments in Ghana on hold for the foreseeable future.

'''''Apophthegmatum opus''''' is a translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Apophthegmata_Laconica|Apophthegmata]]'' by [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], a collection of [[apophthegm]]s from [[classical antiquity]].{{cn|date=October 2015}} Many classical apophthegms repeated ideas of [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Alexander the Great]].{{cn|date=October 2015}} According to Speroni, ''Apophthegmatum opus'' is one of "the most monumental collections of classical apophthegms… ever assembled…"&lt;ref&gt;Speroni, C. (1964). ''Wit and wisdom of the Italian Renaissance,'' Berkeley, CA, USA: University of California Press.{{full|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}  Here are a few samples of Erasmus' apophthegms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While on the march with his army one winter, Alexander the Great was sitting by a campfire, watching the army as it marched by. He noticed an old warrior shivering from the cold, trying to find a place near the fire. Alexander bade the man sit in his own chair, saying, "If you had been born a Persian, it would cost you your head to sit in the king's chair, but you are a Macedonian, not a Persian. Sit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=|last=|title=The Apophthegmes of Erasmus, Translated into English by Nicolas Udall; Literally Reprinted from the Scarce Edition of 1564 |publisher=Robert Roberts |place= Boston, Lincolnshire |year= 1877|url=https://archive.org/stream/apopthegmesofera00erasuoft#page/224/mode/2up |page= 224|accessdate= 18 January 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Metellus once accused Cicero of having caused more people to die through his personal testimony than he had saved through his representing them in court. Cicero responded, "Indeed, for my integrity exceeds my eloquence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=|last=|title=The Apophthegmes of Erasmus, Translated into English by Nicolas Udall; Literally Reprinted from the Scarce Edition of 1564 |publisher=Robert Roberts |place= Boston, Lincolnshire |year= 1877|url=https://archive.org/stream/apopthegmesofera00erasuoft#page/340/mode/2up |page= 341 |accessdate= 18 January 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A certain young gentleman who had come to Rome from the provinces was found to bear an astonishing resemblance to Augustus Caesar. Hearing this, Augustus had the man brought before him. Perceiving the close resemblance, Augustus asked him, "Tell me, did your mother ever spend any time in Rome?" The quick-witted provincial shot back, "My mother, never; my father, often."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=|last=|title=The Apophthegmes of Erasmus, Translated into English by Nicolas Udall; Literally Reprinted from the Scarce Edition of 1564 |publisher=Robert Roberts |place= Boston, Lincolnshire |year= 1877|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924027287014#page/n281/mode/2up |pages=272–273 |accessdate= 18 January 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of Socrates' lessons was that men should abstain from foods that might provoke a man to eat when he has no hunger, and drinks that might provoke him to drink when he has no thirst. He went on to say that the best sauce in the world is to be hungry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=|last=|title=The Apophthegmes of Erasmus, Translated into English by Nicolas Udall; Literally Reprinted from the Scarce Edition of 1564 |publisher=Robert Roberts |place= Boston, Lincolnshire |year= 1877|url=https://archive.org/stream/apopthegmesofera00erasuoft#page/2/mode/2up |pages= 2–3|accessdate= 18 January 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ba Cissoko''' is a [[Guinea]]n [[world music]] band featuring five members, two of whom play the traditional [[kora (instrument)|Kora harp]]. Two band members play percussion instruments and one plays bass. The sound of the band has been described as "West Africa meets Jimi Hendrix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1079&amp;Itemid=168|title = West Africa meets Jimi Hendrix|publisher = Joburg|accessdate = 1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The band is named after the lead singer and electronic Kora player, Ba Cissoko, the nephew of the kora maestro M'Bady Kouyaté. Band members include Sekou Kouyaté also on kora, and bass player Kourou Kouyaté, both Ba Cissoko's younger cousins.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/africabeyond/africaonyourstreet/features/17791.shtml |title=Africa on Your Street |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=July 2007 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sekou Kouyaté]]: [[Kora (instrument)|Kora]] (acoustical and electrical), vocal

*[[Ibrahima Bah "Kounkouré"]]: [[Calebasse]], [[djembé]], [[crin]], [[congas]]
*[[Alhassane Camara]]: [[percussion]]

==History==
Ba Cissoko was created in 1999 with just three members. The last member is featured on the recent album release from 2009 called Séno. The band toured the UK supporting acclaimed [[Nigeria]]n musician [[Femi Kuti]] in 2007.

Sekou Kouyaté can with his electronically enhanced Kora harp produce a sound somewhat similar to that of fast [[guitar tapping]], partly helped by the nature of the instrument. The new sound has earned Sekou the nickname of "Jimi Hendrix Africain", due to [[Jimi Hendrix]] style [[riffs]].

The '''Bati–Angba''' or '''Bwa languages''' are a clade of [[Bantu language]]s, about half of Zone C.40 in Guthrie's classification. According to Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003), these languages form a valid node. They are:
: [[Bwa language|Bwa]] (Yewu, Benge–Baati) – [[Pagibete language|Pagibete]], [[Kango language (Bas-Uélé District)|Kango]]&lt;!--included in Ehret--&gt;, [[Bango language|Bango]] (Babango), [[Ngelima language|Ngelima]] (Angba)

In addition, Nurse &amp; Philippson report that Bati–Angba may be a part of [[Komo–Bira languages]]. The proposal is called '''[[Boan languages|Boan]]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2605">'''Dayviews''' (formerly Bilddagboken, "picture diary") is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[virtual community]] where users can upload photographs and present these to other members. The community has succeeded well on the virtual community market in Sweden, primarily because the site is aimed entirely at sharing images, while other communities in Sweden are mostly aimed at chatting. The page is, according to themselves, ''Sweden's largest and fastest growing website''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilddagboken.se/ The news page as a logged in member]&lt;/ref&gt; 
(Statistics about Swedish commercial websites is available at Kiaindex – [http://www.kiaindex.org/?natoff=1])

The page has about 20,000 to 80,000 members logged in at any given time and about six million visitors (one million unique visitors) per week (July 2008).

On 15 October 2007 it was confirmed that [[Lunarstorm]] had bought 40% of Bilddagboken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resume.se/nyheter/2007/02/15/lunarstorm-koper-del-av-bi/index.xml Resumé: Lunarstorm köper del av Bilddagboken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128174657/http://www.resume.se/nyheter/2007/02/15/lunarstorm-koper-del-av-bi/index.xml |date=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2008, the community surpassed more than 200 million uploaded images. It also reached 800,000 members in the same week.&lt;ref&gt;A thread in the bilddagboken.se forum http://bilddagboken.se/p/forum.html?fID=4&amp;tID=60518&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Bilddagboken had more than 100,000 users logged in at the same time, setting a record for itself. This effectively overloaded the servers and caused slow surfing at their site. Recently, Bilddagboken has also created a new forum for all users.

As of 2008, Bilddagboken is available in 5 different languages (see below).

The Bilddagboken sister sites have been 'live' for almost 2 years and have failed to capture any presence within International markets.

Bilddagboken.se and Myphotodiary.com are since November 2009 the same site, with a link to change language in the footer of the page, although only Swedish and English are available at this time. The other localizations are still separate sites.

'''Carabao Dang Energy Drink''' ({{lang-th|คาราบาวแดง}}; {{rtgs|''kharabao daeng''}}) ''Khārābāw dæng'', ('red [[water buffalo]]') is a Thai [[energy drink]] launched in 2002 by Carabao Tawandang Co Ltd. It is now Thailand's second most popular [[energy drink]]. It is the key brand of Carabao Tawandang in Thailand, with an estimated 21 percent market share in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financeasia.com/News/391786,carabao-aims-to-energise-thai-ipo-market.aspx |title= Carabao aims to energise Thai IPO market |date= 2014-11-04 |website= FinanceAsia |access-date= 2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The name "Carabao Dang" comes from the Carabao Group's association with the band [[Carabao (band)|Carabao]], combined with the German Tawandang Brewery Restaurant. It is marketed with the slogan "Carabao Dang: The Fighting Spirit".&lt;ref name="CGroup"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background and Major Developments|url=http://www.carabaogroup.com/en/about/background|website=Carabao Group|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drink's launch was accompanied by a high profile TV advertising campaign featuring the company founder, rock star Yuenyong Opakul, also known as [[Aed Carabao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Red Bull now chasing country music fans |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9887700_ITM |work=[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign was investigated by the Office of the Consumer Protection Board for being too violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=STAMINA DRINKS: Govt sees red over ads |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.arcview.php?clid=2&amp;id=69508 |work=The Nation |date=2002-11-20 |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but went on to win a gold and a silver medal at ''Media &amp; Marketing'' magazine's Asian Brand Marketing Effectiveness Awards in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gold award for Carabao Daeng |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-879149_ITM |work=The Nation |date=2003-09-30 |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second ad, featuring clips of late actor [[Denholm Elliott]], digitally altered so he was drinking Carabao from a trough, was less successful. 

The drink was introduced to the United States and Europe under the brand name ''Carabao'' leading to an increase in sales of the Thai brand on the west coast of the US in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carabao Dang Firm Takes Aim at U.S., European Beverage Markets |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17905553_ITM |work=[[Bangkok Post]] |date=2004-06-22 |accessdate=2008-04-28 | first=Bamrung | last=Amnatcharoenrit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exports to China and India began in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carabao plans expansion in both China and India|url=http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Business-and-Industry/164331290 |work=[[Knight-Ridder]] Tribune Business News |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2008-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carabao was introduced in Australia at the beginning of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carabaoenergy.com.au/history|title=History||website=Carabao Australia}}{{failed verification|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market and share==
The market for energy drinks in Thailand is estimated at 35 billion [[Thai baht|baht]] in 2018. Carabao research indicates that more than eight million Thais consume energy drinks. Nineteen percent live in Bangkok, 32 percent in other urban areas. and 49 percent in rural provinces. Carabao aims to increase its market share from 25 percent in 2018 to 33 percent in 2020, making it the leader in the domestic energy drinks market.&lt;ref name="BP-20180817"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sritama |first1=Suchat |title=Carabao aims to become top drink in Thailand |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1523094/carabao-aims-to-become-top-drink-in-thailand |accessdate=19 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carabao Group expects 2018 revenues to reach 15 billion baht, up from 13 billion baht in 2017.&lt;ref name="BP-20180817"/&gt;

==Production==
Carabao completed work on a new production center in the [[Bang Pakong District]] of [[Chachoengsao Province]] in mid-2018. The 8.7 billion baht, 180 [[Rai (unit)|rai]] facility includes a glass bottle plant, an aluminum can plant, and a bottling plant. Bottle production will increase to 1.6 billion bottles per year, up from 1 billion, and can production will increase from 800 million per year to 1.5 billion. Future plans include a fourth factory on the site.&lt;ref name="BP-20180817"/&gt;

The '''Colombo Plan Staff College for Technician Education (CPSC)''' is a regional [[inter-governmental organization]] in [[Asia Pacific]] region mandated to enhance Vocational Education and Training in its member countries.

CPSC is a specialized agency of the [[Colombo Plan]].

==History==
Responding to the need to improve the quality of technician education and training, the Member Governments of the Colombo Plan considered the recommendation of the [[Singapore Colloquium]] in May 1969 to establish a Regional Center for Technician Teacher Training.  Adopted during the 20th [[Consultative Committee Meeting]] in [[Canada]] in October 1969, the said recommendation was firmed up into a feasibility study which was conducted from March to June 1970. Results were presented during the 21st Consultative Committee Meeting (CCM), referred for Further Study and examined by a working party of experts in February 1971, October 1971 and February 1972, respectively.  After a thorough scrutiny, it was finally approved during the 22nd CCM in November 1972.  A [[Memorandum of Understanding]] relating to the establishment of the Colombo Plan Staff College for Technician Education (CPSC) as a regional center followed during the 23rd CCM in December 1973.

The '''Emblem of the Transcaucasian SFSR''' was adopted by the government of the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]]. The final version was adopted in 1930.

The emblem is based loosely on the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union|state emblem]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. It incorporates designs from each of the three major groups that combined in the Transcaucasian SFSR, the [[Armenians]], [[Azeri]] and [[Georgian people|Georgians]], and unusually features [[Islam]]ic art and [[communist]] elements side by side. The [[latticework]] in the star itself bespeaks the former [[Coat of arms of Georgia (country)|coat of arms of Georgia]] from 1918-1921 and adopted again from 1991-2004; the [[crescent]] represents the Muslim Azeris, on a background depicting the national symbol of the Armenians, [[Mount Ararat]]. The rising sun stands for the future, the star as well as the [[hammer and sickle]] for the victory of [[communism]] and the "world-wide socialist community of states". 

In 1936, the republic was dissolved and the three regions became the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian]], [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian]], and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3564">The '''Euromed Heritage programme''' was a programme (1998-2013) chartered by the [[Barcelona Declaration]] and funded through the resulting [[Euro-Mediterranean Partnership]].&lt;ref name=Barcelona-1995&gt;{{cite web|title=EU legislation enabling the Barcelona accord|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/external_relations/relations_with_third_countries/mediterranean_partner_countries/r15001_en.htm|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its purpose was to foster regional inter-cultural dialogue between the member states of the [[Mediterranean Countries|Mediterranean]], through collaboration on the preservation of [[Cultural heritage preservation|cultural heritages]].&lt;ref name=Ferrero-Waldner&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Benita Ferrero-Waldner, former EU Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy|url=http://www.euromedheritage.net/euroshared/doc/benita_ferrero-waldner.htm|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1995, Euromed Heritage has obtained funding and embarked upon several initiatives.  As of 2010, 400 partner organizations from Mediterranean countries have benefited from funding provided by Euromed Heritage.&lt;ref name=MedHeritageBackground&gt;{{cite web|title=Mediterranean Heritage background page|url=http://www.euromedheritage.net/intern.cfm?menuID=7&amp;submenuID=24|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euromed Heritage I==
Between 1998 and 2004, the programme focused largely on collecting [[cultural heritage|heritage]] inventories and fostering networks of [[Mediterranean people|peoples]] and organizations around the [[Mediterranean]].  Other activities included the creation of an encyclopedia, sponsoring [[festival]]s, [[Trade fair|exposition]]s, exhibits and promotions.&lt;ref name=MedHeritageProjects&gt;{{cite web|title=Mediterranean Heritage projects page|url=http://www.euromedheritage.net/intern.cfm?menuID=7&amp;submenuID=1|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euromed Heritage II==
Between 2002 and 2007, an initiative to improve organizational capabilities to preserve heritage was conducted.  [[Intangible heritage]] was an emphasis, with several projects involving historic aspects of heritage such as historic Mediterranean coastal defense and navigation.&lt;ref name=MedHeritageProjects/&gt;

==Euromed Heritage III==
Between 2004 and 2008, another initiative of the programme focused on [[Islamic art]], as well as [[Islamic culture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine culture]].&lt;ref name=MedHeritageProjects/&gt;

==Euromed Heritage IV==
The emphasis of the programme from 2008 through 2012 was the appropriation of the various cultural heritages by nations' own peoples, through [[education]] and knowledge.  This project also provided a framework and facilitated the development of [[best practice]]s for cultural preservation.  Euromed IV involved partners from the [[European Union]] and several Mediterranean partner countries, including Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Tunisia.&lt;ref name=MedHeritageProjects/&gt;

Euromed Heritage IV completed its activities on February 15, 2013. Their [[website]] remains accessible for public use. The outputs of the programme— knowledge, tools, methodologies— are available on the [[e-corpus]] [[digital library]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euromedheritage.net/intern.cfm?menuID=9&amp;submenuID=7&amp;idnews=831|title=Cultural Heritage programme: Euromed Heritage 4|website=www.euromedheritage.net|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany''' (Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Norddeutschland) is a [[Landeskirche|member church]] of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, EKD). It was established on 27 May 2012 as a merger of the [[North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]], and the [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church]]. It covers the combined area of all those former member churches, which are the federal states of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. Nordkirche is the only Landeskirche in Germany which covers parts of both [[New states of Germany]] and West Germany. It is also called Nordkirche (North Church). It has 2,063,904 members (31/12/2016). There are 1,704 ordained pastors and more than 84,000 volunteers working for Nordkirche (4/2016).

==Bishops==
There are five bishops (8/2018): One ''Landesbischof'' (Presiding Bishop; literally: "State Bishop") as the ''primate'' resp. ''metropolitan bishop'', who got his see in [[Schwerin]], and four ''Bischöfe im Sprengel'' (bishops in the dioceses; "Sprengel" means diocese):
* Presiding Bishop [[Gerhard Ulrich]] (Episcopal see in Schwerin)
* Sprengel ''Schleswig und Holstein'': Bishop [[Gothard Magaard]] (Episcopal see in [[Schleswig]])
* Sprengel ''Hamburg und Lübeck'': Bishop [[Kirsten Fehrs]] (Episcopal see in [[Hamburg]])
* Sprengel ''Mecklenburg und Pommern'': Bishop Dr [[Andreas von Malzahn]] (Episcopal see in Schwerin)
* Sprengel ''Mecklenburg und Pommern'': Bishop Dr [[Hans-Jürgen Abromeit]] (Episcopal see in [[Greifswald]])
Presiding Bishop Gerhard Ulrich also served as  ''Leitender Bischof'' (Leading Bishop) of [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany]] from 2011 until 2018. Ulrich will be retired  as presiding bishop in spring of 2019. On 27 September 2018, the General Synod elected the regional bishop (Regionalbischöfin) Kristina Kühnbaum-Schmidt as new Presiding Bishop (Landesbischöfin). The presiding bishop preaches in Schwerin and Lübeck cathedral.

==Dioceses==
The three dioceses consists of 13 Kirchenkreise (districts) in total.

'''Sprengel Schleswig und Holstein''' (Diocese of Schleswig and Holstein) covers the state of Schleswig-Holstein without some parts of Southern Holstein (larger urban zone of Hamburg), Lübeck and the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]]. The parishes in Nordschleswig (Danish: ''Nordslesvig'') in Southern Danmark (Jutland) also belong to the Diocese of Schleswig and Holstein.
* Kirchenkreis Altholstein
* Kirchenkreis Dithmarschen
* Kirchenkreis Nordfriesland 
* Kirchenkreis Ostholstein
* Kirchenkreis Plön-Segeberg 
* Kirchenkreis Rantzau-Münsterdorf

* Kirchenkreis Hamburg-West/Südholstein
* Kirchenkreis Lübeck-Lauenburg 

'''Sprengel Mecklenburg und Pommern''' (Diocese of Mecklenburg and Pommern) covers the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
* Kirchenkreis Mecklenburg 
* Kirchenkreis Pommern

==Organisation==
The Sprengel of ''Mecklenburg und Pommern'' got two bishops because of the latest merger of the former regional churches of Mecklenburg and Pommern with Nordelbien. After a period of transition there will only be one bishop for the Sprengel.
The headquarters (Landeskirchenamt) are in Kiel and in Schwerin. Each Sprengel is structured into many districts ("Kirchenkreise"); there are 13 districts. The ''Kirchenkreis'' is the unit of some parishes. 

Instruments of organisation are:
* Landessynode (general synod; literally: State Synod); praeses: Ulrike Hillmann. The synod consists of both, clergy and lay people. The Landessynode regularly meets in Lübeck.
The synod is led by the praeses.
: 2012-2018: Dr Andreas Tietze
: since 2018: Ulrike Hillmann

* Landeskirchenamt (church administrative office); president: Prof Dr Peter Unruh. The Landeskirchenamt is based in Kiel and in Schwerin.
* Bischofsrat (bishops' council). The Bischofsrat consist of all bishops of Nordkirche. THe chair is the Presiding Bishop.
* Kirchenleitung (church executive board). The Kirchenleitung consists of all bishops and of representatives of clergy, lay people and staff. The chair is the Presiding Bishop.

==Practices and life of the church==
The Centre for Global Ministries and Ecumenical Relations (Zentrum für Mission und Ökumene, ZMÖ) is based in Breklum, North Frisia (head office) and in Hamburg (staffed office). It cares about all international and ecumenical relationships of Nordkirche. It has its roots in Breklum's missionary society, founded in 1876 by pastor Christian Jensen. They prepared and sent missionaries to India and to the US, then also to Tanzania, China and Papua-Neuguinea.

[[Ordination of women]] and [[blessing of same-sex unions|blessing of same-sex marriages]] were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.evangelisch.de/inhalte/132237/27-02-2016/nordkirche-will-segnung-von-homosexuellen-paaren-ermoeglichen Evangelisch.de: Nordkirche will Segnung von homosexuellen Paaren ermöglichen (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Maria Jepsen was the first woman worldwide who became female bishop. She served as bishop of the former diocese (Sprengel) of Hamburg from 1992-2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.evangelisch.de/inhalte/143019/04-04-2017/maria-jepsen-war-die-erste-bischoefin&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hevesi Sándor Theatre''' (''Hevesi Sándor Színház'') is a theatre in the city of [[Zalaegerszeg]], [[Hungary]]. Its building is situated in the city centre, on Kosztolányi street.

==History==
Work on the building of the theatre began in the late 1950s, with the original goal to house cultural and artistic events for the working class - it was then known as Worker's Home of Trade Unions of Zalaegerszeg (''Szakszervezetek Zalaegerszegi Munkásotthona''). It opened with the play ''[[Bánk bán]]'' by [[József Katona]] on 28 January 1968. From 1966 to 1980 it functioned as the cultural center of Zala county (''Megyei Művelődési Központ''). In 1980 work began to modernise it for proper theatrical use and the Hevesi Sándor Theatre was inaugurated on 11 October 1983 with the play ''[[Az ember tragédiája]]'' by [[Imre Madách]].

The '''Kumakatok''' (''"door knockers"'') are a group of three robed figures believed by many in the Philippines to knock on doors in the middle of the night and bring bad omens. They allegedly look like humans, but wear hoods that obscure their faces to some extent. One resembles a young female, while the other two look like elderly men.

A visit from the Kumakatok is usually an omen of death, as either the eldest member of the house, or one who is ill, will be visited and subsequently die. The visits are supposedly more frequent after a disease outbreak. Residents of [[Luzon]] and [[Visayas]] at one time painted white crosses on their doors to ward off the Kumakatok. This trend was said to cause the trio to switch from residences to government buildings, hospitals, and even churches.

Reported sightings of the Kumakatok have decreased significantly since World War II. One explanation is that many buildings were destroyed at that time, leaving the Kumakakok few doors upon which to knock.

Folklore of the [[Luo peoples]] of [[Kenya]] speaks of a mighty warrior known as '''Luanda Magere''' (Alternative spelling is Lwanda). He belonged to the Sidho clan in Kano, and he was believed to have once walked the shores of the [[Lake Victoria]]. The Sidho clan occupies the present sugar belt at the foot of the Nandi escarpment. He was possessed of unearthly powers, and his flesh was made of stone. Arrows, spears and clubs simply deflected from his body, making him invincible during warfare. He was famously known for his capability to tear an entire army apart.

==Story==
The Luo traditional enemies at the time were the Lang'o (Luo name for the Kalenjin community) . The Lang'o were tired of being defeated at war by the Luo. The Nandi elders sat to discuss the issue and came to a conclusion where they would give Luanda Magere a Nandi girl to marry, claiming that it was a gesture of peace. The girl's role was to find out how to defeat him. They therefore picked the most beautiful Nandi girl and sent her to him. Though the Luo elders advised him not to take the girl, Luanda Magere did not heed their advice. Luanda Magere's eventual downfall came at the hands of his wife. Now it happened that whenever Luanda was sick, his first wife would care for him. One day he fell ill when his first wife was away. He therefore called his Lang'o wife to bring him some medicine. Luanda instructed her to cut his shadow with a knife and instill the medicine. She was surprised when she saw his shadow bleed. That night, she crept out of Lwanda's home and ran back to her people. She was received with joy when she told them her husband's weakness: that his shadow was made of flesh and was vulnerable to attack. The news quickly spread.
The Nandi knew that the Luo would not expect them to attack as Luanda had married one of them making them kinsmen.
They then attacked the Luo. The Luo fought fiercely and Luanda killed so many Nandi warriors that they decided to retreat. As he was running, one Nandi warrior remembered that Luanda's strength was in his shadow. He stood at a hill and threw his spear at Luanda's shadow. Luanda Magere fell down and died. His body turned to stone. the stone is there to date and is a tourist attraction point.

==Legacy==
A site in Sidho with a stone is still revered as the spot where Luanda Magere died and people come from far and wide to conduct rituals and prayers at the site. Luanda Magere is still celebrated among the Luo through song and dance. This folktale is told to generations and taught to children at Primary school level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2965">'''Luso-Africans''' are Africans who are people of mixed [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] heritage generally living in [[Africa]]. This ethnic identity arose from the sixteenth century as primarily male Portuguese settlers, often [[Lançados]], settled in various parts of Africa, often marrying African women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newitt|first1=Malyn|title=“Portuguese” Style and Luso-African Identity: Precolonial Senegambia, Sixteenth-Nineteenth Centuries|url=http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/review/portuguese-style-and-luso-african-identity-precolonial-senegambia-sixteenth-nineteenth-centuries/|website=Leeds University Centre for African Studies|publisher=Leeds University|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also a term for slaves from Brazil who were freed. "These individuals often established profitable trade links between Africa and Brazil. They were so numerous that their homes, characterized by what is known as Brazilian-style architecture, can still be seen in many port cities along the African coast. These individuals helped strengthen the cultural ties between African communities on both sides of the Atlantic."{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In the fifteenth and sixteenth century, Portuguese traders settled in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] and along the West African coast from [[Senegal]] to [[Sierra Leone]]. Descendants of these traders and of local African women formed the nucleus of a Luso-African community that soon developed a distinctive culture, joining elements of European and local African culture. These Luso-Africans, or 'Portuguese' as they called themselves, were commercial middlemen, distinguished by their language (Portuguese and, later, [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Crioulo]]), architecture and Christian religion. As each of these characteristics could be shared by members of adjacent African communities, identity transformations in both directions were relatively common. 'Portuguese' identity remained both fluid and contextually defined through the seventeenth century. During the eighteenth and nineteenth century, however, 'Portuguese' were drawn increasingly into a European discourse on identity, one based upon a priori characteristics, primarily skin color. Forced to respond to this imposed identity, Luso-Africans continued to maintain that they were 'Portuguese'; now, however, they also began to define themselves negatively by reference to what they were not.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle de Bangui''' is a French international school in [[Bangui]], [[Central African Republic]]. The school serves levels ''maternelle'' (preschool) through ''lycée'' (senior high school).&lt;ref name=AEFE&gt;"[http://www.aefe.fr/reseau-scolaire-mondial/rechercher-un-etablissement/centrafricaine-republique-bangui-lycee-francais Lycée français Charles-de-Gaulle]." [[AEFE]]. Retrieved on 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2013 there were 182 students. Most students were CAR citizens and several were binationals. A small number included French and other nationalities.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;"[http://www.ambafrance-cf.org/Le-lycee-Charles-de-Gaulle Lycée Français de Bangui]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6YSNrLS3s?url=http://www.ambafrance-cf.org/Le-lycee-Charles-de-Gaulle Archive]). Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle. Retrieved on May 12, 2015. "Les événements survenus à Bangui à partir de mars 2013 ont eu pour conséquence le rappel du personnel expatrié et résident et la mise en place d’une structure provisoire, le lycée restant homologué, pour l’année 2013-2014. En octobre 2013, l’établissement compte 182 élèves et l’essentiel de l’accompagnement des élèves, tous inscrits aux cours du CNED, est assuré par 19 assistants pédagogiques, tous recrutés locaux. Cette année, le lycée Charles-de-Gaulle scolarise une majorité d’élèves centrafricains et un nombre élevé de binationaux. Peu de Français sont présents ainsi que d’autres nationalités."&lt;/ref&gt;

The école française Charles-de-Gaulle and the Lycée Franco-Centrafricain [[André-Malraux]] merged on 1 September 1992, forming the Charles de Gaulle. French expatriates operating the school left the capital in 2013 due to the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–present)|Central African Republic conflict]].&lt;ref name=Page/&gt;

In 2007, the force had 240 officers serving a population of approximately 85,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html|title=Andorra|first=Ben|last=Cahoon|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101142336/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Andorra.html|archivedate=1 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The police force consists of the Directorate of the Police, four divisions which carry out the various missions of the police, and two "functional groups".&lt;ref name="POLIS"/&gt;

===Directorate of the Police===
The Directorate of the Police is composed of a Director, a Deputy Director who has the grade of police commissioner, a secretary, a planning and human resources officer and an administrative assistant. It directs police activities throughout the country. Its members are nominated by the [[Government of Andorra]] based on proposals from the [[Ministry of the Interior (Andorra)|Ministry of the Interior]].

===Divisions===
There are four Divisions with the following responsibilities:

*The Division of Criminal Police (similar to [[Kriminalpolizei]]) is in charge of [[criminal investigation]]s and divided into two investigation units. The first one, responsible for investigations aimed both at prevention and repression of crime, has sections dealing with [[drugs]], [[domestic violence]], [[organised crime]], general affairs, juveniles, and [[money laundering]]. The second investigates crimes brought to its attention and is also responsible for cases of [[alpine climate|climate]] accidents. Also in this area is the National Central Office of [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]].
*The Division of Public Security and Proximity comprises two uniformed units whose role is to ensure the overall safety and security of residents. The "Unit for Citizens' Security" is a proximity police intended to prevent offences and maintaining public order. The "Unit for Citizens' Awareness," a detachment of the central police, operates the Information Room, answers public queries, coordinates external services and supervises detention conditions.
*The Division of Police Support is responsible for operational support to the other divisions, as well as to the Directorate. It comprises six departments: analysis of criminal information; legal matters; information technology; training; prevention and social orientation; and management.
*The Division of Transit and Borders comprises two uniformed units: the Traffic Unit (similar to [[highway patrol]], [[motorcycle]] patrols to supervise the movement of vehicles at the national [[border]]s and intervene in case of accidents) and the Borders Unit (a [[border guard]] in charge of border immigration control) that works in co-operation with the Department of Immigration.

===Groups===
Six groups – for the [[executive protection|protection of VIPs]], [[bomb disposal]], [[riot police|order maintenance]], emergency situations, sniffer-dog training and mountain rescue – are formed by members of the four Divisions; are assembled in response to specific needs; and are assisted by colleagues from neighbouring countries, particularly in organising joint training programmes.

===Equipment===  
The Police Corps of Andorra is the more armed tactical team and they are referred as, Grup d'Intervencio Policia d'Andorra (GIPA) they are more armed than the average officer, these are some of the weapons they are issued: 
* [[Beretta 92]] (PAMAS G1- being phased out)

[[File:Russia Mercator 1595.jpg|thumb|Map showing Russia and Poland in 1595]]
The '''Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth''' was a proposed [[Sovereign state|state]] that would have been based on a [[personal union]] between the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. A number of serious attempts, by various means, to create such a union took place between 1574 and 1658, and even as late as the latter part of the 18th century, but it has never materialized due to incompatible demands from both sides.

The proposed union is known in [[Polish language|Polish]] [[historiography]] as the ''Triple Union'' (''unia troista'') and has also been called the ''Polish–Russian Union'' (''unia polsko-rosyjska'') or ''Polish–Muscovite Union'' (''unia polsko-moskiewska''). No well-established term for this entity exists in English-language histories.

==Rationale==
Proponents of such a union among the [[Polish nobility]], included the then influential secular thinkers [[Jan Zamoyski]] and [[Lew Sapieha]], had listed several arguments in its favor: peace on the turbulent eastern border, a powerful military ally and relatively sparsely populated territories (compared to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]]) for colonization and [[serfdom]]. The idea was also supported by the [[Jesuits]] and other papal emissaries who never ceased to entertain the idea of bringing [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Russia into the [[Catholicism|Catholic fold]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Some of the Russian [[boyar]]s found the proposal attractive (like [[Boris Godunov]], a supporter of Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor's I]] candidacy) for various reasons, among them the fact that the [[Golden Freedoms]] of the Commonwealth, if applied in Russia, would weaken [[tsar]]'s power and thus grant the Russian nobility a much higher status than they had enjoyed previously.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The proposals of that time revolved around introducing a [[personal union]] between the Commonwealth and Russia, and various economic and political agreements (elimination of [[trade barriers]], free movement of people, etc.), up to the creation of one country, using the framework of that led to the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the first place ([[Union of Lublin]] of 1569). However all proposals presented by the Polish side were rejected by the Russian tsar. The most promising negotiations took place during 1600, when a Polish diplomatic mission led by [[Lew Sapieha]] arrived in Moscow. Sapieha presented to [[Boris Godunov]] an elaborated idea of a union between Poland–Lithuania and Russia. The subjects of both rulers were to be free to serve the other ruler, travel to his country, contract marriages with the other ruler's subjects, own land and go to study in the other ruler's country.&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;Andrzej Nowak, ''Between Imperial Temptation and Anti-Imperial Function in Eastern European Politics: Poland from the Eighteenth to Twenty-First Century'', Slavic Euroasian Studies, Hokkaido University, [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no7_ses/chapter12.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Moscow side was willing to agree to some parts of the proposed treaties (like [[extradition]] of the crime suspects), it was strictly opposed to points about [[religious tolerance]] (non-Orthodox religions, especially Catholicism, were persecuted in Russia, unlike in Commonwealth, which allowed all faith to be preached) and free movement of people (according to Polish scholars).&lt;ref name="malec"/&gt; To transform the Russian [[tsardom]] into a [[republic]] modeled on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth has proven to be a too ambitious project. Many Russians were afraid of [[polonization]], as was already happening with Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility, and a growing danger stemming from the increasing number of peasant and even noble refugees escaping the Russian Empire,&lt;ref name="promemoria"&gt;[[Jerzy Czajewski]], ''"Zbiegostwo ludności Rosji w granice Rzeczypospolitej"'' (Russian population exodus into the Rzeczpospolita), Promemoria journal, October 2004 nr. (5/15), {{ISSN|1509-9091}}, [http://www.promemoria.org.pl/arch/2004_15/2004_15.html Table of Content online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312232518/http://www.promemoria.org.pl/arch/2004_15/2004_15.html |date=2006-03-12 }}, Polish language&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nowak2"&gt;Andrzej Nowak, ''The Russo-Polish Historical Confrontation'', [[Sarmatian Review]], January 1997, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/197/Nowak.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; to which Russian tsar Ivan responded with the policy of violent repressions, the so-called ''[[oprichnina]]''. [[Union of Brest]] of 1596 was a further argument for the Orthodox opponents of the closer ties between Russia and the Commonwealth, who argued that it was the prelude to Catholicization of Russia.

==History==

===Polish Succession===

[[File:Ivan the Terrible (cropped).JPG|thumb|Ivan IV of Russia was a candidate for Polish throne]]
The idea was first broached in the 16th century after the death of the last [[Polish king]] of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], [[Sigismund II Augustus]].  [[Tsar]] [[Ivan IV of Russia]] ("the Terrible") became a popular candidate among the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]]. He had substantial support in Poland, especially among the lesser and middle nobility, who saw in him an opportunity to limit the growing power of the [[Polish-Lithuanian magnates]]. During the [[Interrex (Poland)|interregnum]], two [[diplomatic missions]] (led by [[Michał Harraburda]], ''pisarz litewski'', and [[Jędrzej Taranowski]]) were sent from Poland to Moscow to hold discussions.  The negotiations failed, due to hostilities resulting from the [[Livonian War]], territorial demands by Ivan (who wanted former territories of [[Kievan Rus']], then under control of Lithuania), and decision by Ivan that Russian side will not 'lower itself to the level of other European monarchies and send a diplomatic mission to Poland begging for him to become a king'. During the second interregnum, in 1574, candidature of Ivan IV was even highly regarded in Poland, however the Moscow diplomatic mission that arrived in Poland had no orders nor prerogatives to negotiate this matter. Eventually the disappointed pro-Ivan faction, represented by [[Jan Sierakowski]], issued a statement in Sejm: ''...Great Prince of Muscovy would be the best choice for king, but due to his silence we are forced to forget him and should not mention him again''.&lt;ref name="malec"&gt;[[Jerzy Malec]], ''Szkice z dziejów federalizmu i myśli federalistycznych w czasach nowożytnych'', "Unia Troista", Wydawnictwo UJ, 1999, Kraków, {{ISBN|83-233-1278-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Succession===
[[File:Anonymous Prince Władysław Vasa (detail).jpg|thumb|Władysław Vasa of Poland claimed the Russian throne]]
The mixed circle of the proponents of this idea saw an opportunity in Russia after [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]], the last Russian ruler of that time whose legitimacy was never questioned, died. The proposal was revived soon after Ivan's death, through the reigns of [[Stefan Batory]] in Poland and [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor I]] in Russia. After Batory's death in 1587, Feodor I became quite interested in acquiring the Polish throne, and sent a diplomatic mission to Poland. His support among the Lithuanians was high, but Poles issued several demands, among them requiring Fedors's conversion to [[Catholicism]], an absolutely unthinkable event. Eventually [[Sigismund III Vasa]] was elected the king of Poland. Death of Feodor prompted Sigismund to propose his candidacy for the Moscow throne, however by the time Polish diplomatic mission arrived in Moscow, [[Boris Godunov]] was elected the new tsar.&lt;ref name="malec"/&gt;

With the legitimacy issues clouding the entire period of the rule of [[Boris Godunov]], Russia submerged into even greater chaos upon his death, the Russian [[Time of Troubles]], which was accompanied by a decisive Polish armed intervention, or the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)]], commonly referred to in Russia as the ''Polish intervention in the end-17th century''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In the course of the Polish–Muscovite War, the Polish prince (later king) [[Władysław IV Vasa]] was briefly elected a Russian Tsar among other such strange developments like [[enthronement]] and short reign of [[False Dmitriy I]], an [[impostor]] of tsar Ivan's son. However, Wladyslaw was never officially enthroned and his quick election remained in history as one of the fluke events of Russia's [[Time of Troubles]].

The idea was again proposed in 1656–1658, when Moscow suggested that one of the points of negotiations would be the election of the Russian tsar for the Polish throne. This time it was the Polish side which presented demands (conversion to Catholicism, territorial changes) that eventually discouraged Russians from pursuing this project.

===Proposal of the last Polish king===
Finally, the idea returned in the 18th century, when the last Polish king [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] attempted to save the Polish state by proposing a marriage between himself and [[List of Russian rulers|Russian Empress]], [[Catherine the Great]].

The very possibility that such an idea could have been seriously considered by the Polish side early on was likely based on the spirit of the 1573 [[Warsaw Confederation]] (Warsaw Compact), that guaranteed, at least formally, an equality for non-Catholic nobles in the Commonwealth. However, while the adopted convention was an unprecedentedly liberal act for its time, such full equality was never achieved in reality even within the Commonwealth itself. Taking into account that the most divisions of that time, if not dynastic, were the religious divisions and the relationship between the Catholic and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[East-West Schism|branches of Christianities]] were strained at best, it remains surprising that such an idea was seriously considered at all. It remains equally unlikely, that such an idea could have been accepted by the Russian side because the view towards Catholicism in the Russian Empire was highly negative.

Thus, while the idea of a Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth was supported early on by some progressive and secular Polish diplomats, in the end the efforts of the few could not overcome Russian opposition to Catholicism and the fear that such a union would spell Catholic domination over the Orthodox religion.

The '''Qauqaut''' ({{zh|c=猴猴族|p=Hóuhóu Zú}}) are a [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aboriginal]] people who live primarily in the town of [[Su-ao, Yilan|Su-ao]] in [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]]. They spoke the [[Basay language]], which is a [[East Formosan languages|Kavalanic language]]. According to [[Ino Kanori]], the Qauqaut people have been assimilated by the [[Kavalan people]]. The Qauqaut people are not recognised by the government of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RcF5tZ7N-4sC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=qauqaut+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqzLDK3pzTAhVmD8AKHTkyClUQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=qauqaut%20people&amp;f=false|title=Invisible Indigenes: The Politics of Nonrecognition|last=Miller|first=Bruce Granville|date=2003-01-01|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=|isbn=0803232322|location=|pages=189|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to oral tradition from various [[Atayal people|Atayal]] villages, the Qauqaut originally settled in the mid-stream of Takiri River ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: Liwuhsi). Due to pressure from Atayals in the mid 1700s, the Qauqaut started to move down the Takiri to the east coast. Later, Qauqaut moved north to Langsu in [[Nan'ao County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F-hrAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=qauqaut+people&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=qauqaut|title=Language and linguistics|last=|first=|date=2001-01-01|publisher=中央硏究院語言硏究所籌備處|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=276|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early modern period|Early modern]] Chinese documents for the Kavalan areas reported that the Qauqaut were linguistically and culturally distinct from all the other Formosan natives, and that there was no intermarriage between Qauqaut and other communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MYsSAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=qauqaut+people&amp;dq=qauqaut+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqzLDK3pzTAhVmD8AKHTkyClUQ6AEIQzAG|title=台灣南島語言論文選集|last=李壬癸|first=|date=2004-01-01|publisher=中央研究院語言學研究所|year=|isbn=9789570184136|location=|pages=967|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese historian [[Paul Jen-kuei Li]] hypothesised (1995) that in about 200 BCE, the Qauqaut migrated from [[Southeast Asia]] to the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Caroline Islands]], and in around 1000 AD arrived on the east coast of Taiwan, based on his linguistic comparison with the nearby [[Seediq language|Taroko (Seediq) language]] of Taiwan, which he said varies greatly from the Qauqaut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CZ0CekQHsaEC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%E7%8C%B4%E7%8C%B4%E6%97%8F&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3mbLJj53TAhXlA8AKHdlHC6UQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%E7%8C%B4%E7%8C%B4%E6%97%8F&amp;f=false|title=泡茶走西仔反: 清法戰爭台灣外記|last=Dodd|first=John|last2=陳政三|date=2007-11-01|publisher=台灣五南圖書出版股份有限公司|year=|isbn=9789866764158|location=|pages=83|language=zh-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the rest of the Taiwanese aborigines, who are said to have arrived on the island much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fj1mAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=qauqaut+people&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=qauqaut|title=Southeast Asian Archaeology: Wilhelm G.

'''Radio Netherlands Worldwide''' ('''RNW'''; {{lang-nl|Radio Nederland Wereldomroep}}) was a public [[radio]] and [[television]] network based in [[Hilversum]], producing and transmitting programmes for international audiences outside the [[Netherlands]]. Radio Netherlands Worldwide also distributed content via web and e-mail technology from as early as 1992.

Its services in Dutch ended on 10 May 2012. English and [[Indonesia]]n languages ceased on 29 June 2012 due to steep budgets cuts imposed by the Dutch government and a concomitant change in focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/14/radio-netherlands-worldwide-says-goodbye-its-audiences.html |title=Radio Netherlands Worldwide says goodbye to its audiences |date=June 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618005603/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/14/radio-netherlands-worldwide-says-goodbye-its-audiences.html |archivedate=June 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last programme broadcast on shortwave was a daily half-hour show in Spanish for Cuba named ''El Toque'' (''The Touch''), which ended on 1 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eltoque.com/audio/el-ultimo-toque|title=El último Toque|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=1 August 2014|publisher=El Toque.com|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to government directives, the service implemented a new mandate in 2013 to promote free speech and independent journalism using new media in areas where people are not free to gather information or to form and express independent opinions and ceased operations as a broadcaster, but as a non-governmental organization under the name [[RNW Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.org/|title=RNW Media|website=www.rnw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Broadcasting to the Dutch Colonial Empire by Philips Radio ===
Following a series of experiments on various wavelengths in 1925, reports of good reception from a low-power shortwave transmitter were received [http://marnette.home.xs4all.nl/radioindonesie/omroep/omroep.htm from Jakarta] on 11 March 11 1927. Dutch Queen Wilhelmina made what is believed to be the world's first royal broadcast on 1 June 1927, addressing compatriots in the East and West-Indies.

Regular international broadcast transmissions started shortly afterwards from the [[Philips]] shortwave transmitter in [[Eindhoven]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/info/history-radio-netherlands-worldwide|title=History of Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=4 August 2014|date=12 November 2009|publisher=Official website of RNW|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811004419/http://www.rnw.nl/english/info/history-radio-netherlands-worldwide|archivedate=11 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the callsign ''PHOHI'' for broadcasts in the Dutch language to the [[Dutch East Indies]] - now [[Indonesia]]) and ''[[PCJJ]]'' for broadcasts in English and Dutch to the rest of the world.

The Philips company in Eindhoven saw a market for its radios in the Dutch colonies. Their Research Labs got support from companies who were trading goods between The Netherlands and Batavia (now Indonesia). The PHOHI was officially founded on 18 June 1927. In 1928, test transmissions commenced from a site in Huizen, Noord Holland. It was chosen because of the high water table on the land near the Zuyderzee lake (now Gooimeer). This meant there was a good conductivity for an efficient earth, which lead to stronger signals in the target areas.

Around 1929, the Philips call sign was simplified to PCJ.

There were several prewar technical innovations:

The Research Laboratories continued with the [http://www.philips-historische-producten.nl/pcj-uk.html development] of new transmitters that could operate at shorter wavelengths and could be re-tuned for broadcasts to different parts of the world. By the end of 1936, the power had been raised by connecting a stage with two water-cooled type TA 20/250 valves. This provided a power output of 60&amp;nbsp;kW at a frequency of 15220&amp;nbsp;kHz and immediately became the strongest short-wave transmitter in Europe. In 1937, this transmitter was moved from Eindhoven to the PHOHI Transmitter Park in Huizen.

* Broadcasts were considerably improved in 1937 with the construction of [[Directional antenna|beam antennas]] supported by the world's first wooden [[Radio masts and towers|antenna masts]] rotatable on two concentric circular rails at the transmitter site in [[Huizen transmitter|Huizen]]. In November 2006, a 1/5th size [http://criticaldistance.blogspot.nl/2006/11/official-handover-of-two-towers.html model of this antenna] was officially inaugurated on a roundabout a few hundred metres from the original site.
* Rotatable curtain array antennas were not in common use until the 1960s, so PCJ was far ahead of its time with its introduction of rotatable [[HRS type antennas]].

=== Dutch broadcasting in exile ===
Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion]] in May 1940.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; There were three transmitters in operation at that time. On the afternoon of May 14, the Dutch military commander gave orders that the transmitters should be destroyed, to prevent them falling into the hands of the Nazis. After several attempts, which included calling in the help of the Hilversum fire brigade, two of the three transmitters were completely destroyed. The third was only partially damaged and later used by the Germans for pro-Nazi broadcasts, some originating from Germany. There were also relays of music concerts from Dutch broadcasters operating under German control.

The [[Dutch government]] in exile was granted air-time on ''[[BBC]]'' transmitters in 1941.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The programme ''[[Radio Oranje]]'' was a [http://jonathanmarks.libsyn.com/media_network_a_voice_from_across_the_water daily commentary] on the Dutch situation both in the Netherlands and the rest of the empire ([[Dutch East Indies|Dutch East]] and [[Dutch West Indies|West Indies]]).&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; One of the chief commentators on ''Radio Oranje'', Henk van den Broek, was given the task of restarting [[public broadcasting]] once the country was liberated.

On 3 October 1944, van den Broek travelled from London to a liberated Eindhoven and began broadcasts as ''Radio Herrijzend Nederland''.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

=== Birth of Radio Netherlands Worldwide ===
On 24 May 1945, a programme for Dutch people living abroad was transmitted with the help of the BBC.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In July 1945, the Dutch government founded the ''Stichting Radio Nederland in den Overgangstijd'' (''Radio Netherlands in Time of Transition'') and gave it the mandate for both domestic and international broadcasts.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Later, under pressure from the pre-war Dutch broadcasting companies, the government decided to separate national and international broadcasting.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; On 15 April 1947, the ''Stichting Radio Nederland Wereldomroep'' (''Radio Netherlands International Foundation'') was established.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Broadcasts in Dutch, Indonesian, English and Spanish began in that year.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Subsequently, language services in Arabic and Afrikaans (1949), French (1969) and Brazilian Portuguese (1974) were added.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

During its entire broadcast history, Radio Netherlands Worldwide was always editorially independent from the Dutch government, being funded as around 6% of the public allocation for public broadcasting.

The [[interval signal]] of Radio Netherlands was a version of the [[Eighty Years' War]] song ''[[Merck toch hoe sterck]]'' played on a carillion. The original [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah65hjiaGT4 recording] was made at the cathedral in Den Bosch. It was replaced in August 1987 [http://jonathanmarks.libsyn.com/mn06081987bellsfrombreda by a recording of the carillion] in Breda.

=== End of radio broadcasts ===
The English-language shortwave broadcasts to North America were discontinued on 26 October 2008, due to a survey that claimed that more listeners listened to RNW podcasts than listened on shortwave radio.

On 24 June 2011, the Dutch government announced a 70% cut to RNW's budget reducing it from 46 million euros to 14 million.

On 11 May 2012 at 2200 CEST, the Dutch service signed off at the end of a 24-hour Radio marathon broadcast. This included several interviews with past staff members of the station, including the former Director General Lodewijk Bouwens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/rnw%E2%80%99s-dutch-language-service-falls-silent "RNWs Dutch-language service falls silent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512023728/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/rnw%E2%80%99s-dutch-language-service-falls-silent |date=2012-05-12 }}, Radio Netherlands Worldwide, May 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; And on 29 June 2012, Radio Netherlands ended broadcasting in English at 20:57 GMT after a similar celebratory  24-hour broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RNW-Program line-up for the last day of broadcasting|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/radioshow/whats-week-latest-rnw-programme-schedule#|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with the host Jonathan Groubert who signed off for the last time have been posted by Jonathan Marks, the former Radio Netherlands Programme Director (1992–2003) and host of [[Media Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Netherlands Signs Off in Style|url=http://criticaldistance.blogspot.nl/2012/06/radio-netherlands-signoff.html|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, RNW's has been funded by the Dutch Foreign Ministry rather than the Education and Culture Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/sweeping-changes-rnw-it-falls-under-axe "Sweeping changes for RNW as it falls under the axe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705013032/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/sweeping-changes-rnw-it-falls-under-axe |date=2011-07-05 }}, Radio Netherlands Worldwide, June 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shortwave relay stations ==
The shortwave international broadcasts were heard worldwide via broadcast facilities in [[Bonaire]] (opened in 1969) and [[Madagascar]] (opened in 1972).&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The last transmission from the shortwave relay station in Bonaire ended at 1:57 GMT on June 30, 2012 &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTmAQ5MNizs&amp;t "Farewell to RNW shortwave broadcasts from Bonaire"]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the installations were later dismantled later that year. Radio Netherlands Worldwide used a shortwave station in [[Flevoland]] from 1985 to 2007.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The shortwave transmissions were supplemented by an extensive network of partner stations.

==Programming on the English Service==
The ''[[Happy Station Show]]'' was a long-running popular radio show, originating on the network's predecessors in 1928 and continued until 1995. Popular music from Europe and various other countries was mixed with [[vintage]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] and [[multilingual]] chatter, switching back and forth between [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], by hosts including long serving [[Eddie Startz]] and Tom Meijer each Sunday. It became popular since it gave listeners a chance to travel in their armchair during a period when international travel was impossible for most people. It also pioneered call-in shows, in both the [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] versions, during the latter part of the 1970s.  In 2009, Canadian-born presenter Keith Perron revived the "Happy Station" from his company [[PCJ Radio]] based in [[Taipei]].

''DX Juke Box'' was a media show on Radio Netherlands Worldwide that ran on the English service from its inception in 1961 with Harry van Gelder (1911–2003) and Jim Vastenhoud, through to 7 May 1981, when the name and format was changed to ''Media Network''. The music was originally designed to attract younger listeners to technical features, with a lot of emphasis in the early days on [[DXing|DX]] tips and technical articles. There were also DX courses on basic [[electronics]] and [[Radio propagation|propagation]] during the 1960s and 1970s. When host Jonathan Marks took over in August 1980, he re-launched the show less than one year later by adding news/topical features and eliminating the music. Media Network ran successfully for more than 1000 editions, before it migrated to a full-time website/weblog in October 2000. The blog was discontinued in 2012 as a result of budget cuts. The Media Network archive containing around 300 of the broadcasts is on line for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonathanmarks.libsyn.com/|title=Media Network Vintage Vault 2018-2019|website=jonathanmarks.libsyn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, RNW discontinued ''Newsline'' which had been its staple current affairs programme and also discontinued news bulletins. Instead, the service continued with music, literary and  documentary-based programmes. Literary programmes ''Radio Books'' ended in 2010 and ''Commonwealth Short Stories'' ended the following year. . The environmental programme ''[[Earth Beat]]'' ended with the closure of the English service in June 2012 as did ''South Asia Wired.'' ''[[The State We're In (radio)|The State We're In]]'', a coproduction with [[United States|American]] public radio station [[WAMU-FM]], was a programme about "[[human rights]], human wrongs and how we treat each other" told from a first person perspective, continued for several months as a podcast and North American broadcast before ending in October 2012.

With the closure of the English service, regional English language programmes ''Bridges with Africa'' and ''What's Up Africa'' which had been produced and broadcast through local partner stations in [[Africa]] as well as online as podcasts, were discontinued.
