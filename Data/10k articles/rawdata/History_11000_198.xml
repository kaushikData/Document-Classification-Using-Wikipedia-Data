Born in [[Taybet El-Muthalath]], near [[TulKarem]], he was one of the earliest graduates of the Arabic College, Dar Al-Mu’allimin, in [[Jerusalem]]. He read history and [[Arabic literature]] at the [[American University of Beirut]] and later earned a Ph.D from the [[University of London]] in 1948. Prior to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] he was a senior education officer in Jerusalem. He was in London when the crisis of 1948 unfolded. He became a [[Palestinian refugee|refugee]] and was appointed Lecturer in Comparative Education at the [[Institute of Education]], London, where he taught until his retirement in 1977. Tibawi wrote extensively on many aspects of [[Middle Eastern]] history in both English and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

He established a fund for Palestinian postgraduate students at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">'''Alberto Radicati''', [[Count]] of [[Passerano]] ([[Torino]], 11 November 1698 – 24 October 1737, [[The Hague]]), was an 18th-century historian, philosopher and [[free-thinker]]. He was the reputed author of the 1732 work ''A Philosophical Dissertation upon Death, Composed for the Consolation of the Unhappy by a Friend of Truth'', published in [[London]]. This work created a scandal and led to the arrest of Radicati and his translator.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Berti, 'Unmasking the Truth: the theme of imposture in early modern European culture, 1660-1730', in James E. Force, David S. Katz (eds.) ''Everything connects: in conference with Richard H.

There Radicati's work is used as an example of a free-thinker explicitly adopting the radical views attributed to the free-thinkers by Berkeley in his 1732 dialogue ''[[Alciphron (book)|Alciphron]]'', and so to defend Berkeley against the charge of attacking a [[Strawman fallacy|strawman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3116">The '''All Saints Day flood''' ({{lang-de|Allerheiligenflut}}) of 1304&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Hermann and Georg (1962). ''Vanished Cities'', pp. 18, 21, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[storm surge]] that hit the southwestern [[Baltic Sea]] [[coast]] on 1 November ([[All Saints' Day]]) that year. The region of [[Western Pomerania]] was particularly badly affected by the flooding. 271 lives were lost as a result of the flood.

Like most similar storm floods, it was created when water accumulated in the middle and northern Baltic as a result of several days of strong westerly winds, and then surged abruptly onto the Pomeranian coast when the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast. The All Saints Day flood resulted in substantial losses of land between the islands of [[Rügen]] and [[Usedom]]: for example, until 1304 there was a land bridge between the peninsula of [[Mönchgut]] on Rügen and the island of [[Ruden (island)|Ruden]] off Usedom. The [[Bay of Greifswald]] was probably still an [[inland lake]] and the present-day branch of the [[River Oder]], the [[Peenestrom]], flowed on through the [[Strelasund]] and did not discharge into the Baltic until the western end of the sound. In the 1304 storm flood, the southern part of the Mönchgut and most of Ruden was flooded. Whether further storm flooding was needed to finally turn drown the land under the water, is not known. The only losses recorded are those of two villages on Ruden that were drowned. The Bay of Greifswald was henceforth known as the "low country" (''Landtief'') or the "New Deep" (''Neue Tief''). 300 years later, only the ever-shrinking island of Ruden remained, along with the small island of [[North Ruden]], which presumably sank beneath the waves in the 17th century. The remaining island is still less than 2 metres above the water for long stretches; the channel for the eastern approach to [[Stralsund]] has to be dredged to be kept free.

Other consequences of the All Saints Day flood have not been handed down, but it is also possible that it led to breaches to the Baltic Sea at [[Damerow (Usedom)|Damerow]] on Usedom, at the [[Świna|Swine estuary]] and on the shores of the [[Prorer Wiek]]. These areas were almost uninhabited at the end of [[Middle Ages]] because of their infertility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4898">'''Alonso González de Nájera''' (died 1614) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] soldier and an advocate of reforms in the conduct of the [[War of Arauco]]. He served in the war following the [[Disaster of Curalaba]] and the great [[Mapuche]] uprising that followed in [[Chile]] that resulted in [[Destruction of Seven Cities|the loss of all the Spanish settlements]] south of the [[Bio Bio River]]. He was sent back to the royal court in Spain to argue for a reform to the way the war against the Mapuche was fought. Nájera's  arguments for his reforms were incorporated in his book of ''Desengaño y reparo de la Guerra del Reino de Chile'' (Disappointment and Reparation of the War of the Kingdom of Chile).

== Biography ==

There is no information on his life before 1600. It is only known that he served in the Spanish army in [[Flanders]] and then in [[France]]. On November 13, 1600  he left Lisbon for Chile with the rank of captain under the  command of Francisco Martinez de Leiva. He arrived in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] in May 1601, afterward moving to the south of Chile, where he remained until 1607.

[[Alonso de Ribera]], Governor of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]], founded the fort [[Nacimiento, Chile|Nacimiento]] on the banks of the Bio Bio near the confluence with the river Vergara, December 24, 1603.  Gonzalez, Najera was responsible for building it and was its first garrison commander.  After four years of military service in the war zone, he was appointed [[sergeant major|sargento mayor]] by the newly appointed Governor [[Alonso García Ramón]] in 1605.  He later returned to [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] sick and wounded in his leg, as a result of his participation in the war.

Because of the critical military situation in Chile, Governor Ramon Garcia decided to send González de Nájera to Spain to report to King [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] on the true state of the territory. The choice of González was based on his long years of experience and  skilled, zealous service to the king in many prominent posts and positions in the army. In May 1607, he departed for Spain, where he arrived at the end of the next year. To record the critical situation that lived in Chile, and to convince the Council of the Indias and the King to send relief to Chile, he drafted and presented some considerations which were later transformed into the fifth and sixth points of his book ''Desengaño y reparo de la Guerra del Reino de Chile''.
 
In the Court, Gonzalez de Najera made a series of recommendations on how to continue the war. He pointed out the weaknesses that the current methods used in the war suffered, especially the system of "campeadas" or incursions that the Hispanic army made in Mapuche territory to burn their fields and to hunt them for slaves.  He not only set out his criticism, but proposed to establish a new system to complete the conquest of the Mapuche territory and to finish with the war. This consisted of the creation of a line of forts that separated both territories, a professional army that operated from them towards the interior of Mapuche territory, the extermination of the natives who were to be hunted as slaves and their replacement  by black slaves from Africa, apparently considered less rebellious than the Mauche.  However, he was not heard and the Governors request for relief did not succeed. The actual decision was to impose [[Luis de Valdivia]]'s system of [[defensive war]], contrary to what was suggested by Gonzalez de Najera. However his merits were recognized and he was appointed Governor of Puerto Hércules in [[Tuscany]], where he finished his life sometime in 1614 although the date is uncertain.  
 
Gonzalez de Najera did not succeed in getting his book ''Desengaño y reparo de la Guerra del Reino de Chile'', published.  Although he finished writing it in 1614, it never was published while he was still alive,  being printed more than two centuries later in Madrid, in 1866, containing his arguments and proposals and in 1889 in Chile, with a biographical introduction by [[Jose Toribio Medina]].

'''Archaeogaming''' is an archaeological framework which, broadly speaking, includes the study of [[archaeology]] in and of [[video-games]] as well as the use of video-games for archaeological purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/Digital-Humanities/fl/Archaeology-of-Video-Games.htm|title=What is Archaeogaming?|website=About.com Education|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the study can include, but is in no means limited to: the physical excavation of video-game [[Computer hardware|hardware]], the use of archaeological methods within game worlds, the creation of video-games for or about archaeological practices and outcomes or the critical study of how archaeology is represented in video-games.  Virtual and augmented reality applications in archaeology might also be subsumed within its rubric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/09/virtual_and_augmented_reality_in_archaeology_revive_pompeii_atalh_y_k.html/ |title= The Best Time Travel We've Got: Archaeologists Use Virtual Reality to explore long-gone worlds |accessdate=2016-02-05 |last=Bittel  |first= Jason|authorlink = Bittel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

M. Dennis states that archaeogaming is ''“… the utilization and treatment of immaterial space to study created culture, specifically through videogames” which “requires treating a game world, a world bounded and defined by the limitations of its hardware, [[software]] and coding choices, as both a closed universe and as an extension of the external culture that created it. Everything that goes into the immaterial space comes from its external cultural source, in one way or another.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gingerygamer.com/index.php/archaeogaming/ |title= Archaeogaming (2016) |accessdate=2016-02-05 |last= Dennis |first= M.|authorlink = M. Dennis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking this into consideration the archaeogaming framework indicates that there is no functional difference between studying archaeology in the physical, material world, and implementing it with regards to the study, critique and creation of video-games for and about archaeology. As such it is said that archaeogaming ''“requires the same standards of practice as the physical collection of excavated data, only with a different toolset. It also provides the opportunity to use game worlds to reflect on practice, theory and the perceptions of [archaeology].”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gingerygamer.com/index.php/archaeogaming/ |title= Archaeogaming (2016) |accessdate=2016-02-05 |last= Dennis |first= M.|authorlink = M. Dennis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first recorded use of the term “archaeogaming” appears on June 9, 2013 on Andrew Reinhard’s blog, in which he discusses the archaeological underpinnings of [[World of Warcraft]] and extrapolates that there is the potential to explore the [[gameplay]] and construction of these worlds using an archaeological methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archaeogaming.com/2013/06/09/what-is-archaeogaming/ |title= What Is Archaeogaming? (2013) |accessdate=2016-02-05 |last= Reinhard |first= A.|authorlink = A. Reinhard }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term went on to be retroactively applied to work previously carried out within the umbrella of video-games and archaeology, for example, the ethnographic investigations conducted by E. Johnson in [[Skyrim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/5099437/Experienced_Archaeologies_A_mini-ethnography_exploring_the_way_in_which_people_engage_with_the_past_in_single_player_role-playing_videogames |title= Experienced Archaeologies: A mini-ethnography exploring the way in which people engage with the past in single player role-playing videogames (2013) |accessdate=2016-02-05 |last= Johnson |first= E.|authorlink = E. Johnson }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term has been developed by various academics since the first inception and development is ongoing. Though Reinhard is credited with first applying the term to this study it is noted here that many other academic enquries have previously tackled the topic under different names such as gaming archaeology and game-archaeology.

==Types of Archaeogaming==
There are many forms or sub-categories within the wider archaeogaming discipline, ranging from the study of the material culture of video-games through to the creation of video-games as a means to think about or represent archaeological practices, processes or outcomes. The core categories will be discussed in turn below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.valueproject.nl/blog-posts/other/introducing-the-interactive-pasts-conference/ |title= Interactive Pasts Conference (2016) |accessdate=2016-02-05 |last= GROUP  |first= VALUE|authorlink = VALUE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeology of video-games (real-world excavation) ===
The archaeology of video-games in the physical world entails the excavation of material culture using conventional and specialist archaeogaming methodologies. The [[Atari video game burial]], which entailed the excavation of [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]] cartridges from the [[New Mexico]] landfill site, is an example of this form of archaeogaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/JCA/article/view/27108 |title= Excavating Atari: Where the Media was the Archaeology (2015)|accessdate=2016-02-05 |last= Reinhard |first= A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/why-we-dug-atari/375702/|title=Why Digging Atari Games Out of a Landfill Is Archaeology|last=Weber|first=William Caraher, Raiford Guins, Andrew Reinhard, Richard Rothaus, and Bret|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology in video-games (digital excavation)===
The archaeogaming sub-category of digital excavation refers to using archaeological methods to dig into how video-games operate. An example of this method can be found in J. Aycock’s use of computer-science methods to explore the construction and implementation of features within video-games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEcoVxcnFTQ&amp;feature=youtu.be |title= Retrogame Archaeology (2016)|accessdate=2016-02-05 |last= Aycock |first= J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Heaven wrote about the archaeology of rubbish/garbage within virtual worlds for [[New Scientist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28505-what-digital-trash-dumped-in-games-tells-us-about-the-players/|title=What digital trash dumped in games tells us about the players|last=Heaven|first=Douglas|website=New Scientist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The June 2016 release of ''[[No Man's Sky]]'' (Hello Games) will also see the launch of the ''No Man's Sky'' Archaeological Survey, the first formal archaeology project undertaken within a procedurally created universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/soundsdoable/culture-file-archeogaming|title=Culture File: Archeogaming (part 2)|website=SoundCloud|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Examination of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage in video-games ===
The critical study of how archaeology has, could and should be used in video-games is perhaps the broadest and most widely represented sub-category of the archaeogaming group in academic and popular [[literature]]. Proponents of this sector discuss how archaeology has been represented in externally produced games and construct frameworks which aim to develop better representations of archaeological material, practices and outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia-Raso|first1=Daniel|title=Watching video games, Playing with Archaeology and Prehistory: Retrospectives and perspectives into the image that videogames spread about a scientific discipline and the humankind pastl=AP: Online Journal in Public Archaeology|date=2011|issue=1|pages=73–92|url=http://www.arqueologiapublica.es/descargas/1300786325.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural heritage is also explored in an archaeological way via archaeogaming, from critical reviews of games such as Subnautica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valueproject.nl/blog-posts/games-we-dig/games-we-dig-subnautica/|title=Games We Dig – Subnautica {{!}}|website=www.valueproject.nl|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Never Alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue38/6/reinhard.html|title=Internet Archaeol. 38. Reinhard. Review of Never Alone [game]|website=intarch.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to online playthroughs of games such as [[Far Cry Primal]] by professors and students of archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/news-and-events/news/external/news-2016/far-cry-primal/|title=Far Cry Primal Twitch Stream - Archaeology, The University of York|website=www.york.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors have also explored aspects of game design and creation in relation to the discipline of archaeogaming, exposing parallels in the development of titles like Day Of The Tentacle Remastered to the archaeologcial process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archaeogaming.com/2016/03/23/the-archaeology-of-the-remaster-cultivating-the-past/|title=The Archaeology of the Remaster: Cultivating the Past|last=Judge|first=The Otaku|date=2016-03-24|website=Archaeogaming|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating archaeological video-games===
There are two key branches within this sub-grouping: the practice of creating video-games which represent archaeological material, practices or processes or the creation of video-games to serve archaeological needs. The former of these categories can be seen in the production of games for museums, exhibitions or online sites, usually with the express aim of educating or informing an audience. The latter of the categories focusses on how video-games, as a media form, can be used to supplement, overcome or provide novel methods for recording, expressing or communicating archaeology for academic purposes.

== Media Reception ==
Archaeogaming began receiving global attention upon the publication of an August 2015 article on Vice Motherboard by Kathleen Caulderwood, "The Archaeologist Who Studies World of Warcraft".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-archaeologist-who-studies-world-of-warcraft|title=The Archaeologist Who Studies 'World of Warcraft'|website=Motherboard|language=en-us|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story received wider circulation courtesy of a follow-up piece on the video game site Kotaku, "Actual Archaeologist is Digging through World of Warcraft, Skyrim".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/actual-archaeologist-is-digging-through-world-of-warcra-1724001740|title=Actual Archaeologist Is Digging Through World of Warcraft, Skyrim|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guokr, a Chinese science and technology news site reported on archaeogaming shortly thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guokr.com/article/440676/|title=在游戏里考古的考古学家？不仅玩游戏，而且做学术！ {{!}} 科学人 {{!}} 果壳网 科技有意思|website=www.guokr.com|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by German technology site Technology Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/Eine-Vorbereitung-auf-von-Maschinen-erstellte-Kulturen-2813007.html|title=Eine Vorbereitung auf von Maschinen erstellte Kulturen|last=Review|first=Technology|website=Technology Review|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeogaming has been the subject of two national radio broadcasts in Canada and Ireland, first on CBC's Spark radio program with Nora Young, "We're Kind of making it up as we Go Along": What it's like to be a Video Game Archaeologist"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/295-street-psychology-game-archaeology-and-more-1.3240890/we-re-kind-of-making-it-up-as-we-go-along-what-it-s-like-to-be-a-video-game-archaeologist-1.3248856|title='We're kind of making it up as we go along' — What it's like to be a video game archaeologist|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then on Ireland's Lyric FM Culture File with Eleanor Flegg, "What is Archaeogaming?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/soundsdoable/culture-file-archeogaming-part|title=Culture File: Archeogaming (part 1)|website=SoundCloud|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Developments==
In April, 2016, a group of academics gathered at [[Leiden University]], [[Netherlands]], as part of the VALUE conference on interactive pasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.valueproject.nl/blog-posts/other/introducing-the-interactive-pasts-conference/ |title= Interactive Pasts Conference (2016) |accessdate=2016-02-05 |last=  |first= |authorlink = VALUE }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this conference was to present current research, engage in critical discussion of archaeology and video-games and to develop a manifesto for the development of the necessary theoretical, methodological and practice based frameworks involved under the broad term of archaeogaming. The core tenets of the first draft of the manifesto (1.0) are as follows:

* To create a common language for describing the intersection between archaeology and video-games
* To develop the methodological, practice-based and theoretical paradigms required for effective analysis, critique and development
* To develop effective methods for communicating with the game development industry regarding the use of archaeological entities 
* To develop ethical frameworks for engaging with archaeological material within video-games
* To curate and provide data-sets, information and modes of communication which are accessible to developers wishing to access archaeological material
* To develop platforms whereby the public can access integral archaeological information about and for video-games
* To preserve games, game culture and game history using appropriate archaeological method and theory
* To approach the study of the public perception of archaeology in / of video-games as well as their surrounding culture (including conventions, cosplays, fanart etc.) with due care and appropriate methodological approaches.
* To engage with the development history, the developer culture and the impact which this has on the game development practice through an archaeological lens
* To develop the field of archaeogaming on an academic, public and industry level through effective knowledge sharing, centralization and open information.

'''Azra Erhat''' (4 June 1915; [[Sisli]], [[Istanbul]] – 6 September 1982, Istanbul) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] author, [[archaeology|archaeologist]], academician, [[philology|classical philologist]], and [[translator]]. A pioneer of Turkish [[Humanism]], Azra Erat is especially well known for her published works, including many translations into Turkish from the [[classical literature]] of [[Ancient Greece]].

==Biography==
Azra Erhat was born on 4 June 1915 in Sisli, Istanbul. Her parents were Tevfik Bey and Nakibe Hanım. Nakibe and her sister, Mukbile, were the children of Fatma Hanım and Fadıl Bey. Fadil Bey (1857-1938) was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, where he completed his primary and secondary education before traveling to Istanbul, where he graduated from law school. Working as a lawyer while splitting his time between Istanbul and Thessaloniki, Fadil and his wife, Fatma, eventually settled down in [[Buyukada]] Island, Istanbul Province, in 1923. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/95045256.pdf | title = ''95045256.pdf'' | author=|publisher=CORE.ac.uk/İstanbul Şehir University Library Taha Toros Archive * 001523493006 * | language=Turkish | accessdate=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The period of Azra Erhat’s birth was a time of upheaval, coinciding with the [[occupation of Constantinople]] by British, French, and Italian forces. She moved with her parents to [[Izmir]] in 1922 and to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in 1924, when her father's work was transferred there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iuklasikfiloloji.tumblr.com/post/134807395172/azra-erhat-100-ya%25C5%259Finda | title = ''Azra Erhat is 100 Years Old'' | author=|publisher=Istanbul University Classical Philology Society | language=Turkish | accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erhat received two years of primary education in [[Volksschule]], Vienna, before her father's work necessitated another move, this time to [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. There she completed primary school and then attended [[Emile Jacqmain High School]] ([[:fr:Lycée Emile Jacqmain|fr]]) where she gained a strong interest in literature while studying French, Flemish, Latin, and Ancient Greek. When Erhat's father died in 1932, Azra stayed in Brussels at a friend's home to complete high school while her family moved back to Istanbul. Finishing with the highest achievement level -(''{{lang-fr|avec le plus grand fruit bel}}''), she then rejoined her family in Istanbul. In 1934 Azra entered the [[Istanbul University]] Faculty of Arts degree, where her most influential instructor was the Austrian [[romance languages|romance philologist]] and prolific literary critic, [[Leo Spitzer]]. Introducing Erhat to Professor George Rodhe of [[Ankara University]] in 1936, Spitzer recommended Azra for a student-assistant position translating Rodhe's lessons from French, German, Latin, and Greek content into Turkish. On September 1, 1936, Erhat accepted the offer and transferred to the newly inaugurated Department of Classical Philology of the Faculty of Languages, History, and Geography at Ankara University. Working as a student-translator-assistant up to and beyond graduation in 1939, she continued as an assistant in the University's Department of Classical [[Philology]] and became an associate professor in 1946. During this same period, Azra also worked in the Translation Office established by Minister of Education [[Hasan Ali Yücel]] with fellow Turkish [[Humanism]] pioneers [[Sabahattin Eyüboğlu]], [[Vedat Günyol]] ([[:tr:Vedat Günyol|tr]]), [[Orhan Burian]] ([[:tr:Orhan Burian|tr]]), and Saffet Korkut, establishing close friendships with them. In 1945, separately and together with Orhan Veli, she translated and published many works from [[Homer]], [[Aristophanes]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Plato]]. 

With the departure of Hasan Ali Yücel as Turkey’s minister of education following the 1946 elections, the political atmosphere began changing in the Department of Education. In 1948, during a cleansing of left-leaning thinkers, Erhat and fellow faculty members, including [[Pertev Naili Boratav]], [[Behice Boran]], [[Adnan Cemgil]] ([[:tr:Adnan Cemgil|tr]]), and [[Niyazi Berkes]], were dismissed from Ankara University. Returning to Istanbul, Erhat continued working from 1949 to 1955 as a translator, an art critic, and news reporter, when she received a position with the Turkish daily newspaper, ''[[Vatan]]'', where she worked until 1956. From 1956 until her retirement in 1975, Erhat worked in the library of the United Nations' [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) Near and Middle East Center. In 1971, Erhat, Sabahattin Eyüboğlu, and Vedat Günyol were arrested and charged with violating Article 141 of the Turkish Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://canyayinlari.com/yazardetay/yazar/11088/ | title = ''Azra Erhat'' |author=|publisher=Can Yayinlari Publishing House, Istanbul| accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (establishing a secret [[Communism|communist]] organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yazarmezar.com/mezar-sayfa-146.html |publisher=Yazar Mezar |title=''Sabahattin Eyüboğlu'' |language=Turkish |accessdate=2018-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913202632/http://yazarmezar.com/mezar-sayfa-146.html |archivedate=2011-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bedrirahmi.com/sebahattin-eyuboglu/biyografi | title = ''Sabahattin Eyüboğlu'' | author=|publisher=Tüm Hakları Korunmaktadır | language=Turkish | accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;) during the [[coup d’etat]] of March 12 [[1971 Turkish military memorandum]]. Detained for 4 months in the [[Maltepe, Istanbul|Maltepe]] Military Prison, Erhat and her companions were released in the first legal session. While she was unable to work throughout the one and a half years until her lawsuit was finally closed, the ILO supported Erhat and protected her staff.

The years between 1956 and 1982 are considered Erhat's most creative and prolific period, with the publication of many literary works during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iuklasikfiloloji.tumblr.com/post/134807395172/azra-erhat-100-ya%25C5%259Finda | title = ''Azra Erhat is 100 Years Old'' | author=|publisher=Istanbul University Classical Philology Society | language=Turkish | accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual works and others she collaborated on with Sabahattin Eyüboğlu were published in ''New Horizons'' Magazine (''{{lang-tr|Yeni Ufuklar}}''). In collaboration with Ibrahim Abdulkadir Mericboyu, alias/pen-name [[A. Kadir]] ([[:tr:A. Kadir|tr]]), Erhat translated [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', winning the Habib Törehan Science Award in 1959 for Volume 1, and the [[Turkish Language Institution]] Translation Award in 1961 for Volume 3. Erhat's translation of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' was published in 1970, her ''Dictionary of Mythology'' (''{{lang-tr|Mitoloji Sözlüğü}}'') was published in 1972, and her Ph.D. thesis provided the material published in collaboration with [[Cengiz Bektaş]] in 1978 entitled, ''Conversations and Poetry on [[Sappho]]'' (''{{lang-tr|Sappho Üzerine Konuşmalar ve Şiir Çevirileri}}''). Azra Erhat also occasionally wrote under the [[pseudonym]] Ayşe Nur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.writersofturkey.net/index.php?title=Azra_Erhat | title = ''Azra Erhat'' | author=|publisher=Women Writers of Turkey: Database Directors: Dr. Burcu Alkan (Bahçeşehir University) and Dr. Çimen Günay-Erkol (Özyeğin University)  | language=English | accessdate=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 1982, after unsuccessful treatment in London for cancer, Azra Erhat died in Istanbul at age 67. Her body was buried at the Bülbüldere Cemetery in [[Üsküdar]], Istanbul. 

Following Erhat’s death, her books were endowed to [[Anadolu University]], with a collection created in her memory. In 1983, in honor of Erhat’s significant contribution to [[Classical Literature]] translations, ''Yazko'' a Turkish journal of translation, began offering a [[literary award]] in her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.writersofturkey.net/index.php?title=Azra_Erhat | title = ''Azra Erhat'' | author=|publisher=Women Writers of Turkey: Database Directors: Dr. Burcu Alkan (Bahçeşehir University) and Dr. Çimen Günay-Erkol (Özyeğin University)  | language=English | accessdate=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azra Erhat’s translations of Homer’s ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' are still primary sources of classical literature in Turkey today. Drawn from Erhat’s distinctive humanism gained “from local values and bridges between Western cultures and Anatolian cultures,” her language and writing style “provides a simple and understandable epic text.” Enabling readers who are unable to read the original texts, Erhat’s translations, “which are not only linguistically but structurally and formally successful, also carry the Anatolian identity that the translator cares about and reflect the epicenter of the land they belong to.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tr.writersofturkey.net/index.php?title=Azra_ERHAT | title = ''Azra Erhat'' | author=|publisher=Women Writers of Turkey: Database Directors: Dr. Burcu Alkan (Bahçeşehir University) and Dr. Çimen Günay-Erkol (Özyeğin University)  | language=Turkish | accessdate=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Introduction to Azra Erhat’s book, ''İşte İnsan (Ecce Homo)'', Azra writes: (turkish):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kitapyurdu.com/kitap/iste-insan-ecce-homo/638.html | title = ''İşte İnsan (Ecce Homo)'' | author=Azra Erhat|publisher= 5th edition, Adam Yayincili, 1996, via kitapyurdu.com | language=Turkish | accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Büyük tuttum bu işi: dört yıllık düşüncemi, yaşantımı bir kitaba sığdırmak isterdim. Homeros'ta insan dedim yola çıktım, beden ruh ikiliği dikildi karşıma, aldım inceledim; derken Platon'un insan anlayışı, toplum görüşü çeldi aklımı, onu da kavrayayım derken açıldım uçsuz bucaksız bir düşünce alanına. Özgürlük, mutluluk, insancılık...Sorunlar, saçları altın tellerle örülmüş öcüler gibi çekti sürükledi beni oradan oraya.(...) Bir desteğim vardı: Yaşantıya olan güvenim. İnsanı mı konu edindim: insan gibi yaşayayım kendimi vere vere, dolu dizgin, coşkunca yaşayayım ki insanı anlayayım, insanı söyleyebileyim.(...)Sevgiyi ahlak edindim kendime. İnsancılığı yalnız sevgide gördüm ve sevgiden bekledim, kitabımı satır satır yazdırsın bana. Yanılmadım da: Ecce Homo'yu bana sevgi yazdırdı.
-Azra Erhat-''

(From the same webpage translated to English by Google Translate:) ''I've kept this great job: four years of thought, I want to fit my life in a book. In Homer, I went on the road, body soul duality was erected, and I looked at it; Plato's human understanding, society, the wisdom of my mind, I understand it, I opened up to an immense field of thought. Freedom, happiness, humanity ... Problems, hairs woven with gold wires attracted the dangers pulled me from there. (...) I had a support: I have confidence in life. I've made a human being: I live like a human, I want to live a full, full of enthusiasm, let me understand the human, I can say human. I saw humanity in love alone and waited for love, let me print my book in line by line. I wasn't mistaken: Ecce Homo wrote me with love.
-Azra Erhat-''

==Origination of Turkey’s “Blue Cruise” Movement==

Strongly connected with her activities as a writer and translator, Erhat’s recreational activities likewise significantly impacted the rising trend of Westernization in [[Kamal Ataturk]]’s newly-formed [[Republic of Turkey]]. Together with fellow authors [[Cevat Şakir Kabaağaçlı]], alias/pen-name ''The Fisherman of [[Halicarnassus]]'' (''{{lang-tr|Halikarnas Balıkçısı}}''), and Sabahattin Eyüboğlu, Azra Erhat is considered an originator of the literary and touristic term, ''[[Blue Cruise]]'' (''{{lang-tr|Mavi Yolculuk}}''). Used in [[Tourism in Turkey|Turkey's tourism industry]], the name ''Blue Cruise'' (or ''Blue Voyage'') is the title of Erhat’s [[travel literature|travelogue]], ''Mavi Yolculuk'', originally published in 1962 and republished in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Cevat Şakir Kabaağaçlı, sentenced in 1925 to a 3-year exile to [[Bodrum]] found this sleepy fishing village known in antiquity as [[Halicarnassus]] so charming that, long after his exile ended, he returned to settle down there. Convincing his closest friends and fellow members of the Turkish [[intelligentsia]] of the unspoiled beauties of the shoreline and rural environment of Bodrum, authors [[Sabahattin Eyüboğlu]], Azra Erhat, and others soon joined Cevat, who had renamed himself ''Halikarnas Balıkçısı'' (''the Fisherman of Halicarnassus'').&lt;ref name=Whiting&gt;{{cite book|last=Whiting|first=Dominic|title=''Turkey Handbook''|year=2001|publisher=Footprint Handbooks|isbn=978-1-900949-85-9|pages=315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKi5p20LQY4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Turkey+Handbook&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=78nWTfjdLofb0QGW0b23Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the coming decades, the close friends would enjoy many long sailing trips together in the local sponge divers' sailing boats, called [[gulet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding herself immersed in a lush natural landscape seemingly unchanged since antiquity, Erhat viewed her surroundings as “the scenes of historical and mythological events.” Expressing her strong belief that Anatolia gave birth to [[Western civilization]], Erhat charmed her companions (and soon her readers) with detailed discussions from [[Classical Literature]] on Halicarnassus, [[Troy]], [[Pergamum]], [[Ephesus]], and other famous [[Anatolia|Anatolian]] sites of [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;

Especially with the 1962 release of Erhat’s immensely popular travel book, ''Mavi Yolculuk'' (''Blue Cruise''), and articles written by Erhat and her colleagues at ''New Horizons'' Magazine (''{{lang-tr|Yeni Ufuklar}}''), the Turkish reading public began flocking to this region.

Enduring until the end of their lives, the relationship between Azra Erhat and the Fisherman of Halicarnassus (''{{lang-tr|Halikarnas Balıkçısı}}'') blossomed into a love story regularly nourished by Blue Cruises when they were together and thousands of letters written to each other when they were apart. After Halikarnas Balıkçısı died in 1972, with his prior permission, Erhat published a collection of his letters in her 1976 book, ''Letters of the Fisherman of Halicarnassus'' (''{{lang-tr|Mektuplarla Halikarnas Balıkçısı}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.writersofturkey.net/index.php?title=Azra_Erhat | title = ''Azra Erhat'' | author=|publisher=Women Writers of Turkey: Database Directors: Dr. Burcu Alkan (Bahçeşehir University) and Dr. Çimen Günay-Erkol (Özyeğin University)  | language=English | accessdate=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bithynian coinage''' refers to coinage struck by the [[Kingdom of Bithynia]] that was situated on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].

==Extent of monetization==
[[Asia Minor]] is known for having kingdoms that issued abundant coinage during some points in their history. After [[Pergamon]] under the [[Attalid dynasty]] expanded, smaller kingdoms exploited the political situation and increased their power in the region. Bithynia, [[Cappadocia]] and [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] are well-known and studied for their abundant coinage at certain times. Bithynian kingdom incorporated the most monetized areas under its domain when compared to the other two kingdoms. Bithynian rulers struck long and continuous series of silver and bronze coinage. Elsewhere, Cappadocians are primarily known for their military issues of coins, and the less monetized [[Pontus (region)|Pontic region]] primarily struck bronze coinage.&lt;ref name="Metcalf2016"/&gt;

The purpose of the first royal Bithynian and Cappadocian bronze coinage is still unknown.&lt;ref name="Metcalf2016"/&gt;

==History==
The first king was [[Zipoetes I of Bithynia|Zipoetes I]] c. 298&amp;nbsp;BC – c. 279&amp;nbsp;BC. It is thought that there were no coinage struck during his reign.&lt;ref name="snible"/&gt;

The first Bithynian king to strike coins was [[Nicomedes I]] (c. 280&amp;nbsp;BC – c. 250&amp;nbsp;BC). He is primarily known for bringing the [[Gauls]] known as [[Galatians (people)|Galatians]] to the [[Asia Minor]] in 277&amp;nbsp;BC to fight against his brother and [[Antiochus I]]. This short-sighted mistake brought troubles for local Greeks for a century. In early 260s BC, possibly in 264&amp;nbsp;BC according to [[Eusebius]], he moved the capital to [[Nicomedia|Nicomedia on the Propontis]]. There was a mint in the new capital. Silver [[tetradrachm]]s and drachms of the [[Attic weight]] are known. Nicomedes I is known to have struck some bronze coinage too.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Mørkholm|title=Early Hellenistic Coinage from the Accession of Alexander to the Peace of Apamaea (336–188 BC)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_5Ez0kAOuIC&amp;pg=PA130|date=31 May 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39504-5|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bithynian and Cappadocian coinages were started with minor series of bronze coins.&lt;ref name="Metcalf2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=William E. Metcalf|title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trkUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937218-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successor of Nicomedes I was [[Ziaelas]] (c. 250&amp;nbsp;BC – 230&amp;nbsp;BC). He is known for having minted bronze coinage. However, only a few specimen have survived.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt;

Reign of [[Prusias I]] (c. 232&amp;nbsp;BC – 182&amp;nbsp;BC) saw birth of a more regular silver and bronze coinage for the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt; The first large issues of coins can be thus attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Metcalf2016"/&gt; Bronze coinage of Prusias I and [[Prusias II]] have not been differentiated in the most common catalogues. However, those related to Ziaelas can be attributed to Prusias I.&lt;ref name="Mørkholm1991"/&gt;

[[Nicomedes II]] is notable for having struck the first [[gold stater]]s in the kingdom's history. Those coins had his portrait on their obverse, and a galloping horseman on the reverse.&lt;ref name="Bilde1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Per Bilde|title=Aspects of Hellenistic Kingship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDgMAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Aarhus University Press|isbn=978-87-7288-474-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced the year number of the [[Bithynian era]] on his coins, replacing the [[Seleucid era]].&lt;ref name=Højte&gt;Jakob Munk Højte, "From Kingdom to Province: Reshaping Pontos after the Fall of Mithridates VI", in Tønnes Bekker-Nielsen (ed.), ''Rome and the Black Sea Region: Domination, Romanisation, Resistance'' (Aarhus University Press, 2006), 15–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Nicomedes III]] and [[Nicomedes IV]] struck similar tetradrachms as their predecessor Nicomedes II.&lt;ref name="snible"/&gt;

==End of the kingdom==
[[File:Antoninus Pius Provincial Demeter BMC12 1.xcf|thumb|left|[[Roman provincial currency|Roman provincial coin]] of [[Antoninus Pius]]]]
On the death of king [[Nicomedes IV]] in 74&amp;nbsp;BC the kingdom was [[bequeathed]] to the [[Roman Empire]], and subsequently reconstituted as a [[Roman province]]. It was later part of the province of the [[Bithynia and Pontus]]. Roman administration saw introduction of a new [[Roman provincial currency|provincial currency]], and Bithynian polity's capital was moved back to [[Nicomedia]].&lt;ref name="snible"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snible.org/coins/hn/bithynia.html|website=snible.org|title=Ancient coinage of Bithynia|accessdate=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayles1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne G.

During Roman rule the provincial cities that, in the combined province of Bithynia and Pontus, issued coinage reached 29 cities during the second century AD. Some of these cities on the Bithynian region included [[Apamea Myrlea]], [[Bithynium]], [[Nicaea]], Nicomedia and [[Tium]].&lt;ref name="Sayles1998"/&gt;

'''Bohemia''' ({{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|ˈ|h|iː|m|i|ə}} {{respell|boh|HEE|mee|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bohemia "Bohemia"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-cs|Čechy}};&lt;ref&gt;There is no distinction in the [[Czech language]] between adjectives referring to Bohemia and to the Czech Republic; i.e. ''český'' means both ''Bohemian'' and ''Czech''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Audio-de|Böhmen|De-Böhmen.ogg}}; {{lang-pl|Czechy}}; {{lang-fr|Bohême}}; {{lang-la|Bohemia}}; {{lang-it|Boemia}}) is the westernmost and largest [[historical region]] of the [[Czech lands]] in the present-day [[Czech Republic]]. In a broader meaning, Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory, including [[Moravia]] and [[Czech Silesia]],&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05&lt;/ref&gt; especially in a historical context, such as the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] ruled by [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Bohemian kings]].

Bohemia was a [[Duchy of Bohemia|duchy]] of [[Great Moravia]], later an independent principality, a [[Kingdom of Bohemia|kingdom]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and subsequently a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Austrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Pehe: [http://www.pehe.cz/Members/redaktor/co-vlastne-slavime-28.-rijna Co vlastně slavíme 28. října?]&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]] and the establishment of an [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–38)|independent Czechoslovak state]], Bohemia became a part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Between 1938 and 1945, border regions with sizeable German-speaking minorities of all three Czech lands were joined to [[Nazi Germany]] as the [[Sudetenland]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bohemia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/71528/Bohemia|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of Czech territory became the [[Second Czechoslovak Republic]] and was subsequently occupied as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]],  In 1969, the Czech lands (including Bohemia) were given autonomy within Czechoslovakia as the [[Czech Socialist Republic]]. In 1990, the name was changed to the [[Czech Republic]], which became a separate state in 1993 with the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia|split of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Until 1948, Bohemia was an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia as one of its "lands" ("země").&lt;ref name="Krajské uspořádání" /&gt; Since then, administrative reforms have replaced self-governing lands with a modified system of "regions" ("kraje") which do not follow the borders of the historical Czech lands (or the regions from the 1960 and 2000 reforms).&lt;ref name="Krajské uspořádání"&gt;Petr Jeřábek: [http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/krajske-usporadani-vadi-i-po-ctrnacti-letech-20140102.html Krajské uspořádání?

(Constitution of the Czech Republic)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohemia had an area of {{convert|52065|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and today is home to approximately 6.5 million of the Czech Republic's 10.5 million inhabitants. Bohemia was bordered in the south by [[Upper Austria|Upper]] and [[Lower Austria]] (both in [[Austria]]), in the west by [[Bavaria]] and in the north by [[Saxony]] and [[Lusatia]] (all in [[Germany]]), in the northeast by [[Silesia]] (in [[Poland]]), and in the east by [[Moravia]] (also part of the Czech Republic). Bohemia's borders were mostly marked by mountain ranges such as the [[Bohemian Forest]], the [[Ore Mountains (Central Europe)|Ore Mountains]], and the [[Krkonoše]], a part of the [[Sudetes]] range; the Bohemian-Moravian border roughly follows the [[Elbe]]-[[Danube]] [[European Watershed|watershed]].

== Etymology ==
In the 2nd century BC, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were competing for dominance in [[northern Italy]], with various peoples including the [[Boii]]. The Romans defeated the Boii at the [[Battle of Placentia (194 BC)]] and the [[Battle of Mutina (193 BC)]]. After this, many of the Boii retreated north across the Alps.&lt;ref name="Collis, John 2003"&gt;Collis, John. ''The Celts: Origins, Myth and Inventions''. Tempus Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7524-2913-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later Roman authors refer to the area they had once occupied (the "desert of the Boii" as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Strabo]] called it&lt;ref&gt;Pliny 3.146 and Strabo [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239:book=7:chapter=1&amp;highlight=boii 7.1 290 and 292], but also see [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239:book=7:chapter=2&amp;highlight=boii 7.2 293]&lt;/ref&gt;) as ''Boiohaemum''. The earliest mention&lt;ref name="Collis, John 2003"/&gt; was by [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' 28 (written at the end of the 1st century AD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ger.shtml#28 |title=Tacitus: Germania |publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later mentions of the same name are in Strabo and [[Velleius Paterculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=pTA3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|title=The Baiuvarii and Thuringi: An Ethnographic Perspective|chapter=The Boii, Bavaria and Bohemia|last=Green|first=Dennis|page=18|isbn=9781843839156|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name appears to include the tribal name ''Boi-'' plus the [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]] element *''haimaz'' "home" (whence Gothic ''haims'', German ''Heimat'', English ''home''). This Boiohaemum was apparently isolated to the area where King [[Marobod]]'s kingdom was centred, within the [[Hercynian forest]].

The Czech name "Čechy" is derived from the name of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[ethnic group]], the [[Czechs]], who settled in the area during the 6th or 7th century AD.

===Ancient Bohemia===
Bohemia, like neighbouring [[Bavaria]], is named after the [[Boii]], who were a large [[Celtic nations|Celtic nation]] known to the Romans for their migrations and settlement in northern Italy and other places. Another part of the nation moved west with the [[Helvetii]] into southern France, which was one of the events leading to the interventions of Julius Caesar's Gaulish campaign of 58 BC. The emigration of the Helvetii and Boii left southern Germany and Bohemia a lightly inhabited "desert" into which [[Suebi]]c peoples arrived, speaking Germanic languages, and became dominant over remaining Celtic groups. To the south, over the Danube, the Romans extended their empire, and to the southeast in present-day Hungary, were [[Dacians|Dacian]] peoples.

In the area of modern Bohemia the [[Marcomanni]] and other Suebic groups were led by their king [[Marobodus]], after suffering defeat to Roman forces in Germany. He took advantage of the natural defenses provided by its mountains and forests. They were able to maintain a strong alliance with neighbouring tribes including (at different times) the [[Lugii]], [[Quadi]], [[Hermunduri]], [[Semnones]], and [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], which was sometimes partly controlled by the [[Roman Empire]], and sometimes in conflict with it, for example in the second century when they fought [[Marcus Aurelius]].

In late classical times and the early [[Middle Ages]], two new Suebic groupings appeared to the west of Bohemia in southern Germany, the [[Alemanni]] (in the Helvetian desert), and the Bavarians ([[Baiuvarii]]). Many Suebic tribes from the Bohemian region took part in such movements westwards, even settling as far away as Spain and Portugal. With them were also tribes who had pushed from the east, such as the [[Vandals]], and [[Alans]].

Other groups pushed southwards towards [[Pannonia]]. The last known mention of the kingdom of the Marcomanni, concerning a queen named [[Fritigil]] is in the 4th century, and she was thought to have lived in or near Pannonia. The Suebian [[Langobardi]], who moved over many generations from the [[Baltic Sea]], via the Elbe and Pannonia to Italy, recorded in a [[Origo Gentis Langobardorum|tribal history]] a time spent in "Bainaib".

After this [[migration period]], Bohemia was partially repopulated around the 6th century, and eventually [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes arrived from the east, and their language began to replace the older Germanic, Celtic and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] ones. These are precursors of today's [[Czech people|Czechs]], though the exact amount of Slavic immigration is a subject of debate.  The Slavic influx was divided into two or three waves. The first wave came from the southeast and east, when the Germanic [[Lombards]] left Bohemia (c. 568 AD). Soon after, from the 630s to 660s, the territory was taken by [[Samo]]'s tribal confederation. His death marked the end of the old "Slavonic" confederation, the second attempt to establish such a Slavonic union after [[Carantania]] in [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]].

Other sources (''[[Descriptio civitatum et regionum ad septentrionalem plagam Danubii]]'', Bavaria, 800–850) divide the population of Bohemia at this time into the Merehani, Marharaii, Beheimare (Bohemani) and Fraganeo. (The suffix ''-ani'' or ''-ni'' means "people of-"). Christianity first appeared in the early 9th century, but only became dominant much later, in the 10th or 11th century.

The 9th century was crucial for the future of Bohemia. The [[Manorialism|manorial system]] sharply declined, as it did in Bavaria. The influence of the central ''Fraganeo-Czechs'' grew, as a result of the important cultic centre in their territory. They were Slavic-speaking and thus contributed to the transformation of diverse neighbouring populations into a new nation named and led by them with a united ''slavic'' ethnic consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Charvát: "Zrod Českého státu" [Origin of the Bohemian State], March 2007, {{ISBN|80-7021-845-2}}, in Czech&lt;/ref&gt;

===Přemysl dynasty===
{{main|History of Bohemia in the High Middle Ages}}
[[File:Přemyslovci erb.svg|thumb|The coat of arms of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]] (until 1253-62).]]

Bohemia was made a part of the early Slavic state of [[Great Moravia]], under the rule of [[Svatopluk I]] (r. 870–894). After Svatopluk's death Great Moravia was weakened by years of internal conflict and constant warfare, ultimately collapsing and fragmenting due to the continual incursions of the invading nomadic [[Magyars]]. Bohemia's initial incorporation into the Moravian Empire resulted in the extensive [[Christianization of Bohemia|Christianization of the population]]. A native monarchy arose to the throne, and Bohemia came under the rule of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]], which would rule the Czech lands for the next several hundred years.

The Přemyslids secured their frontiers from the remnant Asian interlocurs, after the collapse of the Moravian state, by entering into a state of semi-vassalage to the Frankish rulers. This alliance was facilitated by Bohemia's conversion to Christianity, in the 9th century. Continuing close relations were developed with the East [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom, which devolved from the [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] Empire, into [[East Francia]], eventually becoming the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

After a decisive victory of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia over invading Magyars in the 955 [[Battle of Lechfeld]], [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]] of Bohemia was granted the [[March of Moravia]] by German emperor [[Otto the Great]]. Bohemia would remain a largely autonomous state under the Holy Roman Empire for several decades. The jurisdiction of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was definitively reasserted when [[Jaromir, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromír of Bohemia]] was granted fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia by Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry II]] of the Holy Roman Empire, with the promise that he hold it as a vassal once he re-occupied Prague with a German army in 1004,  ending the rule of [[Boleslaw I of Poland]].

The first to use the title of "King of Bohemia" were the Přemyslid dukes [[Vratislav II of Bohemia|Vratislav II]] (1085) and [[Vladislav II of Bohemia|Vladislav II]] (1158), but their heirs would return to the title of [[duke]]. The title of king became hereditary under [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (1198). His grandson [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]] (king from 1253–1278) conquered a short-lived empire which contained modern [[Austria]] and [[Slovenia]]. The mid-13th century saw the beginning of substantial German immigration as the court sought to replace losses from the brief [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] in 1241. Germans settled primarily along the northern, western, and southern borders of Bohemia, although many lived in towns throughout the kingdom.

===Luxembourg dynasty===
[[File:Wappen Königreich Böhmen.png|thumb|The coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia.]]
The [[House of Luxembourg]] accepted the invitation to the Bohemian throne with the marriage to the Premyslid heiress, Elizabeth and the crowning subsequent of [[John I of Bohemia]] in 1310. His son, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] became King of Bohemia in 1346. He founded [[Charles University in Prague]], central Europe's first university, two years later.

His reign brought Bohemia to its peak both politically and in total area, resulting in his being the first King of Bohemia to also be elected as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Under his rule the [[Bohemian crown]] controlled such diverse lands as [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Upper Lusatia]] and [[Lower Lusatia]], Brandenburg, an area around [[Nuremberg]] called New Bohemia, [[Luxembourg]], and several small towns scattered around Germany.

===Hussite Bohemia===
[[File:Tabor CZ aerial old town from north B1.jpg|thumb|The more extreme Hussites became known as [[Taborite]]s, after the city of [[Tábor]] that became their center.]]
During the ecumenical [[Council of Constance]] in 1415, [[Jan Hus]], the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Charles University and a prominent reformer and religious thinker, was sentenced to be burnt at the stake as a [[Heresy|heretic]]. The verdict was passed despite the fact that Hus was granted formal protection by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] prior to the journey. Hus was invited to attend the council to defend himself and the Czech positions in the religious court, but with the emperor's approval, he was executed on 6 July 1415. The execution of Hus, as well as five consecutive papal [[crusades]] against followers of Hus, forced the Bohemians to defend themselves in the [[Hussite Wars]].

The uprising against imperial forces was led by a former mercenary, [[Jan Žižka]] of Trocnov. As the leader of the Hussite armies, he used innovative tactics and weapons, such as howitzers, pistols, and fortified wagons, which were revolutionary for the time, and established Žižka as a great general who never lost a battle.

After Žižka's death, [[Prokop the Great]] took over the command for the army, and under his lead the Hussites were victorious for another ten years, to the sheer terror of Europe. The Hussite cause gradually splintered into two main factions, the moderate [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] and the more fanatic [[Taborite]]s. The [[Utraquists]] began to lay the groundwork for an agreement with the Catholic Church and found the more radical views of the Taborites distasteful. Additionally, with general [[war-weariness]] and yearning for order, the Utraquists were able to eventually defeat the Taborites in the [[Battle of Lipany]] in 1434. Sigismund said after the battle that "only the Bohemians could defeat the Bohemians."

Despite an apparent victory for the Catholics, the Bohemian Utraquists were still strong enough to negotiate [[freedom of religion]] in 1436. This happened in the so-called [[Compacts of Basel|Basel Compacts]], declaring peace and freedom between Catholics and Utraquists. It would only last for a short period of time, as [[Pope Pius II]] declared the Basel Compacts to be invalid in 1462.

In 1458, [[George of Podebrady]] was elected to ascend to the Bohemian throne. He is remembered for his attempt to set up a pan-European "Christian League", which would form all the states of Europe into a community based on religion. In the process of negotiating, he appointed [[Leo of Rozmital]] to tour the European courts and to conduct the talks. However, the negotiations were not completed, because George's position was substantially damaged over time by his deteriorating relationship with the Pope.

[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Bohemia as the heart of ''[[Europa regina]]'', 1570.]]
After the death of King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] in the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] became the new King of Bohemia and the country became a constituent state of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

Bohemia enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period. In 1609, Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], who made Prague again the capital of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] at the time, himself a Roman Catholic, was moved by the Bohemian nobility to publish ''Maiestas Rudolphina'', which confirmed the older ''Confessio Bohemica'' of 1575.

After Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II]] and then King of Bohemia [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] (later Holy Roman Emperor) began oppressing the rights of Protestants in Bohemia, the resulting [[Bohemian Revolt]] led to outbreak of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1618. Elector [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], a [[Calvinist]] [[Protestant]], was elected by the Bohemian nobility to replace Ferdinand on the Bohemian throne, and was known as the [[Winter King]]. Frederick's wife, the popular [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]] and subsequently Elizabeth of Bohemia, known as the Winter Queen or Queen of Hearts, was the daughter of King [[James VI of Scotland]].

After Frederick's defeat in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, 27 Bohemian estates leaders together with [[Jan Jesenius]], rector of the [[Charles University]] of Prague were executed on the Prague's Old Town Square on 21 June 1621 and the rest were exiled from the country; their lands were then given to Catholic loyalists (mostly of Bavarian and Saxon origin), this ended the pro-reformation movement in Bohemia and also ended the role of Prague as ruling city of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In the so-called "renewed constitution"&lt;!--description needed--&gt; of 1627, the German language was established as a second official language in the Czech lands. The Czech language formally remained the first language in the kingdom, however, both German and Latin were widely spoken among the ruling classes, although German became increasingly dominant, while Czech was spoken in much of the countryside.

The formal independence of Bohemia was further jeopardized when the Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] approved administrative reform in 1749. It included the indivisibility of the [[Habsburg Monarchy#Rulers of the Habsburg Monarchy, 1526–1918|Habsburg Empire]] and the centralization of rule; this essentially meant the merging of the Royal Bohemian Chancellery with the Austrian Chancellery.

At the end of the 18th century, the [[Czech National Revival]] movement, in cooperation with part of the Bohemian aristocracy, started a campaign for restoration of the kingdom's historic rights, whereby the Czech language was to regain its historical role and replace German as the language of administration. The [[enlightened absolutism]] of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] and [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], who introduced minor language concessions, showed promise for the Czech movement, but many of these reforms were later rescinded. During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolution of 1848]], many Czech nationalists called for autonomy for Bohemia from Habsburg Austria, but the revolutionaries were defeated. The old Bohemian Diet, one of the last remnants of the independence, was dissolved, although the Czech language experienced a rebirth as [[romantic nationalism]] developed among the Czechs.

In 1861, a new elected Bohemian Diet was established. The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown ([[Kingdom of Bohemia]], [[Margraviate of Moravia]], and [[Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia]]) became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy ("state rights program"), while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution (so-called "Verfassungstreue").

After the defeat of Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, Hungarian politicians achieved the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], ostensibly creating equality between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. An attempt by the Czechs to create a tripartite monarchy (Austria-Hungary-Bohemia) failed in 1871. The "state rights program" remained the official platform of all Czech political parties (except for social democrats) until 1918.

===20th century===
[[File:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Bohemia (westernmost area) in Czechoslovakia 1918-1938.]]
[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]

After [[World War I]], Bohemia (as the largest and most populous land) became the core of the newly formed country of [[Czechoslovakia]], which combined Bohemia, [[Moravia]], [[Czech Silesia]], [[Upper Hungary]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]) and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] into one state. Under its first president, [[Tomáš Masaryk]], Czechoslovakia became a liberal democratic republic but serious issues emerged regarding the Czech majority's relationship with the native [[Sudeten Germans|German]] and Hungarian minorities.

Following the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, the border regions of Bohemia historically inhabited predominantly by ethnic Germans (the [[Sudetenland]]) were annexed to [[Nazi Germany]]. This was the only time in Bohemian history that its territory was politically divided. The remnants of Bohemia and Moravia were then annexed by Germany in 1939, while the Slovak lands became the separate [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]], a puppet state of [[Nazi Germany]]. From 1939 to 1945 Bohemia, (without the Sudetenland), together with Moravia formed the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] (''Reichsprotektorat Böhmen und Mähren'').

Any open opposition to German occupation was brutally suppressed by the Nazi authorities and many Czech patriots were executed as a result. After [[World War II]] ended in 1945, the vast majority of remaining Germans were [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II|expelled]] by force by the order of the re-established Czechoslovak central government, based on the Potsdam Agreement, and their property was confiscated by the Czech authorities. This severely depopulated the area and from this moment on locales were only referred to in their Czech equivalents regardless of their previous demographic makeup.

The Communist Party won the most votes in free elections but not a [[majority|simple majority]]. [[Klement Gottwald]], the communist leader, became Prime Minister of a coalition government.
[[File:Karlovy Vary Czech Rep.jpg|thumb|right|Bohemian town [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]].]]
In February 1948 the non-communist members of the government resigned in protest against arbitrary measures by the communists and their Soviet protectors in many of the state's institutions. Gottwald and the communists responded with a coup d'état and installed a pro-Soviet authoritarian state. In 1949, Bohemia ceased to be an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia, as the country was divided into administrative regions that did not follow the historical borders.

In 1989, [[Agnes of Bohemia]] became the first saint from a [[Central Europe]]an country to be canonized by [[Pope John Paul II]] before the "[[Velvet Revolution]]" later that year.

After the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in 1993, the territory of Bohemia remained in the [[Czech Republic]]. The new [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] provided for higher administrative units to be established, providing for the possibility of Bohemia as an administrative unit, but did not specify the form they would take. A constitutional act in 1997 rejected the restoration of self-governing historical Czech lands and decided for the regional system that has been in use since 2000.&lt;ref name=const2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=45807&amp;nr=347~2F1997&amp;rpp=15#local-content|title=Portál veřejné správy|website=portal.gov.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petr Pithart]], former Czech prime minister and president of the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]] at the time, remained one of the main advocates of the land system,&lt;ref name="odvaha"&gt;Petr Zídek: [http://www.lidovky.cz/dnesnim-politikum-chybi-odvaha-tvrdi-petr-pithart-z-uprchliku-strach-nema-1tj-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A151017_130833_ln_domov_mct Dnešním politikům chybí odvaha, tvrdí Petr Pithart.

Bohemia thus remains a [[historical region]], and its administration is divided between the Prague, [[Central Bohemian Region|Central Bohemia]], [[Pilsen Region|Plzeň]], [[Carlsbad Region|Karlovy Vary]], [[Ústí nad Labem Region|Ústí nad Labem]], [[Liberec Region|Liberec]], and [[Hradec Králové Region|Hradec Králové]] [[Regions of the Czech Republic|Regions]], as well as parts of the [[Pardubice Region|Pardubice]], [[Vysočina Region|Vysočina]], [[South Bohemian Region|South Bohemian]] and [[South Moravian Region]]s.&lt;ref name="Krajské uspořádání" /&gt; In addition to their use in the names of the regions, the historical land names remain in use in names of municipalities, cadastral areas, railway stations&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cd.cz/cd-online/stanice.php Seznam železničních stanic], List of railway stations, České dráhy (Czech railways) – seek for "v Čechách" (17×), "na Moravě" (15×), "Český", "České", "Moravský", "Moravské" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; or geographical names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kct-tabor.cz/gymta/VrcholyPohoriCR/geomorfologie.htm Geomorfologické celky ČR] (Geomorphologic areas of the Czech Republic), KČT Tábor&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction and border between the Czech lands is also preserved in [[Czech language|local dialects]].

==Kladsko==
{{main|County of Kladsko}}
The area around [[Kłodzko]] ({{lang-cz|Kladsko}}; {{lang-de|Glatz}}; {{lang-la|Glacio}}) in south-western [[Poland]] was culturally and traditionally a part of Bohemia. [[Kłodzko Land]] has now been a part of [[Lower Silesia]] since its conquest by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1763. Referred to as "Little [[Prague]]" ({{lang-de|Klein-Prag}}), the [[Kłodzko Valley]] region on the [[Nysa Kłodzka]] river was the focus of several attempts to reincorporate the area into [[Czechoslovakia]], one of several [[Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts]].

The last attempt occurred in May 1945 when [[Czechoslovakia]] tried to annex the area on behalf of the [[Czechs|Czech]] minority present in the western part of the [[Kłodzko Valley]] and known as the "[[Czech Corner]]". Pressure brought on by the [[Soviet Union]] led to a ceasing of military operations, with the Czech minority being expelled to [[Germany]] and Czechoslovakia. According to [[canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the area remained part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague]] until 1972.

Capitalizing on interest regarding the [[Kladsko]] area in the Czech national psyche, a special tourist area in the [[Náchod District]] has been designated as the ''Kladsko Borderland Tourist Area''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kladskepomezi.cz/en/page.php?sid=1|title=Story Landscape - Kladsko Borderland, Glatz Borderlan|first=inCUBE|last=interactive|website=www.kladskepomezi.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; (tourism district; {{lang-cs|turistická oblast Kladské pomezí}}). This area, entirely within the [[Czech Republic]], was formerly known as the ''[[Alois Jirásek|Jirásek]]'s Region'' ({{lang-cs|Jiráskův kraj}}), ''[[Adršpach rocks]]'' ({{lang-cs|italic=yes|Adršpašské skály}}).

'''Caspar Barlaeus''' (February 12, 1584 – January 14, 1648) was a Dutch [[polymath]] and [[Renaissance humanist]], a [[theology|theologian]], poet, and historian.

==Life==
Born '''Caspar (Kaspar) van Baerle''' in [[Antwerp]], Barlaeus' parents fled the city when it was occupied by Spanish troops shortly after his birth. They settled in [[Zaltbommel]], where his father eventually would become head of the [[Latin school]]. Caspar studied theology and philosophy at the [[University of Leiden]]. After his study, he preached for 1.5 years in the village of [[Nieuwe-Tonge]], before returning to Leiden in 1612 as an under-regent of a college. From 1617 he also was professor in philosophy at the university. Because of his [[remonstrant]] sympathies, he was forced out of this job in 1619. He then studied and graduated in medicines (in [[Caen]]), but never practiced professionally.

From 1631, he was professor of philosophy and rhetoric at the Amsterdam Athenaeum, ''[[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam|Athenaeum Illustre]]''), which is commonly regarded as the predecessor of the [[University of Amsterdam]]; the ''Athenaeum'' had its seat in the fourteenth-century Agnietenkapel. In January 1632, Barlaeus, along with [[Gerard Vossius]], held his inaugural speech at the Amsterdam Atheneum. Barlaeus later encouraged [[Martinus Hortensius]] to lecture –and give an inaugural speech- at the same institution.

==Writings==
Barlaeus published many volumes of poetry, particularly [[Latin poetry]]. He also wrote the [[eulogy]] that accompanies the 1622 portrait of cartographer [[Willem Blaeu]].

Barlaeus was involved in various aspects of cartography and history. He translated [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas|Antonio de Herrera's]] ''Description of the West Indies'' in 1622. In 1627, Barlaeus provided the text for the [[atlas]] of [[Italy]] created by [[Jodocus Hondius]]. In 1647, he wrote an account of the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonial empire in Brazil]], inspired by the leadership of [[John Maurice of Nassau]] (Johan Maurits) at [[Recife]]. The ''Rerum per octennium in Brasilia et alibi nuper gestarum sub praefectura'', as it is called, contains numerous maps and plates of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/30578284/Untitled?secret_password=1oxibkyjkvczuzp0uvtr|title=Rerum per octennium in Brasilia et alibi nuper gestarum sub praefectura|website=Scribd|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engravings of Brazilian northeastern locales, fleets, battles, and maps were for 160 years the main references to Brazilian landscapes available in Europe, and are well known by Brazilians today as the most important examples of pre-national art. [[Franciscus Plante]] wrote a similar work in the same year called ''Mauritias'', and included the maps already published in Barlaeus' work. These were maps of ''[[Ceará]]'', ''[[Pernambuco]]'', ''[[Paraíba]]'', and ''Pernambuco Borealá''. Plante also incorporated a portrait of John Maurice that had already been included in Barlaeus' work.

In 1638, Barlaeus wrote ''Medicea Hospes, sive descriptio publicae gratulationis, qua ... Mariam de Medicis, excepit senatus populusque Amstelodamensis''. Published by Willem Blaeu, it includes two large folding engraved views of the ceremonies on the occasion of the [[France|French]] queen mother [[Marie de Medici|Marie de Medici's]] [[Royal entry|triumphal entry]] into [[Amsterdam]] in 1638. Considered an important moment in Dutch history, Marie's visit lent ''de facto'' international recognition of the newly formed [[Dutch Republic]]. Marie de Medici actually traveled to the Netherlands as exile, but spectacular displays and water pageants took place in the city's harbor in celebration of her visit. There was a procession led by two mounted [[trumpeter]]s; a large temporary structure erected on an artificial island in the [[Amstel River]] was built especially for the festival. This building was designed to display a series of dramatic [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its [[pavilion]].

==Death and legacy==
*Barlaeus died at Amsterdam. Franciscus Plante wrote Barlaeus' [[obituary]] and [[epitaph]] in 1648.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Latijn/Plante.html|title=Franciscus Plante|website=www.let.leidenuniv.nl|language=nl|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claude Fleury''' (6 December 1640, [[Paris]] – 14 July 1723, [[Paris]]), was a [[France|French]] ecclesiastical [[historian]].

Destined for the bar, he was educated at the aristocratic [[College de Clermont]] (now that of Louis-le-Grand). In 1658 he was nominated an advocate to the ''[[parlement]]'' of Paris, and for nine years followed the legal profession. But he had long been of a religious disposition, and in 1667 turned from [[law]] to [[theology]]. He had been some time in orders when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], in 1672, selected him as tutor of the princes of [[Conti]], with such success that the king next entrusted to him the education of the count of Vermandois, one of his natural sons, on whose death in 1683 Fleury received for his services the [[Cistercian]] abbey of [[Loc-Dieu]], in the [[diocese of Rodez]].

In 1689 he was appointed sub-preceptor of the dukes of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], of [[Anjou]], and of [[Berry (province)|Berry]], and thus became intimately associated with [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]], their chief tutor. In 1696 he was elected to fill the place of [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]] in the [[Académie française]]; and on the completion of the education of the young princes the king bestowed upon him the rich [[priory]] of [[Argenteuil]], in the [[diocese of Paris]] (1706). On assuming this [[benefice]] he resigned, with rare disinterestedness, that of the abbey of Loc-Dieu.

About this time he began his great work, the first of the kind in France, and one for which he had been collecting materials for thirty years—the ''Histoire ecclésiastique''. Fleury's evident intention was to write a history of the church for all classes of society; but at the time in which his great work appeared it was less religion than theology that absorbed the attention of the clergy and the educated public; and his work accordingly appealed to the student rather than to the popular reader, dwelling as it does very particularly on questions of doctrine, of discipline, of supremacy, and of rivalry between the priesthood and the imperial power.

Nevertheless, it had a great success. The first edition, printed at Paris in 20 volumes ([[4to]]), 1691, was followed by many others, among which may be mentioned that of Brussels, in 32 vols ([[8vo]]), 1692, and that of Nîmes, in 25 vols (8vo), 1778 to 1780. The work of Fleury only comes down to the year 1414. It was continued by [[Jean Claude Fabre]] and [[Claude Pierre Goujet|Goujet]] down to 1595, in 16 vols. (4to). In consulting the work of Fleury and its supplement, the general table of contents, published by Rondet, Paris, 1758, 1 vol. (4to) will be found very useful. Translations have been made of the entire work into Latin, German and Italian. The Latin translation, published at Augsburg, 1758–1759, 85 vols. (8vo), carries the work down to 1684.

Fleury was appointed confessor to the young [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] in 1716, because, as the duke of Orleans said, he was neither [[Jansenist]] nor [[Molinist]], nor [[Ultramontanist]], but [[Catholic]]. His great learning was equalled by the modest simplicity of his life and the uprightness of his conduct.

Fleury left many works besides his ''Histoire ecclésiastique''. The following deserve special mention:
*''Histoire du droit français'' (1674, [[12mo]])
*''Mœurs des Israelites'' (1681, 12mo)
*''Mœurs des Chrétiens'' (1682, 12mo)
*''Catechisme Historique, contenant en abregé l'histoire sainte et la doctrine Cretienne'' (1683, 2vo)
*''Traité du choix et de la méthode des études'' (1686, 2 vols 12mo)
*''Les Devoirs des maîtres et des domestiques'' (1688, 12mo)
A number of the smaller works were published in one volume at Paris in 1807. The [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Roman Congregation of the Index]] condemned his ''Catéchisme historique'' (1679) and the ''Institution du droit ecclésiastique'' (1687).

The '''Communist insurgency in Myanmar''' (known as ''Burma'' from 1948 to 1988) was led by the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB) ("white flags"), and the [[Communist Party (Burma)]] ("red flags"). The conflict ended in 1988, when the armed wing of the CPB disbanded following the [[Revolutions of 1989#Asia|Fall of Communism]] and the [[8888 Uprising|ousting]] of the [[Burmese Way to Socialism|Burmese socialist dictatorship]].

==Timeline==

===WWII===
The CPB fought for independence from the [[United Kingdom]] and against the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]] in [[World War II]], prior to the eruption of [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|civil conflict in Myanmar]]. 

While in Insein prison in July 1941, Thakin Soe and Than Tun had co-authored the ''Insein Manifesto'', which declared fascism as the major enemy in the coming war and called for temporary co-operation with the British and the establishment of a broad coalition alliance that should include the [[Soviet Union]]. It followed the [[Popular Front]] line advanced by the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]], at the Seventh [[Comintern]] Congress in 1935. 

This was against the prevailing opinion of the Dobama Movement, including Thakin Aung San, who had secretly left Myanmar with a group of young men, who later became known as the [[Thirty Comrades]], to receive military training from the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] and founded the [[Burma Independence Army]] (BIA), later renamed the [[Burma Defence Army]] (BDA) and subsequently the [[Burma National Army]] (BNA), whom fought Allied Forces.&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Smith|year=1991|title=Burma - Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity|publisher=Zed Books|location=London and New Jersey}}{{pn|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oh"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.smlc.leeds.ac.uk/eas/eas_content/resources/documents/67LEAP.pdf#search=%22%22Thakin%20Than%20Tun%22%22|title=The Burmese Communist Party and the State-to-State Relations between China and Burma|first=Oliver|last=Hensengerth|year=2005|publisher=Leeds East Asia Papers|pages=10–12, 15–16, 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[puppet government]] was set up during the occupation by the Japanese on 1 August 1943. Soe had gone underground in the [[Irrawaddy Delta]] to organize armed resistance soon after the invasion, and Than Tun as Minister of Land and Agriculture was able to pass on intelligence to Soe. Other communist leaders Thakins Thein Pe and Tin Shwe made contact in July 1942 with the exiled colonial government in [[Shimla|Simla]], India. In January 1944 at a secret meeting near Dedaye in the Delta, the CPB successfully held its First Congress chaired by Soe.

The Communists were in the forefront of the armed resistance which subsequently became a national uprising on 27 March 1945, led by the BNA under the command of General [[Aung San]]. The communist commander Ba Htoo of the northwest command based in [[Mandalay]] started the rebellion three weeks earlier on 8 March. The CPB together with the BNA and the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP, later renamed the Socialist Party), had formed the [[Anti-Fascist Organisation]] (AFO) at a meeting in [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] in August 1944; it was transformed into the [[Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League]] (AFPFL) a year later after the defeat of Japan and the return of the British colonial administration to continue the fight for independence. The party that had started with a small group of men now became a major legal political party from 1945 until 1948 when Burma gained independence from Britain.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oh"/&gt;

===Faction split===
In February 1946 Thakin Soe denounced the leadership, accusing them of [[Browderism]], the form of [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] espoused by [[Earl Browder]], leader of the [[American Communist Party]], who proposed that armed struggle would no longer be necessary, as world fascism and imperialism had been weakened, making constitutional methods a real option to achieve "national liberation".&lt;ref name="oh"/&gt; Thein Pe, who had replaced Soe as secretary general, was the leader responsible for the policy paper on strategy entitled ''Toward Better Mutual Understanding and Greater Cooperation'' written in India and adopted at the party's Second Congress at Bagaya Road, Rangoon in July 1945. Soe broke away from the CPB to form a splinter group called the [[Communist Party (Burma)]] or the "red flags". The majority remained with Thakins Than Tun and Thein Pe and continued to co-operate with the AFPFL; the main party became known as the white flag communists although the title has never been officially accepted. During negotiations the British noticed that Than Tun was the thinker behind Aung San as he referred to his brother-in-law repeatedly for his opinion.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Also dubbed 'Thein-Than Communists' in the popular press, in the end they failed to achieve 'Leftist Unity' with Aung San and the Socialists led by [[U Nu]] and [[Kyaw Nyein]] within the AFPFL.

===Post-WWII===
Soe and Ba Tin had traveled to India in September 1945 to talk to the [[Communist Party of India]] where Browderism was already under attack, and Soe came back convinced that armed struggle was the only way forward. Amidst widespread strikes starting with the Rangoon Police and mass rallies, the new British Governor Sir [[Hubert Rance]] offered Aung San and the others seats in the Executive Council which after an initial refusal was taken up in September 1946. The CPB had by now abandoned the Browderist line, and a rift that had opened up between the party and Aung San with the socialists culminated in Than Tun being forced to resign as general secretary of the AFPFL in July of that year, a position he had held since its inception. The party was finally expelled from the AFPFL on 2 November after the communists had accused Aung San and the socialists of 'kneeling before imperialism', selling out by joining the Executive Council, and calling off the general strike.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oh"/&gt;

In February 1947, Ba Thein Tin and communist student leader Aung Gyi attended the British Empire Conference of Communist Parties in London, the first time the CPB took part in an international communist forum.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; After denouncing the [[Burmese general election, 1947|elections to the Constituent Assembly]] that took place the following April, the party fielded 25 junior candidates but won just 7 seats.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; The assassination of Aung San and his cabinet members on [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|19 July]] stunned the CPB as much as the rest of the country, but the party was still anxious to build a united front with the AFPFL to drive the British out of Burma, convinced that the assassination was an imperialist plot to stop Aung San from achieving Leftist Unity.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Thakin Nu concluded negotiations that Aung San had started with the British premier [[Clement Attlee]] in London, and the Nu-Attlee Treaty of October 1947 was condemned as a sham by the communists, the bone of contention in particular being the Let Ya-Freeman Defence Agreement, appended as an annexe to the treaty. It provided for an initial period of three years for a British military training mission to remain in the country and a possible future military alliance with Britain. This was to the CPB proof of British intention to subvert Burma's sovereignty and Nu's capitulation.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===Beginning of conflict===
On 8 November 1947, Nu called for a new coalition of socialists, the CPB and the People's Volunteer Organisation (PVO) formed from the demobbed war veterans by Aung San as his own paramilitary force. When it failed Nu accused the communists of gathering arms for an insurrection. The impact of communist campaigning against the treaty left its mark in Burma's decision not to join the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. The party's Burma-born [[Bengal]]i theoretician Goshal's thesis in December titled ''On the Present Political Situation and Our Tasks''  set out a revolutionary strategy reviving the slogan 'final seizure of power' from the previous January, and called for a 'national rising to tear up the treaty of slavery', [[nationalisation]] of all British and foreign assets, the abolition of all forms of landlordism and debt, the dismantling of the state bureaucracy and its replacement with a people's government, and alliances and trade agreements with 'democratic China, fighting [[Vietnam]] and [[Indonesia]]' and other democratic countries resisting '[[Anglo-America]]n imperialist domination'. A twofold strategy would be followed: an escalating campaign of strikes by workers and government employees in Rangoon and other cities, and the establishment of "liberated" areas in the countryside to be defended by Red Guards consisting of PVOs trained in [[guerilla warfare]].&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

February 1948 saw a wave of strikes in [[Rangoon]] by the [[All Burma Trade Union Congress]] (ABTUC) backed by the CPB, and in March a 75,000 strong mass rally by the All Burma Peasants Organisation (ABPO) at [[Pyinmana]]. Nu gave the order to arrest the communist leaders convinced that they were planning an uprising on Resistance Day, 27 March, only to find the CPB headquarters at Bagaya empty on the morning of 28 March; his quarry had flown to their stronghold Pyinmana to start an armed revolution. The CPB was not however officially outlawed until October 1953.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===Civil war===
{{main|Internal conflict in Myanmar}}

Within eight months of independence Burma plunged into an all out civil war. Soe's red flag communists had already started a rebellion, so had the [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] nationalists led by the veteran monk U Seinda as well as the [[Mujahid]] Rakhine Muslims. The PVO had split into White-band and Yellow-band factions; the majority White-band PVO led by Bo La Yaung, a member of the [[Thirty Comrades]], and Bo Po Kun, joined the insurrection in July. Nu's government deployed the Karen and Kachin Rifles to suppress the communist uprising, and took [[Pyay]], [[Thayetmyo]] and [[Pyinmana]] during the latter half of 1948. The [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) rebelled at the end of January 1949 when the Army Chief of Staff Gen. Smith Dun, an ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] was replaced by Gen. [[Ne Win]], a socialist commander and senior member of the Thirty Comrades after Aung San and Bo Let Ya. The [[Mon people|Mon]] joined the Karen. The [[Pa-O]] in the [[Shan State]] also rose up. Three regiments of the [[Burma Rifles]] also went underground led by communist commanders Bo Zeya, Bo Yan Aung and Bo Ye Htut, all members of the Thirty Comrades, forming the Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA).&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

The CPB's appraisal of Burma as a 'semi-colonial semi-feudal' state led to the [[Maoist]] line of establishing guerilla bases among the peasants in the countryside as opposed to mobilising the urban [[proletariat]], although it continued to support above-ground leftist opposition parties such as the [[Burma Workers and Peasants Party]] (BWPP) led by trade union leaders Thakins Lwin and Chit Maung, and dubbed 'crypto-communists' or 'red socialists' by the Rangoon press. They tried unsuccessfully to bring the communists back into mainstream politics, and in 1956 formed an alliance called the [[National United Front]] to contest the election on a 'peace ticket' winning 35% of the vote though only a small number of seats.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

The [[politburo]]'s decision to fight 'for the very existence of our party' at a clandestine central committee meeting in April 1948 in Rangoon was confirmed the following month by the full plenum of the CC at Hpyu 120 miles north of the capital. The headquarters of the CPB remained on the move mostly in the forests and hills along the [[Sittang River]] valley, [[Pyinmana]] – [[Yamethin]] area in central Burma, sometimes north into the Three M triangle ([[Mandalay]] – [[Meiktila]] – [[Myingyan]]). Debt was abolished, and farming and trading [[co-operatives]] established in areas under their control. One year into the insurrection its forces were reorganised along Maoist lines into a main force, mobile guerilla forces and local people's militia, with the command shared between military and political commissars. In September 1950 the People's Army (PA) was formed by merging the communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) with Bo Zeya's Revolutionary Burma Army (RBA). Its regular forces consisted of four main divisions, each with 1,000 men under arms.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

The [[Karen National Union]] (KNU)  with its 'reactionary feudal leadership' was regarded as being used by the British to destabilise the Union by both the AFPFL government and the communists, although Than Tun had supported the earlier [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] nationalist rebellion against the British, the [[Shan people|Shan]] struggle against the feudal autocracy, and the Karen right to self-determination. The civil war was thus waged from three sides: the AFPFL, the Communist-PVOs and the [[ethnic minority]] nationalists with the KNU threatening Rangoon itself in early 1949. Nu estimated government casualties alone at 3,424 dead including 1,352 army personnel in 1952.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===1950s===
The communist military offensive began to lose traction, and in 1955, the CPB put forward the 'Peace and Unity' proposal. It combined a strong peace movement by its above-ground supporters and sympathizers and proposals by Than Tun to the AFPFL government in 1956. [[War-weariness]] had led to a desire for peace, and the move was welcomed by both the leftist opposition and conservative groups in Rangoon. [[Thakin Kodaw Hmaing]], the revered veteran nationalist leader, formed an Internal Peace Committee which in 1958 was allowed by the government to speak on the CPB's behalf. The results of the [[Burmese general election, 1956|1956 election]], where the National United Front did very well on a peace ticket, had also given the AFPFL a jolt.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

On the international front, US support of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) forces, that had crossed over from [[Yunnan province]] into northeastern Burma after Mao's victory in China, had resulted in Burma's refusal to join the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation ([[SEATO]]). [[Zhou Enlai]] visited Rangoon on his return from the [[Geneva Conference (1955)|Geneva Conference]] on [[Indo-China]] to meet Nu, and issued a joint communique reaffirming the 'five principles of peaceful co-existence' and the right of people 'to choose their own state system'; Nu repaid the visit the same year receiving the assurance that Chinese leaders had no contact with the CPB. [[Ne Win]] also led a military delegation to Beijing in 1957, and met Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]. A week-long visit in December 1955 by [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared to endorse Burma as a model non-aligned, socialist Third World country developing at its own pace; Burma was a strong supporter of the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]]. [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death and the shift in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] policy under Khrushchev contributed to the mood of national reconciliation.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Now U Nu turned the communist peace offensive to his advantage and came up with a very successful 'arms for democracy' offer. [[Tatmadaw]] (Burma Armed Forces) offensives in early 1956, Operation ''Aung Thura'' (Valiant Victory) in [[Pakokku]] area and Operation ''Aung Tayza'' (Glorious Victory) in [[Pathein]] area, had been partly successful. The year 1958 saw mass surrenders of first the [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] nationalists led by U Seinda, next the [[Pa-O]], [[Mon people|Mon]], and [[Shan people|Shan]] communists, but most importantly the PVO led by Bo Po Kun. The official figure was 5,500 armed insurgents that 'entered the light', of which about 800 were white flag communists mainly in [[Sittwe]], northern [[Rakhine State]]. The one crucial exception was the KNU.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

[[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] became the primary arms supplier for the Burmese government beginning in 1952, when the Burmese reached out to [[Belgrade]] due to the slow and uneasy support from the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The two nations became very close as a result, and the [[Yugoslav National Army]] sent advisors to aid in the front lines. The sudden strong relationship between Burma and Yugoslavia prompted concern among the Americans, who worried the Yugoslav support would strengthen Marxist ideology in the government.&lt;ref&gt;FRUS, 1952-54, vol. XII, part II, East Asia and the Pacific, pp. 194-195.&lt;/ref&gt; General Ne Win, who previously sought support solely from the West, was impressed with the speed of the Yugoslav-Burmese cooperation, and traveled to Belgrade in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;NARA, RG 59, 690B.9321/12-2253, Memorandum of Conversation between General Ne Win and the Army and Air Attachés of the U.S. Embassy in Burma, December 22nd 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egreteau, Renaud, and Larry Jagan.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
In 1963 Ne Win as head of the [[Union Revolutionary Council]] government launched a peace offensive starting with a general amnesty on 1 April. Bo Ye Htut, a member of the Thirty Comrades and central military committee of the CPB who had been to Rangoon on a secret peace mission before the 1958 AFPFL split, took the offer together with Bo Ye Maung and Bo Sein Tin. The KNU split in the same month between the KNUP and the Karen Revolutionary Council (KRC) led by Saw Hunter Tha Hmwe. The first insurgent group to arrive in Rangoon was the red flag delegation in June later joined by [[Thakin Soe]] himself from [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in August. After just three meetings the talks were abruptly ended by the RC on 20 August and the red flag communists were flown back to [[Sittwe]].&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Three CPB teams arrived in July and September by air from China led by Bo Zeya, Yebaw Aung Gyi, Thakins Pu and Ba Thein Tin. These 'Beijing returnees' were allowed to travel to the party’s jungle headquarters in the [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] [[mountains|Yoma]] near Paukkaung where the leadership, reunited after 15 years, held an historic meeting of the Central Committee. Talks began on 2 September after the CPB delegation headed by the general secretary Yebaw Htay and the People's Army's chief of staff Bo Zeya arrived on 28 August. A second team headed by Thakin Zin, politbureau member and secretary of the NDUF which agreed to negotiate as one team, arrived on 20 September. Meetings with the CPB and NDUF overshadowed those with other nationalities such as the Shan and Kachin delegations.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===Peace talks collapse===
Talks broke down on 14 November, when the Revolutionary Council government demanded that:
# All troops must be concentrated in a designated area.
# No one can leave without permission.
# All organisational work must stop.
# All fund-raising must stop.

Expectations had been running high, and the People’s Peace Committee, set up by the NUF and supported by [[Thakin Kodaw Hmaing]] and former brigadier [[Kyaw Zaw]], staged a Six-District Peace March in early November from Minhla to Rangoon. The marchers were cheered and applauded along the entire route by large crowds chanting anti-government slogans, and given food parcels collected by the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) and the [[All Burma Federation of Student Unions]] (ABFSU). When they reached Rangoon at a mass rally of 200,000 in front of city hall, speakers openly supported the NDUF’s demand to keep its weapons and territory. Although at first the CPB and NDUF had misinterpreted Ne Win’s peace offensive as a sign of weakness desperate for a solution, once they arrived in Rangoon they realised it was going to be a mainly cosmetic exercise. They therefore took the opportunity to re-establish contacts and meet family and friends.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===Crackdown===
Over 900 people were arrested in the immediate aftermath, mostly BWPP and NUF activists, but also Thaton Hla Pe, leader of the Union Pa-O National Organisation (UPNO) and formerly of the insurgent Pa-O National Organisation (PNO), who was one of the main organisers of the peace march, and Nai Non Lar leader of the former Mon People’s Front (MPF). By the end of the year over 2,000 were believed to be in prison. Almost the entire executive committees of the RUSU and the ABFSU fled to join the CPB.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===1970s===
In November 1978 Thakin Ba Thein Tin presented a ‘political report’ at a historic meeting of the politburo held in Panghsang, unanimously approved at the CC meeting in early 1979. It formed the basis of the resolutions passed in September 1985 at the CPB’s Third Congress, 40 years since the last one in Rangoon, attended by just 170 of the party’s estimated 5,000 members.
* The party’s past errors of the 1955 ‘revisionist’ line and the 1964 ‘intra-party revolutionary line’ were now admitted.
* Ne Win’s regime was characterised as representing ‘imperialism, feudal-landlordism and bureaucratic capitalism’.
* The primacy of the armed struggle, Marxist–Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought and China’s example was reaffirmed.
* Soviet ‘socialism-imperialism’ and Vietnam’s ‘hegemonism’ were to be resisted as much as ‘US imperialism’. The CPB had supported the [[Khmer Rouge]] and written to both the Vietnamese and Cambodian parties urging them to settle their dispute peacefully. Ne Win, for his part in playing the China card, also happened to be the first head of state to pay a visit to [[Phnom Penh]] after the Khmer Rouge came to power.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

The party’s general programme was drawn up in the light of  ‘the experiences of the last 30 years of the armed struggle’.
* It warned against ‘sectarianism’ and ‘leftist’ and ‘rightist deviationism’.
* The party’s constitution was revised to ‘suit the changing conditions’ of the world.
* New ‘party building’, ‘military’ and ‘agricultural’ lines were adopted.
** Party membership had failed to fulfill the 1964 directive of recruiting at least one member from every village.
** The new military line would be ‘strategic defence’ at a time when the party was weak and the enemy strong.
** Because Burma was still a ‘backward semi-colonial, semi-feudal, agrarian country with uneven political and economic development’, ‘agrarian revolution’ with the slogan 'land to the tillers' was still the basis of a ‘people’s war’ waged by building up Red Power areas and encircling the cities. In insisting on not ‘copying the [[October Revolution]] of Russia’ by calling a ‘general strike and uprising’ (in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] – ''thabeikson thabonhta''), it appeared to have ignored the recent upheavals of 1974–76 in the cities.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===Peace parley 1980–81===
Shortly after Myanmar resigned from the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in protest against Soviet and Vietnamese manipulation at the September 1979 [[Havana]] Conference, the Chinese Foreign Minister [[Huang Hua (politician)|Huang Hua]] paid a visit to Rangoon. Ne Win announced an amnesty in 1980 which saw the return of [[U Nu]] and others from Thailand. The CPB responded with an attack on Mong Yawng, but proposed talks in September after letting the amnesty expire. The first meeting took place in Beijing in October between the teams led by Ba Thein Tin and Ne Win who paid a surprise visit to China leaving the Kachin delegation in the middle of the talks in Rangoon. At the second meeting headed by Thakin Pe Tint for the CPB and Maj. Gen. Aye Ko for the BSPP the following May in [[Lashio]], three new conditions were put on the table by Aye Ko:

# The abolition of the CPB.
# The abolition of the People's Army under the command of the CPB.
# The abolition of all the ‘liberated areas’.

The CPB was told that according to Article 11 of the 1974 Constitution which had established Burma as a [[one-party state]] there was no place for another political party. Ne Win ended the peace talks on 14 May and let the ceasefire deadline of 31 May with the KIO pass without replying to the Kachin position. There had been no ceasefire agreement with the CPB.

The VOPB began to broadcast appeals for ending the civil war, developing democracy and building national unity in a new [[multi-party system]]. The CPB still commanded 15,000 troops in the north-east, and the Tatmadaw, after resuming the Operation ''King Conqueror'' belatedly in 1982 and having suffered losses amounting to several hundred in the Kengtung-Tangyang area from CPB counter-attacks, finally retreated. Both sides now faced another challenge in the rising strength of the [[National Democratic Front (Burma, 1976)|National Democratic Front]] (NDF) formed in 1976, pointedly excluding the [[Bamar]], by the ethnic insurgencies uniting the Karen, Mon, Kachin, Shan,Pa-O, Karenni, Kayan, Wa and Lahu, particularly with the return of the KIO in 1983 after its separate peace talks with the BSPP failed. This finally led to the CPB reaching an agreement with the NDF in 1986.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

===8888 Uprising===
{{main|8888 Uprising}}
The government of Myanmar heavily blamed the CPB for the tremendous upheavals in 1988, the economic collapse that resulted in the country being recognised by the UN as one of the [[Least Developed Countries]] in the world in 1987 and simmering discontent over the years compounded by yet another round of ‘demonetisation’ culminated in a great outburst of angry protests and demonstrations countrywide, which led to a national uprising on 8 August 1988. It was brutally crushed by the Tatmadaw, killing thousands of civilians and this time in the cities alleging communist infiltration.

Kyin Maung, then politburo member in charge of the CPB underground Task Force 4828 (named after 28 March 1948 insurrection), was forthright in admitting the presence of cadres in the cities, including Thet Khaing, son-in-law of [[Kyaw Zaw]], but asserted that the Military Intelligence Service (MIS) had greatly exaggerated the party’s 'leading role' in the uprising. The party had begun advocating a multi-party democracy system after 1981, and it was not until 28 March 1988, the anniversary of the insurrection, that it called for a provisional government composed of various opposition parties, forces and personages. The students’ call for an [[interim government]] to end one-party rule and to hold multi-party elections never materialised, as [[U Nu]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] could not agree to work together, and this failure to achieve a united opposition sealed the fate of the uprising.

== History ==
David Isay grew up in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Manhattan]], [[New York State|New York]]. He is the son of the [[psychiatrist]] [[Richard Isay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaycitynews.com/dr-richard-isay-lover-and-fighter-dies-at-77/|title=Dr. Richard Isay, Lover and Fighter, Dies at 77 - Gay City News - Gay City News|website=gaycitynews.com|accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and book editor and author, Jane Isay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/blog/2010/05/06/jane-and-dave-isay-role-reversal|title=Jane and Dave Isay: Role Reversal - Bookreporter.com|website=www.bookreporter.com|accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Friends Seminary]] in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsseminary.org/storycorps|title=Our Mission|website=www.friendsseminary.org|accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York University]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.rutgers.edu/medrel/news-releases/2010/05/storycorps-founder-d-20100506&lt;/ref&gt;

Isay produced a wide variety of programs for [[NPR]], including the ''Yiddish Radio Project'' with [[Henry Sapoznik]], salvaging recordings of Victor Packer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/arts/television-radio-pulling-in-signals-from-a-lost-world.html "Television/Radio; Pulling in Signals From a Lost World"], ''The New York Times'', JULIE SALAMON, March 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced "The Execution Tapes", nineteen recordings of the 23 electrocutions carried out by the state of Georgia since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/us/sounds-of-the-georgia-death-chamber-will-be-heard-on-public-radio.html "Sounds of the Georgia Death Chamber Will Be Heard on Public Radio"], ''The New York Times'', Sara Rimer, May 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Isay received a MacArthur “Genius” fellowship as a radio documentary producer before he started StoryCorps.

In 2003 Isay set up an oral history recording booth at [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/nyregion/oral-history-project-wants-nation-interviewers-public-recording-booth-grand.html "Oral History Project Wants Nation of Interviewers; Public Recording Booth at Grand Central Aims to Democratize Chroniclers Art"], ''The New York Times'', Michael Brick, May 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited oral historian [[Studs Terkel]] of Chicago to cut the ceremonial ribbon for the opening of StoryCorps' first booth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnegie.org/fileadmin/Media/Publications/carnegie_results_fall_12_story_coprs.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, StoryCorps has recording booths in Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco &lt;ref&gt;[http://storycorps.org/programs/]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, StoryCorps converted two airstream trailers into a MobileBooth traveling recording studios, launching its first cross-country tour.
In 2010, StoryCorps began animating a selection of their interviews with the Rauch Brothers, thus making the leap from radio broadcast to television on shows like PBS’ POV and online animated videos.

&lt;!-- This article is written in British English. Please observe [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ENGVAR#National_varieties_of_English these guidelines] --&gt;

The '''division of labour''' is the separation of tasks in any  [[system]] so that participants may specialize.  Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or [[natural resource]]s in addition to skills and training and complex combinations of such assets are often important, as when multiple items of specialized equipment and skilled operators are used to produce a single product. The division of labour is the motive for [[trade]] and the source of [[economic interdependence]].

After the [[Neolithic Revolution]], pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labor, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites.  This specialization was furthered by the process of [[industrialisation]], and [[Industrial Revolution]]-era factories.  Accordingly many [[Classical economics|classical economists]] as well as some mechanical engineers such as [[Charles Babbage]] were proponents of division of labour. Also, having workers perform single or limited tasks eliminated the long training period required to train craftsmen, who were replaced with lesser paid but more productive unskilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total [[Output (economics)|output]] and [[trade]], the rise of [[capitalism]], and the increasing complexity of [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient [[Sumer]]ian ([[Mesopotamia]]n) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.

In contrast to division of labour, division of work refers to the division of a large task, contract, or project into smaller tasks—each with a separate schedule within the overall project schedule. Division of labour, instead, refers to the allocation of tasks to individuals or organizations according to the skills and/or equipment those people or organizations possess. Often division of labour and division of work are both part of the economic activity within an industrial nation or organization.

== Theorists ==

=== Plato ===
In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]]'', the origin of the state lies in the natural inequality of humanity, which is embodied in the division of labour.

{{quote|Well then, how will our state supply these needs? It will need a farmer, a builder, and a weaver, and also, I think, a shoemaker and one or two others to provide for our bodily needs. So that the minimum state would consist of four or five men.... (''The Republic'', p. 103, Penguin Classics edition.)}}

Silvermintz notes that, "Historians of economic thought credit Plato, primarily on account of arguments advanced in his Republic, as an early proponent of the division of labour." Notwithstanding this, Silvermintz argues that, "While Plato recognizes both the economic and political benefits of the division of labour, he ultimately critiques this form of economic arrangement insofar as it hinders the individual from ordering his own soul by cultivating acquisitive motives over prudence and reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvermintz|first=Daniel|title=Plato's Supposed Defense of the Division of Labor: A Reexamination of the Role of Job Specialization in the Republic|journal=History of Political Economy|year=2010|volume=42|issue=4|pages=747–72|url=http://hope.dukejournals.org/content/42/4/747.abstract|doi=10.1215/00182702-2010-036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Xenophon ===
[[Xenophon]], in the fourth century BC, makes a passing reference to division of labour in his '[[Cyropaedia]]' (a.k.a. [[Cyropaedia|Education of Cyrus]]).

{{quote|Just as the various trades are most highly developed in large cities, in the same way food at the palace is prepared in a far superior manner. In small towns the same man makes couches, doors, ploughs and tables, and often he even builds houses, and still he is thankful if only he can find enough work to support himself. And it is impossible for a man of many trades to do all of them well. In large cities, however, because many make demands on each trade, one alone is enough to support a man, and often less than one: for instance one man makes shoes for men, another for women, there are places even where one man earns a living just by mending shoes, another by cutting them out, another just by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but assembles the parts, Of necessity, he who pursues a very specialized task will do it best.&lt;ref&gt;Book VIII, ch, ii, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA4ohkXjeF4C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=cyropaedia+xenophon+I%22in+small+towns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rirS1vn2bT&amp;sig=WAizKVoTZo7saTHrRQI3akwpy7s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_8Y_SvWpN4rAM5KMjKkO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 4[&amp;#93;-6], cited in ''[[The Ancient Economy (book)|The Ancient Economy]]'' by M. I. Finley. Penguin books 1992, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ibn Khaldun===
The 14th-century scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] emphasised the importance of the division of labour in the production process. In his [[Muqaddimah]], he states:
{{quote|The power of the individual human being is not sufficient for him to obtain (the food) he needs, and does not provide him with as much as he requires to live. Even if we assume an absolute minimum of food...that amount of food could be obtained only after much preparation...Thus, he cannot do without a combination of many powers from among his fellow beings, if he is to obtain food for himself and for them. Through cooperation, the needs of a number of persons, many times greater than their own number, can be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abdullahi|first=Ali Arazeem|author2=Salawu, Bashir|title=Ibn Khaldun: A Forgotten Sociologist?|journal=South African Review of Sociology|date=1 October 2012|volume=43|issue=3|pages=24–40|doi=10.1080/21528586.2012.727543}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== William Petty ===
[[William Petty|Sir William Petty]] was the first modern writer to take note of division of labour, showing its existence and usefulness in Dutch [[shipyard]]s. Classically the workers in a [[shipyard]] would build ships as units, finishing one before starting another. But the Dutch had it organized with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships. People with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on [[political economy]].

Petty also applied the principle to his survey of [[Ireland]]. His breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training.

=== Bernard de Mandeville ===
[[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]] discusses the matter in the second volume of ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' (1714).  This elaborates many matters raised by the original poem about a 'Grumbling Hive'. He says:
{{quote|But if one will wholly apply himself to the making of Bows and Arrows, whilst another provides Food, a third builds Huts, a fourth makes Garments, and a fifth Utensils, they not only become useful to one another, but the Callings and Employments themselves will in the same Number of Years receive much greater Improvements, than if all had been promiscuously followed by every one of the Five.}}

=== David Hume ===

{{quote|When every individual person labors apart, and only for himself, his force is too small to execute any considerable work; his labor being employed in supplying all his different necessities, he never attains a perfection in any particular art; and as his force and success are not at all times equal, the least failure in either of these particulars must be attended with inevitable ruin and misery. Society provides a remedy for these three inconveniences. By the conjunction of forces, our power is augmented: By the partition of employments, our ability increases: And by mutual succor we are less exposed to fortune and accidents. ’Tis by this additional force, ability, and security, that society becomes advantageous.}}

=== Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau ===
In his introduction to ''Art de l'Épinglier'' [The Art of the Pin-Maker] (1761),&lt;ref&gt;R. Réaumur and A. de Ferchault. Art de l'Épinglier avec des additions de M. Duhamel du Monceau et des remarques extraites des mémoires de M. Perronet, inspecteur général des Ponts et Chaussées. Paris, Saillant et Nyon, 1761.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] writes about the "division of this work":&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Duhamel.jpg|Scan]] of the text of "l'Art de l'Épinglier", with the expression "division de ce travail".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There is nobody who is not surprised of the small price of [[pin]]s; but we shall be even more surprised, when we know how many different operations, most of them very delicate, are mandatory to make a good pin. We are going to go through these operations in a few words to stimulate the curiosity to know their detail; this enumeration will supply as many articles which will make the division of this work. [...] The first operation is to have brass go through the drawing plate to calibrate it. [...]}}

By "division of this work", Duhamel du Monceau is referring to the subdivisions of the text describing the various trades involved in the pin making activity; this can also be described as division of labour.

=== Adam Smith ===

In the first sentence of ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]] foresaw the essence of industrialism by determining that division of labour represents a substantial increase in productivity. Like du Monceau, his example was the making of pins. Unlike [[Plato]], Smith famously argued that the difference between a street porter and a philosopher was as much a consequence of the division of labour as its cause. Therefore, while for Plato the level of specialization determined by the division of labour was externally determined, for Smith it was the dynamic engine of economic progress.  However, in a further chapter of the same book Smith criticizes the division of labour saying it can lead to "the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people. … unless government takes some pains to prevent it."&lt;ref&gt;"The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgement concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life... But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.", ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), [[Adam Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt; The contradiction has led to some debate over Smith's opinion of the division of labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothbard|first=Murray|title=The Celebrated Adam Smith|url=https://mises.org/page/1430|website=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=2012-05-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612015921/http://mises.org/page/1430|archivedate=12 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] agreed with Smith: "Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of the faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |year= 1841 |title= Democracy in America: Volume I |location= New York, NY |publisher= J.&amp;nbsp;&amp; H.&amp;nbsp;G.

The [[Departmentalization|specialization]] and concentration of the workers on their single subtasks often leads to greater skill and greater productivity on their particular subtasks than would be achieved by the same number of workers each carrying out the original broad task.

Smith saw the importance of matching skills with equipment – usually in the context of an [[organization]].  For example, pin makers were organized with one making the head, another the body, each using different equipment.  Similarly he emphasised a large number of skills, used in cooperation and with suitable equipment, were required to build a ship.

In modern economic discussion, the term [[human capital]] would be used.  Smith's insight suggests that the huge increases in productivity obtainable from [[technology]] or technological progress are possible because human and physical capital are matched, usually in an organization. See also a short discussion of Adam Smith's theory in the context of [[Pin Factory|business processes]].

Babbage wrote a seminal work "On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures" analyzing perhaps for the first time the division of labour in factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Nathan|title=Babbage: pioneer economist by Nathan Rosenberg|url=http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/babbage/rosenb.html|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immanuel Kant ===
In the ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals|Groundwork of the Metaphysics of morals]]'' 1785, Kant notes the value of the division of labour:&lt;blockquote&gt;All crafts, trades and arts have profited from the division of labour; for when each worker sticks to one particular kind of work that needs to be handled differently from all the others, he can do it better and more easily than when one person does everything. Where work is not thus differentiated and divided, where everyone is a jack-of-all-trades, the crafts remain at an utterly primitive level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=Project Gutenberg|website=Project Gutenberg|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Karl Marx ===
Marx argued that increasing the specialization may also lead to workers with poorer overall skills and a lack of enthusiasm for their work. He described the process as [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]: workers become more and more specialized and work becomes repetitive, eventually leading to complete alienation from the process of production. The worker then becomes "depressed spiritually and physically to the condition of a machine".&lt;ref&gt;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, 1844, First Manuscript, in T.B. Bottomore, Karl Marx Early Writings, C.A. Watts and Co. Ltd., London, 1963, p.&amp;nbsp;72&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Marx argued that division of labour creates less-skilled workers. As the work becomes more specialized, less training is needed for each specific job, and the workforce, overall, is less skilled than if one worker did one job entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Wage Labor &amp; Capital&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Marx's theoretical contributions is his sharp distinction between the economic and the [[social division of labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. (1977). ''[[Capital, Volume I|Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1.]]'' New York: Vintage Books, pp. 781–94.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, some forms of labour co-operation are purely due to "technical necessity", but others are a result of a "social control" function related to a class and status hierarchy If these two divisions are conflated, it might appear as though the existing division of labour is technically inevitable and immutable, rather than (in good part) socially constructed and influenced by [[Power (sociology)|power]] relationships. He also argues that in a [[communism|communist]] society, the division of labour is transcended, meaning that balanced human development occurs where people fully express their nature in the variety of creative work that they do.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Rattansi: Marx and the Division of Labor (Macmillan, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Henry David Thoreau ===
[[Henry David Thoreau]] criticized the division of labour in ''[[Walden]]'' (published in 1854), on the basis that it removes people from a sense of connectedness with society and with the world at large, including nature. He claimed that the average man in a civilized society is less wealthy, in practice, than one in a "savage" society. The answer he gave was that [[self-sufficiency]] was enough to cover one's basic needs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Thoreau's friend and mentor, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], criticized the division of labour in "The American Scholar"; a widely informed, holistic citizenry is vital for the spiritual and physical health of the country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Émile Durkheim ===
In his seminal work, ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]'', [[Émile Durkheim]]&lt;ref&gt;A founding father of sociology, Emile Durkheim, best known for his 1893 seminal work, ''De La Division Du Travail Social'' (''The Division of Labor in Society''),"dedicated himself to the establishment of sociology as a legitimate and respected science and as an instrument of rational social action." {{cite journal | last1 = Alpert | first1 = Harry | year = 1959 | title = Emile Durkheim: A Perspective and Appreciation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 462–65 | doi=10.2307/2089532| jstor = 2089532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that the division of labour appears in all societies and positively correlates with societal advancement because it increases as a society progresses. Durkheim arrived at the same conclusion regarding the positive effects of the division of labour as his theoretical predecessor, [[Adam Smith]].  In ''The Wealth of the Nations'', Smith observes the division of labour results in "a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labor."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam. ''The Wealth of Nations''.  Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  While they shared this belief, Durkheim believed the division of labour applied to all "biological organisms generally" while Smith believed this law applied "only to human societies."&lt;ref name="JonesRobert"&gt;Jones, Robert. ''Emile Durkheim: An Introduction to Four Major Works.'' Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications, Inc., 1986. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  This difference may result from the influence of [[Charles Darwin]]’s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' on Durkheim’s writings.&lt;ref name="JonesRobert" /&gt;  For example, Durkheim observed an apparent relationship between "the functional specialization of the parts of an organism" and "the extent of that organism's evolutionary development," which he believed "extended the scope of the division of labour so as to make its origins contemporaneous with the origins of life itself…implying that its conditions must be found in the essential properties of all organized matter."&lt;ref name="JonesRobert" /&gt;

Since Durkheim’s division of labour applied to all organisms, he considered it a "[[natural law]]"&lt;ref name="JonesRobert" /&gt; and worked to determine whether it should be embraced or resisted by first analysing its functions.  Durkheim hypothesized that the division of labour fosters [[social solidarity]], yielding "a wholly moral phenomenon" that ensures "mutual relationships" among individuals.&lt;ref name="DurkheimEmile"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. ''The Division of Labor in Society.''  New York: The Free Press, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As social solidarity cannot be directly quantified, Durkheim indirectly studies solidarity by "classify[ing] the different types of law to find...the different types of social solidarity which correspond to it."&lt;ref name="DurkheimEmile" /&gt; Durkheim categorizes: criminal laws and their respective punishments as promoting [[mechanical solidarity]], a sense of unity resulting from individuals engaging in similar work who hold shared backgrounds, traditions, and values;&lt;ref name="AndersonMargaret"&gt;Anderson, Margaret L. and Taylor, Howard F. ''Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society.'' Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and civil laws as promoting organic solidarity, a society in which individuals engage in different kinds of work that benefit society and other individuals.&lt;ref name="AndersonMargaret" /&gt;  Durkheim believes that [[organic solidarity]] prevails in more advanced societies, while mechanical solidarity typifies less developed societies.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, James.  ''Sociology 138: Theory and Society.'' Department of Sociology, Duke University, n.d. Web. 16 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He explains that, in societies with more mechanical solidarity, the diversity and division of labour is much less, so individuals have a similar worldview.&lt;ref name="MertonRobert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merton | first1 = Robert K | year = 1994 | title = Durkheim's Division of Labor in Society | url = | journal = Sociological Forum | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 17–25 | doi=10.1007/bf01507702}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Durkheim opines that in societies with more organic solidarity, the diversity of occupations is greater, and individuals depend on each other more, resulting in greater benefits to society as a whole.&lt;ref name="MertonRobert" /&gt;

Durkheim’s work enabled [[social science]] to progress more efficiently "in … the understanding of human social behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alpert | first1 = Harry | year = 1959 | title = Emile Durkheim: A Perspective and Appreciation | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 462–65 | doi=10.2307/2089532| jstor = 2089532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ludwig von Mises ===
Marx's theories, including the negative claims regarding the division of labour have been criticized by the [[Austrian economists]] such as [[Ludwig von Mises]].

The main argument here is the economic gains accruing from the division of labour far outweigh the costs. It is argued that it is fully possible to achieve balanced human development within capitalism, and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] is downplayed as mere romantic fiction.

=== Friedrich A. Hayek ===
In ''[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]'', [[Friedrich A. Hayek]] states:

{{quote|The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a division of labour but also a coordinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labour on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the "state" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type.&lt;ref&gt;Editor/Trans.First Pub.

== Globalization and global division of labour ==
The issue reaches its broadest scope in the controversies about [[globalization]], which is often interpreted as a euphemism for the expansion of world trade based on [[comparative advantage]].
This would mean that countries specialize in the work they can do at the lowest relative cost measured in terms of the [[opportunity cost]] of not using resources for other work, compared to the opportunity costs experienced countries. Critics, however, allege that international specialization cannot be explained sufficiently in terms of "the work nations do best", rather this specialization is guided more by [[commerce|commercial]] criteria, which favour some countries over others.

The [[OECD]] recently advised (28 June 2005) that:

{{quote|Efficient policies to encourage employment and combat unemployment are essential if countries are to reap the full benefits of globalization and avoid a backlash against open trade... Job losses in some sectors, along with new job opportunities in other sectors, are an inevitable accompaniment of the process of globalization... The challenge is to ensure that the adjustment process involved in matching available workers with new job openings works as smoothly as possible.}}

Few studies have taken place regarding the global division of labour.  Information can be drawn from [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] and national statistical offices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In one study, [[Deon Filmer]] estimated that 2.474 billion people participated in the global non-domestic labour force in the mid-1990s. Of these,
* around 15%, or 379 million people, worked in industry,
* a third, or 800 million worked in services, and
* over 40%, or 1,074 million, in agriculture.

The majority of workers in industry and services were wage and salary earners – 58 percent of the industrial workforce and 65 percent of the services workforce. But a big portion were self-employed or involved in family labour. Filmer suggests the total of employees worldwide in the 1990s was about 880 million, compared with around a billion working on own account on the land (mainly peasants), and some 480 million working on own account in industry and services. The 2007 ILO Global Employment Trends Report indicated that services have surpassed agriculture for the first time in human history: "In 2006 the service sector’s share of global employment overtook agriculture for the first time, increasing from 39.5 per cent to 40 per cent. Agriculture decreased from 39.7 per cent to 38.7 per cent. The industry sector accounted for 21.3 per cent of total employment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILO releases Global Employment Trends 2007|publisher=ILO News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006103439/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/public/releases/yr2007/pr07_02sa.htm|archivedate=6 October 2008 |location=BANGKOK|date=25 January 2007|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/public/releases/yr2007/pr07_02sa.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern debates ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
In the modern world, those specialists most preoccupied in their work with theorizing about the division of labour are those involved in [[management]] and [[organization]]. In view of the global extremities of the division of labour, the question is often raised about what division of labour would be most ideal, beautiful, efficient and just.

Two styles of management that are seen in modern organizations are control and commitment, control being the division of labour style of the past and commitment being the style of the future. Control management is based on the principles of job specialization and the division of labour. This is the [[assembly line]] style of job specialization where employees are given a very narrow set of tasks or one specific task. Commitment division of labour is oriented on including the employee and building a level of internal commitment towards accomplishing tasks. Tasks include more responsibility and are coordinated based on expertise rather than formal position.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;McAlister-Kizzier, Donna. "Division of Labor."  Encyclopedia of Business and Finance, 2nd ed.. 2007. Encyclopedia.com. 1 Dec. 2014 http://www.encyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Job specialization is advantageous in developing employee expertise in a field and boosting organizational production. However, disadvantages of job specialization included limited employee skill, a dependence on entire department fluency, and employee discontent with repetitious tasks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

It is widely accepted that the division of labour is to a great extent inevitable, simply because no one can do all tasks at once. Labour hierarchy is a very common feature of the modern workplace structure, but of course the way these hierarchies are structured can be influenced by a variety of different factors.

Size, cost, and the development of new technology are factors that have influenced job specialization structures in the modern workplace. The cost of job specialization is what limits small organizations from dividing their labour responsibilities, but as organizations increase in size there is a correlation in the rise of division of labour. Technological developments have led to a decrease in the amount of job specialization in organizations as new technology makes it easier for fewer employees to accomplish a variety of tasks and still enhance production. New technology has also been supportive in the flow of information between departments helping to reduce the feeling of department isolation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

It is often agreed{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} that the most equitable principle in allocating people within hierarchies is that of true (or proven) competency or ability. This important concept of [[meritocracy]] could be read as an [[explanation]] or as a justification of why a division of labour is the way it is.

In general, in capitalist economies, such things are not decided consciously.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Different people try different things, and that which is most effective cost-wise (produces the most and best output with the least input) will generally be adopted.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Often techniques that work in one place or time do not work as well in another.  This does not present a problem,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} as the only requirement of a capitalist system is that you turn a profit.

==Limitations==

[[Adam Smith]] famously said in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market. This is because it is by exchange that each person can be specialized in their work and yet still have access to a wide range of goods and services. Hence, reductions in barriers to exchange lead to increases in the division of labour and so help to drive economic growth. Limitations to the division of labour have also been related to coordination and transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.1956.tb02717.x | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=ECONOMICS AND BIOLOGY: SPECIALIZATION AND SPECIATION | year=1956 | journal=Kyklos | pages=181–189 | last1 = Houthakker | first1 = H. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be motivational advantages to a reduced division of labour (which has been termed ‘[[job enlargement]]’ and '[[job enrichment]]').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/096317901167460 | volume=74 | issue=4 | title=Future work design research and practice: Towards an elaborated model of work design | year=2001 | journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology | pages=413–440 | last1 = Parker | first1 = Sharon K. | last2 = Wall | first2 = Toby D. | last3 = Cordery | first3 = John L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs that are too specialized in a narrow range of tasks are said to result in demotivation due to boredom and alienation. Hence, a [[Taylorism|Taylorist]] approach to work design contributed to worsened industrial relations.

There are also limitations to the division of labour (and the division of work) that result from work-flow variations and uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1628/093245613X13620416111326 | volume=169 | issue=2 | title=The Division of Labour under Uncertainty | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics JITE | pages=253–274 | last1 = Wadeson | first1 = Nigel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12274210], Barrera, Catherine Grace (2014). Skill, Job Design, and the Labor Market under Uncertainty. ''Doctoral dissertation, Harvard University''&lt;/ref&gt; These help to explain issues in modern work organization, such as task consolidations in [[business process reengineering]] and the use of multi-skilled work teams. For instance, one stage of a production process may temporarily work at a slower pace, forcing other stages to slow down. One answer to this is to make some portion of resources mobile between stages, so that those resources must be capable of undertaking a wider range of tasks. Another is to consolidate tasks so that they are undertaken one after another by the same workers and other resources. Stocks between stages can also help to reduce the problem to some extent but are costly and can hamper quality control. Note also that modern [[flexible manufacturing system]]s require both flexible machines and flexible workers.

In project-based work, the coordination of resources is a difficult issue for the [[project manager]] as project [[Schedule (project management)|schedules]] and resulting resource bookings are based on [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of task durations and so are subject to subsequent revisions. Again, consolidating tasks so that they are undertaken consecutively by the same resources and having resources available that can be called on at short-notice from other tasks can help to reduce such problems, though at the cost of reduced specialisation.

There are also advantages in a reduced division of labour where knowledge would otherwise have to be transferred between stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2003.07.015 | volume=161 | issue=3 | title=Activity consolidation to improve responsiveness | year=2005 | journal=European Journal of Operational Research | pages=683–703 | last1 = Rummel | first1 = Jeffrey L. | last2 = Walter | first2 = Zhiping | last3 = Dewan | first3 = Rajiv | last4 = Seidmann | first4 = Abraham}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, having a single person deal with a customer query means that only that one person has to be familiarised with the customer’s details. It is also likely to result in the query being handled faster due to the elimination of delays in passing the query between different people.

== Gendered division of labour ==

The clearest exposition of the principles of sexual division of labour across the full range of human societies can be summarized by a large number of logically complementary implicational constraints of the following form: if women of childbearing ages in a given community tend to do X (e.g., preparing soil for [[planting]]) they will also do Y (e.g., the planting) while for men the logical reversal in this example would be that if men plant they will prepare the soil. "Entailment Theory and Method: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Sexual Division of Labor"&lt;ref&gt;[http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/pub/Entail77.pdf eclectic.ss.uci.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; by White, Brudner and Burton (1977, public domain), using statistical [[entailment]] analysis, shows that tasks more frequently chosen by women in these order relations are those more convenient in relation to [[childrearing]]. This type of finding has been replicated in a variety of studies, including modern industrial economies. These entailments do not restrict how much work for any given task could be done by men (e.g., in [[cooking]]) or by women (e.g., in clearing forests) but are only least-effort or role-consistent tendencies. To the extent that women clear forests for agriculture, for example, they tend to do the entire agricultural sequence of tasks on those clearings. In theory, these types of constraints could be removed by provisions of child care, but [[ethnographic]] examples are lacking.

== Industrial organizational psychology ==
Job satisfaction has been shown to improve as an employee is given the task of a specific job. Students who have received PhDs in a chosen field later report increased satisfaction compared to their previous jobs. This can be attributed to their high levels of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Goldberg | first2 = L.

'''Edward Arthur Thompson''' (22 May 1914 &amp;ndash; 1 January 1994) was an Irish-born British [[classicist]], [[medievalist]] and [[professor]] at the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1948 to 1979. He wrote from a [[Marxist]] perspective, and argued that the [[Visigoths]] were settled in [[Aquitaine]] to counter the internal threat of the peasant [[bagaudae]].

==Biography==
Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of [[Waterford]], [[Ireland]]&lt;ref name="Markus RA"&gt;Markus, R.A. "Obituary: Professor Edward Thompson", ''The Independent'', 6 January 1994; retrieved 29 March 2009. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-edward-thompson-1398226.html&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family of both Irish and [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent.&lt;ref name="British Academy"&gt;"Edward Arthur Thompson, 1914-1994". [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928232553/http://www.proc.britac.ac.uk/tfiles/3E/111p679.pdf "Proceedings of the British Academy, 111'', pp. 679-93], ''The British Academy''; retrieved 29 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although taught to read only at the age of eight, Thompson proceeded to attend and finish at [[The High School, Dublin]], with which he maintained sufficient links to be requested by its then-headmaster, Dr. John Bennett, to send a copy of ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' when Thompson published the book in 1948.&lt;ref name="British Academy"/&gt;

Although his father worked for the administration of the [[National Health Insurance]], Edward Thompson would be the first of his family to enter university: he graduated with First Class Honours in Classics from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the arbitrary choice of his headmaster at The High School.&lt;ref name="Markus RA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Academy"/&gt;

Thompson's first appointment in [[academia]], as Lecturer in Classics, was a two-year stint at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] {{spaced ndash}}although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941.&lt;ref name="British Academy"/&gt; Already prepared to enter the [[World War II|Second World War]] with an enlistment in the [[British Army]], Thompson finally secured an appointment at the [[University of Swansea]], having learned of an opening for somebody who could teach [[Greek language|Greek]] from a friend, Swansea classicist Ben Farrington.&lt;ref name="British Academy"/&gt;

From Swansea, Thompson transferred to [[King's College, London]], teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. It was during this time that Thompson's first book, ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'', was published in Britain. He subsequently moved once more{{spaced ndash}}this time to direct the classics department at the [[University of Nottingham]], where Thompson worked from 1948-79.&lt;ref name="Markus RA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Academy"/&gt; Until his retirement in 1979, Thompson served as the first Chairman of the Editorial Board of the scholarly journal ''Nottingham Medieval Studies'', founded by [[Lewis Thorpe]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="British Academy"/&gt;

He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1964{{spaced ndash}}the first University of Nottingham academic to be so honoured.{{cn|date=December 2015}} 

Although Thompson left the staunchly pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1956, the year of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary]], Thompson's academic work continued to demonstrate a Marxist-oriented outlook on history. No longer active in political life, he continued his enthusiastic interest for politics.&lt;ref name="British Academy"/&gt; His interest in the class structure of societies, and in their material basis, continued to direct the structure of his studies.&lt;ref name="Markus RA"/&gt; Thompson died, aged 79, in [[Nottingham]].

'''Geert Ludzer Mak''' (born 4 December 1946 in [[Vlaardingen]]) is a Dutch journalist and a non-fiction writer in the field of history. His ten books about [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Europe]] have earned him great popularity. His best-known work, ''In Europe'', a combination of a travelogue through the continent of Europe and a history of the 20th century, has appeared in over a dozen languages. 

==Life==
In 1968, he was arrested for publishing a pamphlet in a student paper with the heading "Johnson oorlogsmisdadiger volgens de normen van Tokio en Neurenberg." ("[[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] war criminal according to the norms of [[Tokyo trials|Tokyo]] and [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]]."), referring to the [[Vietnam War]] that reached its peak during Johnson's presidency. Mak was accused of "insulting a friendly head of state", likely under American pressure due to the [[Cold War]]. He faced harsh sentences, including three weeks in jail, but ended up only having to pay 200 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/2099250-beledigen-staatshoofd-kostte-geert-mak-200-gulden.html Beledigen staatshoofd kostte Geert Mak 200 gulden (Dutch)], ''[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Personal life==
Mak is married to Mietsie Ruiters. He has two step-children and five grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcreader.nl/artikel/6506/we-hadden-geen-hoofdredacteur Geert Mak family life]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception of ''In Europe'' ==
''In Europe'' was the best-selling book by a Dutch author in the Netherlands in 2004, selling over 400,000 copies. The British reviews were generally enthusiastic, although for the professional historian or political scientist the book has little to offer: “''In Europe'' hardly breaks new ground historically” writes Martin Woollacott in an otherwise positive review in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mak himself sees his work as journalism. In an interview with a Dutch journalism trade-journal he says: “my approach is journalistic. My books are filled with newspaper tricks”. Historians are generally cautious when it comes to judging Mak’s work. Hermann von der Dunk, emeritus professor of history at Utrecht University says about Mak: “it is well written, and historically correct, but it is not what I would call academic history. There is no analysis of historical development”.&lt;ref&gt;''Academische Boekengids'', March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A 35-part VPRO television series based on ''[[In Europa (series)|In Europe]]'' prompted some historians to point to errors and comment that the makers were ill-informed about current debates in the field of history.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/7005/hoe-konden-de-mensen-toch-zo-stom-zijn.html Historisch Nieuwsblad]'', December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordan of Giano''' ({{lang-la|Iordanus de Iano}}; 1195 &amp;ndash; after 1262) was an Italian [[Minorite]] from [[Giano dell'Umbria|Giano]] in the [[Spoleto|Valley of Spoleto]].  

Jordanus joined the [[Franciscans]] around 1220. A few years later he was sent to [[Germany]] with a group under Caesarius of Speyer, the first Franciscan provincial of Germany. He was ordained in 1223, and became the guardian at [[Mainz]] and the custos of the Franciscan houses in [[Thuringia]] in 1225. In 1230 and again in 1238, he returned to [[Italy]] on business relating to his order. 

He attended a chapter of German Franciscans held at [[Halberstadt]] in 1262. There he dictated the early memoirs of the Franciscans in Germany (''De primitivorum Fratrum in Theutoniam missorum et conversatione et vita'') to a Brother Baldwin of [[Brandenburg]]. The memoirs begin in the year 1207 and are one of the chief sources for Franciscan history in Germany. The only extant manuscript breaks off abruptly at the year 1238.

He has become best known for his [[science fiction]], including his 1936 novel ''[[War with the Newts]]'' and 1920 play ''[[R.U.R.]]'' (''Rossum's Universal Robots''), which introduced the word ''[[robot]]''.&lt;ref name="ort"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ort |first= Thomas |title= Art and Life in Modernist Prague: Karel Capek and His Generation, 1911-1938 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |date= 2013 |isbn= 978-1-349-29532-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: robot n2&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote many politically charged works dealing with the social turmoil of his time.

[[Image:Capkuv dum.jpg|left|thumb|House of Čapek brothers in Prague 10, Vinohrady]]

=== Early life and education ===
Karel Čapek was born in 1890 in the [[Bohemia]]n mountain village of [[Malé Svatoňovice]]. However, six months after his birth, the Čapek family moved to their own house in [[Úpice]].{{sfn|Ort|2013|p=17}} His father, Antonín Čapek, worked as a doctor at the local textile factory.&lt;ref name="oregon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~russial/cyberj/prism/people/jagernauth/capekwork.html |title=Life of Karel Čapek |publisher=Prism: UO Stories, University of Oregon |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonín was a very energetic person; apart from his work as a doctor, he also co-funded the local museum and was a member of the town council.&lt;ref name="zena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zena-in.cz/clanek/bozena-capkova-sberatelka-maminka-slavnych-potomku |title=Božena Čapková, sběratelka, maminka slavných potomků |language=czech |publisher=ŽENA-IN.cz |author=Jana Ládyová |date=23 June 2016 |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opposing his father's [[Materialism|materialist]] and [[Positivism|positivist]] views, Karel Čapek loved and admired his father, later calling him “a good example... of the generation of [[Czech national revival|national awakeners]].”{{sfn|Ort|2013|p=19}} Karel's mother, Božena Čapková, was a homemaker.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt; Unlike her husband she did not like life in the country and she suffered from long-term depressions.&lt;ref name="zena" /&gt; Despite that, she assiduously collected and recorded local folklore, such as legends, songs or stories.{{sfn|Ort|2013|pp=17-18}} Karel was the youngest of three siblings. He would maintain an especially close relationship with his brother [[Josef Čapek|Josef]], a highly successful painter, living and working with him throughout his adult life.&lt;ref name=Klima&gt;{{cite book|last=Klíma|first=Ivan|title=Karel Čapek: Life and Work|year=2001|publisher=Catbird Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=0-945774-53-2 |pages=191–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Helena, was a talented pianist who later become a writer and published several memoirs about Karel and Josef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mestohronov.cz/osobnosti-mesta/clanek/helena-capkova |title=Helena Čapková |language=czech |publisher=Město Hronov |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing elementary school in Úpice, he moved with his grandmother to [[Hradec Králové]], where he attended high school. Two years later, he was expelled for taking part in an illegal students' club.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt; Čapek later described the club as a “very non-murderous anarchist society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Čapek |first1=Karel |last2=Čapek |first2=Josef |title=Ze společné tvorby: Krakonošova zahrada, Zářivé hlubiny a jiné prózy, Lásky hra osudná, Ze života hmyzu, Adam stvořitel |publisher=Československý spisovatel |date=1982 |chapter=Předmluva autobiografická |language=czech |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this incident he moved to [[Brno]] with his sister and attempted to finish high school there, but two years later he moved again, to [[Prague]], where he finished high school at the Academic Grammar School in 1909.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spisovatele.cz/karel-capek |title=Karel Čapek |publisher=Osobnosti.cz |language=czech |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his teenage years Čapek became enamored with the visual arts, especially [[Cubism]], which influenced his later writing.&lt;ref name="harkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harkins |first=William |editor-last=Čapek |editor-first=Karel |title=Three Novels: Hordubal, Meteor, An Ordinary Life |publisher=Catbird Press |date=1990 |chapter=Introduction |isbn=0-945774-08-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school, he studied philosophy and aesthetics in Prague at [[Charles University]], but he also spent some time at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin and at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobranova-Kuhnnova&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobranova-Kuhnnova|first=Sarka|title=Believe in People: The essential Karel Capek|year=1988|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=978-0-571-23162-1|pages=xvii&amp;nbsp;– xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was still a university student, he wrote some works on contemporary art and literature.{{sfn|Ort|2013|p=21}} He graduated with a doctorate of philosophy in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.private-prague-guide.com/article/karel-capek-josef-capek/ |title=The artistic genius of Karel and Josef Čapek |publisher=Custom Travel Services s.r.o. (Ltd) |author=Tracy A. Burns |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War I and Interwar period ===

Exempted from military service due to the spinal problems that would haunt him his whole life, Čapek observed World War I from Prague. His political views were strongly affected by the war, and as a budding journalist he began to write on topics like [[nationalism]], [[totalitarianism]] and [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name="js"&gt;[[James Sallis]], Review of '' Karel Capek: Life and Work'' by Ivan Klima. ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'', (pp. 37–40).&lt;/ref&gt; Through social circles, the young author developed close relationships with many of the political leaders of the nascent Czechoslovak state, including [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], Czechoslovak patriot and the first [[President of Czechoslovakia]], and his son [[Jan Masaryk|Jan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liehm |first=Antonín J. |title=Closely Watched Films: The Czechoslovak Experience |publisher=Routledge |date=2016 |isbn=978-1138658059}} (p. 56)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsome"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newsome |first=Geoffrey |editor-last=Čapek |editor-first=Karel |title=Letters from England |publisher=Continuum |date=2001 |chapter=Introduction |isbn=0 8264 8485 9}} (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; who would later become foreign secretary. T. G. Masaryk was a regular guest at Čapek's "[[Friday Men]]" [[Garden party|garden parties]] for leading Czech intellectuals. Čapek was also a member of Masaryk's ''[[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]]'' political network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejinyasoucasnost.cz/archiv/2007/1/t-g-masaryk-zrozen-k-mytu-/ |title=T. G. Masaryk: zrozen k mýtu |author=Šedivý, Ivan |publisher=Dějiny a současnost |language=czech |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their frequent conversations on various topics later served as the basis for Čapek's ''Talks with T. G. Masaryk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{google books|e-udK8SWIQEC|Talks with T. G. Masaryk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Vysehrad_Nahrobek_Karla_Capka_a_Olgy_Scheinpflugove.jpg|right|thumb|Tomb of Karel Čapek and Olga Scheinpflugová at Vyšehrad cemetery]]
Čapek began his writing career as a journalist. With his brother Josef, he worked as an editor for the Czech paper ''[[Národní listy]]'' ''(The National Newspaper)'' from October 1917 to April 1921.&lt;ref name="pamatnik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capek-karel-pamatnik.cz/EN/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=200086&amp;id=1012 |title=The Life of Karel Čapek |publisher=Památník Karla Čapka |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving, he and Josef joined the staff of ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' ''(The People's Paper)'' in April 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Sarka Tobrmanova-Kuhnova, "Introduction," to Karel Čapek, "Believe in People: the essential Karel Čapek."London, Faber and Faber 2010, 2010, {{ISBN|9780571231621}} (p.xxiv-xxv).&lt;/ref&gt;

Čapek's early attempts at fiction were short stories and plays for the most part written with his brother [[Josef Čapek|Josef]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aktualne.cz/wiki/osobnosti/zaslouzili-umelci/josef-capek/r~0fccd4cceffd11e3b78f0025900fea04/ |title=Josef Čapek |publisher=aktualne.cz |language=czech |date=9 June 2014 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechs/karel-capek |title=Karel Čapek |publisher=Český rozhlas |date=12 January 2000 |author=Nick Carey |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čapek's first international success was ''[[R.U.R.]]'', a dystopian work about a bad day at a factory populated with [[sentient]] [[android (robot)|androids]]. The play was translated into English in 1922, and was being performed in the UK and America by 1923. Throughout the 1920s, Čapek worked in many writing genres, producing both fiction and non-fiction, but worked primarily as a journalist.&lt;ref name="js" /&gt; In the 1930s, Čapek's work focused on the threat of brutal [[national socialist]] and fascist dictatorships; by the mid-1930s, Čapek had become "an outspoken anti-fascist".&lt;ref name="js" /&gt; He also became a member of [[International PEN]] and established, and was the first president of, the Czechoslovak PEN Club.&lt;ref name="sayer" /&gt;

=== Late life and death ===

In 1935 Karel Čapek married actress [[Olga Scheinpflugová]], after a long acquaintance.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt;{{sfn|Klíma|2001|pp=200-206}} In 1938 it became clear that the Western allies, namely [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], would fail to fulfil the pre-war agreements, and they [[Western betrayal|refused to defend]] Czechoslovakia against [[Nazi Germany]]. Although offered the chance to go to exile in England, Čapek refused to leave his country&amp;nbsp;– even though the Nazi [[Gestapo]] had named him "public enemy number two".&lt;ref name="mailbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/mailbox/mailbox-2012-03-03 |title=Radio Prague - Mailbox |publisher=Český rozhlas |date=3 March 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While repairing flood damage to his family's summer house in [[Stará Huť]], he contracted a common cold.&lt;ref name="pamatnik" /&gt; As he had suffered all his life from [[spondyloarthritis]] and was also a heavy smoker, Karel Čapek died of [[pneumonia]], on 25 December 1938.&lt;ref name="radio" /&gt;

Surprisingly, the Gestapo was not aware of his death. Several months later, just after the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German invasion of Czechoslovakia]], Nazi agents came to the Čapek family house in Prague to arrest him.&lt;ref name="ct24" /&gt; Upon discovering that he had already been dead for some time, they arrested and interrogated his wife Olga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spisovatele.cz/karel-capek |title=Olga Scheinpflugová |publisher=Osobnosti.cz |language=czech |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Josef was arrested in September and eventually died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]], "Introduction", to  ''RUR &amp; War with the Newts''. London, Gollancz, 2011, {{ISBN|0575099453}} (p.vi).&lt;/ref&gt; Karel Čapek and his wife are buried at the [[Vyšehrad cemetery]] in Prague.

Karel Čapek wrote with intelligence and humor on a wide variety of subjects. His works are known for their interesting and precise description of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/16 |title=Karel Čapek - pragmatista a ironik |publisher=Slovo a smysl (Word &amp; Sense) |language=czech |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čapek is renowned for his excellent work with the [[Czech language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jedlička |first=Alois |date=1991 |title=Jazykové a jazykovědné zájmy Karla Čapka |url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?lang=en&amp;art=6978 |journal=Naše řeč |publisher=Czech Academy of Sciences |language=czech |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=6–15 |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aktualne.cz/wiki/osobnosti/zaslouzili-umelci/karel-capek/r~e6f033fac0f411e3a1ef002590604f2e/ |title=Karel Čapek |publisher=aktualne.cz |language=czech |date=10 April 2014 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known as a [[science fiction author]], who wrote before science fiction became widely recognized as a separate genre. Many of his works also discuss ethical aspects of industrial inventions and processes already anticipated in the first half of the 20th century. These include [[mass production]], [[nuclear weapon]]s and intelligent artificial beings such as robots or androids. His most productive years were during [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|The First Republic of Czechoslovakia]] (1918–1938).

Čapek also expressed fear of social disasters, dictatorship, violence, human stupidity, the unlimited power of corporations, and greed.  Čapek tried to find hope, and the way out.

From the 1930s onward, Čapek's work became increasingly [[anti-fascist]], [[anti-militarist]], and critical of what he saw as "irrationalism".&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;[[Darko Suvin]], "Capek, Karel" in
''[[Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers]]'' by Curtis C. Smith. St. James Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-912289-27-9}} (p.842-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Klíma]], in his biography of Čapek, notes his influence on modern Czech literature, as well as on the development of Czech as a written language. Čapek, along with contemporaries like [[Jaroslav Hašek]], spawned part of the early 20th-century revival in written Czech thanks to their decision to use the vernacular. Klíma writes, "It is thanks to Čapek that the written Czech language grew closer to the language people actually spoke".&lt;ref name=Klima /&gt;  Čapek was also a translator, and his translations of French poetry into the language inspired a new generation of Czech poets.&lt;ref name=Klima /&gt;

His other books and plays include [[Detective fiction|detective stories]], novels, [[fairy tale]]s and [[Play (theatre)|theatre plays]], and even a book on gardening.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gardener's Year'', illustrated by Josef Čapek. First published in Prague, 1929. English edition London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; His most important works attempt to resolve problems of [[epistemology]], to answer the question: "What is knowledge?" Examples include ''Tales from Two Pockets'', and the first book of the trilogy of novels ''[[Hordubal]],'' ''Meteor,'' and ''An Ordinary Life.'' He also co-wrote (with his brother Josef) the libretto for [[Zdeněk Folprecht (composer)|Zdeněk Folprecht]]'s opera ''Lásky hra osudná'' in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;"Karel Čapek". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''. 2nd edition, Oxford, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, Čapek's work was only reluctantly accepted by the communist government of Czechoslovakia, because during his life he had refused to accept communism as a viable alternative. He was the first in a series of influential non-Marxist intellectuals who wrote a newspaper essay in a series called "Why I am not a Communist".&lt;ref&gt;K. Čapek, [http://capek.misto.cz/english/communist.html ''Why I am not a Communist?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105062749/http://capek.misto.cz/english/communist.html |date=January 5, 2010 }} [[Přítomnost]] December 4, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 (70 years after his death), a book was published containing extensive correspondence by Karel Čapek, in which the writer discusses the subjects of [[pacifism]] and his [[Conscientious Objectors|conscientious objection]] to military service with lawyer Jindřich Groag from [[Brno]]. Until then, only a portion of these letters were known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nakladatelstvi-nzb.abchistory.cz/index.html?pod=/_0002-vojaku-vladimire----karel-capek--jindrich-groag-a-odpiraci-vojenske-sluzby.htm ''„Vojáku Vladimíre...“: Karel Čapek, Jindřich Groag a odpírači vojenské služby''], Nakladatelství Zdeněk Bauer, Prague 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Miller]] wrote in 1990: &lt;blockquote&gt;I read Karel Čapek for the first time when I was a college student long
ago in the Thirties. There was no writer like him...prophetic assurance mixed with surrealistic humour and hard-edged social satire: a unique combination...he is a joy to read.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Arthur. "Foreword" to ''Toward the Radical Center: A Karel Capek Reader'',
edited by Peter Kussi.Catbird Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0945774079}} .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Etymology of ''robot'' ==
[[Image:R.U.R._by_Karel_%C4%8Capek_1939.jpg|right|thumb|R.U.R. theatrical poster, 1939]]
Karel Čapek introduced and made popular the frequently used international word ''[[robot]]'', which first appeared in his play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R.U.R.]]'' in 1920. While it is frequently thought that he was the originator of the word, he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' [[etymology]] in which he named his brother, painter and writer [[Josef Čapek]], as its actual inventor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html Karel Capek&amp;nbsp;– Who did actually invent the word "robot" and what does it mean?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204135259/http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html |date=February 4, 2012 }} at capek.misto.cz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan Margolius]],'The Robot of Prague',  Newsletter, The Friends of Czech Heritage  no. 17, Autumn 2017, pp. 3 - 6.  https://czechfriends.net/images/RobotsMargoliusJul2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the Czech journal ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' in 1933, he also explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures ''laboři'' (from Latin ''labor'', work). However, he did not like the word, seeing it as too artificial, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested ''roboti'' (''robots'' in English).

The word ''robot'' comes from the word ''robota''. The word robota means literally "[[corvée]]", "serf labor", and figuratively "drudgery" or "hard work" in Czech. It also means "work", "labor" in Slovak, archaic Czech, and many other Slavic languages (e.g., Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Polish, Macedonian, Ukrainian, etc.). It derives from the reconstructed [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] word [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/robota|*robota]], meaning "(slave) work." (cf. the German word for work, ''Arbeit''.)

==Awards and honors==
The asteroid [[1931 Čapek]], discovered by [[Luboš Kohoutek]] was named after him.&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;{{cite book |title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names – (1931) Čapek  |last  = Schmadel | first = Lutz |publisher  = [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]  |page  = 155  |date  = 2007 |url    = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_1932 |isbn  = 978-3-540-00238-3|accessdate = 5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*National Famine Monument, Murrisk, Westport, Co Mayo
::This stark and striking monument in Murrisk is an appropriate commemoration of the millions who perished in the Great Famine over one hundred and fifty years ago. Crafted in bronze by John Behan, the dramatic sculpture depicts a "Coffin Ship" with skeleton bodies in the rigging. "Coffin Ship" was the term used to describe the ships which left our shores horrendously overcrowded with emigrants fleeing the famine. The dire and unhygienic conditions on board ensured that many did not reach their destination.

::The National Famine Monument was unveiled in 1997 by President Mary Robinson. Located directly opposite the carpark at the foot of Croagh Patrick, it commands panoramic views over the drumlin landscape of Clew Bay.

Many died despite the help they received within the city, some 7000 in the city perished within one year.The Memorial was funded by public subscription, with many small donations from local communities, contributions from the British and Irish governments, each of the Merseyside local councils, Dublin and Dun Laoghaire councils and many others. The sculpture was created by Eamonn O'Docherty. The Liverpool Great Hunger Commemoration Committee also erected ten plaques around the city, including one on the gates to Clarence Dock. Unveiled in 2000, the plaque inscription reads in Irish and English: "Through these gates passed most of the 1,300,000 Irish migrants who fled from the Great Famine and 'took the ship' to Liverpool in the years 1845–52" The Maritime Museum, [[Albert Dock]], Liverpool has an exhibition regarding the Irish Migration, showing models of ships, documentation and other facts on Liverpool's history.

The '''Loughgall Ambush''' took place on 8 May 1987 at the village of [[Loughgall]], [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. An eight-man [[Active Service Unit|unit]] of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) launched an attack on the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) station in the village. Having driven a stolen [[Backhoe loader|digger]] with a bomb placed in its bucket through the perimeter fence, they attacked the building with automatic rifles, the bomb exploding, badly damaging the police station. Soldiers from the [[British Army]]'s [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), who had been lying in wait at the scene, then returned fire both from within the station and from concealed positions around it in a pre-planned and co-ordinated [[ambush]], killing all of the IRA attackers,&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt; two of whom  were subsequently found in the police investigation of the incident to have been unarmed when they were killed.&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Patfinucane"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loughgall — a Search for the Truth|url=http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/state-violence/loughgall-search-truth|website=Pat Finucane Centre|publisher=Loughgall Truth &amp; Justice Campaign|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An innocent civilian was also killed by the SAS engaging unit after unwittingly driving into the midst of the [[melee]], and being mistakenly identified by it as part of the IRA's attacking force.&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt;

==Background and preparations==
The IRA's [[Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade|East Tyrone Brigade]] was active mainly in eastern [[County Tyrone]] and neighbouring parts of [[County Armagh]]. By the mid-1980s it had become one of the IRA's most aggressive formations. Members of the unit, such as [[Jim Lynagh]] and [[Pádraig McKearney]], advocated a strategy of destroying bases and preventing them being rebuilt or repaired in an attempt to "deny ground" to British forces.&lt;ref name=mcdonald&gt;{{cite news | title = True tale of IRA 'martyrs' revealed | author = | url = https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,801151,00.html | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = 29 September 2002 | accessdate =19 September 2007 | location=London | first=Henry | last=McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rough&gt;Taylor, Peter.

In the attack at The Birches, they had breached the base's perimeter fence with a digger that had a bomb in its bucket.&lt;ref name=rough/&gt; It was planned to use the same tactic in an attack on the lightly-manned Loughgall Royal Ulster Constabulary station.&lt;ref name=rough/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Big Boys' Rules'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British security forces however had received detailed intelligence information about the IRA's plans.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; It is believed that this was obtained by RUC Special Branch and the British Army's [[Special Reconnaissance Unit]] (SRU).&lt;ref name=rough/&gt; It has been alleged that the security forces had a [[double agent]] inside the IRA unit, and that he was killed by the SAS in the ambush.&lt;ref name=tout&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Taylor (Journalist) | title = Provos – The IRA &amp; Sinn Féin | publisher = [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] | year = 1997 | page = 276 | doi =  | isbn = 0-7475-3818-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim that the security forces had instead learned of the ambush through other surveillance methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Holland | first = Jack | title = Hope against History | publisher = Henry Holt | year = 1999 | page = 143|isbn= 0-8050-6087-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Terrorism: Inside A World Phenomenon'', Barry Davies states that the date and time of the attack was eventually confirmed by a [[Telephone tapping|telephone tap]].&lt;ref name="davies203"&gt;{{cite book|last1=davies|first1=Barry|title=Terrorism : inside a world phenomenon|date=2005|publisher=Virgin Books|location=London|isbn=0753510766|pages=203|edition=[New ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian and former Professor of Politics at [[Queen's University Belfast]] [[Richard English]], information of the attack had not come from within the unit. Though Tony Gormely was known as a well-paid [[RUC Special Branch|Special Branch]] informant.&lt;ref&gt;English, Richard, ''Armed Struggle, the History of the IRA'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-517753-4}} Page 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Three local RUC officers worked at the station; which was only open part-time in twice daily intervals of two hours (09:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and 05:00 PM to 07:00 PM). One of the officers was to carry on the normal running of the station assisted by the other two.&lt;ref name="Newsletternov16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt; Whilst six SAS soldiers in plain clothes, including the commander, were positioned inside.&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt; Another eighteen SAS soldiers in uniform were hidden in wooded areas in five locations around the station.&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt;

The IRA's attack involved two teams. One team would drive a digger with a bomb in its bucket through the base's perimeter fence and light the fuse. At the same time, another team would arrive in a van and open fire on the base,&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; with the aim of killing the three police officers as they came off duty.&lt;ref name="irishnews-may17"&gt;Young, Connla. [http://www.irishnews.com/news/2017/05/08/news/ira-man-tells-the-inside-story-of-the-loughgall-attack-and-the-sas-ambush-1019349/ "IRA man tells the inside story of the Loughgall attack and the SAS ambush"]. ''[[Irish News]]''. 8 May 2017. Retrieved 8 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams would then leave the area in the van.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; To avoid security checkpoints, the bomb was ferried by boat across [[Lough Neagh]], from [[Ardboe]] to [[Maghery]].&lt;ref name="bomb-boat"&gt;Young, Connla. [http://www.irishnews.com/news/2017/05/08/news/loughgall-bomb-was-transported-by-boat-1019351/ "Loughgall bomb was transported by boat"]. ''[[Irish News]]''. 8 May 2017. Retrieved 8 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The van and digger that would be used were hijacked in the hours leading up to the attack.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; The van, a blue [[Toyota HiAce]], was stolen by masked men from a business in [[Dungannon]]. At about the same time, the unit's commander James Lynagh was spotted in the town, suggesting the van might be used in the attack.&lt;ref name="davies203"/&gt; The digger (a [[backhoe loader]]) was taken from a farm at Lislasly Road, about two miles west of Loughgall. Two IRA members stayed at the farm to stop the owners raising the alarm. [[Declan Arthurs]] drove the digger, while two others drove ahead of him in a scout car. The rest of the unit travelled in the van from another location, presumably also with a scout car.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; When a covert observation post monitoring the digger reported that it was being moved, the SAS took up its positions.&lt;ref name="davies203"/&gt;

==Ambush==
The IRA unit arrived in Loughgall from the north-east shortly after 7&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; when the station was scheduled to close for the night. All were armed, masked with [[balaclava (clothing)|balaclavas]], and wearing [[boilersuits]], [[medical gloves|surgical gloves]] and socks over their footwear with the intent of limiting [[forensic]] evidence of their presence at the scene. Some of the attackers were also wearing bullet-proof vests.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; The digger drove past the police station, turned around and drove back again with the Toyota van carrying the main IRA assault party doing the same, in anticipation of the lightly-manned station's staff coming out of the building around that time to go home, thereby presenting themselves as more vulnerable targets.&lt;ref name="provos273"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Peter|title=Provos : the IRA and Sinn Fein|date=1998|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747538189|page=273|edition=Rev. and updated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not seeing any activity in the station in their two slow passes of it, members of the IRA unit felt that something was amiss,&lt;ref name="provos273"/&gt; and debated whether to continue, but decided to go ahead with the attack.&lt;ref name="irishnews-may17"/&gt; Tony Gormley and Gerard O'Callaghan got out of the van and joined Declan Arthurs on the digger, according to journalist [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], "literally riding shotgun", with weapons in one hand and a lighter in the other.&lt;ref name="provos273"/&gt; At about 7:15 Arthurs drove the digger towards the station.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; In the front bucket was 200–400 lb&lt;ref name="bomb-boat"/&gt; of [[semtex]] inside an oil drum, partially hidden by rubble and wired to two 40-second fuses.&lt;ref name="davies203"/&gt; The other five members of the unit followed in the van with Eugene Kelly driving, unit commander Patrick Kelly in the passenger seat whilst in the rear were Lynagh, Pádraig McKearney, and Seamus Donnelly.&lt;ref name="provos273"/&gt; The digger crashed through the light security fence and the fuses were lit. The van stopped a short distance ahead and — according to the British security forces — three of the team jumped out and opened fire at the police station with automatic weapons.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Author Raymond Murray disputes this.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt;  According to Taylor, and co-corroborated by the ECHR report, Patrick Kelly jumped from the passenger seat and, followed by others, immediately opened fire on the building, either to encourage the rest to resolve the dispute about going ahead with the attack, or possibly because this was the way previous attacks had begun.&lt;ref name="provos273"/&gt; At the same time, the bomb detonated, the blast destroying the digger and badly damaging the building, injuring three members of the security forces within.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Graham and Smyth, Jim (2000). ''The Crowned Harp: Policing Northern Ireland''. Contemporary Irish Studies. Pluto Press, p. 122. {{ISBN|0-7453-1393-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within seconds the SAS opened fire on the IRA attackers from the station and from hidden positions outside with [[M16 rifle|M16]] and [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|H&amp;K G3]] rifles and two [[FN MAG|L7A2]] [[general-purpose machine gun]]s.&lt;ref name="irishnews-may17" /&gt; 600 spent British cartridge cases from the scene were recovered, with approximately 125 bullet holes in the bodywork of the van.&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt; 78 spent cartridge cases were recovered that were fired from IRA weapons.&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt; All eight IRA members were killed in the hail of gunfire; all had multiple wounds to their bodies, including their heads.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | title = IRA deaths: The four shootings | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1312421.stm | publisher = ''BBC'' | date = 4 May 2001 | accessdate =11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declan Arthurs was shot in a lane-way opposite Loughgall Football Club premises, without a firearm in the direct vicinity, holding a cigarette lighter closed in his right hand.&lt;ref name="Patfinucane" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt; It has been alleged by [[Tim Pat Coogan]] that three of the wounded IRA members were shot dead as they lay on the ground after surrendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coogan | first = Tim Pat | authorlink = Tim Pat Coogan | title = The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal 1966–1995 and the Search for Peace | publisher = [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] | year = 1995 | page = 290 | doi =  | isbn = 0-09-179146-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other IRA members in the scout cars escaped from the scene, managing to pass through British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary check-points set up in the vicinity immediately after the ambush had been sprung.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt;&lt;ref name="irishnews-may17"/&gt;

Two innocent civilians travelling in a car which happened to drive into the scene of the ambush whilst it was underway were also opened fire upon by the British forces. The two brothers, Anthony and Oliver Hughes, were driving home in a white Citroen GS Special car after repairing a lorry with Oliver wearing overalls similar in appearance to those being worn by the IRA unit.&lt;ref name="Patfinucane" /&gt; About 130 yards from the police station, British soldiers opened fire on their car from behind, killing Anthony (driving) and badly wounding Oliver.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; The Citroen had approximately 34 bullet holes.&lt;ref name="ECHR2001" /&gt; The villagers had not been told of the operation and no attempt had been made to evacuate anyone or to seal off the ambush zone, as this might have alerted the IRA to the ambush's presence.&lt;ref name=mackenzie/&gt; Anthony's widow was later compensated by the British Government for the death of her husband.&lt;ref name=murray/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter (1997). ''Provos: The IRA and Sinn Féin''. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The security forces recovered eight IRA firearms from the scene: three H&amp;K G3 rifles, one [[FN FAL]] rifle, two [[FN FNC]] rifles, a [[Spas-12|Franchi SPAS-12]]T [[shotgun]] and a [[Ruger Security-Six]] [[revolver]]. The Royal Ulster Constabulary subsequently linked the weapons to seven known murders and twelve attempted murders in the Mid-Ulster region.&lt;ref name=obrien_1995_p141/&gt; The Ruger had been stolen from Reserve RUC officer William Clement, killed two years earlier in the attack on Ballygawley police station by the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Urban | first = Mark | authorlink = | title = Big Boys' Rules | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | year = 1992 | page = 229 | doi =  | isbn = 0-571-16809-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that another of the guns had been used in the murder of Harold Henry, a builder who was employed by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary in facilities construction in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, Kevin (1995).

==Aftermath==
The East Tyrone Brigade continued to be active until the last Provisional IRA ceasefire ten years later. SAS operations against the IRA also continued. The IRA set out to find the informer it believed to be among them, although it has been suggested that the informer, if there ever was one, had been killed in the ambush.&lt;ref name=tout/&gt; The Loughgall police station was attacked again on 5 September 1990, when the blast from a van bomb badly damaged it, wounding in the process seven constables.&lt;ref name="Reuters, 5 September 1990"&gt;Reuters, 5 September 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters, 5 September 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/heathwood/static/1990.html CAIN – Listing of Programmes for the Year: 1990-BBC news, 5 September 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA unit destroyed in the ambush became known as the "Loughgall Martyrs" among IRA supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, Kevin (2008). ''The New Politics of Sinn Féin''. Liverpool University Press, p. 1. {{ISBN|1-84631-144-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The men's relatives considered their deaths to be part of a deliberate [[Shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland|shoot-to-kill policy]] by the security forces in the province. Thousands of people attended their funerals, the biggest republican funerals in Northern Ireland since those of the IRA hunger strikers of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret History of the IRA'', Ed Moloney, 2002, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Adams]], in his graveside oration, gave a speech stating the British Government understood that it could buy off the government of the [[Republic of Ireland]], which he described as the "shoneen clan" (pro-British), but added "it does not understand the Jim Lynaghs, the Pádraig McKearneys or the [[Séamus McElwaine]]s. It thinks it can defeat them. It never will."&lt;ref&gt;''Secret History of the IRA'', Ed Moloney, 2002, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the ambush the Provisional IRA released a statement saying: "[[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteers]] who shot their way out of the ambush and escaped saw other volunteers being shot on the ground after being captured".&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/CQ/vol010_3summer1990/wright.pdf PIRA Propaganda:The Construction of Legitimacy, by Joanne Wright]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that ten IRA men, including the eight killed at Loughgall, had their human rights violated by the failure of the British Government to conduct a proper investigation into their deaths.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The court did not make any finding that these deaths amounted to unlawful killing.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | title = UK condemned over IRA deaths | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1311724.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 4 May 2001 | accessdate =28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Northern Ireland's [[Historical Enquiries Team]] found that not only did the IRA team fire first but that they could not have been safely arrested. They concluded that the British Army was justified in opening fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/shot-ira-unit-fired-first-at-sas-28689002.html |title=Shot IRA unit 'fired first at SAS' |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loughgall police station was re-built and was in use until its administrative closure in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psni.police.uk/property_sold.pdf  Property Sold by the PSNI in the Last Ten Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217073954/http://www.psni.police.uk/property_sold.pdf |date=17 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 it was sold for private development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PROVO+MASSACRE+PSNI+STATION+SOLD%3B+Scene+of+11+killings+set+to+be+used...-a0254788849 Provo Massacre PSNI Station Sold; Scene of 11 killings set to be used for housing] [[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]], 27 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Loughgall Ambush'' is the name of a republican ballad specifically about the attack, recorded by [[Charlie and the Bhoys]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlyrics.org/charlie-and-the-bhoys/lyric/loughgall-ambush/258267.html Song details]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3918">{{Ottoman Turkish name|Mustafa Naima}}
'''Mustafa Naima''' ({{lang-ota|مصطفى نعيما}}; ''Muṣṭafā Na'īmā''; 1655 &amp;ndash; 1716) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] bureaucrat and historian who wrote the chronicle known as the ''Tārīḫ-i Na'īmā'' (''Naima's History''). He is often considered to be the first official historian of the [[Ottoman Empire]], although this formal office was probably not created until the time of his successor, Rashid.

==Life and career==
'''Mustafā Na'īm''' was born the son of a [[Janissary]] in [[Aleppo]], [[Ottoman Syria]]. He joined the [[Baltadji|palace guard]] in Constantinople and was educated as a secretary there. He rose in the financial administration of the empire until the palace intrigues caused him to be sent to a provincial administrative post in 1715.

As a historian Naima mentions the arrival of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ambassadors: Qaim Beg, Sayyid Ataullah and Hajji Ahmad Saeed, sent by the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]]. The ambassadors lodged in the [[Seraglio]] of Saiwush Pasha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ|title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political &amp; diplomatic relations between Mughal India and the Ottoman Empire, 1556-1748|last=Farooqi|first=Naimur Rahman|date=1989-01-01|publisher=Idarah-i Adabiyat-i Delli|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Patras]].

==Works==
Na'īmā's main work is the ''Ravżatu'l-Ḥüseyn fī ḫulāṣati aḫbāri'l-ḫāfiḳeyn'' (روضة الحسين فى خلاصة أخبار الخافقين in Ottoman; literally: "The Garden of Hüseyin in the Summary of the Chronicles of East and West"). This work was finished in 1704 and dedicated to the [[vizier]] Amcazade Hüseyin Paşa.  The book covers the events of the years from 1591 to 1660.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17639">An '''online interview''' is an [[online research method]] conducted using [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Qualitative Online Interviews: Strategies, Design, and Skills.|last=Salmons|first=J.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as instant messaging, email, or video. Online interviews require different ethical considerations, sampling and rapport than practices found in traditional face-to-face (F2F) [[interviews]]. Online interviews are separated into [[Synchronization|synchronous]] online interviews, for example via [[online chat]] which happen in  'real time' online&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/the-sage-handbook-of-online-research-methods/n15.xml|title=Internet-based Interviewing : SAGE Research Methods|website=srmo.sagepub.com|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asynchronous communication#Electronically mediated communication|asynchronous online]] interviews, for example via [[email]] conducted in non-real time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some authors discuss online interviews in relation to [[online focus groups]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stromer" /&gt; whereas others look at online interviews as separate research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Kate|last2=Williams|first2=Matthew|date=2005-11-01|title=Researching online populations: the use of online focus groups for social research|url=http://qrj.sagepub.com/content/5/4/395|journal=Qualitative Research|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=395–416|doi=10.1177/1468794105056916|issn=1468-7941}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article will only discuss online interviews.

Online interviews, like offline interviews, typically ask respondents to explain what they think or how they feel about an aspect of their social world.&lt;ref name="Lindlof"&gt;{{cite book|title=Qualitative communication research methods|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan|date=2002|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|last1=Lindlof|first1=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews are especially useful for understanding the meanings participants assign to their activities; their perspectives, motives, and experiences.&lt;ref name="Stromer"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003|title=Depth Interviews for the Study of Motives and Perceptions of Internet Use|journal=Presented at the International Communication Association Conference|location=San Diego, CA|last1=Stromer-Galley|first1=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews are also useful for eliciting the language used by group members, gathering information about processes that cannot be observed, or inquiring about the past.&lt;ref name="Lindlof" /&gt; Thus the objectives researchers have do not differ significantly, however the methods and research design can be effected by the online component of the research which this article will take issue with.

== Methodologies ==
In online interviews, data is primarily generated through conversations between a researcher and "respondent". Researchers often seek out a deliberate (or "non-random") selection of respondents, recruiting individuals who can provide insight on a particular phenomenon, situation, or practice.&lt;ref name="Lindlof" /&gt; Online Interviews can utilize a selection of formats and employ varying means of computer-mediated communication (CMC).

=== Synchronous ===
The interview is synchronous if it is conducted in real time. [[Skype]] interviews allow participants and researchers to converse in real time. Video chat is the closest a researcher will get towards resembling a face-to-face interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanna|first=Paul|date=2012-04-01|title=Using internet technologies (such as Skype) as a research medium: a research note|url=http://qrj.sagepub.com/content/12/2/239|journal=Qualitative Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=239–242|doi=10.1177/1468794111426607|issn=1468-7941}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because it allows for facial expressions and other visual cues that are absent in textually based forms such as chatrooms.&lt;ref name="Hanna2012"&gt;{{cite journal|date=5 April 2012|title=Using internet technologies (such as Skype) as a research medium: a research note|journal=Qualitative Research|volume=12|issue=2|pages=239–242|doi=10.1177/1468794111426607|last1=Hanna|first1=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of conducting synchronous interviews online is using [[WebRTC]]. When WebRTC is used web browser (Firefox, Chrome or IE) acts as a client and both the parties can connect over a real-time video-chat.

=== Asynchronous ===
An asynchronous online interview takes place when the researcher and the participant are not online at the same time. Typically these interviews will use email but other technologies might also be employed. This can be an advantage for research conducted across time zones or with busy participants, allowing them to answer questions at their convenience.&lt;ref name="Lindlof" /&gt;  Kitvits (2005 cited in Dowling 2012) point out that asynchonous interviews are very useful for reflective process which helps to assure rigor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A concern related to the asynchronous method is the possibility of interviews gradually drying up over an extended period. While the possibility of long term "[[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]]" research is valuable, it is also risky. Completion requires high levels of participant motivation, since they have not dedicated a specific block of time.&lt;ref name="Stromer" /&gt; Additionally, asynchronous online interviews may feel less conversational and make it more difficult to ask follow-up questions. Rezabek (2000) describes this as a "lack of timeliness".&lt;ref&gt;Rezabek, Roger (2000, January). Online focus groups: Electronic discussions for research [67 paragraphs]. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research [online journal], 1(1). http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs-texte/1-00/1-00rezabek-e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structured ===
Structured interviews are guided by questions which are prepared prior to the interview.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Semi-structured ===
Semi-structured interviews balance the pre-planned questions of a structured approach with the spontaneity and flexibility of the unstructured interview.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Unstructured ===
Unstructured interviews are conversations where the researcher collects data on a broad topic, however, does have any specific questions prepared,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; allowing informants to guide the conversation by offering stories and additional insights.&lt;ref name="Lindlof" /&gt; Unstructured interviews may be especially useful when researchers are trying to understand an unfamiliar setting, a phenomenon or people's motives.&lt;ref name="Stromer" /&gt; Dowling (2012) used unstructured interviews in an asynchronous format via email.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Online versus offline ==

=== Advantages ===
There are many reasons online interviews can be an appropriate and valuable methodological tool. For example, the use of online interviews as opposed to onsite interviews provides the researcher with opportunities to:
* carry out interviews with a very geographically dispersed population.
* interview individuals or groups who are often difficult to reach, such as the less physically mobile (disabled/in prison/in hospital) or the socially isolated (drug dealers/terminally ill/ etc.) or those living in dangerous places (e.g. war zones).
* carry out interviews in a personal, yet neutral, location such as a home.&lt;ref name="Hanna2012" /&gt; Researchers and participants can be comfortable while still maintaining their personal space and, if necessary, keep their specific whereabouts private.
* reach a target audience where the audience is unknown (e.g. people who may use a certain type of technology) or would like to remain anonymous. E-mail and instant messaging interview methods have the advantage of privacy.&lt;ref name="Stromer" /&gt; Interviews that take place in public online venues (e.g. discussion boards, chatrooms) may be off-putting to some participants.&lt;ref name="illingworth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/6/2/illingworth.html|title=The Internet Matters: Exploring the Use of the Internet as a Research Tool|last=Illingworth|first=Nicola|date=31 August 2001|accessdate=11 February 2009|work=Sociological Research Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* provide savings in costs to the researcher (for example, costs associated with travel and venue hire).
* record data quickly and accurately. Video and audio interactions on Skype can be easily captured using desktop software.&lt;ref name="Hanna2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lo Iacono|first=Valeria|date=2016-05-01|title=Skype as a Tool for Qualitative Research Interviews|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/21/2/12.html|journal=Sociological Research Online|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data generated from textual forms (e.g. chatrooms, e-mail correspondence) is already transcribed. 
* reduce the environmental impact of research by eliminating the resource expenditure associated with traveling long distances.&lt;ref name="Hanna2012" /&gt;
* interview individuals who would like to stay visual anonymous and to engage in more self-disclosure or feel liberated from stereotypes that may be associated with visible identity markers such as age, race or gender.&lt;ref name="Stromer" /&gt; Because the participant cannot see the researcher, this may also help reduce issues of [[interviewer effect]].
In asynchronous interviews the extended time frame can also be a benefit allowing researchers more time to think of evocative or precise follow-up questions. Researchers can reread the chat history and use previous responses to inform the subsequent questions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/cases-in-online-interview-research/n11.xml|title=Online Asynchronous and Face-to-Face Interviewing: Comparing Methods for Exploring Women's Experiences of Breastfeeding Long Term : SAGE Research Methods|website=srmo.sagepub.com|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
There are, however, possible drawbacks to online interviews. Scholars such as Mann and Stewart (2005) have questioned how effective they are in comparison to face-to-face interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Mann and Stewart (2005)''Internet Communication and Qualitative Research: A Handbook for Researching Online'' London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; Online interviews may make it difficult to:
* establish a good rapport and level of trust between researcher and participant in a computer-mediated research relationship.
* achieve a long-term commitment to the research subject by participants, if this is necessary.
* communicate with participants with varying degrees of technical skill within a population. Participants cannot be assumed to all possess the level of technical competence required to employ the research methods.
* achieve satisfactory closure to the research relationship at the end of a long-term project.
* maintain attention, as the researcher may not have control over (or even be aware of) distractions that are interrupting the interviewee's engagement with the interview.&lt;ref name="illingworth" /&gt;
* recruit participants. In order to access specific populations, there may be a need to  'advertise' through relevant newsgroups and forums. 
Though the question-and-answer format of the interview is similar to face-to-face interviews, during text-based interviews participants and researchers are not visible to one another. This can make it difficult to assess how questions and responses are being interpreted on either side due to a lack of visual cues.&lt;ref name="Markham1998" /&gt;

Internet researcher [[Annette Markham]] (1998) observes that text-based interviewing can take much longer than face-to-face, phone or Skype interviews because typing takes longer than talking. Textual methods require users to verbalize conventional aspects of polite conversation, such as nodding or smiling, which requires added effort and time.&lt;ref name="Markham1998"&gt;{{cite book|title=Life online: researching real experience in virtual space|date=1998|publisher=Altamira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|pages=61–83|last1=Markham|first1=Annette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==
There are many ethical considerations that arise solely because the interview is conducted online. As suggested by the [[Association of Internet Researchers|Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR)]], these will vary depending on community norms, local and national codes and guidelines, and context specific considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, A., &amp; Buchanan, E. (2012). Ethical decision making and internet research: Recommendations from the AoIR Ethics Working Committee. Available from: http://aoir.org/reports/ethics2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Privacy ===
If the research was conducted the researcher should consider taking appropriate steps to protect human subjects and, where appropriate, their avatars or online representations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Consent ===
Has the researcher obtained proper informed consent? The importance of consent stays the same online. The researcher needs to obtain it so to not formally contravenes European data protection legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it can be done in different ways online. For example, a consent form could be emailed and then faxed, posted or send back via email. Another way of creating consent could be to include a tick box "I accept" to simulate a signature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Withdrawal ===
In asynchronous formats of interviews, researchers have experienced a lack of knowing if the participant has withdrawn or if the answer just took some time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In synchronous interviews a withdraw button could be added.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Netiquette ===
[[Etiquette in technology|Netiquette]], the way people expect someone to behave online, becomes important for online interviews in three ways. Firstly, silence which can be used in face-to-face interviews as a tactic to encourage someone to talk more&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making sense of teen life: Strategies for capturing ethnographic data in a networked era. In E. Hargittai &amp; C. Sandvig (Eds.), Digital Research Confidential: The Secrets of Studying Behavior Online|last=Boyd|first=Danah|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – is more ambiguous online. It could mean that the interviewer has left, is slow to answer or even withdrew from the interview.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Secondly, by selecting participants for an online interview two things should be kept in mind. On the one side, the aspect of representation should be considered as not everyone has internet or has the technical abilities to use it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, if the interviewer aims to approach candidates online in forums, the researcher should think of ways how to do it in the least disruptive way, for example asking the forum facilitator first instead of directly posting the inquiry into the forum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another important aspect is the use of emoticons. A sensitive use of emoticons is advisable to adapt the style to suit that of the interviewee.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Community interviews==
The Internet allows many people at once to directly interview persons of public interest. Voting-systems may allow communities to collectively find the questions they'd like to get answered most.

===Reddit AMAs===
{{Main article|Reddit#IAmA and AMA}}
One popular subsite of the social media and aggregation site [[reddit]], /r/IAmA, prompts its users to ask celebrities, politicians other persons of public interest questions about any topic. These interviews are called "AMAs" for "ask me anything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|title='Ask Me Anything': How a Weird Internet Thing Became a New Form of Media|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ask-me-anything-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-new-form-of-media/282860/|accessdate=January 7, 2014|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|date=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interviews, of which there are multiple everyday, often receive thousands of questions which are voted on by the community via reddit's comment-voting system with all of them being answerable by the person being interviewed. Interviewees are required to provide proof of their identity to the volunteer [[Internet forum#Moderators|moderators]] of the site and have included people such as [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barack Obama AMA|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/sort=new|publisher=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="potus-telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | title=President Obama makes online appearance on Reddit |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/9507620/President-Obama-makes-online-appearance-on-Reddit.html |accessdate=August 30, 2012 |date=August 29, 2012 |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Hadfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Hadfield AMA|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18pik4/i_am_astronaut_chris_hadfield_currently_orbiting/|publisher=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who answered questions from the [[International Space Station]]), [[Bill Gates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates AMA|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/|publisher=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Colbert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Colbert AMA|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ee20j/stephen_colbert_has_answered_your_questions/|publisher=Reddit|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Larry King]] and many more. &lt;!--todo quote etc. --&gt;

Retrieved 4 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, he added Somerset to his surname by [[deed poll]], the Fry family originating from [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]] in that county, and [[Plantagenet]] was a nickname which he adopted at university, relating to his advocacy of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]].&lt;ref name=ah/&gt;

==Early life==
Peter George Robin Fry was born in 1931, and was the third child and only son of&lt;!--Peter Kenneth Llewellyn FRY married Ruth Emily MARRIOTT (b. 29 July 1904 - d. 16 March 1978) according to rootsweb--&gt; a distinguished naval officer (created [[OBE]] in the [[1953 New Year Honours]]) and pianist.&lt;ref name=ah&gt;[http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/04050501.html ArchiveHub]. Retrieved 11 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Christ Church Cathedral School]], Oxford, then [[Lancing College]] in West Sussex, and [[St Thomas' Hospital|St. Thomas's Hospital Medical School]], London, but did not do well at either of the latter two institutions.

After failing his exams, he had to leave St. Thomas's after a year. From this point on his father refused to subsidise him any more, so Fry found employment as a librarian and projectionist with the National Film Board of Canada. In 1952 he inherited some money from his grandmother, left his job and married, against his parents' wishes, Audrey Russell whom he had known at medical school. After spending all his money, and failing another degree, Fry became a schoolteacher at Wallop School in [[Weybridge]], Surrey.&lt;ref name=ah/&gt;

In 1954, Fry began study of law and history at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;The Author's and Writer's Who's Who, Edward Martell, Burke's Peerage, Ltd, 1971, p. 740&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-plantagenet-somerset-fry-1364295.html&lt;/ref&gt; Needing more money, he twice took part in the television game show ''[[Double Your Money]]'', and won the jackpot of £512,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; making him something of a celebrity, and had his first book, ''Mysteries of History'', published, soon followed by a biography of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. This was the start of a successful writing career, and over the years he wrote numerous popular books about history for adults and for children, as well as books about antiques. He started the Council for Independent Archaeology.&lt;ref name=cix/&gt; Fry was a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts|Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts]].&lt;ref name="The Author's 1971, pg 740"/&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, Fry worked as a public relations executive and, amongst other roles, served as an information officer for the [[Chartered Association of Building Engineers|Association of Architects and Surveyors]] and for the [[Ministry of Public Building and Works]].&lt;ref name="The Author's 1971, pg 740"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Although Fry's professional life was successful, his personal life was unhappy. His first marriage to Audrey Russell was dissolved in 1957.

The following year he married Daphne Elizabeth Caroline, daughter of Major (Hon. Lt-Col) Frederick Reginald Yorke, of a Yorkshire landed gentry family.&lt;ref name="The Author's 1971, pg 740"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, Burke's Peerage, 1965, pg 738&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was soon diagnosed with an incurable form of kidney cancer, although Fry never let her know it. After her death in 1961, he set up a medical research trust in her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencharities.org/charities/204024|title=THE DAPHNE SOMERSET FRY MEMORIAL TRUST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then married the Hon. Mrs Leri Butler (née Llywelyn-Jones), a divorcée (previously married to the Hon. Pierce Alan Somerset David Butler, son of the 7th [[Earl of Carrick (Ireland)|Earl of Carrick]]&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, 2000, pg 288&lt;/ref&gt;); she was 24 years his senior. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973.

The following year he married Fiona Whitcombe, who survived him.

He was the victim of several car crashes, one of which made him reliant on the use of a wheelchair for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/adlib/Details/archiveSpecial/110014359|title=University of Reading – Archive and Museum Database –  Details}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1996, Fry was told he was dying of [[bowel cancer]], but he refused treatment, and suffocated himself with a plastic bag at his home in [[Wattisfield]], Suffolk at the age of 65,&lt;ref name=ah/&gt; after writing a letter explaining his actions to the coroner.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

'''Pop culture pathology''' (or '''Popular culture pathology''') is the forensic study of [[popular culture]] in fields such as celebrity,&lt;ref&gt;Gans, J.H. (1999). ''Popular Culture and High Culture: an analysis and evaluation of taste''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; music, fashion, food, aesthetic desire, television, as well as additional and often obscure media and stimuli. Pop culture pathology is an obscure branch of both [[Critical Theory]] and [[Cultural Studies]].

Originating in private universities in the United States around the turn of the millennium, pop culture pathology is the systematic attempt to analyze trends in culture in order to examine more closely the relationships that the individual has to the world around them. The studies include experiments with the [[aesthetic]] experiences that people have in common, with the goal being to uncover the intrinsic trend that allows for the phenomenon of extrinsic trends. Some common philosophical foundations for this tradition are [[Michel Foucault]] and the philosophy of [[deconstruction]] pioneered by [[Jacques Derrida]].

== The Botto Experiment==
The most common way to test theories in pop culture pathology is to attempt to simulate situations of complete cultural ignorance. For example, a test done in 2005 at University of California, Berkeley, is referred to as the "Botto Experiment".  A young student named Nicholas Botto was given a CD on its release date that had received no radio play and which he had no exposure to. He listened to only this album for two months and was readmitted to society. He was told to return in a year's time with 5 albums that he found he enjoyed in light of the album he had been assigned. In the experiment the album that was famously used was ''In An Aeroplane Over The Sea'' by the [[indie rock]] band [[Neutral Milk Hotel]]. The style of music was known as "[[Lo-Fi]]" which was uncommon at the time. A year later Botto returned with five similar albums. His choices perfectly predicted a generation of music in the Lo-Fi genre, opening the door for pop culture pathology to be known as a legitimate subject.

==Implications of Popular Culture Pathology==
The postmodern implications of this type of experimentation are still being realized by scientists and philosophers. By assigning meaning to a certain cultural item the person conducting the experiment is deciding what will matter in the entirety of the next year for the subject. It seems to go without saying that this type of influence poses solutions for current cultural trends that are deemed "immoral." By making the greater good more fashionable socially many of the worlds problems have the potential to be fixed in the future.

===Failures of Popular Culture Pathology===
Unfortunately the Botto Experiment caused irreversible side effects. The cultural boom that the experiment predicted engulfed the subject forcing an end to the next stage of the experiment.  Next, the subject was supposed to be given the same album a second time and told to return with an additional five. The second phase was supposed to show the instability of modern society and the impossibility of forcing the individual to move against it. This was proven wrong as the subject returned to the same five albums as before, effectively ruining the study.

===Macro Ventures in PCP===
This type of experiment has taken place on different scales and in different ways. For example, the [[Music Genome Project]] has created a service known as [[Pandora Radio]] that allows the user to connect with various types of music according to extremely limited initial criteria. This type of conditioning is also present in the latest incarnation of Apple's [[iTunes]]. The new "Genius" feature allows the user to discover music that perpetuates their current cultural trend, furthering the flawed results of the perplexing but vastly studied Botto Experiment.

==What comes next?==
Academia has been waiting anxiously for the next manifestation of popular culture pathology.  The anticipation has caused the creation of two different views on the subject. One, pioneered in the United States, predicts that the science will next try to cause moral reform. Much fear surrounds this popular view but more than that there is suspicion that the sentiment has simply been placed at the influence of another experiment in the field itself. Given the ironic nature of the study it seems likely that the next manifestation will be at the hands of the next philosopher daring enough to repeat the Botto Experiment with a focus on the field of popular culture pathology instead of popular culture itself.

The second prediction arose in Europe and is more secular. Philosophers there believe that popular culture pathology is the end of the moral focus of the "new world." The term "new world" has been used here in order to call attention to the fact that the Americas have habitually been ahead of Europe technologically, but far behind intellectually. The idea that morality is facing its doom is generally coming, again, from postmodern European philosophy (see [[Nietzsche]], [[Baudrillard]], [[Heidegger]]) predicting the realization that meaning is being assigned by the institution not the individual. This brings the field back to Michel Foucault and the problem of the individual. This view harbors intense curiosity at the cyclical nature of the study. In the end only time will tell the future of this curious new field of study.

'''Radu Rosetti''' ([[Francization|Francized]] ''Rodolphe Rosetti'';&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 125; Marghiloman, IV, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; September 14, 1853 – February 12, 1926) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n politician, historian and novelist, father of General [[Radu R. Rosetti]] and a prominent member of the [[Rosetti family]]. From beginnings in [[traditionalist conservatism]], he adopted progressive agrarian stances, and experimented with modernizing his estate in [[Căiuți]]. A Moldavian regionalist sitting on the left of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]], he collaborated more or less formally with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] opposition during his tenure as [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] of [[Roman County|Roman]], [[Brăila County|Brăila]], and [[Bacău County|Bacău]]. Also serving two terms in the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]] and briefly employed as general director of prisons, Rosetti adopted an anti-elitist and reformist discourse. This pitted him against Conservative chiefs such as [[Nicolae Filipescu]] and [[Titu Maiorescu]], but he was protected by [[Lascăr Catargiu]] and, later, by [[Petre P. Carp]].

Rosetti was financially ruined by his poor investments in the grain trade, and, from 1898, withdrew to secondary jobs in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs Ministry]]. Although he lacked a formal training, he was a treasured polyglot, and achieved his notoriety as a scholar and social critic. His early studies focused on Moldavia's legal and social history, but later took up more politically charged themes. A mild antisemite and adversary of [[Jewish emancipation]], Rosetti then turned to criticizing his own class and its [[manorialism]], constructing an influential paradigm in progressive historiography. Welcomed into the ranks of left-wing [[Poporanism]] by 1906, he proposed a radical [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and prophesied the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasants' revolt of 1907]].

The early stages of World War I, with [[Romania in World War I|Romania maintaining neutrality]], saw Rosetti campaigning for the [[Central Powers]]. He advised against any alliance with the [[Russian Empire]], being fearful of [[Pan-Slavism]] and supportive of the Romanian claims in [[Bessarabia]]. He was disappointed when the country [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|sided with Russia]], and remained behind in [[Bucharest]] when it was occupied by the Central Powers; with Carp and other Conservatives, he organized a collaborationist bureaucracy, and served in it as [[Eforia Spitalelor Civile|Ephor of the Civilian Hospitals]]. Such choices contrasted those of his son, who became a war hero. Reunited with him in postwar [[Greater Romania]], Rosetti still pursued his literary career, receiving accolades for his final works as a memoirist and raconteur. One of his "Moldavian tales" was [[The Gypsy Girl at the Alcove|adapted for the screen]] by his son-in-law, [[Victor Beldiman]].

==Biography==

===Youth and early affiliations===
Born in [[Iași]], Radu was part of the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] [[Rosetti family]], which included [[Antonie Ruset]], [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]] from 1675 to 1678. Contrary to family legend, he was not descended directly from Prince Antonie, but rather from Antonie's brother, ''[[Paharnic|Cupar]]'' Constantin.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Iftimi, "Heraldică și arhitectură", in ''Monumentul'', Vol. VII, 2006, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar's great-grandfather was Lascarache Ruset and his grandfather was [[Logothete]] Răducanu Ruset (1762–1838).&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;[[Alexandru Piru]], "Rosetti Radu", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. II, p. 492.

The family owned the large estate of [[Căiuți]], nearby the spas of [[Slănic-Moldova]], which was the childhood home of Radu and his siblings (a brother and several sisters, including Ana and Margot Rosetti).&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 9–14, 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; A native speaker of Romanian, Radu learned Greek from his paternal grandmother; he later achieved fluency in French (his favorite language of expression), English, German, Italian and Spanish, and had a working knowledge of Latin and, from 1888, [[Old Church Slavonic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 16, 45. See also Ornea (1988), pp. 87–88, 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at Iași, Geneva, Toulouse (where he finished high school) and Paris,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; his only diploma being a ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' degree.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 292; Ornea (1988), pp. 87–88, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Switzerland, he indirectly witnessed the [[Franco-Prussian War|fall of France]], with the surrender of the [[Armée de l'Est]]; he then became passionate about conservative and [[Legitimists|Legitimist]] politics, smuggling weapons into [[Navarre]] during the [[Third Carlist War]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning home, he moderated his reactionary stance. As Radu Jr noted, his father became a "progressive conservative" who admired "[[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 15, 24, 56&lt;/ref&gt; Against traditionalists and elitists such as those from the ''[[Junimea]]'' school, Radu Sr reportedly believed that boyar privilege was a bane, and insisted that aristocrats too should work for a living.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 14–15, 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; While he endorsed Moldavia's merger with neighboring [[Wallachia]] into the [[United Principalities]] (from 1881, the [[Kingdom of Romania]]), he maintained a conservative dislike for the Wallachians, viewing Moldavians as structurally superior.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 67–68; Rosetti, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Radu inherited Căiuți upon Răducanu's death in June 1872, and used its forest for hunting, which he generally did on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He played host to important figures in Romanian public life, including [[Dimitrie Ghica-Comănești]], [[Dimitrie A. Grecianu]], [[Dimitrie Rosetti Tescanu]], [[Anghel Saligny]], and [[Alexandru B. Știrbei]]—thus, he cultivated both members of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) and of the opposition [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 22–25&lt;/ref&gt; Sacrificing his dreams of becoming an engineer in order to supervise his inheritance,&lt;ref name="zo87"/&gt; Rosetti entertained hopes of modernizing Căiuți during the transition from [[manorialism]] to full capitalism. Unable to adapt his lifestyle, he eventually succumbed to market pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), pp. 87–89; Rosetti, pp. 11–14, 21–22, 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1876, at [[Saint Spyridon Church, Iași|Saint Spyridon Orthodox church]] in Iași, he married Henrieta Bogdan, the ultra-conservative granddaughter of poet [[Nicolae Dimache]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 18, 20–21, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, the [[Moldavian military forces|Moldavian artillery]] officer Lascăr Bogdan, had died years before, and she was chaperoned by a relative, [[Grigore Sturdza]]; her sister, Elena, was married to the ''[[Uhlan]]'' officer Mișa Sturdza.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 10, 18–20, 27–28, 41, 68–71&lt;/ref&gt; Well loved by his tenant farmers and passionate about advancing their causes, Rosetti served terms as a mayor of Căiuți.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Henrieta gave birth to their children: Radu (in 1877), Henri (1879), Eugène (1881) and Magdalena (1882).&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, however, Rosetti and his entire family moved out of the manor, taking up residence in [[Târgu Ocna]]. Their new home was a townhouse once owned by [[Costache Negri]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; This move followed a long dispute over land between Rosetti and his sisters, with Radu taking over ownership of [[Răducăneni]], and conceding his manor to Ana; both estates were running debts and were eventually resold, leaving Rosetti inconsolable to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 13, 20, 29–32. See also Ornea (1988), pp. 87–89&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to pursue his agriculturalist dream, investing his settlement money (against Henrieta's advice) to take up tenant farming in [[Dodești|Urdești]], on land owned by [[George Diamandy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefect and writer===
From December 1888, encouraged by historians [[Ioan Bianu]] and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], Rosetti published his first works of genealogy and agrarian history in the periodical ''Revista Nouă''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), pp. 95–98; Rosetti, pp. 45, 189. See also Iorga, ''Istoria literaturii...'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Formally joining the Conservatives,&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 36, 45&lt;/ref&gt; his first important public post was as [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] of [[Roman County]] in August 1889. This followed the ascendancy of [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Lascăr Catargiu]], who appointed Rosetti in hopes of curbing socialist agitation in the area. He resigned after a fairly short interval, following Catargiu's deposition. During most of 1890, he was severely ill after medicating himself on [[Anti-obesity medication|anti-obesity pills]], and received treatment from [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in 1891 and [[Romanian general election, 1891|was elected]] to the [[Romanian Chamber of Deputies|Assembly of Deputies]] for a [[Fălciu County]] seat, in the 3rd Electoral College—then reelected [[Romanian general election, 1892|in 1892]]. These were intense campaigns, pitting Rosetti against the opposition's Radu Ralea.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, he was named prefect of [[Brăila County]], a job which he took because his wife's declining health required advanced medical services. As an outsider, he was asked by Catargiu to audit the local Conservative chapter, to the annoyance of a junior party leader, [[Nicolae Filipescu]]. Filipescu turned to sabotaging Rosetti's work; the latter contacted Bianu and, through him, PNL chairman [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], to help him appoint a bipartisan council of reputable men. When news of this attempted partnership broke nationally, the Conservatives were irritated.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 47–51, 58&lt;/ref&gt; After another series of challenges, including the [[1881–96 cholera pandemic|cholera pandemic]] (eventually handled by [[Iacob Felix]]), [[Danube]] floods, and dockers' strikes,&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 51–56&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetti moved on to a similar position in [[Bacău County]] in October 1893. He inaugurated an anti-corruption campaign and various public works, but also appealed to nepotism, such as when he ensured the victory of his protege, G. I. Donici, in the by-election for the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 71–73, 77&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1894, PNL agitators instigated the peasants against Conservative tax reforms, causing riots in [[Ardeoani]] and [[Răcăciuni]]. Voices in his own party called Rosetti responsible for the 17 wounded [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|Gendarmes]] and the unknown of number of peasants brutalized during retaliations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay in [[Bacău]], Rosetti made another enemy: his own nephew, the local Conservative boss [[Eugen Ghica-Comănești]], who objected strongly to the program of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1895, with Catargiu still Prime Minister, Rosetti applied for a vacated government job, that of general director of prisons. He received his appointment and together with Vasilică Rosetti (a relative working for the [[Romanian Police]]), attempted to reform the prison bureaucracy and clamp down on petty corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 76, 78–81&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the PNL newspaper ''[[Voința Națională]]'' ran a story according to which he had abusively chained the inmates of [[I. L. Caragiale, Dâmbovița|Mărgineni]]; Rosetti denied the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

That October, when the government fell to a PNL one led by Sturdza, Rosetti was fired according to a tradition that a change in power brought about a wholesale replacement of civil servants with supporters of the new leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), p. 90; Rosetti, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his Urdești project had proved a failure, with Rosetti losing most of his investment to declining grain prices.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 58, 82&lt;/ref&gt; Without a stable domicile, Rosetti lived with his Bogdan in-laws in [[Ion Creangă, Neamț|Grădinți]], then at a retreat in [[Agapia]], while his sons were studying in Iași and [[Bucharest]]. It was here that he began work on his first historical novel, ''Cu paloșul'' ("With the Longsword"),&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 82–83, 89–95&lt;/ref&gt; fictionalizing the life and adventures of [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]].&lt;ref name="gc678"&gt;Călinescu, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared as a ''[[feuilleton]]'' in the Conservative daily ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archivist, surveyor, and antisemitic polemicist===

In trouble because he lacked the means to live decently, and because his lack of a university degree meant he could not become a lawyer or a professor, Rosetti sought a professional job relatively safe from the vicissitudes of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs Ministry]] formed one such oasis. He applied there, and in April 1898, when Sturdza was both Prime and Foreign Minister, he was hired as the archivist's assistant, again helped by Bianu.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), p. 90; Rosetti, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; His other supporter was Gheorghe Văsescu, a friend of the PNL factional leader [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Although this new job was low in the ministerial hierarchy, his fluent knowledge of several languages (itself a precondition for working in the ministry)&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 292; Ornea (1988), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and his penchant for historical exegesis helped Rosetti advance. Nevertheless, the promotions came with a humiliating slowness and, with a wife, three sons and a daughter to support, he found the salary insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), pp. 90–92&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Conservatives returned to power in 1899, their new leader was [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]]—Rosetti's patron, Catargiu, died suddenly the same year, leaving him virtually without friends in the party.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosetti was living in Bucharest, where he first rented rooms in Olbricht House, Sfântul Ionică Street, then moved in with his wife and daughter on Mihai Vodă Street, in [[Lipscani]], and finally, in 1903, on Schitu Măgureanu Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 106, 113–114, 132–133, 167, 169, 182&lt;/ref&gt; By 1899, he was transferred from the archives to the special projects department, and also worked on the review commission for [[surveying]] the border between Romania and [[Austria-Hungary]] (dispatched to [[Vatra Dornei]] during summer 1900).&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 114, 136&lt;/ref&gt; He was made head of special projects in April 1902, when he also began surveying the border between [[Northern Dobruja]] and the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="rr162"&gt;Rosetti, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosetti returned to his studies of history, with a genealogy of the [[Ghica family]], published in 1902 by ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''. It became the topic of controversy, proving that the Ghica-Comănești branch, including his rival Eugen, were usurpers of the princely name, and descended from the Suldjaroglu family.&lt;ref name="rr162"/&gt; By 1905 he had issued ''Cu paloșul'', which enjoyed considerable success,&lt;ref name="lb292"&gt;Boia, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; as a volume, alongside other historical sketches: monographs of Răducăneni–Bohotin and [[Ruginoasa, Iași|Vascani]], a review of [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Moldavian Catholicism]] and the [[Csangos]], and a genealogy of the Răducăneni Rosettis.&lt;ref name="ștșt"&gt;[[Ștefan Ștefănescu]], "Rosetti, Radu I.", in ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei românești'', p. 284. Bucharest: [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', pp. 121, 122; Ornea (1988), pp. 97–98; Rosetti, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, his research concentrated on [[Bessarabia]], a former Moldavian province ceded to the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1903, he authored a polemic with the local ''[[Zemstvo]]'', which had demanded cession over Romanian monastery estates in that region.&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 122; Ornea (1988), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

On orders from [[Ioan Lahovary]], he also began researching a tract on the [[history of the Jews in Romania]]. Published in French as ''La Roumanie et les Juifs'', under the pen name "Verax", then translated by Rosetti himself into English,&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; it doubled as a polemic with the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] (AIU), and specifically with publicist [[Elias Schwarzfeld|Edmond Sincerus]].&lt;ref name="elias"&gt;"Elias Schwarzfeld", in ''L'Univers Israélite'', Vol. 71, Issue 19, July 1915, pp. 465–466&lt;/ref&gt; According to Radu Jr, who helped his father with statistics, the work responded to "the Jewish campaign against Romania" and "upset Jews both local and foreign." He argues that the "utterly objective" brochure defended Romanian antisemitism as [[Economic antisemitism|economic protection]] rather than [[Racial antisemitism|racial prejudice]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[Journal des Débats]]'' highlighted the same core argument, but was cautious about its neutrality. It describes Rosetti's text as "more of a profusely cited plea than the result of disengaged inquiry."&lt;ref name="agjdd"&gt;A. G., "Les Livres nouveaux. ''La Roumanie et les Juifs'', par Verax", in ''[[Journal des Débats]]'', Nr. 248/1903, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; On the AIU side, polemicists argued that ''La Roumanie et les Juifs'' amounted to propaganda or deflection. A 1904 reaction, published by ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', noted that "in Romania, the words 'verax' and 'liar' are synonymous".&lt;ref&gt;"Revue de la presse. Le Dr Gaster et les juifs de Roumanie", in ''L'Écho Sioniste'', Vol. 5, Issue 6, June 1904, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''L'Univers Israélite'', Verax's "venomous pen" produced "almost an official response by the Romanian government".&lt;ref name="elias"/&gt; 

Rosetti expressed sympathy for [[Zionism]], but mainly because he viewed it as a validation that Jews were [[Jewish assimilation|unassimilable]].&lt;ref name="hbjdec"&gt;H. Bouët, "Comptes rendus. ''La Roumanie et les Juifs'', par Vérax", in ''Journal des Économistes'', Vol. I, Issue 1, January 1904, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; The essay therefore insisted that [[Jewish emancipation]] was not an option, "focus[ing] attention on the direct contact between Jews and the Romanian peasantry".&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosetti, Jews prevented Romanians from becoming an entrepreneurial middle class. However, as argued by economist H. Bouët, he contradicted his assumption by noting that Romanians needed to be "pushed" by government expenditure into "trades, commerce and industry".&lt;ref name="hbjdec"/&gt; Comparing Jewish immigrants to the ''[[Uitlander]]s'' of [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], Rosetti acknowledged the history of [[pogrom]]s, but argued that these were equivalent to other violence sparked by economic competition.&lt;ref name="agjdd"/&gt; The book also included respectful tributes to perceived Jewish talents, noting that it was "impossible to speak ill of the craftsman of this race", "a tireless worker [who] leaves no room for criticism";&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu (2009), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Radu Jr notes that his family viewed Jews overall as a danger, but that they welcomed assimilated Jews and frowned upon violent antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 56–57, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrarian historian and 1907 revolt===
[[File:Octav Bancila - Inmormantarea.jpg|thumb|430px|''A Funeral'', 1908 painting by the [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] [[Octav Băncilă]], purporting to show a massacre during the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|recent peasants' revolt]]]]
Rosetti was a widower from September 1905, but enjoyed the moral and material support of his grown sons: Radu Jr was an officer and Henri a jurist,&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; while Eugène had quit school and was prospecting for [[Standard Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt; He himself supplemented his income as an [[insurance investigator]], assessing damages caused by [[hail]].&lt;ref name="Rosetti, p. 188"&gt;Rosetti, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he became preoccupied with a looming social crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 183–190&lt;/ref&gt; The first of his works to openly deal with the issue of agrarian inequalities and tensions over land was ''Despre originea și transformările clasei stăpânitoare din Moldova'' ("On the Origins and Transformations of the Moldavian Ruling Class").&lt;ref name="ștșt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), p. 97; Rosetti, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis looked back on the sources of [[Vlach law]], suggesting that ancient Romanians were all free men organized into ''[[Obște|obști]]'', that latifundia were imposed through boyar theft, and that [[serfdom]] was only cemented by the will of [[Michael the Brave]] in the late 16th century.&lt;ref name="ștșt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 491–493&lt;/ref&gt; Dealing more specifically with the genealogical claims of the Romanian nobles, Rosetti distinguished between an ''[[Uradel]]'' of ''[[knyaz]]es'' and a later stratum of [[Phanariotes]], with the latter including his own lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Catrinar, "Boierimea și țărănimea în cronica lui Grigore Ureche. Interpretări istorice", in ''Suceava. Anuarul complexului Muzeal Bucovina'', Vols. XXIX–XXX, II, 2004, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by medievalist [[Ștefan Ștefănescu]], this account was fundamentally inaccurate, but Rosetti still had the "merit [...] of breaking away from traditional Romanian historiography, which idealized the past."&lt;ref name="ștșt"/&gt; Cultural historian [[Z. Ornea]] also underlines that Rosetti's "harshness", although "not entirely unique", set him aside from other boyar literati.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; His "vituperation", Ornea argues, "has its bitter source in his own biography."&lt;ref name="zo87"/&gt; In passing, Rosetti also touched controversial topics of the more distant past, offering his take on [[Roman Dacia]] and the [[origin of the Romanians]]. He viewed initial Roman colonization as weak, and believed that the nation was created by the invading [[South Slavs]] and captives from the [[Diocese of Dacia]]. This theory was immediately challenged by [[Dimitrie Onciul]], who cited early sources which appeared to contradict Rosetti.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ștefan Ștefănescu]], "Dimitre Onciul – Un istoric ilustru al generației Marii Uniri", in [[Dimitrie Onciul]], ''Scrieri alese (1856–1923)'', pp. xiv–xv. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-973-27-1322-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rosetti had kept his post under another Sturdza cabinet, Cantacuzino's return in 1904 signaled his downfall. His prophecy of an impending disaster clashed with the Conservatives' optimism, and he was pressured into resigning before April 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Without joining the PNL, Rosetti now sympathized with its left-wing and, beyond, with the emerging [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] movement, declaring himself disgusted with the Conservatives' National Exhibit of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; In December,&lt;ref name="Rosetti, p. 188"/&gt; he put out the tract ''Pământul, sătenii și stăpânii în Moldova'' ("Land, Villagers and Masters in Moldavia"). In the 1940s, [[Traian Herseni]] reviewed it as "one of the most precious works" of the period, a pioneering contribution to [[rural sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 491, 529, 592&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Rosetti's son, the work was much praised by Sturdza, but constituted an attack on the "sacrosanct principles" of Conservative theoreticians, above all [[Titu Maiorescu]] and [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]], but also Filipescu, the "unrepentant reactionary";&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea also notes that Maiorescu was vexed and vengeful.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1907, dismissing objections from Maiorescu and [[Ioan Kalinderu]], the [[Romanian Academy]] voted to grant Rosetti its Năsturel Herescu Award.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, p. 189. See also Ornea (1988), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasants' uprising of February]], which seemed to confirm Rosetti's foretelling, had erupted outside [[Hârlău]], but soon spread throughout the land, prompting Sturdza's return as Prime Minister. During these events, Radu Jr was tasked with protecting Jewish property in Bucharest against antisemitic backlashes.&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 192–193&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetti put out his other key work of history later in 1907. Titled ''Pentru ce s-au răsculat țăranii?'' ("Why Did the Peasants Rebel?"), it argued that the uprising marked a reaction against the latifundia and tenancies. Building on earlier observations, he documented the survival of serf-like obligations under the guise of a new regime. As he noted, peasants being forced to pay for fodder and informally pressured or terrorized into reimbursing [[corvée]]s, and often reduced to lassitude and alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Dobrogeanu-Gherea, pp. 61–62, 76, 80, 84, 92, 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; With this tract, Rosetti also emerged as a supporter of radical [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]],&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 292, 295, 297; Herseni, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that capitalism was remaking the village into a "plutocratic assemblage".&lt;ref&gt;Matei &amp; Mioc, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; His became the orthodox interpretation in Romanian historiography,&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', p. 29; [[Iván T. Berend]], ''History Derailed: Central and Eastern Europe in the Long Nineteenth Century'', p. 250. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|978-052-093-209-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rosetti being recognized by scholar [[Lucian Boia]] as a "rejuvenator" in the field.&lt;ref name="lb292"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], who coined the term "neo-serfdom" to describe Romanian labor relations, saw the work as "remarkable", "illuminating", and fundamentally compatible with his own [[Marxist sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobrogeanu-Gherea, pp. 65, 92, 95, 127, 175–177&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist [[Henri H. Stahl]], Rosetti had an overwhelming influence on Gherea, and this was unjustified: "[Rosetti] never properly understood the issue, as one cannot really claim to understand rural life only from documents and personal experience; one needs assiduous and rigorously scientific fieldwork."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri H. Stahl]], ''Amintiri și gînduri din vechea școală a monografiilor sociologice'', p. 22. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1981.  {{OCLC|8929819}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gherea also had qualms about Rosetti's bias. He asserted that Rosetti had remained a boyar at heart, who dreamed of a Romanian "[[Junker (Prussia)|Junckerism]]" and rejected the notion of helping the peasants with affordable credits.&lt;ref&gt;Dobrogeanu-Gherea, pp. 176, 391–392&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Gherea argued that Rosetti had not highlighted the conflict of values and morals between landowners and peasants, with each class having its own notions of justice and retribution. Instead, Rosetti blamed socialist agitators for the peasants' recourse to terror and vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Dobrogeanu-Gherea, pp. 184–185, 189, 193–194, 208–209, 372&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ornea notes that Rosetti kept the "vain hope" that the land issue would be solved by [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], and that he partly subscribed to the discredited theory according to which Jewish tenants, alongside socialists, were largely responsible for the "crisis".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), pp. 156–159, 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Russian campaigner===
Throughout the year of the revolt, Rosetti also put out monographs on censorship in early 19th-century Moldavia, including the clampdown on Jewish literature during the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' regime,&lt;ref name="ang&amp;al121"&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the tacit support for nationalist propaganda under [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] and its repression by [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Roman, pp. 271, 281&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to this narrow field remain recognized as the most relevant in over a century of research, although scholars have since noted their numerous errors of citation and chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, pp. 270, 276, 284&lt;/ref&gt; He had been co-opted by the Poporanists at ''[[Viața Românească]]'', which hosted his responses to critics, in particular [[George Panu]].&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 122; Iorga, ''Istoria literaturii...'', p. 204; Rosetti, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the terrain for clashes with the right-wing populist historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], against whom Rosetti was invoked as an authority, causing Iorga to withdraw his articles for ''Viața Românească''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Istoria literaturii...'', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; As Iorga recalled in 1934, Rosetti was a man of "unmatched conceit" and an "intelligent dilettante in matters of history".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''O viață de om. Așa cum a fost. Vol. II: Luptă'', p. 142. Bucharest: Editura N. Stroilă, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

He resumed his literary activity by 1909, contributing to the weekly ''Minerva'' and then to Iorga's ''[[Sămănătorul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 407, 602&lt;/ref&gt; When his eldest son married Ioana Știrbey (orphaned daughter of [[Alexandru B. Știrbei]] and sister of the more famous [[Eliza Brătianu|Eliza]]), Rosetti became in-laws with [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]], who was now leader of the PNL, replacing Sturdza as head of government.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 297; Rosetti, pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; Ioana died in 1914, leaving Radu Jr in charge of her sizable estates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], ''Oameni cari au fost'', Vol. II, pp. 106–107. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]], 1935&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="np-rgen"&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Petrescu-Redi, [http://convorbiri-literare.ro/?p=5640 "Generalul Radu R. Rosetti, între moșia cea mică – Brusturoasa și moșia cea Mare – România"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Magdalena Rosetti also got married, to actor [[Victor Beldiman]]—brother of diplomat [[Alexandru Al. Beldiman]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 67–68, 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Readmitted into the Foreign Affairs Ministry in 1909, Radu Sr became department director under the Conservative [[Petre P. Carp]], but resigned again in 1912, when his rival Maiorescu took over as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 292; Ornea (1988), pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; He remained active as a scholar, publishing in 1909 two books on the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)|1806 war in Bessarabia]] and the Moldavian diplomatic efforts, as well as two other monographs on Moldavia and Wallachia during the same interval. He also looked into the microhistory of property disputes, publishing his ancestors' ledger of land claims and, in 1910, a two-volume account of the 1850s conflict between the Moldavian government and [[Neamț Monastery]].&lt;ref name="ang&amp;al121"/&gt; Returning as "Verax", he detailed the conflict between Romania and the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in the brochure ''Grèce et Roumanie'', printed in Paris; under his real name, he also revisited the "[[Jewish Question]]", putting out a tract on developments to 1909.&lt;ref name="ang&amp;al122"&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was also touched in the article ''Un proces de sacrilegiu la 1836 în Moldova'' ("A Trial over Sacrilege in 1836 Moldavia"), where he suggested that Romanians were naturally tolerant and Jews generally fanatical.&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu (2009), pp. 11, 32, 441&lt;/ref&gt; The novel ''Păcatele sulgeriului'' ("The Sins of the ''[[Sluger]]''"), came out in 1912 and sought to illustrate Rosetti's theories on the land question. It showed the brave but [[Hamartia|tragically flawed]] Mihalache, and 18th-century boyar who accumulates land stolen from yeomen and is punished by fate.&lt;ref name="gc678"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elov200–1"&gt;[[Eugen Lovinescu]], ''Istoria literaturii române contemporane'', pp. 200–201. Chișinău: [[Editura Litera]], 1998. {{ISBN|9975740502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is one of several in which Rosetti describes an "utterly despicable" ''[[droit du seigneur]]'', allegedly exercised by boyars against nubile [[Slavery in Romania|Roma slaves]].&lt;ref name="aoius"/&gt;

Although he still professed his [[Francophilia]], Rosetti distrusted Russia, pined for Bessarabia, and, from the 1870s, wanted Romania to stand by the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and the [[Central Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained this stance during the early stages of World War I, when [[Romania in World War I|Romania kept neutral]]. His 1914 brochure, ''Nici într-un chip cu Rusia'' ("Never but Never with Russia") highlighted the threat of [[Pan-Slavism]] and informed the public that an alliance with Russia would soon turn into a [[currency union]], a protectorate, and eventually an annexation of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Rosetti rooted in particular for the [[German Empire]], since he could discern in its policies "nothing that would be detrimental to our own interests", but rather "our own salvation from the Russian peril."&lt;ref name="lb294"&gt;Boia, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

The same ideology was taken up in three later tracts: in 1914, ''Atitudinea politicii rusești în țările române povestită de organele oficiale franceze'' ("The Russian Political Stance toward the Romanian Lands, as Recounted by French Official Channels"); in 1915, ''Adevărații provocatori'' ("The Actual Instigators") and ''Atitudinea României în războiul actual'' ("Romania's Stance in the Current War").&lt;ref&gt;Angheluță ''et al.'', pp. 120–121, 122; Boia, pp. 100, 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he theorized that the conflict was the result of Russian intrigues and [[British Empire|British imperialism]], while accusing the Romanians of being poorly informed about their choices, "indifferent to the plight of Bessarabia and the Bessarabians."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 100, 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; These Romanians included Radu Jr, who openly supported the Entente.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 55, 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; All such works were published in cooperation with ''Viața Românească'', which, in 1916, also put out Rosetti's answer to scholar [[Vasile Pârvan]], wherein he reasserted his views on the origin of the Romanians.&lt;ref name="ștșt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ang&amp;al122"/&gt; Rosetti was also a contributor to Carp's gazette, ''Moldova'', a tribune for anti-Russian and [[Germanophile]] Moldavians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Agrigoroaiei, [http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/texte/nr45PetreCarp.html "Petre P. Carp și ziarul ''Moldova''"], in ''Revista Română'' ([[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA]]), Nr. 3/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime collaboration===
Reportedly, [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] read ''Nici într-un chip cu Rusia'' and approved of its content, although he found it somewhat "excessive".&lt;ref&gt;Marghiloman, I, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in 1915 Rosetti could clearly read that both he and Prime Minister Brătianu leaned toward the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in mid 1916, Romania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|declared war on the Central Powers]]. Following an abortive [[Battle of Transylvania|attack on Austria-Hungary]], Romania was invaded by the Central Powers, suffering major defeats [[Battle of Turtucaia|at Turtucaia]] and [[Battle of Bucharest|at Bucharest]]. King Ferdinand and the army, alongside a mass of refugees, withdrew to Iași; Romania, directly supported by the Russians, only held on to Rosetti's native Moldavia. As a loyalist soldier, Radu Jr fought with distinction and was severely wounded [[Battle of Mărășești|at Răzoare-Mărășești]], earning the rank of Colonel.&lt;ref name="np-rgen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 297; Secrieru, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosetti the elder remained behind in occupied Bucharest, where he rejoined a cell of Conservatives that included former Prime Ministers Carp and Maiorescu, as well as the Beldimans. His most controversial career move was open collaboration with the Germans and Germanophiles: in June 1917, he was nominated as minister in a putative Carp government.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 45, 295&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up accepting a more minor position under [[Lupu Kostaki]], becoming [[Eforia Spitalelor Civile|Ephor of the Civilian Hospitals]]. According to his son-in-law Victor Beldiman and his friend Bianu, Rosetti proved himself a staunch and dignified administrator, refusing to bow down to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was also involved in the intrigues dividing the Bucharest Conservatives. He supported Carp against Kostaki and [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], and, the latter claims, promoted to high office favorites such as Jan Zaplachta.&lt;ref&gt;Marghiloman, II, pp. 391–392, 452&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, with Beldiman, he also began collecting proof for a "Brătianu file", to be used for denouncing the PNL chief.&lt;ref&gt;Marghiloman, III, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1918, with Marghiloman appointed head of a Conservative-and-Germanophile cabinet, Ferdinand I conceded defeat, and Romania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|sued for peace]]. Rosetti disliked Marghiloman, and immediately resigned from his administrative position, but nonetheless viewed this moment as a confirmation of his predictions, calling for Carp to replace Marghiloman and bring Romania into Germany's orbit.&lt;ref name="lb296"&gt;Boia, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; In an open letter, while confessing his rekindled "hatred for the Germans", he demanded the ouster of King Ferdinand and [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|his royal house]]. As noted by the monarchist Iorga, this document, the product of "bad fashion", caused great distress to [[Marie of Romania|Queen Marie]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii'', II, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; During the interval, Rosetti also began writing opinion pieces in [[Dimitrie S. Nenițescu]]'s newspaper, ''Renașterea'', where he issued reprimands against his erstwhile friend Brătianu and other PNL politicos.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 51, 296&lt;/ref&gt; His other venue was ''Izbânda'', the "independent democratic paper",&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; which was heavily censored by the Marghiloman administration.&lt;ref&gt;Cancicov, p. 645&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by September, the Central Powers were defeated on the [[Macedonian Front]], rekindling Romanian hopes for an Entente victory. Reenrolled in the [[French Army]] as an adamant anti-German,&lt;ref&gt;Cancicov, p. 649&lt;/ref&gt; Radu Jr mediated between Ferdinand and the [[Allied Army of the Orient|Army of the Orient]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii'', II, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; Romania's situation improved greatly with the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|German Armistice on November 11]], which signaled Marghiloman's downfall. Rosetti ran unsuccessfully for an Assembly seat in the [[Romanian general election, 1918|November 18 election]]. According to Iorga, he still enjoyed sizable support from the Bucharest populace.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Memorii'', II, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, ''Renașterea'' published his designs for land reform. Criticizing Marghiloman for his concessions to the peasants, these went back on his earlier radicalism, proposing the preservation of some large estates, in hopes that these would ensure competitiveness and the modernization of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 297. See also Călinescu, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoirs and final years===
[[File:Țigăncușa dela iatac, Cinema Clasic, 30 dec 1923.png|thumb|240px|Poster for the world premiere of ''[[The Gypsy Girl at the Alcove|Gypsy Girl at the Alcove]]'' at Cinema Clasic of [[Bucharest]], December 1923]]
In December, Radu Jr returned to Romania with [[Henri Mathias Berthelot|General Berthelot]] and the Entente mission,&lt;ref&gt;Cancicov, p. 649; Marghiloman, IV, pp. 166, 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; before spending two years as a military attaché in London.&lt;ref name="np-rgen"/&gt; His father then lived to see the creation of [[Greater Romania]], which confirmed the expectations of the pro-Entente side but, thanks to Marghiloman, also [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|included Bessarabia]]. As Radu Jr notes, he was "thankful" and felt no bitterness toward the PNL, being in this set apart from other Conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile his ideas on agrarian issues had a lasting an influence on late Poporanism, which, during the interwar, became the official doctrine of the [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] and then the [[National Peasants' Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Liviu Neagoe, "The 'Third Way': Agrarianism and Intellectual Debates in Interwar Romania", in ''Anuarul Institutului de Istorie G. Barițiu'', Vol. XLVI, 2009, pp. 4, 16; Ornea (1988), pp. 94–95, 159, 165–166&lt;/ref&gt; According to political economist Ion Veverca, Rosetti, Iorga and Dobrogeanu-Gherea were also exponents of a stage in Romanian economic theory, between [[classical economics]] and [[cultural relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion Veverca, "Gândirea economică în România. Încercare de cuprindere sintetică", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 9/1935, pp. 706–709&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rosetti's work on Moldavian village history became a source for [[Iorgu Iordan]]'s research into regional [[toponymy]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Butnaru, "Iorgu Iordan, toponimist", in ''Anuar de Lingvistică și Istorie Literară'', Vol. LV, 2016, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rosetti returned to publishing in 1920–1921, with two selections of "Moldavian tales" (''Povești moldovenești'').&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc1015"&gt;Călinescu, p. 1015&lt;/ref&gt; He followed up with a 1922 memoir, ''Amintiri'', which Iorga recognized as a "precious" source.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, ''Istoria literaturii...'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Part of it doubled as [[oral history]], collecting testimonies from Rosetti's elders, including details of Jewish toleration and [[pogrom]]s, as well as on the looting and raping by marauding [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]&lt;ref&gt;Mironescu, p. 11; Oișteanu (2009), pp. 33, 156, 399, 410&lt;/ref&gt; and the intermingling between Romanians and Roma slaves.&lt;ref name="aoius"/&gt; In its polemical fragments, it showed glimpses of the author's Russophobia and critique of manorialism, with jibes against landowners such as [[Costache Conachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Mironescu, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by literary historian [[George Călinescu]], overall the series showed the boyar class being "unbelievably obsolete", "dazzled" by "the new liberal society"; Rosetti's style was "always agreeable."&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 677&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ornea concludes that the "sympathetic reconstruction [they offer] can be considered entirely reliable as a document", but also "veritable literature."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1988), pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]] praises Rosetti as one of the great and distinctly Moldavian raconteurs, placing him alongside [[Gheorghe Sion]] and [[Dumitru C. Moruzi]].&lt;ref name="elov200–1"/&gt; The "Tales", fictionalizing Moldavia's more distant past, were noticeably more daring in subject matter and conflict. Praised by Călinescu for their accomplished narratives, they included episodes of double-dealing over land property, vengeful castration, and forceful religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 677–678&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1923, he was again frequenting ''Viața Românească'', at the Poporanists' new club in Bucharest. The modernist [[Felix Aderca]], who also paid a visit, recalls that "lily-white" Rosetti was showing signs of senility, describing medieval genealogies to a bindery foreman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru Piru]], ''Viața lui G. Ibrăileanu'', pp. 128–129. Bucharest: [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Rosetti indirectly contributed to the history of [[Romanian cinema]], as one of his novellas became the basis for [[Alfred Halm]]'s ''[[The Gypsy Girl at the Alcove]]''. A [[lost film]] adapted by Beldiman (who also appears in it as Taverner Ștrul),&lt;ref&gt;Călin Stănculescu, ''Cartea și filmul'', p. 9. Editura Biblioteca Bucureștilor, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-606-8337-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is noted for starring both [[Elvira Popescu]] and [[Ion Finteșteanu]],&lt;ref&gt;Mihaela Grancea, Radu Șerban, "Industrie și artă, etic și estetic în filmul interbelic. Câteva realități și opinii din mediul cultural românesc", in Lucian Nastasă, Dragoș Sdrobiș (eds.), ''Politici culturale și modele intelectuale în România'', p. 42. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Mega, 2013.  {{ISBN|978-606-543-390-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for its depiction of sexual abuse by the boyars on their female slaves.&lt;ref name="aoius"/&gt; Rosetti's final scholarly work was a 1923 piece on medieval Moldavia from [[Lațcu of Moldavia|Lațcu]] to [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]],&lt;ref name="ștșt"/&gt; followed in 1924 by a third edition of ''Cu paloșul''.&lt;ref name="gc1015"/&gt;

Rosetti died on February 12, 1926 in Bucharest&lt;ref name="ștșt"/&gt; and was buried in [[Bellu cemetery]], Plot 97.&lt;ref name="bezv240"&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', p. 240. Bucharest: [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A second and final installment of ''Amintiri'' came out in 1927,&lt;ref name="elov200–1"/&gt; with the "Moldavian tales" parodied in ''Viața Românească'' by [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Mironescu, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The historian's eldest son, from 1924 Brigadier General Rosetti, continued his scholarly work and, in 1927, joined the Romanian Academy, presiding over the [[Romanian Academy Library|Academy Library]] in succession to Bianu.&lt;ref name="np-rgen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secrieru, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Although he detested fascism,&lt;ref&gt;Secrieru, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; he agreed to serve as [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]] for [[Ion Antonescu]] during 1941. According to Boia, Rosetti's 1914 warning about Russia was inaccurate for its day, but "terribly close to facts" when contemplated in relation to the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation of 1944–1958]].&lt;ref name="lb294"/&gt; Implicated in the Antonescu trial through the doctrine of [[collective responsibility]], Rosetti Jr was sentenced by the [[Romanian People's Tribunals]].&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Văcărești prison]],&lt;ref name="np-rgen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secrieru, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and shares his father's grave at Bellu.&lt;ref name="bezv240"/&gt;

'''Ralph of Coggeshall''' (died after 1227), [[England|English]] [[chronicler]], was at first a monk and afterwards sixth [[abbot]] (1207–1218) of [[Coggeshall]], an [[Essex]] foundation of the [[Cistercian]] order.

==Chronicon Anglicanum==
Ralph himself tells us these facts; and that his resignation of the abbacy was made against the wishes of the brethren, in consequence of his bad health. He took up and continued a ''Chronicon Anglicanum'' belonging to his house; the original work begins at 1066, his own share at 1187. He hoped to reach the year 1227, but his autograph copy breaks off three years earlier.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Ralph makes no pretensions to be a literary artist. Where he had a written authority before him he was content to reproduce even the phraseology of his original. At other times he strings together in chronological order, without any links of connection, the anecdotes which he gathered from chance visitors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Unlike [[Benedictus Abbas]] and [[Roger of Hoveden]], he makes little use of documents; only three letters are quoted in his work. On the other hand, the corrections and erasures of the autograph show that he took pains to verify his details; and his informants are sometimes worthy of exceptional confidence. Thus he vouches [[Richard I of England|Richard]]'s chaplain Anselm{{clarify|date=April 2013}} for the story of the king's capture by [[Leopold V of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Austria]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The tone of the chronicle is usually dispassionate; but the original text contained some personal strictures upon [[John of England|Prince John]], which are reproduced in [[Roger of Wendover]]. The admiration with which Ralph regarded [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] is attested by his edition of [[Ralph Niger]]'s chronicle; here, under the year 1161, he replies to the intemperate criticisms of the original author. On Richard I the abbot passes a judicious verdict, admitting the great qualities of that king, but arguing that his character degenerated. Towards John alone Ralph is uniformly hostile; as a Cistercian and an adherent of the [[William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex|Mandeville]] family he could hardly be otherwise.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Ralph refers in the ''Chronicon'' (s.a. 1091) to a book of visions and miracles which he had compiled, but this is no longer extant. He also wrote a continuation of Niger's chronicle, extending from 1162 to 1178 (printed in R. Anstruther's edition of Niger, London, 1851), and short annals from 1066 to 1223.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The autograph manuscript of the ''Chronicon Anglicanum'' is to be found in the [[British Library]] ([[Cotton library|Cotton, Vespasian]] D. X). The same volume contains the continuation of Ralph Niger. The ''Chronicon Terrae Sanctae'', formerly attributed to Ralph, is by another hand; it was among the sources on which he drew for the ''Chronicon Anglicanum''. The so-called ''Libellus de motibus anglicanis sub rege Johanne'' (printed by [[Edmond Martène|Martène]] and [[Ursin Durand|Durand]], ''Ampl. Collectio'', v. pp.&amp;nbsp;871–882) is merely an excerpt from the ''Chronicon Anglicanum''. This latter work was edited for the [[Rolls series]] in 1875 by [[Joseph Stevenson]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

{{For|the lifestyle sometimes associated with laziness|Sedentary lifestyle}}
[[File:Grant DeVolson Wood - American Gothic.jpg|thumb| [[Grant DeVolson Wood]]'s ''[[American Gothic]]'' depicts a sedentary American family in front of their permanent living structure]]
In [[cultural anthropology]], '''sedentism''' (sometimes called '''sedentariness'''; compare '''sedentarism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Gabaccia| first1 = Donna R.| author-link1 = | chapter = 17: Food, mobility, and world history| editor1-last = Pilcher| editor1-first = Jeffrey M.| title = The Oxford Handbook of Food History| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Kb2o-eE0huMC| series = Oxford Handbooks in History| location = New York| publisher = Oxford University Press| publication-date = 2012| page = 308| isbn = 9780199729937| access-date = 2017-01-09| quote = This assumption that civilized peoples were largely immobile has sometimes been labeled as sedentism or sedentarism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice of living in one place for a long time. {{As of | 2018}}, the majority of people belong to sedentary cultures. In [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionary anthropology and archaeology]], ''sedentism'' takes on a slightly different sub-meaning, often applying to the transition from [[nomadic]] society to a [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] that involves remaining in one place permanently. Essentially, sedentism means living in groups permanently in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Kris Hirst, [http://archaeology.about.com/od/sterms/g/sedentism.htm Sedentism]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial requirements for permanent, non-agricultural settlements ==
For small-scale nomadic societies it can be difficult to adopt a sedentary lifestyle in a landscape without on-site agricultural or livestock-breeding resources, since sedentism often requires sufficient year-round, easily accessible local natural resources.

Non-agricultural sedentism requires good preservation and storage technologies, such as smoking, drying, and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], as well as good containers such as pottery, baskets, or special pits in which to securely store food whilst making it available. It was only in locations where the resources of several major ecosystems overlapped that the earliest non-agricultural sedentism occurred. For example, people settled where a river met the sea, at [[lagoon]] environments along the coast, at river confluences, or where flat [[savanna]] met hills, and mountains with rivers.

== Before agriculture ==
[[File:Badawit naqib.jpg|thumb|230px|Young man of [[Negev Bedouin]]]]
Archaeological research has shown the earliest sedentism began with on-site agriculture and cattle breeding, and most researchers now believe that sedentism was a prerequisite for the first agriculture to occur. Sedentism usually meant more people, sturdier houses, new stone tools, more jewelry, burials or cemeteries, more long-distance goods and also clear signs of [[social stratification]]. At sedentary sites usually more people lived together for a longer time compared to earlier base camp sites or annual gathering sites. This created deeper cultural layers and thus generally richer archaeological materials. There are also indications that the use of [[rock art]] is connected to sedentism, both pre-agricultural and agricultural forms.

==Criteria for the recognition of sedentism in archaeological studies==
In archaeology a number of criteria is necessary for the recognition of either semi or full sedentism.

According to Israeli archaeologist [[Ofer Bar-Yosef]], they are as follows:

1. Increasing presence of organisms that benefit from human sedentary activities, e.g.
* House mice
* Rats
* Sparrows
2. Cementum increments on mammal teeth
* Indications that hunting took place in both winter and summer
3. Energy expenditure
* Leveling slopes
* Building houses
* Production of plaster
* Transport of undressed stones
* Digging of graves
* Shaping of large [[Mortar and pestle|mortars]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ofer Bar-Yosef]], [http://neareast-prehistory.com/html/sedentism.html The Natufian Culture in the Levant, Threshold to the Origins of Agriculture Evolutionary Anthropology], taken from the book 'The Natufian Culture in the Levant, Threshold to the Origins of Agriculture Evolutionary Anthropology', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical regions of sedentary settlements ==
[[File:Chevaux estive Pyrenees.jpg|thumb|Herd of horses on summer mountain pasture in the [[Pyrenees]]]]
The first sedentary sites were pre-agricultural, and they appeared during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] in [[Moravia]] and on the [[East European Plain]] between c. 25000-17000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman D.E., [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_1991_num_17_1_4538 Seasonality and gazelle hunting at Hayonim Cave : new evidence for "sedentism" during the Natufian], [[Paleorient|Paléorient]], 1991, volume 17, issue 17/1, pp.47-57&lt;/ref&gt; A year-round sedentary site, with its larger population, generates a substantial demand on local naturally occurring resources, a demand that may have triggered the development of deliberate agriculture. In the [[Levant]], the [[Natufian]] culture was the first to become sedentary at around 12000 BC. The Natufians were sedentary for more than 2000 years before they, at some sites, started to cultivate plants around 10000 BC.

The [[Jōmon period|Jōmon culture]] in [[Japan]], which was primarily a coastal culture, was sedentary from c. 12000 to 10000 BC, before the cultivation of rice at some sites in northern [[Kyushu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web-japan.org/trends00/honbun/tj990615.html Jomon Fantasy: Resketching Japan's Prehistory]. June 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Ancient_Jomon_of_Japan.html?id=vGnAbTyTynsC&amp;redir_esc=y "Ancient Jomon of Japan", Habu Junko, Cambridge Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In northernmost [[Scandinavia]], there are [[Ertebølle culture|several early sedentary sites]] without evidence of agriculture or cattle breeding. They appeared from c. 5300-4500 BC and are all located optimally in the landscape for extraction of major ecosystem resources,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.io-warnemuende.de/projects/sincos/archive/new_evidence.pdf New Evidence on the Ertebølle Culture on Rugen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112020256/http://www.io-warnemuende.de/projects/sincos/archive/new_evidence.pdf |date=2004-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. the [[Lillberget]] Stone Age village site (c. 3900 BC), the [[Nyelv]] site (c. 5300 BC), and the [[Lake Inari]] site (c. 4500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedishlapland.com/en/Destinations/Overkalix/To-do/Sights/Lillbergets-Stone-Age-Village Lillbergets Stone Age Village] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404203141/http://www.swedishlapland.com/en/Destinations/Overkalix/To-do/Sights/Lillbergets-Stone-Age-Village/ |date=2014-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In northern [[Sweden]] the earliest indication of agriculture occurs at previously sedentary sites, and one example is the [[Bjurselet]] site used during the period c. 2700-1700 BC, famous for its large caches of long distance traded [[flint axe]]s from [[Denmark]] and [[Scania]] (some 1300&amp;nbsp;km). The evidence of [[small-scale agriculture]] at that site can be seen from c. 2300 BC (burnt cereals of barley).

== Historical effects of increased sedentism ==
[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Beja people|Beja]] nomads from [[East Africa|Northeast Africa]]]]
Sedentism increased contacts and [[trade]], and the first [[Middle East]] cereals and cattle in [[Europe]], could have spread through a stepping stone process, where the productive gift (cereals, cattle, sheep and goats) were exchanged through a network of large pre-agricultural sedentary sites, rather than a wave of advance spread of people with agricultural economy, and where the smaller sites found in between the bigger sedentary ones, did not get any of the new products. Not all contemporary sites during a certain period (after the first sedentism occurred at one site) were sedentary. Evaluation of habitational sites in northern Sweden indicates that less than 10 percent of all the sites around 4000 BC, were sedentary. At the same time, only 0.5-1 percent of these represented villages with more than 3-4 houses. This means that the old nomadic or migratory life style continued in a parallel fashion for several thousand years, until somewhat more sites turned to sedentism, and gradually switched over to agricultural sedentism.

The shift to sedentism is coupled with the adoption of new [[subsistence]] strategies, specifically from [[foraging]] (hunter-gatherer) to [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[List of domesticated animals|animal]] [[domestication]]. The development of sedentism led to the rise of population aggregation and formation of [[village]]s, [[cities]], and other [[community]] types.

In [[North America]], evidence for sedentism emerges around 4500 BC. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Forced sedentism==
'''Forced sedentism''' or '''sedentarization''' occurs when a dominant group restricts the movements of a nomadic group. [[Nomadic]] populations have undergone such a process since the first cultivation of land; the organization of modern society has imposed demands that have pushed aboriginal populations to adopt a fixed habitat.

At the end of the 19th and throughout the 20th century many previously nomadic tribes turned to permanent settlement. It was a process initiated by local governments, and it was mainly a global trend forced by the changes in the attitude to the land and real property and also due to state policies that complicated border crossing. Among these nations are [[Negev Bedouin]] in [[Jordan]], [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedouinheritage.org/bhf/blog/masterpieces/bedouin-culture/the-sedentarization-of-the-bedouin-people The Sedentarization of the Bedouin People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412093054/http://www.bedouinheritage.org/bhf/blog/masterpieces/bedouin-culture/the-sedentarization-of-the-bedouin-people/ |date=2012-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bashkirs]], [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]], [[Kazakhs]] in [[the Soviet Union|Soviet Russia]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] nomads in [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanNomads/documents/Wuning.pdf Sedentarization of Tibetan Nomads]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Babongo]] in [[Gabon]], [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] in [[Cameroon]],&lt;ref&gt;Naoki Matsuura, [http://jambo.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_normal/abstracts/pdf/30-3/Matsuura.pdf VISITING PATTERNS OF TWO SEDENTARIZED CENTRAL AFRICAN HUNTER-GATHERERS: COMPARISON OF THE BABONGO IN GABON AND THE BAKA IN CAMEROON], African Study Monographs, 30(3): 137-159, September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Innu]] in [[Canada]] etc.

Dr. '''Siran Upendra Deraniyagala''' (born 1942) was former [[Department of Archaeology (Sri Lanka)#Archaeological Commissioner|Director-General of Archaeology]], [[Sri Lanka]] (1992 &amp;ndash; 2001).

Siran Uprendra Deraniyagala was born in 1942 in [[Chilaw]], the third of four sons of [[Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala|Paules Edward Pieris]] (Director of the [[National Museum of Colombo|National Museum of Ceylon]] (1939-1963)) and Prini née Molamure. His grandfather was [[Sir]] [[Paul Pieris|Paulus "Paul" Edward Pieris]].

Siran completed his school education at [[St. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia]].

'''''The Babylonian Marriage Market''''' is an 1875 [[painting]] by the [[List of British painters|British painter]] [[Edwin Long]] of young women being auctioned into marriage. It received attention for its provocative depiction of women being sold and its attention to historical detail. It was inspired by a passage in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' by [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyherodotu28herogoog#page/n111/mode/1up Histories Clio I 196, Herodotus]&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist painstakingly copied some of the images from [[Assyria]]n artifacts.

It is currently held in the Picture Gallery of [[Royal Holloway College]], after being bought by [[Thomas Holloway]] in 1882, where it fetched a then-record price for a painting by a living artist at £6,615.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vanderbilt|first1=Tom|title=You may also like|date=2016|publisher=Alfred A.

'''''The Invention of The Beautiful Game: Football and the Making of Modern Brazil''''' is a book by [[historian]] Gregg Bocketti published by the University of Florida Press in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invention of The Beautiful Game: Football and the Making of Modern Brazil|last=Bocketti|first=Gregg|publisher=University of Florida Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8130-6255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines “the changes in Brazilian football from the era of Charles Miller and the sportsmen to the consolidation of the ideas of the beautiful game and of Brazil’s ownership of the game, the transition from foot-ball to futebol.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/946998828|title=The invention of the beautiful game : football and the making of modern Brazil|last=Gregg,|first=Bocketti,|publisher=University of Florida Press|year=2016|isbn=9780813062556|location=Gainesville|pages=4|oclc=946998828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
In the book, the author links football to larger historical themes of contemporary Brazil, and further divides into four chapters that each focuses on separate time frames in the perspective of race, class, region, gender, and nationality. Moreover, through social, cultural, and political lenses, the book explores “Brazilian ideas about the game between 1894 and 1938, and the choices Brazilians made about how to explain football during that period.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/946998828|title=The invention of the beautiful game : football and the making of modern Brazil|last=Gregg,|first=Bocketti,|publisher=University of Florida Press|year=2016|isbn=9780813062556|location=Gainesville|pages=8|oclc=946998828}}&lt;/ref&gt; In analyzing his collected historical evidences, the author emphasizes several key terms such as professionalization, amateurism, nationalization, popularization, racial exclusivity, and social hierarchies. The book contains 20 illustrative figures and incorporates historical records of prominent football clubs, popular magazines, and sports press as evidence for the author’s research.

== Critical Reception ==
Critical reception was generally positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Patricia|date=2018|title=Review of The Invention of the Beautiful Game: Football and the Making of Modern Brazil, Bocketti, Greg|jstor=10.5406/jsporthistory.45.1.0099|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=45|issue=1|pages=99–100|doi=10.5406/jsporthistory.45.1.0099}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for the [[The Hispanic American Historical Review|Hispanic American Historical Review]], writer Bernardo Borges Buarque de Hollanda states that he believes the book made an impactful contribution to adding multiple perspectives to Brazilian football through “questioning the nature of a much-used cliché, the beautiful game, which was crucially internalized as part of common sense and by a portion of the national intellectual community.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buarque de Hollanda|first=Bernardo|date=2017-08-01|title=The Invention of the Beautiful Game: Football and the Making of Modern Brazil|url=https://doi.org/10.1215/00182168-3934096|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|language=en|volume=97|issue=3|pages=557|doi=10.1215/00182168-3934096|issn=0018-2168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, he marks the book’s preeminence in taking an unorthodox way of historical research yet still leaving an impressive remark in providing a fresh content with historical objectivity that was not “swayed by the native exoticism or stereotypes.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[H-Net]] also reviewed the work, with the reviewer stating that the book was  “a nuanced and insightful analysis of the contending narratives about the emergence and expansion of football in Brazil, and of how they have produced the powerful nationalist narrative of the futebol nation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/3911/reviews/189333/eakin-bocketti-invention-beautiful-game-football-and-making-modern|title=Eakin on Bocketti, 'Invention of the Beautiful Game: Football and the Making of Modern Brazil' {{!}} H-Nationalism {{!}} H-Net|website=networks.h-net.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the ''[[Luso-Brazilian Review]]'', Christopher Gaffney praised the book as "a well-written, expertly researched examination of the ways in which [futebol] unfolded among and for elites in Rio and São Paulo" while also commenting that Bocketti "neglect[ed] to reinsert football into broader urban and cultural dynamics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaffney|first=Christopher|date=2017|title=The Invention of the Beautiful Game: Football and the Making of Modern Brazil by Gregg Bocketti (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/683463|journal=Luso-Brazilian Review|language=en|volume=54|issue=2|pages=E18–E20|issn=1548-9957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thinlā''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: थिंला) is the second month in the [[Nepal Era]] calendar, the national [[lunar calendar]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Sambat gets national status|url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=24 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104054/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8874&amp;cat_id=5|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The month corresponds to [[Margashirsha]] (मार्गशीर्ष) in the [[Hindu lunar calendar]] and roughly matches [[December]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

Thinlā begins with the [[new moon]] and the [[full moon]] falls on the 15th of the [[lunar month]]. The month is divided into the bright and dark fortnights which are known as Thinlā Thwa (थिंला थ्व) and Thinlā Gā (थिंला गा) respectively.

The main event during this month is the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Vaikuntha Ekadashi]] which is dedicated to [[Vishnu]]. It falls on the 11th day of the bright fortnight. The full moon is also a major religious holiday. In [[Nepal Mandala]], the day is celebrated as [[Yomari punhi|Yomari Punhi]] (यःमरि पुन्हि).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiannewaguthi.org/en/index.php/component/content/article/2-cultural-articles/34-yomari-punhi-a-south-asian-post |title="Yomari Punhi": A South Asian  Post-harvest Festival  among Newars  of Nepal |last=Makaju |first=Uttam |date=2014 |website=Canadian Newa Guthi|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival celebrates the harvest. The special food of the day is a confection known as [[Yomari]], a [[dumpling]] made of rice-flour dough filled with a paste of molasses and sesame seeds. In other cultures, the day is known as Dhānya Purnimā.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levy |first= Robert Isaac |date=1990 |title= Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal|chapter=A Catalogue of Annual Events and Their Distribution throughout the Lunar Year |publisher= University of California Press |page=644 |isbn=9780520069114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Not to be confused with [[Thomas the Rhymer]], a 13th-century Scots laird.''
'''Thomas Rymer''' (c. 1643 – 14 December 1713)&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Sherbo, "Rymer, Thomas (1642/3–1713)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24426 Retrieved 17 Oct 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[antiquary]] and historian. His most lasting contribution was his compilation and publication of the ''Foedera'', sixteen volumes of texts of agreements made between [[The Crown]] of England and foreign powers during all earlier centuries. He held the office of English [[Historiographer Royal (England)|Historiographer Royal]] from 1692 to 1714.

==Early life and education==
Thomas Rymer was born at [[Appleton Wiske]], near [[Northallerton]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1643,&lt;ref name="college"/&gt; or possibly at [[Yafforth]]. He was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, [[lord of the manor]] of [[Brafferton, North Yorkshire|Brafferton]] in Yorkshire, described by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] as possessed of a good estate. The father was executed for his part in the [[Farnley Wood Plot]] of 1663. The son studied at [[Northallerton Grammar School]] where he was a classmate of [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]].&lt;ref name="college"&gt;{{cite book |title=From Middle Ages to Millennium Northallerton Grammar School and College 1322–2000 |last=Riordan |first=Michael |publisher=County Print |isbn=1-86123-103-2 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he studied for eight years under Thomas Smelt, a noted Royalist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{acad |id=RMR659T |name=Rymer, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged sixteen, he then went to study at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], entering on 29 April 1659.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Although Rymer was still at Cambridge in 1662, when he contributed Latin verses to a university volume celebrating the marriage of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and [[Catherine of Braganza]], there is no record of his taking a degree.  This may have been due to the financial problems his father was suffering at the time, or the fact that on 13 October 1663 his father was arrested, and executed the following year, for his involvement in the [[Farnley Wood Plot]] to stage an uprising in Yorkshire against Charles II. Although Thomas's elder brother Ralph was also arrested and imprisoned, Thomas himself was not implicated, and on 2 May 1666, he became a member of [[Gray's Inn]], and was called to the bar on 16 June 1673.{{sfn|Lee|1897}}

==Career==
Rymer's first appearance in print was as translator of [[René Rapin]]'s ''Reflections on [[Aristotle]]'s Treatise of Poesie'' (1674), to which he added a preface in defence of the classical rules for unity in drama.&lt;ref&gt;A translation of Cicero's ''Prince'' (1668), sometimes said to be Rymer's first publication, is actually the work of Thomas Ross.  See Curt Zimansky, ''The Critical Works of Thomas Rymer'' (1956), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the principles there set forth, he composed a tragedy in verse, licensed 13 September 1677, called ''Edgar, or the English Monarch'', which was a failure.  It was printed in 1678.{{sfn|Lee|1897}}

Rymer's views on the drama were again given to the world in the shape of a printed letter to [[Fleetwood Shepheard]], the friend of [[Matthew Prior|Prior]], under the title of ''The Tragedies of the Last Age Consider'd'' (1678). 
To [[Ovid]]'s ''Epistles Translated by Several Hands'' (1680), with preface by [[John Dryden|Dryden]], ''Penelope to Ulysses'' was contributed by Rymer, who was also one of the hands who Englished the [[Plutarch]] of 1683–86. 
The life of [[Nicias]] fell to his share. He furnished a preface to [[Bulstrode Whitelocke|Whitelocke]]'s ''Memorials of English Affairs'' (1682), and wrote in 1681 ''A General Draught and Prospect of the Government of Europe'', reprinted in 1689 and 1714 as ''Of the Antiquity, Power, and Decay of Parliaments'', where, ignorant of his future dignity, the critic had the misfortune to observe, "You are not to expect truth from an historiographer royal."

He contributed three pieces to the collection of ''Poems to the Memory of [[Edmund Waller]]'' (1688), afterwards reprinted in Dryden's ''[[Miscellany]] Poems'', and is said to have written the Latin inscription on Waller's monument in [[Beaconsfield]] churchyard. The preface to the posthumous ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (1688) of [[Thomas Hobbes]] is said to have been by Rymer, but the ''Life of Hobbes'' (1681) sometimes ascribed to him was written by [[Richard Blackburne]]. He produced a congratulatory poem upon the arrival of [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]] in 1689.{{sfn|Lee|1897}}

His next piece of authorship was to translate the sixth elegy of the third book of Ovid's ''Tristia'' for Dryden's ''Miscellany Poems'' (1692, p.&amp;nbsp;148). On the death of [[Thomas Shadwell]] in 1692 Rymer received the appointment of [[Historiographer Royal (England)|historiographer royal]], at a yearly salary of £200.{{sfn|Lee|1897}}
Immediately afterwards appeared his much discussed ''Short View of Tragedy'' (1693), criticising [[Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]], which produced ''The Impartial Critick'' (1693) of [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], the epigram of Dryden.

==''Foedera''&lt;!-- [[Foedera]] redirects here--&gt;==
Rymer's most lasting contribution to scholarship was the ''Foedera'', a collection of "all the leagues, treaties, alliances, capitulations, and confederacies, which have at any time been made between the Crown of England and any other kingdoms, princes and states".&lt;ref name="british-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/search/series/rymer-foedera |title=Rymer's Foedera |work=British History Online |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents were presented in Latin with summaries in English.&lt;ref name="british-history"/&gt; Begun under a royal warrant in 1693, it was "an immense labour of research and transcription on which he spent the last twenty years of his life".&lt;ref&gt;Zimansky, xvii–xx. The quote is from page xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Gentleman's Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mQ3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA27 |date=July 1834 |publisher=F. Jefferies |location=Edinburgh |pages=23–30 : 27–30 |title=The Record Commission; No. III; II. Rhymer's Fœdera. Three Volumes |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the ''Foedera'' comprised 20 volumes dated from 1704 to 1735. Sixteen were prepared by Rymer, of which the last two were published posthumously by his assistant Robert Sanderson, who himself compiled the remaining volumes, the last three being supplementary.&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"/&gt;

[[George Holmes (archivist)|George Holmes]] revised the first 17 volumes, published from 1727 to 1735, as well as a single [[folio]] (in 1730) of corrections to the first edition.&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt;

The "Hague edition" was published from 1737 to 1745 in "ten closely-printed folio volumes".&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|All volumes are scanned at the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foedera'' (Hague edition), Internet Archive:

|group="nb"}} The first nine reprinted the London edition, with the tenth combining [[Paul de Rapin]]'s French-language synopsis and an index to the ''Foedera''.&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; Rapin's text had been translated into English in 1733.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whatley |first=Stephen |title=Acta Regia; Being the Account which Mr. Rapin de Thoyras Published of the History of England, and Grounded Upon Those Records, which are Collected in Mr. Rymers Foedera |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIBcAAAAcAAJ |year=1733 |location=London |publisher=Printed by James Mechell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Record Commission]] in 1800 proposed a "Supplement and Continuation" to the ''Foedera''; in 1809 it decided instead on a complete revision.&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"/&gt; Seven parts were prepared before the project was abandoned owing to dissatisfaction with the editing.&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;Tedder 1911&lt;/ref&gt; Six parts in three volumes were published from 1816 to 1830, and the seventh in 1869, along with miscellaneous notes.{{#tag:ref|

[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009832085 Appendices] from Yale University.
&lt;/ref&gt;
|group="nb"}} The work was thus revised up to the year 1383.&lt;ref name="edinburgh1834"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; A three-volume English-language summary and index of the complete ''Foedera'' followed.&lt;ref&gt;

Appendix and index] (1885).
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Victoria County History]] guide recommends citing the Record Commission (RC) edition where available and the Hague edition otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/writing-for-the-vch/style-guide/references/rymer%E2%80%99s-foedera |title=Writing for the VCH » Style guidelines » Rymer's Foedera |work=Victoria County History |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Rymer died on 14 December 1713, and was buried four days later in [[St Clement Danes]] Church in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].&lt;ref name="college"/&gt; He apparently left no immediate family.{{sfn|Lee|1897}}

[[File:DawnOfTheCenturyMarchTwoStepPaull.jpg|right|thumb|1900 sheet music cover reflecting the era's optimism about a better future through technological progress.]]

'''Turn of the century''', in its broadest sense, refers to the transition from one [[century]] to another. The term is most often used to indicate a distinctive time period either before or after the beginning of a century or both before and after.

Where no specific century is stated, the term usually refers to the most recent transition of centuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2017|reason=In my experience, even in 21st century writing, this phrase always refers to the end of the 19th century.}}

In [[British English]] the phrase the 'turn of the nineteenth century' refers to the years immediately preceding and immediately following 1801, the 'turn of the twentieth century' to the years surrounding 1901, and so on.

In [[American English]] it is not so clear cut.  According to the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'' online Q&amp;A, there is no common agreement as to the meaning of the phrase "turn of the ''n''-th century." For instance, if a statement describes an event as taking place "at the turn of the 18th century," it could refer to a period around the year 1701 or around 1800, that is, the beginning or end of that century. As such, they recommend using only "turn of the century," and only in a context that makes clear which transition is meant.&lt;ref name="Chicagoan.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/Numbers/Numbers17.html |title=Chicago Style Q&amp;A: Numbers |publisher=The Chicago Manual of Style Online |date= |access-date=11 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519091823/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/Numbers/Numbers17.html |archive-date=2011-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Turn of the century" commonly meant the transition from the 19th century to the 20th century; however, as the generations living at the end of the 20th century survived into the 21st century, the specific number of the referenced century became necessary to avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salas |first1=E |date= 1 June 2008|title=At the turn of the 21st century: reflections on our science. |journal=[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors]] |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=351–353 |doi=10.1518/001872008x288402 |pmid=18689036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uldis Ģērmanis''' (4 October 1915 – 19 December 1997) was a [[Latvian people|Latvian]] historian, writer and publicist born in [[Novaya Ladoga]], [[Russian Empire]]. His father was Jānis Ģermanis, and his family returned to the newly independent [[Latvia]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rožkalne |first=Anita |author2=LU literatūras |author3=folkloras un mākslas institūts  |title=Latviešu rakstniecība biogrāfijās. |language=Latvian |publisher=Zinātne |location=Riga |series = |year=2003 |isbn=9984-698-48-3 |oclc=54799673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught history at the [[University of Latvia]] in Riga from 1943 and obtained his master's degree. During [[World War II]], he was mobilised to the [[Latvian Legion]] and served in the [[19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian)|19th. waffen grenadier division of the SS]] as a military reporter. A few days before the German capitulation, he emigrated to [[Sweden]], where he settled in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]]. In 1974, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in history from the [[University of Stockholm]].

Ģērmanis was, since 1935, a lifelong member of the Latvian [[Corporation (university)|student fraternity]] Fraternitas Livonica. His speciality was modern Latvian history, especially of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Latvian Riflemen]]. His ground-breaking work on [[Jukums Vācietis]] and the Latvian Riflemen's role in the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] paved the way for further research on this subject by other Latvian émigré historians, notably the early works of [[Andrew Ezergailis]].

His book ''Zili stikli, zaļi ledi'' (Blue glass, green ice; 1968) describes his experience researching the story of Vācietis. Ģērmanis was one of the rare émigré Latvians allowed access to primary sources in the [[Latvian SSR]] at the time. In the book, he describes the suspicion he was met with by both the Soviet Latvian authorities, and by his fellow émigrés, who questioned his motives for researching the history of pro-Bolshevik Latvians.

In 1958, Ģērmanis living in exile completed "''The Latvian Saga''", which presents Latvian history, but reads like a novel. As the Latvian Embassy in the USA writes on their homepage: "''It describes the people, powers and events that made Latvia what it is today, and puts it all in a broader European context...''", "''...it inspired several generations of Latvians to dedicate their lives to the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latvia-usa.org/thelbyulger.html |title="The Latvian Saga" by Uldis Germanis |accessdate=1 December 2008 |publisher=latvia-usa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the eleventh edition was issued in an English version and the works of Ģērmanis are becoming increasingly popular in his native country as well.

His lecture in Toronto, in 1988, about "current events" in the Soviet Union, is considered by many to be the best analysis of the situation at the time. Video recording of the lecture (in Latvian) can be accessed via internet on daugavasvanagi.ca

Uldis Ģērmanis was elected a member of the [[Latvian Academy of Sciences]] in 1992 and awarded the [[Order of the Three Stars]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramata21.lv/3zvg1.htm |title=Triju Zvaigžņu ordenis |language=Latvian |accessdate=2 December 2008 |publisher=gramata21.lv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Land Road''' (also Army Road or Salt Road) [[Latin|lat]]. ''via regia Lusatiae superioris'', or ''strata regia'', was a trade route and was one of the [[Ancient road]]s. It was a part of the [[Via Regia]], which continued west as far as the [[Rhine]].

Over several centuries the road was, along with the '''Low Road''' to the north, one of the most important transport links from Middle Germany to Silesia and east Poland. Like other [[Imperial road|Reichsstraße]] it was under protection e.g. of local regents. The Via Regia was also significant as a route to [[Santiago de Compostela]] from the east.

== Route ==

'''Walddeutsche''' ({{lang-de|Walddeutsche}} ("Forest Germans") or ''Taubdeutsche'' ("Deaf Germans"); {{lang-pl|Głuchoniemcy}} ("deaf-mutes", a pun)), is the name for a group of people, mostly of German origin, who settled during the 14th-17th century on the territory of present-day [[Doły Jasielsko-Sanockie|Sanockie Pits]], Poland, a region which was previously only sparsely inhabited because the land was difficult to farm.&lt;ref name=ga61/&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
The term ''Walddeutsche'' - coined by the Polish historians [[Marcin Bielski]], 1531,&lt;ref name=bielski/&gt; [[Szymon Starowolski]] 1632, Bishop [[Ignacy Krasicki]]&lt;ref name=krasicki/&gt; and [[Wincenty Pol]] - also sometimes refers to Germans living between [[Wisłoka]] and the [[San River]] part of the West Carpathian Plateau and the [[Central Beskidian Piedmont]] in Poland.

The Polish term ''Głuchoniemcy'' is a sort of pun; it means "deaf-mutes", but sounds like "forest Germans": ''Niemcy'', Polish for "Germans", is derived from ''niemy'' ("mute", unable to talk comprehensibly, i.e. in Slavic), and ''głuchy'' ("deaf",&lt;ref name=dill/&gt; i.e. "unable to communicate") sounds similar to ''głusz'' "[[wood]]".&lt;ref name=metrika/&gt;

== History ==
In the 14th century a German settlement called Hanshof existed in the area. The Church of the Assumption of Holy Mary and St. Michael's Archangel in [[Haczów]] (Poland), the oldest wooden Gothic temple in Europe, was erected in the 14th century and was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]] in 2003.

Germans settled in the territory of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] (territory of present-day [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]]) from the 14th to 16th centuries (''see [[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe|Ostsiedlung]]''), mostly after the  region returned to Polish sphere of influence in 1340, when [[Casimir III of Poland]] took the [[Red Ruthenia|Czerwień]] towns.

[[Marcin Bielski]] states that [[Bolesław I Chrobry]] settled some Germans in the region to defend the borders against Hungary and Kievan Rus' but the arrivals were ill-suited to their task and turned to farming.&lt;ref name=chrobry/&gt; [[Maciej Stryjkowski]] mentions German peasants near [[Przeworsk]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Sanok]], and [[Jarosław]], describing them as good farmers. 

Some Germans were attracted by kings seeking specialists in various trades, such as craftsmen and miners. They usually settled in newer market and mining settlements. The main settlement areas were in the vicinity of [[Krosno]] and some language islands in the [[Doły Jasielsko Sanockie|Pits]] and the [[Rzeszów]] regions. The settlers in the Pits region were known as ''Uplander Sachsen''.&lt;ref name=diricm/&gt; Until approximately the 15th century, the ruling classes of most cities in present-day Beskidian Piedmont consisted almost exclusively of Germans.
[[Image:Markowa chata przyslupowa.jpg|thumb|220px|The village of [[Markowa]]. The typical ''[[Umgebindehaus]]'' - houses, about 150-200 km southeast of [[Kraków]], around 18/19th century, built in the style of ancient mountain ''[[Sachsen|Walddeutsche]]'' atmosphere.&lt;ref name=kotula/&gt;]]
[[File:GermanHamletsSince15th.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Subcarpathian]] (''[[Małopolska]]'') Germans in the 15th century.]]
The Beskidian Germans underwent [[Polonization]] in the latter half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=polon/&gt;

According to [[Wacław Maciejowski]], writing in 1858, the people did not understand German but called themselves Głuchoniemcy.&lt;ref name=wamaciej/&gt; [[Wincenty Pol]] wrote in 1869 that their attire was similar to that of the Hungarian and Transylvanian Germans and that their main occupations were farming and weaving. He stated that in some areas the people were of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] origin, however, they all spoke flawlessly in a [[Lesser Poland]] dialect of Polish.&lt;ref name=wpol/&gt; In 1885, [[Józef Szujski]] wrote that the Gluchoniemcy spoke only Polish, but there were traces of a variety of original languages which showed that, when they arrived, the term ''Niemiec'' was applied to "everyone".&lt;ref name=szujski/&gt; In the modern Polish language, ''Niemiec'' refers to Germans, however, in earlier centuries, it was sometimes also used in reference to Hungarians, possibly due to similarity with the word ''niemy'' or plural ''niemi'' for "mute" or "dumb".&lt;ref name=blackie/&gt;

==Settlement==
Important cities of this region include [[Pilzno]], [[Brzostek, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Brzostek]], [[Biecz]], [[Gorlice]], [[Ropczyce]], [[Wielopole Skrzyńskie]], [[Frysztak]], [[Jasło]], [[Krosno]], [[Czudec]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Łańcut]], [[Tyczyn]], [[Brzozów]], [[Jaćmierz]], [[Rymanów]], [[Przeworsk]], [[Jarosław]], [[Kańczuga]], [[Przemyśl]], [[Dynów]], [[Brzozów]], and [[Sanok]].

It touches upon several predominant theories regarding [[Ancient China]]'s earliest dynasties, namely [[Xia dynasty]], [[Shang dynasty]] and [[Zhou dynasty]], and tries to present [[archaeological]] evidence that those theories are in fact myths originated in early Chinese historical works, which resemble hagiographies and have little basis in reality on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=赵柏熹 |title=中华文明起源于长江流域？犹太裔汉学家这样解读 |publisher=凤凰网.国学 |url=http://guoxue.ifeng.com/a/20160721/49489927_0.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book and as a result its author are a subject of considerable controversy within the Sinological academia, especially so within the [[China|People's Republic of China]].;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 中国文明的源头是北方还是南方-中华读书报-光明网|url = http://epaper.gmw.cn/zhdsb/html/2013-12/04/nw.D110000zhdsb_20131204_3-10.htm?div=-1|website = epaper.gmw.cn|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Guo Lixin |title=Way Out of the Maze of History |publisher=International Journal of Liberal Arts and Social Science，Vol.2 No.4 |year=May 2014 |url=http://www.ijlass.org/data/frontImages/gallery/Vol._2_No._4/9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Summary of Xia, Shang, Zhou Dynasties: from Myths to Historical|url = https://www.academia.edu/27768296/Summary_of_Xia_Shang_Zhou_Dynasties_from_Myths_to_Historical?auto=download&amp;campaign=weekly_digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 he published [[biographical novel]] ''[[Paulino Alcántara|Paulino]]'' (Edicions Saldonar) with David Valero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noguer|first=Ignasi|title=Homenatge a Paulino Alcántara, el primer crac de la història del Barça|journal=El 9 Esportiu|date=10 December 2013|url=http://www.el9.cat/nel9/article/8-esports/48-barca/700316-homenatge-a-paulino-alcantara-el-primer-crac-de-la-historia-del-barca.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two authors bring up the figure of [[Paulino Alcántara]], known for his 369 goals in 257 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aguilar|first=Francesc|title=Presentada la biografía dedicada a Paulino Alcántara, primer crack del Barça|journal=Mundo Deportivo|date=7 November 2013|url=http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20131107/fc-barcelona/biografia-dedicada-a-paulino-alcantara-primer-crack-del-barca_54393185664.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It was necessary to make a biography of a great sports star like Paulino because it is one of the first superstars of the sport and the best Asian footballer of all time", stated the two authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galera|first=Àlex|title=Presentat el primer llibre sobre Paulino Alcántara a la seu d'exjugadors del Barça|journal=Ara|date=7 November 2013|url=http://www.ara.cat/esports/Alcantara-Paulino-llibre-Barca-Frederic_Porta-Saldonar_0_1025297721.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
