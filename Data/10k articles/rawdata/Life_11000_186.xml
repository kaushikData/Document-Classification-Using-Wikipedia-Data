'''Alaric II''' ({{lang-got|*Alareiks}}, "ruler of all";&lt;ref&gt;Kelsie B. Harder, ''Names and their varieties: a collection of essays in onomastics'', American Name Society, University Press of America, 1984, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; {{circa|458/466}}{{snd}}August 507), also known as '''Alarik''', '''Alarich''', and '''Alarico''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or '''Alaricus''' in [[Latin]] — succeeded his father [[Euric]] as king of the [[Visigoths]] in [[Toulouse]] on December 28, 484; he was the great-grandson of the more famous [[Alaric I]], who sacked Rome in 410.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', translated by Thomas J. Dunlap (Berkeley: University of California, 1988), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He established his capital at [[Aire-sur-l'Adour]] (''Vicus Julii'') in [[Aquitaine]]. His dominions included not only the majority of [[Hispania]] (excluding its northwestern corner) but also [[Gallia Aquitania]] and the greater part of an as-yet undivided [[Gallia Narbonensis]].

==Reign==
[[Herwig Wolfram]] opens his chapter on the eighth Visigothic king, "Alaric's reign gets no full treatment in the sources, and the little they do contain is overshadowed by his death in the [[Battle of Vouillé]] and the downfall of the Toulosan kingdom."&lt;ref name=Wolfram-191&gt;Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; One example is [[Isidore of Seville]]'s account of Alaric's reign: consisting of a single paragraph, it is primarily about Alaric's death in that battle.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore of Seville, ''Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum'', chapter 36. Translation by Guido Donini and Gordon B. Ford, ''Isidore of Seville's History of the Goths, Vandals, and Suevi'', second revised edition (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1970), pp. 17f&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented event in Alaric's reign concerned providing refuge to [[Syagrius]], the former ruler of the [[Domain of Soissons]] (in what is now northwestern [[France]]) who had been defeated by [[Clovis I]], King of the Franks. According to [[Gregory of Tours]]' account, Alaric was intimidated by Clovis into surrendering Syagrius to Clovis; Gregory then adds that "the Goths are a timorous race." The [[Franks]] then imprisoned Syagrius, and once his control over Syagrius' former kingdom was secure, Clovis had him beheaded.&lt;ref name=Gregory-27&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''Decem Libri Historiarum'', II.27; translated by Lewis Thorpe, ''History of the Franks'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wolfram points out that at the time "Clovis got no farther than the Seine; only after several more years did the Franks succeed in occupying the rest of the Gallo-Roman buffer state north of the [[Loire]]." Any threat of war Clovis could make would only be effective if they were neighbors; "it is nowhere written that Syagrius was handed over in 486 or 487."&lt;ref name=Wolfram-191/&gt;

[[File:Alarico II.jpg|right|thumb|An artist's imagining of Alaric II in an illustration at the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]]]]

Despite Frankish advances in the years that followed, Alaric was not afraid to take the military initiative when it presented itself. In 490, Alaric assisted his fellow Gothic king, [[Theodoric the Great]], in his conquest of [[Italy]] by dispatching an army to raise [[Odoacer]]'s siege of [[Pavia]], where Theodoric had been trapped.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', pp. 281f&lt;/ref&gt; Then when the Franks attacked the [[Burgundians]] in the decade after 500, Alaric assisted the ruling house, and according to Wolfram the victorious Burgundian king [[Gundobad]] ceded [[Avignon]] to Alaric.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; By 502 Clovis and Alaric met on an island in the Loire near [[Amboise]] for face-to-face talks, which led to a peace treaty.

In 506, the [[Visigoths]] captured the city of [[Dertosa]] in the [[Ebro valley]]. There they captured the [[Roman usurper]] [[Peter (usurper)|Peter]] and had him executed.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Roger. ''Visigothic Spain, 409–711''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2004, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Vouillé and aftermath==
[[File:Reino de los visigodos-en.svg|thumb|right|The Kingdom of the [[Visigoths]] under Alaric II]]

After a few years, however, Clovis violated the peace treaty negotiated in 502. Despite the diplomatic intervention of [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]] and father-in-law of Alaric, Clovis led his followers into Visigothic territory. Alaric was forced by his magnates to meet Clovis in the [[Battle of Vouillé]] (summer 507) near Poitiers; there the Goths were defeated and Alaric slain, according to Gregory of Tours, by Clovis himself.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', pp. 292f&lt;/ref&gt;

The most serious consequence of this battle was not the loss of their possessions in [[Gaul]] to the Franks; with Ostrogothic help, much of the Gallic territory was recovered, Herwig Wolfram notes, perhaps as far as [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, ''History of the Goths'', p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was it the loss of the royal treasury at Toulouse, which Gregory of Tours writes Clovis took into his possession.&lt;ref name=Gregory-27/&gt; As Peter Heather notes, the Visigothic kingdom was thrown into disarray "by the death of its king in battle."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heather, ''The Goths'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Alaric's heirs were his eldest son, the illegitimate [[Gesalec]], and his younger son, the legitimate [[Amalaric]] who was still a child. Gesalec proved incompetent, and in 511 King Theodoric assumed the throne of the kingdom ostensibly on behalf of Amalaric—Heather uses the word "hijacked" to describe his action. Although Amalaric eventually became king in his own right, the political continuity of the Visigothic kingdom was broken; "Amalaric's succession was the result of new power structures, not old ones," as Heather describes it. With Amalaric's death in 531, the Visigothic kingdom entered an extended period of unrest which lasted until [[Leovigild]] assumed the throne in 568.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, ''The Goths'', p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ability as king ==
In religion Alaric was an [[Arianism|Arian]], like all the early Visigothic nobles, but he greatly mitigated the persecution policy of his father Euric toward the [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and authorized them to hold in 506 the council of [[Agde]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alaric II.|volume=1|page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on uneasy terms with the Catholic bishops of [[Arelate]] (modern Arles) as epitomized in the career of the Frankish [[Caesarius of Arles|Caesarius, bishop of Arles]], who was appointed bishop in 503. Caesarius was suspected of conspiring with the [[Burgundians]], whose king had married the sister of Clovis, to assist the Burgundians capture Arles. Alaric exiled him for a year to [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitania, then allowed him to return unharmed when the crisis had passed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/w/wace/biodict/htm/iii.iii.iv.htm Wace, ''Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaric displayed similar wisdom in political affairs by appointing a commission headed by the [[referendary]] [[Anianus (referendary)|Anianus]] to prepare an abstract of the Roman laws and imperial decrees, which would form the authoritative code for his Roman subjects. This is generally known as the ''Breviarium Alaricianum'' or [[Breviary of Alaric]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The {{ill|Montagne d'Alaric|fr}} (Alaric's Mountain) near [[Carcassonne]] is named after the Visigoth king.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rhedesium.com/the-legend-of-the-treasure-of-alaric.html The legend of the treasure of Alaric]''&lt;/ref&gt; Local rumour has it that he left a vast treasure buried in the caves beneath the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.corbieresweb.com/Montagne-d-Alaric Montagne d’Alaric]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{ill|Canal d'Alaric|fr}} (Alaric's [[Canal]]) in the [[Hautes-Pyrénées]] [[Departments of France|department]] is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2916">'''Alcher of Clairvaux''' was a twelfth-century [[Cistercian]] monk of [[Clairvaux Abbey]]. He was once thought to be the author of two works, now attributed by many scholars to an anonymous '''pseudo-Augustine''' of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;http://users.skynet.be/am012324/studium/oneil/bibper15.htm states that Alcher was at Clairvaux c.1150-1175, but the authorship as increasingly doubtful.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ioan P. Couliano, ''Eros and Magic in the Renaissance'' (1987) regards Alcher as more likely than Hugh of St Victor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Beryl Smalley]], ''Studies in Medieval Thought and Learning from Abelard to Wyclif'' (1981), p. 91, agrees with Raciti that the ''De spiritu et anima'' is not by Alcher, but disagrees with his suggestion of [[Peter Comestor]] as author.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Thomas Aquinas]] made the traditional attribution of the ''De spiritu et anima''&lt;ref&gt;Also ''Liber de anima et spiritu''.&lt;/ref&gt; to Alcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/XP/XP090.html Summa Theologica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5090.htm SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The form of the judge in coming to the judgment (Supplementum, Q. 90)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is now reckoned to be a compilation of c.1170, taken from [[Alcuin]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Cassiodorus]], [[Hugh of St Victor]], [[Isaac of Stella]], and [[Isidore of Seville]];&lt;ref&gt;Janet Coleman, ''Ancient and Medieval Memories: Studies in the Reconstruction of the Past'' (1992), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; also [[Boethius]].&lt;ref&gt;http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hwp213.htm, giving Alcher as author.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a source for medieval views on [[self-control]],&lt;ref&gt;Louis G. Kelly, ''The Mirror of Grammar: Theology, Philosophy, and the Modistae'' (2002), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and the doctrine that ''the soul rules the body''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', article ''Man'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''De diligendo Deo'' is a devotional work, also traditionally attributed to Alcher.

At one point in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Aquinas writes about ''De Spiritu et Anima'', "that book is not of great authority."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1079.htm#article8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alleluia Vigilia Nativitatis.png|300px|thumb|Alleluia for Christmas Eve, with [[Jubilus]] (verse has been omitted).]]

The form "Alleluia" is also used to refer to a [[liturgy|liturgical chant]] in which that word is combined with verses of Scripture, usually from the [[Psalms]]. This chant is commonly used before the proclamation of the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]].

==History==
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[Hallelujah|Halleluya]]'' as an expression of praise to God was preserved, untranslated, by the [[Early Christians]] as a superlative expression of thanksgiving, joy, and triumph. Thus it appears in the ancient Greek [[Liturgy of St. James]], which is still used to this day by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] and, in its Syriac recension is the prototype of that used by the [[Maronites]]. In the [http://www.liturgies.net/Liturgies/Eastern/TheDivineLiturgyofMark.htm Liturgy of St. Mark], apparently the most ancient of all, we find this rubric: "Then follow ''Let us attend'', the Apostle, and the Prologue of the Alleluia."—the "Apostle" is the usual ancient Eastern title for the [[Pauline Epistles|Epistle reading]], and the "Prologue of the Alleluia" would seem to be a prayer or verse before Alleluia was sung by the choir.

==Western use==
===Roman rite===
[[Image:Alleluia Vidimus Stellam.png|right|300px|thumb|Example of a pre-Gospel Alleluia with verse.]]
In the [[Roman Rite]] the word "Alleluia" is associated with joy and is especially favoured in [[Eastertide|Paschal time]], the time between [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]], perhaps because of the association of the ''[[Hallel]]'' (Alleluia psalms) chanted at [[Passover]]. During this time, the word is added widely to verses and responses associated with prayers, to antiphons of psalms, and, during the [[Octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of Easter and on Pentecost Sunday, to the dismissal at the end of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] ("[[Ite missa est]]").

On the other hand, the word "Alleluia" is excluded from the Roman liturgy during [[Lent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter II: The Structure Of The Mass, Its Elements, And Its Parts|url=http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/the-mass/general-instruction-of-the-roman-missal/girm-chapter-2.cfm|website=General Instruction Of The Roman Missal|publisher=usccb.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; often euphemistically referred to during this time as the "A-word".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite it is excluded also in the pre-Lenten [[Septuagesima]] period and in [[Requiem|Masses for the Dead]]. The same word, which normally follows the [[Gloria Patri]] at the beginning of each hour of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] and which in the present ordinary form of the Roman Rite is omitted during Lent, is replaced in pre-1970 forms by the phrase ''Laus tibi, Domine, rex aeternae gloriae'' (Praise to thee, O Lord, king of eternal glory) in Lent and the Septuagesima period.

The term "Alleluia" is used also to designate a chant beginning and ending with this word and including a verse of Scripture, in particular a chant to greet and welcome the Lord whose word will be proclaimed in the Gospel reading. The choir or a cantor sings "Alleluia". The congregation repeats this. The choir or cantor then sings a verse taken from the [[Lectionary|Mass Lectionary]] or the [[Roman Gradual]], after which the congregation again sings "Alleluia". In Lent the verse alone is sung or the word "Alleluia" is replaced by a different acclamation taken from the ''Gradual''. If singing is not used, the Alleluia and its verse may be omitted at any season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal], 62−63]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McNamara&gt;[https://zenit.org/articles/liturgy-q-a-the-alleluia-before-the-gospel/ Edward McNamara, "LITURGY Q &amp; A: The Alleluia Before the Gospel'' in ZENIT, 6 June 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2011/feb/28/gospel-acclamation-during-lent/ Jeff Ostrowski, "Gospel Acclamation During Lent"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex [[plainchant]] setting in the Roman Gradual requires a high degree of skill and is mostly used only in monasteries and seminaries.&lt;ref name=McNamara/&gt; This melismatic [[Gregorian chant]] opens with the cantor singing "Alleluia". The choir repeats it, adding to the final syllable a long [[melisma]] called a [[jubilus]]. (The ''[[Liber Usualis]]'' notates the repeat with the Roman numeral "ij" (2) and continues with the jubilus.) The cantor then sings the main part of the verse, and the choir joins in on the final line. The cantor then repeats the opening Alleluia, and the choir repeats only the jubilus. The music is generally ornate, but often within a narrow range. The Alleluia for Christmas Eve, for instance, has an [[ambitus (music)|ambitus]] of only a [[perfect fifth]], a rather extreme example.

Alleluias were frequently [[Trope (music)|troped]], both with added music and text. It is believed that some early Sequences derived from syllabic text being added to the jubilus, and may be named after the opening words of the Alleluia verse. Alleluias were also among the more frequently used chants to create early [[organum|organa]], such as in the [[Winchester Troper]].

In the pre-1970 form of the Roman-Rite Mass the Alleluia and its verse is replaced during Lent and Septuagesima time by a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]]. On the other hand, during Eastertide the [[Gradual]] is replaced with an Alleluia chant, thus putting two such chants before the Gospel reading.

==Eastern uses==
===Byzantine rite===
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholic]] Churches, after reading the Apostle (Epistle) at the [[Divine Liturgy]], the [[Reader (liturgy)#Orthodoxy|Reader]] announces which of the [[Octoechos|Eight Tones]] the Alleluia is to be chanted in. The response of the choir is always the same: "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia." What differs is the tone in which it is sung, and the [[stichera]] (psalm verses) which are intoned by the Reader.

The Alleluia is paired with the [[Prokeimenon]] which preceded the reading of the Apostle. There may be either one or two Alleluias, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (there may be up to three readings from the Apostle, but never be more than two Prokeimena and Alleluia).

In the Russian/Slavic order, the Alleluia is intoned in one of the two following manners, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (The Antiochian/Byzantine practice is slightly different):

====One Alleluia====
:''Deacon:'' "Let us attend."
:''Reader:'' "Alleluia in the ____ Tone."
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."
:The Reader then chants the first sticheron of the Alleluia.
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."
:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the Alleluia.
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."

====Two Alleluias====
:''Deacon:'' "Let us attend."
:''Reader:'' "Alleluia in the ____ Tone:" Then he immediately chants the first sticheron of the first Alleluia.
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."
:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the first Alleluia.
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."
:''Reader:'' "In the ____ Tone:" And he chants the first sticheron of the second Alleluia.
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."

====Lenten Alleluia====
Among the Orthodox, the chanting of Alleluia does not cease during Lent, as it does in the West. This is in accordance with the Orthodox approach to fasting, which is one of sober joy. During the weekdays of [[Great Lent]] and certain days during the lesser Lenten seasons ([[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]], and [[Dormition Fast]]), the celebration of the Divine Liturgy on weekdays is not permitted. Instead, Alleluia is chanted at [[Matins]]. Since this chanting of Alleluia at Matins is characteristic of Lenten services, Lenten days are referred to as "Days with Alleluia."

The Alleluia at Matins is not related to scripture readings or Prokeimena; instead, it replaces [[Theos Kyrios|"God is the Lord..."]] It is sung in the Tone of the Week and is followed by the Hymns to the Trinity (''Triadica'') in the same tone (see [[Octoechos (liturgy)#Use|Octoechos]] for an explanation of the eight-week cycle of tones).

"God is the Lord..." would normally be intoned by the deacon, but since the deacon does not serve on days with Alleluia, it is intoned by the priest. He stands in front of the [[icon]] of Christ on the [[Iconostasis]], and says:

:''Priest:'' "Alleluia in the ____ Tone: Out of the night my spirit waketh at dawn unto Thee, O God, for Thy commandments are a light upon the earth."
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."
:''Priest:'' "Learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth."
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."
:''Priest:'' "Zeal shall lay hold upon an uninstructed people."
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."
:''Priest:'' "Add more evils upon them, O Lord, lay more evils upon them that are glorious upon the earth."
:''Choir:'' "Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia."

====Alleluia for the departed====
Alleluia is also chanted to a special melody at [[Christian burial|funerals]], [[Panikhida|memorial services]] (Greek: ''Parastas'', Slavonic: ''Panikhida''), and on [[Saturdays of the Dead]]. Again, it is chanted in place of "God is the Lord...", but this time is followed by the [[Troparia]] of the Departed.

The Alleluia is intoned by the deacon (or the priest, if no deacon is available):

:''Deacon:'' "Alleluia, in the 8th tone: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord."
:''Choir'': "Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia."
:''Deacon:'' "Their memory is from generation to generation."
:''Choir'': "Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia."
:''Deacon:'' "Their souls will dwell amid good things."
:''Choir'': "Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia."

On Saturdays of the Dead, which are celebrated several times throughout the year, the [[prokeimenon]] at Vespers is also replaced with Alleluia, which is chanted in the following manner:

:''Deacon:'' "Alleluia, in the 8th tone.
:''Choir'': "Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia."
:''Deacon:'' "Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord."
:''Choir'': "Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia."
:''Deacon:'' "Their memory is from generation to generation."
:''Choir'': "Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia."

====Other uses====
[[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel readings]] are appointed for other services as well, particularly those in the [[Trebnik]]. A number of these are preceded by an Alleluia, in the same manner as that chanted at the Divine Liturgy, though sometimes there are no stichera (psalm verses).

During the [[Sacred Mystery]] (Sacrament) of [[Baptism]], in addition to the Alleluia before the Gospel, the choir also chants an Alleluia while the priest pours the [[Oil of Catechumens]] into the [[baptismal font]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15380">'''Alternatives assessment''' or '''alternatives analysis''' is a problem-solving approach used in [[environmental design]], [[environmental technology|technology]], and [[environmental policy|policy]]. It aims to minimize environmental harm by comparing multiple potential solutions in the context of a specific problem, design goal, or policy objective. It is intended to inform decision-making in situations with many possible courses of action, a wide range of variables to consider, and significant degrees of uncertainty. Alternatives assessment was originally developed as a robust way to guide [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] action and avoid [[Analysis paralysis|paralysis by analysis]]; authors such as O'Brien have presented alternatives assessment as an approach that is complementary to [[risk assessment]], the dominant decision-making approach in environmental policy.&lt;ref name="obrien_2000"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-15051-4| last = O'Brien| first = Mary| title = Making better environmental decisions: An alternative to risk assessment| location = Cambridge| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Ashford has described the similar concept of ''technology options analysis'' as a way to generate innovative solutions to the problems of industrial pollution more effectively than through risk-based regulation.&lt;ref name="ashford_1994"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Resources for the Future| isbn = 0-915707-74-8| pages = 275–314| editor = Adam M.

Alternatives assessment is practiced in a variety of settings, including but not limited to [[green chemistry]], [[sustainable design]], supply-chain chemicals management, and chemicals policy.&lt;ref name="geiser_2015"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-51206-0| last = Geiser| first = Ken| title = Chemicals without harm: Policies for a sustainable world| location = Cambridge, Mass.| series = Urban and industrial environments| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent application area for alternatives assessment is the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, also known as chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry| isbn = 978-1-84973-723-4| editor = Roy M.

== Methodology ==

Generally, alternatives assessment involves considering a number of possible options to achieve a specific objective, and applying a principled comparative analysis. The objective is usually to improve the environmental performance or safety of a specific product, material, process, or other activity. Potential alternatives considered in the analysis may include different chemical substances, materials, technologies, methods of use, or even extensive redesign to enable new ways of achieving the objective while avoiding the problem. Understanding the consequences of each available option is central to the process and goals of alternatives assessment, because this helps avoid decisions that substitute one problem with another (unknown) problem. The comparative analysis can involve any number of criteria for evaluating options, and these are typically focused on environmental health and sustainability.&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk"&gt;{{Cite conference| publisher = Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| last1 = Rossi| first1 = Mark| last2 = Tickner| first2 = Joel| last3 = Geiser| first3 = Ken| title = Alternatives assessment framework of the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production| location = Lowell, MA| url=http://www.sustainableproduction.org/downloads/FinalAltsAssess06_000.pdf| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single protocol that dictates how options should be identified, evaluated, and compared in an alternatives assessment. Rather, a number of different alternatives assessment ''frameworks'' exist, which serve to structure decision-making and to enable systematic consideration of the key factors. Jacobs and colleagues identify six major components of alternatives assessment: evaluation of [[Hazard (risk)|hazard]], exposure, [[Life-cycle assessment|life cycle]] impacts, technical feasibility, and economic feasibility; and an overall decision-making strategy.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1289/ehp.1409581| issn = 0091-6765| volume = 124| issue = 3| last1 = Jacobs| first1 = Molly M.| last2 = Malloy| first2 = Timothy F.| last3 = Tickner| first3 = Joel A.| last4 = Edwards| first4 = Sally| title = Alternatives assessment frameworks: Research needs for the informed substitution of hazardous chemicals| journal = Environmental Health Perspectives| date = 2016-03-01| pmid=26339778| pmc=4786344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major framework, the [https://www.uml.edu/research/lowell-center/ Lowell Center for Sustainable Production] Alternatives Assessment Framework,&lt;ref name="lowell_fwk" /&gt; conceives of alternatives assessment very broadly, as a reflexive problem-solving process that recognizes the social and technical complexity of environmental problems. It emphasizes aspects such as stakeholder participation, transparency of the process, and open discussion of values in decision-making. Most other frameworks are more narrow and primarily focused on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="jacobs_2016" /&gt;

=== Chemical alternatives assessment ===

Chemical alternatives assessment (or ''substitution of hazardous chemicals'') is the use of alternatives assessment for finding safer and environmentally preferable design options to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances. Safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals may simply be other chemical substances, or may involve deeper changes in material or product design.&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es1015789| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 44| issue = 24| pages = 9244–9249| last1 = Lavoie| first1 = Emma T.| last2 = Heine| first2 = Lauren G.| last3 = Holder| first3 = Helen| last4 = Rossi| first4 = Mark S.| last5 = Lee| first5 = Robert E.| last6 = Connor| first6 = Emily A.| last7 = Vrabel| first7 = Melanie A.| last8 = DiFiore| first8 = David M.| last9 = Davies| first9 = Clive L.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: Enabling substitution to safer chemicals| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2010-12-15| pmid=21062050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tickner_2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/es503328m| issn = 1520-5851| volume = 49| issue = 2| pages = 742–749| last1 = Tickner| first1 = Joel A.| last2 = Schifano| first2 = Jessica N.| last3 = Blake| first3 = Ann| last4 = Rudisill| first4 = Catherine| last5 = Mulvihill| first5 = Martin J.| title = Advancing safer alternatives through functional substitution| journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology| date = 2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment aims to provide the basis for well-informed decision-making by thoroughly characterizing chemicals and materials (and other design options) across a wide range of environmental and health impact categories. The rationale for this is to avoid shifting environmental health burdens from one category of impacts to another (e.g., substituting a [[carcinogen]]ic chemical with a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] one), 
and to minimize the [[unintended consequences]] of decisions made under conditions of uncertainty and ignorance—in other words, to prevent "[[Hazard substitution#Regrettable substitutions|regrettable substitutions]]", where an alternative appeared better based on limited knowledge, but turned out to be worse or equally bad.&lt;ref name="howard_2014"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.02.034| issn = 0045-6535| last = Howard| first = Gregory J.| title = Chemical alternatives assessment: The case of flame retardants| journal = Chemosphere| date = 2014| volume=116| pages=112–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An array of methodologies and tools for chemical alternatives assessment have been developed worldwide and have been deployed in a variety of industry sectors.&lt;ref name="harrison_hester" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oecd_toolbox"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| title = OECD substitution and alternatives assessment toolbox| url = http://www.oecdsaatoolbox.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical alternatives assessment frameworks include [[chemical hazard]] assessment methods that consider a wide range of hazard [[Clinical endpoint|endpoints]], such as those defined in the
[[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System]] or the [[GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals]].

=== Examples ===

* The Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute has conducted alternatives assessments for the substitution of hazardous substances like lead and formaldehyde.&lt;ref name="turi_five"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Toxics Use Reduction Institute| title = Five Chemicals Alternatives Assessment Study| accessdate = 2016-07-31| date = 2006| url = http://www.turi.org/TURI_Publications/TURI_Methods_Policy_Reports/Five_Chemicals_Alternatives_Assessment_Study._2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of alternatives assessment ==

Scientists from a variety of government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and firms have contributed to developing the practice of alternatives assessment.

=== In the United States ===

Scientific research in the US federal government has contributed to alternatives assessment frameworks and practices. In 2014 the [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] released a chemical alternatives assessment framework developed by an expert working group.&lt;ref name="nrc_2014"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The National Academies Press| isbn = 978-0-309-31013-0| author = National Research Council (US)| title = A framework to guide selection of chemical alternatives| location = Washington, D.C| url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18872/a-framework-to-guide-selection-of-chemical-alternatives| date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] ran a program called ''Design for the Environment'' (now called [https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice Safer Choice]), which developed chemical alternatives assessment methodology&lt;ref name="lavoie_2010" /&gt; and created partnerships to undertake numerous alternatives assessments for chemicals of concern in products.&lt;ref name="usepa_dfe"&gt;{{Cite web| author = US Environmental Protection Agency| title = Design for the Environment alternatives assessments| url = https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/design-environment-alternatives-assessments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives assessment has featured in some state-level chemicals policies and regulatory activities. The [[Massachusetts Toxics Use Reduction Institute]] has provided public technical assistance for "toxics use reduction planning", which includes alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="eliason_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.05.011| issn = 0959-6526| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 517–526| last1 = Eliason| first1 = Pamela| last2 = Morose| first2 = Gregory| title = Safer alternatives assessment: The Massachusetts process as a model for state governments| journal = Journal of Cleaner Production| date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] is implementing new regulations that require firms to undertake alternatives assessments for selected priority chemicals in products.&lt;ref name="ca_dtsc_aa"&gt;{{Cite web| author = California Department of Toxic Substances Control| title = Alternatives analysis| work = Safer Consumer Products (SCP)| url = http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/AA.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse, an association of state governments, has also produced its own guide to alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="ic2_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Interstate Chemicals Clearinghouse| title = IC2 Alternatives assessment guide, version 1.0| url=http://theic2.org/article/download-pdf/file_name/IC2_AA_Guide_Version_1.0.pdf| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some US-based companies have begun to use chemical alternatives assessment to address chemical safety issues in supply chains. For example, firms that participate in the [http://bizngo.org/ Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials] have produced their own guidance for chemical alternatives assessment.&lt;ref name="bizngo_aa"&gt;{{Citation| author = Business-NGO Working Group for Safer Chemicals and Sustainable Materials (BizNGO)| title = BizNGO chemical alternatives assessment protocol| url=http://www.bizngo.org/alternatives-assessment/chemical-alternatives-assessment-protocol| date = 2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the European Union ===

The Sweden-based non-governmental organization [[ChemSec]] has been active in developing resources and tools for the substitution of hazardous chemicals.  The [http://www.subsport.eu/ Substitution support portal (SUBSPORT)] is an EU-based collaboratively-developed resource for chemical substitution.&lt;ref name="lissner_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2190/NS.21.3.l| issn = 1541-3772| volume = 21| issue = 3| pages = 477–497| last1 = Lissner| first1 = Lothar| last2 = Romano| first2 = Dolores| title = Substitution for hazardous chemicals on an international level—The approach of the European project "SUBSPORT"| journal = NEW SOLUTIONS: A Journal of Environmental and Occupational Health Policy| date = 2011-01-01| pmid=22001043}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes alternatives assessment case studies.

[[File:Angel f-artificial intelligence.svg|thumb|right|200px|Angel_F]]
'''Angel_F''' is a fictional child [[artificial intelligence]] that has been used in worldwide art performances focused on the issues of digital liberties, [[intellectual property]] and on the evolution of language and behaviour in information society. The character was created by [[Salvatore Iaconesi]] in 2007 as a hack to the '''Biodoll''' art performance by Italian artist '''Franca Formenti'''. 

The project revolves around the story of the technological sensual relationship between the Biodoll, a digital prostitute, and professor '''[[Derrick de Kerckhove]]''', culminating in the birth of the young artificial intelligence. The digital child morphed from a [[spyware]] program capturing internet users' browsing activities in order to gather text to feed an algorithmic language generating system (thus letting the "child" learn how to speak) and became a digital personality used by the artists for both online and real-world performances.

The project was later joined by '''Oriana Persico''' who curated communication and part of the theoretical approaches of the action.

The Angel_F project has been featured in books, magazines, national televisions, and has been invited to many worldwide conferences and events, both academic and artistic. 

On one occasion, in October 2007, Angel_F attended the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) in Rio de Janeiro as the only digital being invited to speak: the young artificial intelligence was featured with a video message concerning the struggles for digital liberties, privacy, knowledge sharing and access to networks and technologies.

==History==

Angel_F is an acronym which stads for ''Autonomous Non Generative E-volitive Life_Form''. The project was born in 2007 and resulted from the fusion of two contemporary art performances.

Franca Formenti, an Italian artist living in Varese, invented the Biodoll  &lt;ref name="bazzichelli"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bazzichelli | first1 = Tatiana | title = [[Networking. La rete come arte]] | publisher = [[Costa &amp; Nolan]] | year= 2006 | isbn = 88-7437-047-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; character in 2002 which began making its appearances first on the network and later in the physical world by using what were called "clones": young women, prostitutes, pornographic starlets, transsexuals and models interpreting the role of a digital prostitute. The Biodoll was an art performance focused on research emerging from the network of new forms of sexualities, and on the analysis of changes brought on by this transformation to the concepts of private and public spaces, privacy, and the possibility of creating multiple fluid identities through language and digital media. At the time the Biodoll character claimed a role in professor Derrick de Kerckhove's life, narratively seducing him and alluring him into joining in the performance, becoming the Biodoll's favourite lover.

The theme of fertility has always been central to the Biodoll performance: the digital prostitute was a wombless clone but desired giving birth to a son, the '''Bloki'''.

In a process starting in 2006 and ending in February 2007, Salvatore Iaconesi (xDxD.vs.xDxD) used his '''Talker''' &lt;ref name="pagliarini"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pagliarini | first = Luigi | first2 = Elisa |last2=Frauenfelder |first3=Clementina |last3=Gily |first4=Domenico |last4=Jervolino |first5=Iginio Sisto |last5=Lancia |first6=Francesca |last6=Marone |first7=Alberto |last7=Oliviero |first8=Santa |last8=Palumbo |first9=Dunia |last9=Pepe |first10=Rocco |last10=Pititto |first11=Franco |last11=Rubinacci |first12=Francesca |last12=Serra |first13=Rosetta |last13=Zan | title = Intelligenza Polimorfa on Scienze cognitive e aperture pedagogiche. Nuovi orizzonti nella formazione degli insegnanti | publisher = Franco Angeli | year = 2007 | location = Rome | isbn = 978-88-464-9547-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; linguistic artificial intelligence to animate the digital child conceived with prof. Derrick de Kerckhove: ''Angel_F''.

Iaconesi and Persico met in November 2006 and immediately started collaborating on the birth of Angel_F.

Angel_F was designed as a synthetic digital being composed through narrative, technological and [[cognitive psychology]] layers. The objective was to create iconic characteristics that resulted in being evocative and able to mimic human life up to a level in which bringing up a symbolic dialogue was possible. On the other side, the artificial identity was to implement and expose the cultural, emotional and relational ways that were typical of networked [[Ecology#Ecosystem|social ecosystems]], among those technologies, systems and infrastructures that entered and shaped people's daily lives.

The young '''[[Artificial life|digital being]]''' mimicked the evolution of a human baby: initially conceived inside the website of its digital mother it emulated the birth of a child by using the metaphor of a virus developing inside a website, taking progressively more space in the domain's databases and interfaces. Content was produced through the software by using small browser-based spyware techniques, through which Angel_F could [[Inference|infer]] the list of major portals that had been visited by the website's users.

The Biodoll website was invaded by this growing presence and, thus, Angel_F was born.

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) component of Angel_F was derived from another project, Talker,&lt;ref name="talker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iaconesi |first=Salvatore |title=Talker |url=http://www.artisopensource.net/talkers/index2.html |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620081106/http://www.artisopensource.net/talkers/index2.html |archivedate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through which internet users could build up the AI's linguistic network by feeding it their text and web clips. Angel_F used this component to generate sentences and phrases, publishing them on the interface and on selected blogs.

The parallel between the growth of the AI and that of a child kept building up and, just as children learn how to speak and act by observing their parents and the people around them, Angel_F used its spyware and AI components to learn, to navigate websites and web portals using '''[[web crawler]]''' based techniques, and to interact with other people by using the contents hosted and generated in its database to create surreal dialogues in blogs and websites.

A virtual school was created, called '''Talker Mind''',&lt;ref name="talkermind"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iaconesi |first=Salvatore |title=Talker Mind |url=http://www.artisopensource.net/talker_mind/ |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620083741/http://www.artisopensource.net/talker_mind/ |archivedate=20 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to narratively continue the AI's growth. Five professors ([[Massimo Canevacci]], [[Antonio Caronia]], [[Carlo Formenti]], [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] and [[Luigi Pagliarini]]) fed their texts and academic articles to Angel_F, simulating virtual asynchronous lessons by using a multi-blog structure.&lt;ref name="blogart"&gt;{{cite web|last=Agricola de Cologne |first=Wilfred |title=a+b blogart? |url=http://www.javamuseum.org/blog/?page_id=41 |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212161016/http://www.javamuseum.org/blog/?page_id=41 |archivedate=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[peer-to-peer]] system was also created at the time, named '''Presence'''. Its interface resembled the one of [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit videogames]] and the peer to peer users travelled in a starry space and were able to perform standard [[Instant messaging|Instant Messaging]] tasks, such as [[Online chat|chat]] and [[file sharing]]. The interactions were possible both among humans and digital beings. Angel_F was the first user of the Presence peer to peer system.

Angel_F entered the physical world as a baby-stroller mounted laptop computer that was used to let the digital child join events and conferences held worldwide.

The first public space performance was held in [[Milan]], when the Biodoll distributed a generative ''free press'' publication &lt;ref name="bloki1"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Bloki FreePreXXX | date = 20 February 2007 | url = http://www.digicult.it/2007/biodoll.asp | accessdate = 4 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091023080104/http://www.digicult.it/2007/biodoll.asp| archivedate= 23 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called the '''Bloki FreePreXXX''', its text was generated algorithmically and inserted into a prepared graphic layout).

The second performance was held in [[Rome]], at the '''[[Forte Prenestino]]''' on June 14, 2007, with a massive playroom created through computational graphics that people could interact with and that were generated by the AI.

Angel_F performed all over the world, both in artistic contexts and in academic ones. It was also used for the communication strategy of several activist groups on the themes of intellectual property and digital freedoms.

On '''June 22, 2007''' Angel_F presented the closing remarks for an '''Ipotesi per Assurdo''' &lt;ref name="ipotesi"&gt;{{cite web | last = Iaconesi | first = Salvatore | title = Ipotesi per Assurdo | url = http://www.slideshare.net/xdxd/ipotesi-per-assurdo | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorello"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cortiana | first = Fiorello | title = Condividi la Conoscenza | url = http://db.formez.it/ArchivioNews.nsf/7fab7a7a86803f49c1256ae800400917/e0fe4b680b8434cac12572f700334708/Testo/M2/condividi_conoscenza3_programma.pdf?OpenElement&amp;ei=7-TJSp_AO86OsAb085ThDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHk5FlR8u4tI39Rv-PQAro3_D_0KQ&amp;sig2=oDMREwxxZ76tCx919Tpuww | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Absurd Hypothesis) with Salvatore Iaconesi and Oriana Persico at the [[IULM| IULM University in Milan]], discussing the possibilities for an ecosystemic, sustainable reinvention of corporations.

On '''July 28, 2007''', hundreds of people at '''LiberaFesta''' (Free Party) in Rome listened to Angel_F in a speech discussing new politics and ''hacker ethics''.

On '''October 2007''', Angel_F was presented live at the ''FE/MALE 2'' event, as an example of an atypical family during a public debate on new sexualities and social change.

Again in '''October 2007''', Angel_F made a series of public performances [[Florence]]'s '''Festival della Creatività''' (Festival of Creativity), an institutional event held periodically to showcase Italy's and other countries' best technological projects. During the festival Derrick de Kerckhove publicly recognized the little AI as his digital son.&lt;ref name="derickpapa"&gt;{{cite web | last = de Kerckhove | first = Derrick | title = Festival della Creatività | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD3UVluoF0c | accessdate = 4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On '''October 2008''', Angel_F was used at a public event on a European scale called '''Freedom not Fear''' discussing privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref name="fnf"&gt;{{cite web | title = Freedom Not Fear | url = http://www.artsblog.it/post/2428/incursione-digitale-di-angel_f-e-del-super-avatar-al-freedom-not-fear-in-esclusiva-per-i-lettori-di-artsblog | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately ('''July 2009''') Angel_F has been seen with its digital father Derrick de Kerckhove to protest against Italy's harsh politics on freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="angelino"&gt;{{cite web | title = Blogger Strike in Piazza Navona | url = http://www.artsblog.it/post/3645/angelino-is-watching-you | accessdate = 5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case of censorship saw Angel_F involved, when it was not allowed to post its contribution to the '''DFIR''' (Dialogue Forum for Internet Rights) held in ''Rome'' on '''September 2007''' in preparation for Rio de Janeiro's Internet Governance Forum (IGF) edition.&lt;ref name="vetere"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vetere |first=Guido |title=L'identità di Angel_F |url=http://guidovetere.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2007/09/angel_f.html |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114081406/http://guidovetere.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/2007/09/angel_f.html |archivedate=14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case quickly turned into a collaboration among the involved parties &lt;ref name="dicorinto"&gt;[[:it:Arturo Di Corinto|Arturo di Corinto]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Angel_F was invited to the global event in Brazil where it was the only present digital being: on that occasion Angel_F contributed a videomessage, in the digital freedoms workshop, which suggested some ideas for action to the [[United Nations]] and to all the parties involved in the global ''IGF'' organization.

==Background==

Angel_F mixes real technologically advanced systems with a poetic, narrative approach. In the performance real and not-real are constantly intermixed, and the concepts, techniques and characteristics of the whole project have been analyzed multiple times in several international academic events and research projects.

Angel_F's authors coined the term '''[[NeoRealismo Virtuale]]''' (Virtual NeoRealism) to identify the practices created and used in the project.

'''Anti-union violence''' is physical force intended to harm [[trade union|union]] officials, union organizers, union members, union sympathizers, or their families. It is most commonly used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.

Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, [[intimidation]], impersonation, [[disinformation]], and [[sabotage]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318&lt;/ref&gt; for example the hiring and deployment of [[goon squad]]s to assault strikers.

Incidents of violence during periods of labor unrest are sometimes perceived differently by different parties. It is sometimes a challenge to ascertain the truth about labor-related violence, and [[Union violence|incidents of violence committed by, or in the name of, unions or union workers have occurred]] as well.

== History ==

The practice of workers organizing, and meeting resistance for organizing, dates to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;John Romer, ''Ancient Lives; the story of the Pharaoh's Tombmakers. London'': Phoenix Press, 1984, pp. 116-123 See also E.F. Wente, "A letter of complaint to the Vizier To", in ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 20, 1961 and W.F. Edgerton, "The strikes in Ramses III's Twenty-ninth year", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 10, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first known individual killed by authorities for labor activities is likely Cinto Brandini, executed with nine others in 1345 Florence for attempting to organize woolcombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James C. Docherty|first1=Sjaak van der Velden|title=Historical Dictionary of Organized Labor|date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=xxv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAdZaqTetVsC&amp;pg=PR25&amp;lpg=PR25|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent [[Labor history of the United States|labor history]] of any industrial nation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mass labor violence in the U.S. peaked in the early 20th century and has largely subsided since the 1940s.  But the deadly suppression of labor unions on a large scale persists into the new century, in the 2012 [[Marikana killings]] in South Africa, in the ongoing assassinations of [[Trade unions in Colombia|trade union members in Colombia]], and the South Korean government's response to [[Korean Confederation of Trade Unions]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Hyun|title=South Korea Labor Strikes Back|url=http://fpif.org/south-korean-labor-strikes-back/|accessdate=18 April 2016|publisher=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

Since unions are organized to achieve [[collective bargaining]] power to begin with, most union conflicts have been motivated primarily by economic issues (wages, working hours, safety conditions, work rules, etc.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lalor|first1=John Joseph|title=Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, Volume 3|date=1890|publisher=C. E. Merrill &amp; Company|page=816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6g9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA816|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have engaged antagonists (employers, hired strikebreakers, replacement workers, local law enforcement) with economic goals in mind.  In some instances, however, other causes emerge.

===Race===

[[File:Randrebellion.png|right|thumb|French cartoon of the [[Rand Rebellion]] in South Africa, 1922]]

The 1887 [[Thibodaux massacre]] in [[Louisiana]], the 1899 [[Pana riot]] in southern [[Illinois]], and the 1911 [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway#1911 strike|Queen &amp; Crescent killings]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] are three examples of deliberate campaigns of murder against organized black workers in the American south, the first committed by landowners, the other two by white competitors.

In South Africa the 1922 [[Rand Rebellion]] also had underlying racial causes, taking on the slogan "''Workers of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workmall.com/wfb2001/south_africa/south_africa_history_conflict_in_the_1920s.html|title=South Africa  Conflict in the 1920s - Flags, Maps, Economy, Geography, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|work=workmall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; before their strike grew to a small-scale rebellion at the cost of 200 lives.  The behavior of South African police in the [[1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike]] is said to have led to the formation of the [[Northern Rhodesian African Mineworkers' Union]] in 1949 as a cornerstone of the anti-apartheid movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The African Miners' Strike of 1946 |first=M. P. |last=Naicker |url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4727l |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505153758/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4727l |archivedate=2016-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political power===

As with race, for some incidents there is no clear distinction between anti-union violence and political suppression.  Polish labor unions were centrally involved in workers’ uprisings and/or general strikes that challenged the sitting governments in [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|1905]], [[1923 Kraków riot|1923]], and [[1937 peasant strike in Poland|1937]].  In a similar way the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|strike of Asturian miners in 1934]], put down by right-wing Spanish government forces with great loss of life, amounted to an insurrection through work stoppage, not an economic labor action.   Unions continued to play a political and military role in the subsequent [[Spanish Civil War]].

Along with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in Spain, other totalitarian regimes in Europe brought their labor unions under government control, violently when necessary.  After coming to power as chancellor in January 1933, Adolf Hitler declared May Day a national holiday, then on May 2, 1933 unexpectedly moved to outlaw labor unions as part of the Nazi "[[Gleichschaltung|synchronization]]" process.   Major unions such as the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]] were raided that day, their accounts seized, and their leaders (Gustav Schiefer, [[Wilhelm Leuschner]], Erich Luebbe) arrested and sent to concentration camps.  (The bodies of four murdered trade union officials in Duisburg were only found a year later, in April 1934.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=Neil|title=Nazism|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9FFAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every worker in the nation was then compelled to join the single party-controlled union, the [[German Labour Front]].  Similar coercive violence was exercised against labor unions in conquered nations, as in the Netherlands in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warmbrunn|first1=Werner|title=The Dutch Under German Occupation, 1940-1945|date=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykWfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of violence ==

Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing [[Anna LoPizzo]].&lt;ref&gt;William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the [[Frank Little (unionist)|hanging of union organizer Frank Little]] from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]]. A note was pinned to his body which said, "Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the "L" for Frank Little circled.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". At the Forbes tent colony,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes..."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G. Reuther|Victor Reuther]] and others in 1937, "[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized [[tear gas]] attacks and mounted charges."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been cases where violence has been perpetrated or encouraged by agents of management, intending it to be blamed on the union.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 317&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, violence against unions in the United States has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, such as the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]], [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin Felts]], [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns]], or [[Thiel Detective Service Company|Thiel]] detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the [[Citizens' Alliance]]; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''From Blackjacks To Briefcases'', Robert Michael Smith states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies "spawned violence and wreaked havoc" on the labor movement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Morris Friedman]], detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a "bitter struggle" between capital and labor could be counted upon to create "satisfaction and immense profit" for agencies such as the Pinkerton company.&lt;ref&gt;The Pinkerton Labor Spy, Morris Friedman, Wilshire Book Company, 1907, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest union busters in the United States, [[Corporations Auxiliary Company]], had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Lattimer massacre]], nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]], on September 10, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John W. ''Transitions: From Eastern Europe to Anthracite Community to College Classroom.'' Bloomington, Ind.: iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-33732-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William. ''Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth.'' State College, Penn.: Penn State Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-271-02214-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Colorado Labor Wars]], martial law was imposed by the Colorado National Guard in order to put down striking miners. A study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, "There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, H. "The Ludlow Massacre", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346–349&lt;/ref&gt; During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death Special". In 1917, [[Frank Little (unionist)|union organizer Frank Little]] was hanged from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]], with a note pinned to his body which carried a "warning" to other labor activists.&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, during another coal strike in [[Colorado]], state police and mine guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to be called the [[Columbine Mine massacre|Columbine Mine Massacre]].

By the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation related to employer strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1950s, employers began to embrace new methods of managing workers and unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases — A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canada
* With casualties as one indication of its national history, a union pamphlet published in 2006 counted a total of 24 "Canadian Labour Martyrs" since 1903, a number that includes Joseph Mairs of the Vancouver Island War of 1912-14, coal miner [[Albert Goodwin]] killed in 1918, miner [[William Davis (miner)|Bill Davis]] of Nova Scotia (namesake of the [[William Davis Miners' Memorial Day]]), and the 1929 case of [[Rosvall and Voutilainen]] in [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Pamphlet of Canadian Labour Martyrs|url=http://iww.ca/?p=225|website=International Workers of the World Canada|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Rosvall and Voutilainen were murdered for their pro-union efforts resulting in the authorities in Thunder Bay conducting a major cover up in an attempt to conceal the truth.  Thunder Bay remains a hot bed of anti-union violence against pro-union individuals resulting in Thunder Bay being labelled the Capital of Anti-union Violence of Canada.

;Mexico
* the [[Cananea strike]] of organized mine workers in June 1906, and the [[Río Blanco strike]] of unionized textile workers in January 1907, became two linked symbols of the corruption and civil repression of the administration of Mexican president [[Porfirio Díaz]].  They became "household words for hundreds of thousands of Mexicans".&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Latin America, by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press, 1986, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and South America ===

;Argentina
* approximately 1,500 striking rural workers were shot and killed by the [[Argentine Army]] in the [[Patagonia Rebelde|Patagonia Uprising]] between 1920 and 1922

;Bolivia
* government forces killed at least 19 striking mine workers in the [[Catavi Massacre]] of December 1942; the workers themselves counted 400 dead
* popular protests against the November 1, 1979 ''coup d'état'' of [[Alberto Natusch Busch]], protests led by the [[Central Obrera Boliviana]] (COB) trade union confederation, were met with [[All Saints' massacre|violence from the military]].  Perhaps 100 were killed, but the new government was overthrown within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Asociación de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos y Mártires por la Liberación Nacional (Bolivia), Fundación Solón, and Capítulo Boliviano de Derechos Humanos, Democracia y Desarrollo.

;Chile
* the [[Santa María School massacre]] was a [[massacre]] of striking nitrate miners, with wives and children, committed by the [[Chilean Army]] in [[Iquique]], [[Chile]] on December 21, 1907.  The number of victims has been estimated at 2,000

;Venezuela
* As of 2010, some 75 union organizers and union members had been killed in the prior two years, according to figures compiled by the Catholic Church.

'''Assisted reproductive technology''' ('''ART''') are medical procedures used primarily to address [[infertility]]. It includes procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]]. It may include [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI), [[cryopreservation]] of gametes or embryos, and/or may involve the use of  [[fertility medication]]. When used to address infertility, it may also be referred to as '''fertility treatment.''' ART mainly belongs to the field of [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility|reproductive endocrinology and infertility.]] Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons ([[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]). ART may also be used in [[surrogacy]] arrangements, although not all surrogacy arrangements involve ART.

==Procedures==

===General===
With ART, the process of [[sexual intercourse]] is bypassed and fertilization of the [[oocyte]]s occurs in the laboratory environment (i.e., [[in vitro fertilization]]).

In the US, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)—which is required as a result of the 1992 ''Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act'' to publish the annual ART success rates at U.S. fertility clinics—defines ART to include "all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman."  According to CDC, "they do not include treatments in which only sperm are handled (i.e., intrauterine—or artificial—insemination) or procedures in which a woman takes medicine only to stimulate egg production without the intention of having eggs retrieved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Assisted Reproductive Technology? {{!}} Reproductive Health  {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/art/whatis.html|publisher=CDC|date=November 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101183209/https://www.cdc.gov/art/whatis.html|archivedate=November 1, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, ART also excludes artificial insemination and includes only procedures where oocytes are handled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=European IVF-Monitoring Consortium (EIM) for the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology|last2=Calhaz-Jorge|first2=C., et al|last10=Wyns|title=Assisted reproductive technology in Europe, 2012: results generated from European registers by ESHRE.|journal=Human reproduction (Oxford, England)|date=August 2016|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1638–52|pmid=27496943|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/17/humrep.dew151.full|doi=10.1093/humrep/dew151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorenson|first1=Corinna|title=ART in the European Union|journal=Euro Observer Euro Observer|date=Autumn 2006|volume=8|issue=4|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/80371/EuroObserver8_4.pdf?ua=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129022850/http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/80371/EuroObserver8_4.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2016-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO also defines ART this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zegers-Hochschild|first1=F, et al|last2=for the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology and the World Health Organization|title=International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology (ICMART) and the World Health Organization (WHO) revised glossary of ART terminology, 2009.|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=November 2009|volume=92|issue=5|pages=1520–4|pmid=19828144|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/infertility/art_terminology2.pdf?ua=1|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.09.009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129024154/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/infertility/art_terminology2.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2016-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility medication===
Most fertility medications are agents that stimulate the development of follicles in the ovary. Examples are gonadotropins and gonadotropin releasing hormone.

===In vitro fertilization===
In vitro fertilization is the technique of letting [[fertilization]] of the male and female [[gametes]] (sperm and egg) occur outside the female body.

Techniques usually used in in vitro fertilization include:
* [[Transvaginal ovum retrieval]] (OVR) is the process whereby a small needle is inserted through the back of the vagina and guided via ultrasound into the ovarian follicles to collect the fluid that contains the eggs.
* [[Embryo transfer]] is the step in the process whereby one or several embryos are placed into the uterus of the female with the intent to establish a pregnancy.
Less commonly used techniques in in vitro fertilization are: 
* [[Assisted zona hatching]] (AZH) is performed shortly before the embryo is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the implantation process of the growing embryo.
* [[Image:In_vitro_fertilization.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]][[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) is beneficial in the case of male factor infertility where sperm counts are very low or failed fertilization occurred with previous IVF attempt(s). The ICSI procedure involves a single sperm carefully injected into the center of an egg using a microneedle. With ICSI, only one sperm per egg is needed. Without ICSI, you need between 50,000 and 100,000.  This method is also sometimes employed when donor sperm is used.
* [[Autologous endometrial coculture]] is a possible treatment for patients who have failed previous IVF attempts or who have poor embryo quality. The patient's fertilized eggs are placed on top of a layer of cells from the patient's own uterine lining, creating a more natural environment for embryo development.
* In [[zygote intrafallopian transfer]] (ZIFT), egg cells are removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilized in the laboratory; the resulting zygote is then placed into the fallopian tube.
* [[Cytoplasmic transfer]] is the technique in which the contents of a fertile egg from a donor are injected into the infertile egg of the patient along with the sperm.
* [[Egg donor]]s are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or [[advanced maternal age]]. In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilized in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus.
* [[Sperm donation]] may provide the source for the sperm used in IVF procedures where the male partner produces no sperm or has an inheritable disease, or where the woman being treated has no male partner.
* [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) involves the use of genetic screening mechanisms such as fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to help identify genetically abnormal embryos and improve healthy outcomes.
* [[Embryo splitting (disambiguation)|Embryo splitting]] can be used for twinning to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 2|pages= 423–7|date=February 2009 |pmid=19217091 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.098 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis===
A [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]] procedure may be conducted on [[embryo]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] (as a form of [[embryo profiling]]), and sometimes even of [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to [[prenatal diagnosis]]. When used to screen for a specific [[genetic disease]], its main advantage is that it avoids selective [[abortion|pregnancy termination]] as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612258/are-we-designing-inequality-into-our-genes/|title=Designer babies aren’t futuristic. They’re already here.|last=Hercher|first=Laura|date=2018-10-22|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGD thus is an adjunct to ART procedures, and requires [in vitro fertilization to obtain [[oocytes]] or [[embryo]]s for evaluation. Embryos are generally obtained through blastomere or blastocyst biopsy. The latter technique has proved to be less deleterious for the embryo, therefore it is advisable to perform the biopsy around day 5 or 6 of development.&lt;ref name=Sullivan-Pyke2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sullivan-Pyke |first1=C |last2=Dokras |first2=A |title=Preimplantation Genetic Screening and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis. |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America |date=March 2018 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=113-125 |doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2017.10.009 |pmid=29428279}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sex selection]] is the attempt to control the sex of offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post-implantation of an embryo, as well as at birth. Pre-implantation techniques include PGD, but also [[sperm sorting]].

===Others===
Other assisted reproduction techniques include:
* [[Mitochondrial replacement therapy]] (MRT, sometimes called mitochondrial donation) is the replacement of [[mitochondria]] in one or more cells to prevent or ameliorate disease. MRT originated as a special form of IVF in which some or all of the future baby's [[mitochondrial DNA]] comes from a third party. This technique is used in cases when mothers carry genes for [[mitochondrial diseases]]. The therapy is approved for use in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=NAS2016ethics&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Ethical and Social Policy Considerations of Novel Techniques for Prevention of Maternal Transmission of Mitochondrial DNA Diseases|last2=Board on Health Sciences Policy|last3=Institute of Medicine|editor1-last=Claiborne|editor1-first=Anne|editor2-last=English|editor2-first=Rebecca|editor3-last=Kahn|editor3-first=Jeffrey|title=Mitochondrial Replacement Techniques:  Ethical, Social, and Policy Considerations|date=2016|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-38870-2|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/21871/chapter/1}} [http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2016/Mitochondrial-Replacement-Techniques Index page] with links to summaries including [http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2016/Mitochondrial%20Replacement%20Techniques/mito%20ethics%20infographic_FINAL.pdf one page summary flyer].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2015CreeRev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cree|first1=L|last2=Loi|first2=P|title=Mitochondrial replacement: from basic research to assisted reproductive technology portfolio tool-technicalities and possible risks.|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|date=January 2015|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–10|pmid=25425606|doi=10.1093/molehr/gau082}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]] (GIFT) a mixture of sperm and eggs is placed directly into a woman's fallopian tubes using laparoscopy following a transvaginal ovum retrieval.
* [[Reproductive surgery]], treating e.g. [[fallopian tube obstruction]] and [[vas deferens obstruction]], or reversing a [[vasectomy]] by a [[reverse vasectomy]]. In [[surgical sperm retrieval]] (SSR) the reproductive urologist obtains sperm from the vas deferens, epididymis or directly from the testis in a short outpatient procedure.
* By [[cryopreservation]], eggs, sperm and reproductive tissue can be preserved for later IVF.

==Risks==
The majority of IVF-conceived infants do not have [[congenital disorder|birth defect]]s.&lt;ref name="Van Voorhis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Voorhis BJ |year=2007 |title=Clinical practice. In vitro fertilization |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |volume=356 |issue=4 |pages=379–86 |pmid=17251534 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp065743}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some studies have suggested that assisted reproductive technology is associated with an increased risk of birth defects.&lt;ref name="Kurinczuk 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurinczuk JJ, Hansen M, Bower C |year=2004 |title=The risk of birth defects in children born after assisted reproductive technologies |journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=201–9 |pmid=15129049 |doi=10.1097/00001703-200406000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hansen M, Bower C, Milne E, de Klerk N, Kurinczuk JJ |year=2005 |title=Assisted reproductive technologies and the risk of birth defects—a systematic review |journal=Hum Reprod |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=328–38 |pmid=15567881 |url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/2/328.pdf |doi=10.1093/humrep/deh593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artificial reproductive technology is becoming more available. Early studies suggest that there could be an increased risk for medical complications with both the mother and baby. Some of these include low birth weight, placental insufficiency, chromosomal disorders, preterm deliveries, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia(Aiken and Brockelsby).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S096553951600005X|title=Fetal and Maternal Consequences of Pregnancies Conceived Using Art|journal=Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=281–294|year=2016|last1=Aiken|first1=Catherine E. M.|last2=Brockelsby|first2=Jeremy C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the largest U.S. study, which used data from a statewide registry of birth defects,&lt;ref name="Olson 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson CK, Keppler-Noreuil KM, Romitti PA, Budelier WT, Ryan G, Sparks AE, Van Voorhis BJ |year=2005 |title=In vitro fertilization is associated with an increase in major birth defects |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1308–15 |pmid=16275219 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.03.086}}&lt;/ref&gt;
6.2% of IVF-conceived children had major defects, as compared with 4.4% of naturally conceived children matched for [[maternal age effect|maternal age]] and other factors ([[odds ratio]], 1.3; 95% [[confidence interval]], 1.00 to 1.67).&lt;ref name="Van Voorhis 2007"/&gt; ART carries with it a risk for [[heterotopic pregnancy]] (simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obgmanagement.com/the-latest/feature-articles/article/what-you-should-know-about-heterotopic-pregnancy/56cf1776e64a3aecc3e2b9f225cbc001.html?tx_ttnews%5BsViewPointer%5D=1|title=What you should know about heterotopic pregnancy : OBG Management|last=MD|first=Daniel M. Avery, MD, Marion D. Reed, MD, William L. Lenahan,|website=www.obgmanagement.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The main risks are:
* [[Genetic disorder]]s
* [[Low birth weight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007279.htm|title=In vitro fertilization (IVF): MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In IVF and ICSI, a risk factor is the decreased expression of proteins in [[energy metabolism]]; [[Ferritin light chain]] and [[ATP5A1]].&lt;ref name=zhang&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Zhang YL, Feng C |title=Comparative proteomic analysis of human placenta derived from assisted reproductive technology |journal=Proteomics |volume= 8|issue= 20|pages= 4344–56|date=September 2008 |pmid=18792929 |doi=10.1002/pmic.200800294 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Preterm birth]]. Low birth weight and preterm birth are strongly associated with many health problems, such as [[visual impairment]] and [[cerebral palsy]], and children born after IVF are roughly twice as likely to have cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |year=2009 |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |title=Cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorders, and developmental delay in children born after assisted conception: a systematic review and meta-analysis |vauthors=Hvidtjørn D, Schieve L, Schendel D, Jacobsson B, Sværke C, Thorsen P |pmid=19124707 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/72 |doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2008.507 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062747/http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/72 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other risk factors are:
* [[Membrane damage]]{{Citation needed|reason=The reference Zhang'08 does not contain any direct data on membrane damage.|date=January 2014}}, which may be reflected by increased expression of the [[membrane fusion protein]]s [[NAPA (gene)|NAPA]] and [[Annexin A3]].&lt;ref name=zhang/&gt;
[[Sperm donation]] is an exception, with a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared to the general population. It may be explained by that sperm banks accept only people with high sperm count.

Current data indicate little or no increased risk for [[postpartum depression]] among women who use ART.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq025|title=Risk for postpartum depression associated with assisted reproductive technologies and multiple births: A systematic review|year=2010|last1=Ross|first1=L.

Usage of assisted reproductive technology including [[Ovulation induction|ovarian stimulation]] and [[in vitro fertilization]] have been associated with an increased overall risk of [[childhood cancer]] in the offspring, which may be caused by the same original disease or condition that caused the infertility or subfertility in the mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23562045|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.017|title=Fertility treatment and childhood cancer risk: A systematic meta-analysis|year=2013|last1=Hargreave|first1=Marie|last2=Jensen|first2=Allan|last3=Toender|first3=Anita|last4=Andersen|first4=Klaus Kaae|last5=Kjaer|first5=Susanne Krüger|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|pages=150–61|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===Ethics===
Some couples find it difficult to stop treatment despite very bad prognosis, resulting in futile therapies. This may give ART providers a difficult decision of whether to continue or refuse treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine | title = Fertility treatment when the prognosis is very poor or futile | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1194–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19726040 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.07.979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===

====United States====
Many Americans do not have [[health insurance|insurance]] coverage for fertility investigations and treatments. Many states are starting to mandate coverage, and the rate of use is 278% higher in states with complete coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain T, Harlow BL, Hornstein MD |title=Insurance coverage and outcomes of ''in vitro'' fertilization |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=347 |issue=9 |pages=661–6 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12200554 |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa013491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some health insurance companies that cover diagnosis of infertility but frequently once diagnosed will not cover any treatment costs.

2005 approximate treatment/diagnosis costs (United States, costs in US$):
* Initial workup: [[hysteroscopy]], [[hysterosalpingogram]], [[blood test]]s ~$2,000
* Sonohysterogram (SHG) ~ $600–$1,000
* Clomiphene citrate cycle ~ $200–$500
* IVF cycle ~ $10,000–$30,000
* Use of a [[surrogate mother]] to carry the child – dependent on arrangements
Another way to look at costs is to determine the expected cost of establishing a pregnancy. Thus if a clomiphene treatment has a chance to establish a pregnancy in 8% of cycles and costs $500, the expected cost is $6,000 to establish a pregnancy, compared to an IVF cycle (cycle fecundity 40%) with a corresponding expected cost of $30,000 ($12,000/.4).

For the community as a whole, the cost of IVF on average pays back by 700% by tax from future employment by the conceived human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Connolly MP, Pollard MS, Hoorens S, Kaplan BR, Oskowitz SP, Silber SJ |title=Long-term economic benefits attributed to IVF-conceived children: a lifetime tax calculation |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=598–604 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18778175 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/pubMed.php?pii=10709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, all patients have the right to preliminary testing, provided free of charge by the [[National Health Service]]. However, treatment is not widely available on the NHS and there can be long waiting lists. Many patients therefore pay for immediate treatment within the NHS or seek help from private clinics.

In 2013, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] published new guidelines about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IVF|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/IVF/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420030919/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/IVF/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archivedate=20 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines also say women aged between 40 and 42 should be offered one cycle of IVF on the NHS if all of the following additional criteria are also met: They have never had IVF treatment before, have no evidence of low ovarian reserve (this is when eggs in the ovary are low in number or low in quality) and have been informed of the additional implications of IVF and pregnancy at this age. However, if tests show IVF is the only treatment likely to help them get pregnant, women should be referred for IVF straight away.

This policy is often modified by local Clinical Commissioning Groups, in a fairly blatant breach of the [[NHS Constitution for England]] which provides that patients have the right to drugs and treatments that have been recommended by NICE for use in the NHS.  For example, the Cheshire, Merseyside and West Lancashire [[Clinical Commissioning Group]] insists on additional conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Services &amp; how we can help|url=http://www.thehewittfertilitycentre.org.uk/funding-options/|publisher=Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust|accessdate=19 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624054259/http://thehewittfertilitycentre.org.uk/funding-options/|archivedate=2014-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The person undergoing treatment must have commenced treatment before her 40th birthday.
* The person undergoing treatment must have a BMI of between 19 and 29.
* Neither partner must have any living children, from either the current or previous relationships. This includes adopted as well as biological children.
* Sub-fertility must not be the direct result of a sterilisation procedure in either partner (this does not include conditions where sterilisation occurs as a result of another medical problem). Couples who have undertaken a reversal of their sterilisation procedure are not eligible for treatment.

====Canada====
{{see also|Assisted Human Reproduction Act}}
Some treatments are covered by OHIP (public health insurance) in Ontario and others are not. Those with bilaterally blocked fallopian tubes and under 40 have treatment is covered but are still required to pay lab fees (around $3,000–4,000).  Coverage varies in other provinces.  Most other patients are required to pay for treatments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivfcanada.com/services/fees/general_fee_schedule.cfm IVF Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808064341/http://www.ivfcanada.com/services/fees/general_fee_schedule.cfm |date=2009-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Israel's national health insurance, which is mandatory for all Israeli citizens, covers nearly all fertility treatments. IVF costs are fully subsidized up to the birth of two children for all Israeli women, including single women and lesbian couples. Embryo transfers for purposes of gestational surrogacy are also covered.&lt;ref&gt;Teman, Elly. 2010.

====Germany====
On 27 January 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional, that the health insurance companies have to bear only 50% of the cost for IVF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samenspender-info.de/zuschuesse-kuenstliche-befruchtung.html Zuschüsse der Krankenversicherung für eine künstliche Befruchtung ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208072207/http://www.samenspender-info.de/zuschuesse-kuenstliche-befruchtung.html |date=2013-02-08 }} Retrieved 2. January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2012, the Federal Council has approved a draft law of some federal states, which provides that the federal government provides a subsidy of 25% to the cost. Thus, the share of costs borne for the pair would drop to just 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insemination-erfolg.de/finanzierung-befruchtung.html Finanzierung künstlicher Befruchtung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219152136/http://www.insemination-erfolg.de/finanzierung-befruchtung.html |date=2013-02-19 }} Retrieved 2.

===Fictional representation===
Films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/art/chi-0621-fertility-dramasjun21,0,2997759.story chicagotribune.com --&gt; Heartache of infertility shared on stage, screen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120703180716/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-21/news/0906190243_1_fertility-treatments-ovulation-artificial-insemination |date=2012-07-03 }} By Colleen Mastony, Tribune reporter.

''For specific examples, refer to the fiction sections in individual subarticles, e.g. [[Surrogacy#Fictional representation|surrogacy]], [[Sperm donor#Fictional representation|sperm donation]] and [[fertility clinic]].''

In addition, [[reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction]] has been present for many decades.

==Research and speculative uses==
The idea of using future ART techniques, including direct human germline engineering technologies, to select and genetically modify embryos for the purpose of [[human enhancement]] has been referred to as '''designer babies''', '''reprogenetics''', and '''liberal eugenics''' and has been discussed since the introduction of [[biotechnology]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon JW |title=Genetic enhancement in humans |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5410 |pages=2023–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10206908 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5410.2023 |bibcode=1999Sci...283.2023G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/embryo-screening-and-the-ethics-of-human-60561 Pray, L.

An '''astronaut propulsion unit&lt;!-- Name chosen to avoid confusion with AMU --&gt;''' (or '''astronaut maneuvering unit''') is used to move an astronaut relative to the spaceship during a [[spacewalk]]. The first astronaut propulsion unit was the [[Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit]] (HHMU) used on [[Gemini 4]].

==Models==&lt;!-- Chronological Order --&gt;

===Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit===
{{main|Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit}}
The Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit was the [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] "zip" gun used by [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] on the [[Gemini 4]] mission in 1965.  The hand-held gun held several pounds of nitrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kranz | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Kranz | title = Failure Is Not an Option | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-425-17987-7 | page = 135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed limited movement around the [[Gemini spacecraft]]. It was also used by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] on the [[Gemini 10]] mission in 1966.

&lt;/center&gt;

===USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit===
The United States Air Force (USAF) Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) was designed by the [[U.S. Air Force]], which was planning to use the Gemini spacecraft as part of the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL).  The AMU was a backpack using [[hydrogen peroxide]] as the fuel.  The total delta-v capability of the AMU was about 250 feet per second (76.2 meters per second), roughly three times that of the MMU.  The astronaut would strap on the AMU like a backpack, and maneuver around using two hand controllers like that of the later MMU.  Because of the fuel, which came out as a hot gas, the astronaut's suit had to be modified with the addition of woven steel "pants" made of [[Chromel|Chromel-R]] metal cloth.  The AMU was carried aboard the [[Gemini 9]] mission, but was not tested because the astronaut, [[Eugene Cernan]], had difficulty maneuvering from the Gemini cabin to the AMU storage place, at the back of the spacecraft, and overheated, causing his helmet faceplate to fog up. The AMU was also meant to be launched and flown on-board [[Gemini 12]], and to fly untethered from the Gemini spacecraft, but was scrubbed two months before the mission.&lt;ref name=us&gt;{{cite book |title= US Spacesuits |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Kenneth S.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Automatically Stabilized Maneuvering Unit (ASMU)===
In 1973, the [[Automatically Stabilized Maneuvering Unit]] (ASMU) was test-flown aboard [[Skylab]] during the [[Skylab 3]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-400/ch7.htm |title=SP-400 Skylab, Our First Space Station, Chapter 7 -- The Second Manned Period |publisher=George C. Marshall Space Flight Center |year=1977 |editor=Leland F. Belew}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Skylab 4|4]] missions. Tested inside of the orbiting laboratory, it used nitrogen gas allowing both unsuited and suited testing of the unit.  The Skylab AMU was the closest to the Shuttle MMU, but was not used outside the spacecraft because the EVAs were conducted with the astronauts attached to life support umbilicals, and to prevent damage to the delicate solar arrays on the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Foot Controlled Maneuvering Unit (FCMU)===
The [[Foot Controlled Maneuvering Unit]] was tested within Skylab. The purpose of it was to free the astronaut's hands. It was propelled by cold, high-pressured [[nitrogen]] gas located in a tank on the back.&lt;ref name=Birds&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter13.html |title=From Engineering Science To Big Science, Chapter 13 -- More Favored than the Birds: The Manned Maneuvering Unit in Space |year=1998 |first=Anne |last=Millbrooke}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was tested both suited and unsuited.

===Manned Maneuvering Unit===
{{main|Manned Maneuvering Unit}}
The Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) is a propulsion backpack which was used by NASA astronauts on three space shuttle missions in 1984. The MMU allowed the astronauts to perform untethered EVA spacewalks at a distance from the shuttle. The MMU was used in practice to retrieve a pair of faulty communications satellites, Westar VI and Palapa B2. Following the third mission the unit was retired from use.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Soviet SPK===
The former [[Soviet Union]] also used a cosmonaut propulsion system on flights to the space station [[Mir]]. The [[Soviet SPK|SPK]] (or UMK, UPMK&lt;ref name=Rs&gt;{{cite book |title= Russian Spacesuits |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Isaac Abramov &amp; Ingemar Skoog |year= 2003 |publisher= Praxis Publishing Ltd. |location= Chichester, UK |isbn= 1-85233-732-X |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f7pZosHqkbEC&amp;dq=S-901J+suit&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was larger than the Space Shuttle MMU, contained oxygen instead of nitrogen and was attached to a safety tether. Despite the tether, the SPK allowed the cosmonaut, wearing the self-contained [[Orlan space suits|Orlan spacesuit]], to "fly around" the orbiting complex, allowing access to areas nearly impossible to access otherwise. Though tested on Mir in 1990, the cosmonauts preferred using the [[Strela (crane)|''Strela'' crane]] (equivalent to the [[Mobile Servicing System]]). The SPK, which was left attached to the outside to the [[Kvant-2]] module, was destroyed when Mir re-entered the atmosphere after decommissioning.

The 21KS&lt;ref name=Rs/&gt; system is a completely new design for Orlan-DMA spacesuit not using a safety tether, but air jet engines. This system was similar to MMU. It was automatically stabilized, used 6 degrees of freedom, weighed less than 180&amp;nbsp;kg, had a delta-v of 30&amp;nbsp;m/s, practical speed of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s, and an emergency mode that allows for rotational acceleration of 8°/s per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cosmonaut's Personal Transport |magazine= Vokrug Sveta |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Igor Afanasiev &amp; Dmitry Vorontzov |year= 2010 |location= Moscow |url= http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/6972/ |accessdate= 29 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

===SAFER===
{{main|Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue}}
The Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER) is a smaller backpack propulsion system intended as a safety device during space walks. It contains 1.4&amp;nbsp;kg of gaseous [[nitrogen]], which provides much less delta-v capability than the MMU, roughly 10 feet per second (3 meters per second). However SAFER is less complex, less expensive and simpler to use than the MMU, and the limited delta-v is sufficient for the intended rescue-only task. Other Crew Self Rescue (CSR) devices of which prototypes have been developed include an inflatable pole, a telescoping pole, a bi-stem pole and a [[bolas|bola]]-type lasso device ([[astrorope]]) the drifting astronaut could throw to hook to the space station.

[[File:3D-SIM-4 Anaphase 3 color.jpg|thumb|3D representation of a living cell during the process of [[mitosis]], example of an autopoietic system]]

The term '''autopoiesis''' ({{ety|gre|''αὐτo-'' (auto-)|self||''ποίησις'' ([[poiesis]])|creation, production}}) refers to a [[system]] capable of reproducing and maintaining itself. The term was introduced in 1972 by Chilean biologists [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] to define the self-maintaining [[chemistry]] of living [[cells (biology)|cells]]. Since then the concept has been also applied to the fields of [[cognition]], [[systems theory]] and [[sociology]].

The original definition can be found in ''Autopoiesis and Cognition: the Realization of the Living'' (1st edition 1973, 2nd  1980):&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Page 16: It was in these circumstances ... in which he analyzed Don Quixote's dilemma of whether to follow the path of arms (''praxis'', action) or the path of letters (''poiesis'', creation, production), I understood for the first time the power of the word "poiesis" and invented the word that we needed: ''autopoiesis''. This was a word without a history, a word that could directly mean what takes place in the dynamics of the autonomy proper to living systems.

Page 78: An autopoietic [[machine]] is a machine organized (defined as a unity) as a network of processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network.&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Page 89: ... the space defined by an autopoietic system is self-contained and cannot be described by using dimensions that define another space. When we refer to our interactions with a concrete autopoietic system, however, we project this system on the space of our manipulations and make a description of this projection.}}

==Meaning==

Autopoiesis was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of [[living systems]]. A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the [[biological cell]]. The [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell, for example, is made of various [[biochemical]] components such as [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s, and is organized into bounded structures such as the [[cell nucleus]], various [[organelle]]s, a [[cell membrane]] and [[cytoskeleton]]. These structures, based on an external flow of molecules and energy, ''produce'' the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components (not unlike a wave propagating through a medium).

An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an [[allopoietic]] system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something ''other'' than itself (the factory). However, if the system is extended from the factory to include components in the factory's "environment", such as supply chains, plant / equipment, workers, dealerships, customers, contracts, competitors, cars, spare parts, and so on, then as a total viable system it could be considered to be autopoietic. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Though others have often used the term as a synonym for [[self-organization]], Maturana himself stated he would "[n]ever use the notion of self-organization&amp;nbsp;... Operationally it is impossible. That is, if the organization of a thing changes, the thing changes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maturana |first=Humberto |year=1987 |chapter=Everything is said by an observer |title=Gaia, a Way of Knowing: Political Implications of the New Biology |editor=Thompson, William Irwin |publisher=Lindisfarne Press |location=Great Barrington, MA |pages=65–82, 71 |oclc=15792540 |isbn=978-0-940262-23-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, an autopoietic system is autonomous and operationally closed, in the sense that there are sufficient processes within it to maintain the whole. Autopoietic systems are "structurally coupled" with their medium, embedded in a dynamic of changes that can be recalled as [[sensory-motor coupling]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} This continuous dynamic is considered as a rudimentary form of [[knowledge]] or [[cognition]] and can be observed throughout life-forms.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

An application of the concept of autopoiesis to [[sociology]] can be found in [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Systems theory#Sociology and Sociocybernetics|Systems Theory]], which was subsequently adapted by [[Bob Jessop]] in his studies of the capitalist state system. [[Marjatta Maula]] adapted the concept of autopoiesis in a business context.&lt;ref&gt;Maula, M. (2006). Advanced Series in Management: Organizations as learning systems: 'Living composition' as an enabling infrastructure. Emerald Group Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of autopoiesis has also been applied in the context of legal systems by not only Niklas Luhmann, but also Gunther Teubner.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther Teubner, ''Law as an Autopoietic System'' (The European University Institute Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the evolution and development of autopoietic legal systems, see, Neil T. Lyons, ''Autopoiesis: Evolution, Assimilation, and Causation of Normative Closure'' in ''Law, Justice, and Miscommunications: Essays in Applied Legal Philosophy'' (ed. Dr. Tim Kaye, Vanderplas Publishing, 2011) {{ISBN|978-1-60042-152-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of textual studies, [[Jerome McGann]] argues that texts are "autopoietic mechanisms operating as self-generating feedback systems that cannot be separated from those who manipulate and use them".&lt;ref&gt;''The Textual Condition'' (Princeton University Press, 1986), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Maturana and Varela, he defines an autopoietic system as "a closed topological space that 'continuously generates and specifies its own organization through its operation as a system of production of its own components, and does this in an endless turnover of components{{'"}}, concluding that "Autopoietic systems are thus distinguished from allopoietic systems, which are Cartesian and which 'have as the product of their functioning something different from themselves{{'"}}. Coding and markup appear [[allopoietic]]", McGann argues, but are generative parts of the system they serve to maintain, and thus language and print or electronic technology are autopoietic systems.&lt;ref&gt;"Marking Texts of Many Dimensions" in ''A Companion to Digital Humanities'' ed. Susan Schreibman, Raymond George Siemens and John M. Unsworth (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000), pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his discussion of Hegel, the philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] argues, "Hegel is – to use today's terms – the ultimate thinker of autopoiesis, of the process of the emergence of necessary features out of chaotic contingency, the thinker of contingency's gradual self-organisation, of the gradual rise of order out of chaos."&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj, "Less Than Nothing", Verso, 2012, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to complexity==
Autopoiesis can be defined as the ratio between the complexity of a system and the complexity of its environment.&lt;ref name="Fernández"&gt;
{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 2: Information Measures of Complexity, Emergence, Self-organization, Homeostasis, and Autopoiesis |author1=N. Fernandez |author2=C. Maldonado |author3=C. Gershenson |title=Guided self-organization: Inception |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-53734-9 |pages=19–51 |year=2013 |arxiv=1304.1842|bibcode=2013arXiv1304.1842F }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This generalized view of autopoiesis considers systems as self-producing not in terms of their physical components, but in terms of its organization, which can be measured in terms of information and complexity. In other words, we can describe autopoietic systems as those producing more of their own complexity than the one produced by their environment.&lt;ref name=Gershenson&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=Requisite Variety, Autopoiesis, and Self-organization |author=Carlos Gershenson|authorlink=Carlos Gershenson|date=26 Sep 2014 |arxiv= 1409.7475}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relation to cognition==
An extensive discussion of the connection of autopoiesis to [[cognition]] is provided by Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=Evan Thompson |isbn=978-0-674-02511-0 |publisher=Harvard University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA91 |chapter=Chapter 5: Autopoiesis: The organization of the living |pages=91–127 |year=2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The basic notion of autopoiesis as involving constructive interaction with the environment is extended to include cognition. Initially, Maturana defined cognition as behavior of an organism "with relevance to the maintenance of itself".&lt;ref name=Maturana&gt;
{{cite book |title=Autopoiesis and cognition: The realization of the living |chapter=The cognitive process |page=13 |isbn=978-90-277-1016-1 |year=1980 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |author1=H. R. Maturana |author2=F. J. Varela |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVmcN9Ja68kC&amp;pg=PA13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, computer models that are self-maintaining but non-cognitive have been devised, so some additional restrictions are needed, and the suggestion is that the maintenance process, to be cognitive, involves readjustment of the internal workings of the system in some [[Metabolism|metabolic process]]. On this basis it is claimed that autopoiesis is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for cognition.&lt;ref name=Bitbol&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Autopoiesis with or without cognition: defining life at its edge |author1=M Bitbol |author2=PL Luisi |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume=1 |pages=99–107 |year=2005 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618936/pdf/16849156.pdf |doi=10.1098/rsif.2004.0012 |pmid=16849156 |pmc=1618936}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson (p.&amp;nbsp;127) takes the view that this distinction may or may not be fruitful, but what matters is that living systems involve autopoiesis and (if it is necessary to add this point) cognition as well. It can be noted that this definition of 'cognition' is restricted, and does not necessarily entail any awareness or [[consciousness]] by the living system.

==Relation to consciousness==
The connection of autopoiesis to cognition, or if necessary, of living systems to cognition, is an objective assessment ascertainable by observation of a living system.

One question that arises is about the connection between cognition seen in this manner and consciousness. The separation of cognition and consciousness recognizes that the organism may be unaware of the substratum where decisions are made. What is the connection between these realms? Thompson refers to this issue as the "explanatory gap", and one aspect of it is the [[hard problem of consciousness]], how and why we have [[qualia]].&lt;ref name=Thompson2&gt;
{{cite book |title=Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=Evan Thompson |isbn=978-0-674-02511-0 |publisher=Harvard University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA7 |chapter=Cognitivism |page=7 |year=2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A second question is whether autopoiesis can provide a bridge between these concepts. Thompson discusses this issue from the standpoint of [[enactivism]]. An autopoietic cell actively relates to its environment. Its sensory responses trigger motor behavior governed by autopoiesis, and this behavior (it is claimed) is a simplified version of a nervous system behavior. The further claim is that real-time interactions like this require attention, and an implication of attention is awareness.&lt;ref name=Thompson3&gt;

==Criticism==

There are multiple criticisms of the use of the term in both its original context, as an attempt to define and explain the living, and its various expanded usages, such as applying it to self-organizing systems in general or social systems in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fleischaker G. | year = 1992 | title = Autopoiesis in Systems Analysis: A Debate | url = | journal = Int.

(and thus) grounded on a solipsistic foundation that flies in the face of both common sense and scientific knowledge".

'''BP-5 Compact Food''' (also known as a '''BP-5 biscuit''') is a high-calorie, vitamin fortified, compact, compressed and dry food, often used by [[relief agency|relief agencies]] for the emergency feeding of [[refugee]]s and [[internally displaced person]]s.&lt;ref name=idpas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idpas.org/InfantIronDef/BP5webpage.html|title=Multi-micronutrient Powders for children aged 6-24 months - BP-5|publisher=International Nutrition Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
BP-5 is available in packs of 2 biscuit bars.  Each box of 9 packs contains 500g of food, with approximately 2,300 calories per box.  Shelf life is 5 years.&lt;ref name=idpas/&gt;  The food is produced by Compact AS, based in Norway, and purchased by agencies through [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref name=idpas/&gt;

==Ingredients==
Ingredients include baked wheat flour, [[Trans fat|partially hydrogenated]] soybean oil, sugar, soy protein concentrate, malt extract, minerals, amino acids, and vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sevenoceans.no/index.cfm?custom=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
BP-5 is used for [[disaster relief]] and [[disaster preparedness]], and for emergency food rations in [[refugee camp]]s, particularly for malnourished children.  It is eaten directly, or mixed with water to make a [[porridge]].&lt;ref name=idpas/&gt;

Typically, an adult is given 250g per day.  Although this is a calorie deficit, it provides the recommended protein and basic vitamin requirements.  Because it is easily digestible, neutral tasting, and contains no dairy or meat products the food may be widely used, even for people with severe malnourishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Alertnet |title=BP-5 Compact Food |url=http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=/thepeople/suppliers/compact.htm |accessdate=8 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624195721/http://www.alertnet.org/printable.htm?URL=%2Fthepeople%2Fsuppliers%2Fcompact.htm |archive-date=24 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that its portability made it susceptible to cheating, and recommended dispensing pre-prepared food instead when practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ennonline.net/fex/2/use|title=The Use of BP-5 Biscuits in Supplementary Feeding Programmes|author=Fitsum Assafa|publisher=Field Exchange|date=August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balthasar Gérard''' (alternative spellings '''Gerards''' or '''Gerardts'''; c. 1557 – 14 July 1584) was the [[assassination|assassin]] of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] independence leader, [[William the Silent|William I]] of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange]] (William the Silent). He killed William I in [[Delft]] on 10 July 1584, by shooting him twice with a pair of pistols, and was afterwards tried, convicted, and gruesomely executed.

Gérard was born in [[Franche-Comté]] (then belonging to [[Spain]], afterwards to [[France]]). He came from a [[Roman Catholic]] family with 11 children and was a great admirer of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], king of Spain and the Netherlands. He studied law at the [[University of Dole]]. On 15 March 1580, King Philip had offered a reward of 25,000 crowns to anyone who killed William the Silent, to whom he referred as a "pest on the whole of [[Christianity]] and the enemy of the human race".&lt;ref name=Motley&gt;{{cite book|last=Motley|first=John L.|title=The Rise of the Dutch Republic, Vol. 3|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4836|authorlink=John Lothrop Motley|year=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==
After the reward offered by Philip was published, Gérard left for [[Luxembourg]], where he learned that [[Juan de Jáuregui (assassin)|Juan de Jáuregui]] had already been preparing to attempt the assassination, but this attempt did not succeed. In March 1584 he went to [[Trier]], where he put his plan before the regent of the [[Jesuit]]s, but another Jesuit convinced him to change his original scheme and go to the prince of [[Parma]]. In [[Tournai]], after holding counsel with a [[Franciscan]], Father Gery, Gérard wrote a letter, a copy of which was deposited with the guardian of the  [[abbey|convent]], and the original presented personally to the Prince of Parma. In the letter Gérard wrote, in part, "The [[vassal]] ought always to prefer justice and the will of the king to his own life."&lt;ref name=Motley/&gt;

At first the prince thought him unfit but after consulting Haultepenne and others with the letter he was assigned to Christoffel d'Assonleville, who spoke with Gérard, and asked him to put this in writing, which he did on 11 April 1584. He requested absolution from the prince of Parma "as he was about to keep company for some time with heretics and atheists, and in some sort to conform himself to their customs".&lt;ref name=Motley/&gt;

For his first expenses he begged for 50 crowns, which were refused. "I will provide myself out of my own purse", Gérard told Assonleville, "and within six weeks you will hear of me." Assonleville responded: "Go forth, my son ... and if you succeed in your enterprise, the King will fulfill all his promises, and you will gain an immortal name besides."&lt;ref name=Motley/&gt; On Sunday, 8 July 1584, Gérard loitered in the courtyard of the [[Prinsenhof]] examining the premises. A [[halberd]]ier asked him why he was waiting there. He excused himself by saying that in his present shabby clothing and without new shoes he was unfit to join the congregation in the church opposite. The halberdier unsuspectingly arranged from the Prince of Orange himself a gift of 50 crowns for Gérard, who the following morning purchased a pair of pistols from a soldier, haggling the price for a long time because the soldier couldn't supply the particular chopped bullets or [[slug (projectile)|slugs]] he wanted.&lt;ref name=Motley/&gt;

==The shooting==

[[File:KogelgatenPrinsenhof.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The bullet holes still visible at the [[Prinsenhof]] (Delft)]]
On 10 July 1584, as William the Silent climbed the stairs to the second floor, he was spoken to by the [[Wales|Welsh]] captain [[Roger Williams (soldier)|Roger Williams]], who knelt before him. William put his hand on the bowed head of the old captain, at which moment Gérard jumped out of a dark corner. He drew his weapons and fired two shots at the [[stadtholder]]. William the Silent collapsed. His sister knelt beside him, but it was too late. Asked whether he commended his soul to Christ, he answered in the affirmative. His last words were, ''Mon Dieu, ayez pitié de moi et de mon pauvre peuple'' ("My God, have mercy on me and on my poor people").

Gérard fled through a side door and ran across a narrow lane, pursued by Roger Williams. Gérard had almost reached the ramparts, from which he intended to jump into the moat. On the other side a saddled horse stood ready. A [[pig's bladder]] around his waist was intended to help keep him afloat. However, he stumbled over a heap of rubbish. A servant and a halberdier of the prince who had raced after him caught him. When called a traitor by his captors, he is said to have replied, "I am no traitor; I am a loyal servant of my lord." "Which lord?", they asked. "Of my lord and master, the king of Spain". At the same time more pages and halberdiers of the prince appeared and dragged him back to the house under a rain of fists and beatings with the butt of a sword. Hearing his assailants chatter and convinced he heard the prince was still alive, he cried "Cursed be the hand that missed!" {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Trial, torture, and execution==
At the house he immediately underwent a preliminary examination before the city [[magistrate]]s. Upon being interrogated by the magistrates, he reportedly showed neither despair nor contrition, but rather a quiet exultation, stating: "Like [[David (Biblical king)|David]], he had slain [[Goliath]] of [[Gath (city)|Gath]]."

At his trial, Gérard was sentenced to be brutally – even by the standards of that time – killed. The magistrates decreed that the right hand of Gérard should be burned off with a red-hot iron, that his flesh should be torn from his bones with pincers in six different places, that he should be [[Dismemberment|quartered]] and [[disemboweled]] alive, his heart torn from his [[bosom]] and flung in his face, and that, finally, his head should be taken off.&lt;ref name=Motley/&gt;

Gérard's torture was also very brutal. On the first night of his imprisonment Gérard was hung on a pole and lashed with a whip. After that his wounds were smeared with honey and a goat was brought to lick the honey off his skin with his rough tongue. The goat however refused to touch the body of the sentenced.  After this and other tortures he was left to pass the night with his hands and feet bound together, like a ball, so sleep would be difficult. During the following three days, he was repeatedly mocked and hung on a pole with his hands tied behind his back. Then a weight of 300 [[Pound (mass)#Metric pounds|metric pounds]] (150&amp;nbsp;kg) was attached to each of his big toes for half an hour. After this half hour Gérard was fitted with shoes made of well-oiled, uncured dog skin; the shoes were two fingers shorter than his feet. In this state he was put before a fire. When the shoes warmed up, they contracted, crushing the feet inside them to stumps. When the shoes were removed, his half-broiled skin was torn off.  After his feet were damaged, his armpits were branded. After that he was dressed in a shirt soaked in [[alcohol]]. Then burning bacon fat was poured over him and sharp nails were stuck between the flesh and the nails of his hands and feet. Gérard is said to have remained calm during his torture. On 14 July 1584, Gérard was executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Vonnis_van_Balthasar_Gerards Dutch Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
A short summary of his treatment is also provided by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', chapter 2: "The spectacle of the scaffold."&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=January 2018}}

==Aftermath==
Philip II gave Gérard's parents, instead of the reward of 25,000 crowns, three country estates in Lievremont, Hostal, and Dampmartin in the [[Franche-Comté]], and the family was raised to the [[peerage]]. Philip II would later offer the estates to [[Philip William, Prince of Orange|Philip William]], Orange's son and the next Prince of Orange, provided the prince continue to pay a fixed portion of the rents to the family of his father's murderer; the notion was rejected with scorn. The estates remained with the Gérard family. The [[apostolic vicar]] [[Sasbout Vosmeer]] tried to have Gérard canonized, to which end he removed the dead man's head and showed it to church officials in Rome, but the idea was rejected.

==Legacy==
The village of [[Vuillafans]] renamed the street where Gérard was born "Rue Gérard" in his memory.

As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of [[emergence|emergent]] behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules.  The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:

* '''separation''': [[wikt:steer#Verb 2|steer]] to avoid crowding local flockmates
* '''alignment''': steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* '''cohesion''': steer to move toward the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

More complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking.

The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et&amp;nbsp;al.&lt;ref&gt;

extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear. Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals, through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas. Hartman and Benes&lt;ref&gt;

introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the boid to become a leader and try to escape.

The movement of Boids can be characterized as either chaotic (splitting groups and wild behaviour) or orderly. Unexpected behaviours, such as splitting flocks and reuniting after avoiding obstacles, can be considered emergent.

The boids framework is often used in computer graphics, providing realistic-looking representations of flocks of birds and other creatures, such as schools of fish or herds of animals. It was for instance used in the 1998 video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' for the flying bird-like creatures seen at the end of the game on [[Locations of Half-Life#Xen|Xen]], named "boid" in the game files.

The Boids model can be used for direct control and stabilization of teams of simple Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5980123&amp;isnumber=5979525 |title= Design and analysis of Group Escape Behavior for distributed autonomous mobile robots  |first1= Hongkyu |last1= Min  |first2= Zhidong |last2= Wang |year= 2011 |conference= IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Swarms of micro aerial vehicles stabilized under a visual relative localization  |first1= Martin |last1= Saska |first2= Vakula |last2= Jan |first3= Preucil |last3= Libor |year= 2014 |conference= IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[swarm robotics]]. For stabilization of heterogeneous UAV-UGV teams, the model was adapted for using onboard relative localization by Saska et&amp;nbsp;al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= Coordination and Navigation of Heterogeneous UAVs-UGVs Teams Localized by a Hawk-Eye Approach  |first1= Martin |last1= Saska |first2= Vonasek |last2= Vojtech |first3= Krajnik |last3= Tomas |first4= Preucil |last4= Libor |year= 2012 |conference= IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of proposal, Reynolds' approach represented a giant step forward compared to the traditional techniques used in computer animation for motion pictures. The first animation created with the model was ''[[Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice]]'' (1987), followed by a feature film debut in [[Tim Burton]]'s film ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) with computer generated bat swarms and armies of penguins marching through the streets of Gotham City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lrss.fri.uni-lj.si/people/ilbajec/papers/ilb_ab09.pdf | last1=Lebar Bajec |first1= Iztok |first2=  Frank H. |last2= Heppner | date=2009 | title=Organized flight in birds | work=Animal Behaviour | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 777–789 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5018">The '''Bradley method of natural childbirth''' (also known as "husband-coached childbirth") is a method of [[natural childbirth]] developed in 1947 by Robert A. Bradley, M.D. (1917&amp;ndash;1998) and popularized by his book ''[[Husband-Coached Childbirth]],'' first published in 1965. The Bradley method emphasizes that birth is a natural process: mothers are encouraged to trust their body and focus on diet and exercise throughout pregnancy; and it teaches couples to manage labor through deep breathing and the support of a partner or labor coach.&lt;ref name=MayoClinic&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pregnancy/PR00119 Childbirth education: Get ready for labor and delivery], Mayo Clinic, July 25, 2009, accessed July 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers of the Bradley method believe that—with adequate preparation, education and help from a loving, supportive coach—most women can give birth naturally, without drugs or surgery. The Bradley method emphasizes measures that can be taken to help keep women healthy and low-risk in order to avoid [[Complications of pregnancy|complications]] that may lead to medical intervention.

The primary goal of the Bradley method is healthy mothers and healthy babies. The method holds that, in most circumstances, a natural (drug-free) childbirth is the best way to achieve that goal. Proponents of The Bradley Method claim that 86% of Bradley mothers have vaginal births without drugs.&lt;ref name="bradleybirth1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradleybirth.com/WhyBradley.aspx |title=Why Bradley |publisher=Bradleybirth.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classes teach [[nutrition]],  [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]] and natural breathing as [[pain management]] techniques along with active participation of the husband as coach. Parents-to-be are taught to be knowledgeable consumers of birth services and to take responsibility in making informed decisions regarding procedures, attendants and the birthplace.

The method itself is first of all an application of what Dr. Bradley termed "the six needs of the laboring woman", most notably deep and complete relaxation and abdominal breathing, but also including quiet, darkness and solitude, physical comfort, and closed eyes and the appearance of sleep. Secondly, the Bradley Method relies heavily on training fathers to be labor "coaches", or partners. Bradley Method teachers usually supplement these primary techniques with training in different labor positions and comfort measures. In order to master the ability to relax completely as a pain relief tool, couples are taught several different relaxation techniques and encouraged to practice relaxation daily, so that the mother can rely on a conditioned relaxation response to her partner's voice and touch.

Bradley entered into obstetrics in 1947; at the time mothers were restrained in large cribs and wore protective helmets to protect their heads from hitting the sides of the crib due to the effect of the medication they were given.&lt;ref&gt;Erin Hinze, [http://www.birthingyourwaytoday.com/Dr._Robert_A_Bradley.html Dr. Robert A. Bradley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131027/http://www.birthingyourwaytoday.com/Dr._Robert_A_Bradley.html |date=2015-04-02 }}, "Happy Birth Happy Baby", accessed July 10, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; Terming this era as "knock-em-out, drag-em-out obstetrics", when "[[twilight sleep]]" and [[general anesthesia]] were common in hospital deliveries, he decided to develop his own method. Having been raised on a farm and having witnessed many animal births as a part of farm life, Dr. Bradley believed that women, like the non-human animals he had observed growing up, could give birth without drugs or distress. Based on observations of mammals during labor and birth, he developed a childbirth method to teach women to do the things that animal mothers do instinctively. Soon after starting to implement his new childbirth method with pregnant nurses as a trial, Dr. Bradley began to believe that the presence and support of the father during labor and birth was important to the mother's success in achieving a natural birth. He became a pioneer in including fathers in the birth process and eventually expanded his childbirth method to include extensive instruction of the father as labor coach.

Bradley method instructors are certified by the American Academy of Husband-Coached Childbirth™ (AAHCC).&lt;ref name="bradleybirth1"/&gt;

Moreover, governments have been reluctant to formulate an agreed upon and legally binding definition.

*It is both [[Criminal law#Mala in se v. mala prohibita|mala prohibita (i.e., crime that is made illegal by legislation) and mala in se (i.e., crime that is inherently immoral or wrong)]].

The following criteria of violence or threat of violence fall outside of the definition of terrorism:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dtra/terrorism_concepts.pdf Terrorism: Concepts, Causes, and Conflict Resolution], Jan 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azdema.gov/museum/famousbattles/pdf/Terrorism%20Definitions%20072809.pdf Various Definitions of Terrorism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319000454/http://www.azdema.gov/museum/famousbattles/pdf/Terrorism%20Definitions%20072809.pdf |date=2016-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons as to why there is no universal consensus regarding the definition of terrorism. Angus Martyn in a briefing paper for the Australian Parliament has stated that "The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the [[United Nations]] attempts to define the term foundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of [[Wars of national liberation|conflicts over national liberation]] and [[self-determination]]."&lt;ref name=Martyn&gt;Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429023013/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm |date=April 29, 2009 }}, Australian Law and Bills Digest Group, Parliament of Australia Web Site, 12 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These divergences have made it impossible to conclude a [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]] that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Paniagua (2008),  p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the [[international community]] adopted a series of [[Definition of terrorism#The sectoral approach|sectoral conventions]] that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities. In addition, since 1994, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] has condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism: "Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance [[Theory of justification|unjustifiable]], whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them."&lt;ref&gt;1994 United Nations Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annex to UN General Assembly resolution 49/60 ,"Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism", of December 9, 1994, [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r060.htm  UN Doc. A/Res/60/49]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by Jeffrey Record for the [[United States Army]] quoted a source (Schmid and Jongman 1988) that counted 109 definitions of [[terrorism]] that covered a total of 22 different definitional elements.&lt;ref name="Record-p6-fn10"&gt;Record, p. 6 (page 12 of the PDF document), citing in footnote 10 Alex P. Schmid, Albert J. Jongman, et al., ''Political Terrorism: A New Guide to Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, and Literature'', New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Books, 1988, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Record continued "Terrorism expert [[Walter Laqueur]] also has counted over 100 definitions and concludes that the 'only general characteristic generally agreed upon is that terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence.' Yet terrorism is hardly the only enterprise involving violence and the threat of violence. So does war, coercive diplomacy, and bar room brawls".&lt;ref name="Record-p6-fn11"&gt;Record, p. 6 (page 12 of the PDF document) citing in footnote 11: Walter Laqueur, ''The New Terrorism: Fanaticism and the Arms of Mass Destruction'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Terrorism2 london times 1-30-1795.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A 30 January 1795 use of the word 'terrorism' in ''[[The Times]]'', an early appearance in English. The excerpt reads: "There exists more than one system to overthrow our liberty. Fanaticism has raised every passion; Royalism has not yet given up its hopes, and Terrorism feels bolder than ever."]]
The term "terrorism" comes from French {{lang|fr|terrorisme}}, from {{lang-la|terror}}, "great fear", "dread", related to the Latin verb {{lang|la|terrere}}, "to frighten". The {{lang|la|terror cimbricus}} was a panic and state of emergency in Rome in response to the approach of warriors of the [[Cimbri]] tribe in 105 BCE. The French [[National Convention]] declared in September 1793 that "terror is the order of the day". The period 1793–94 is referred to as {{lang|fr|La Terreur}} ([[Reign of Terror]]). [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a leader in the [[French revolution]] proclaimed in 1794 that "Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible."&lt;ref&gt;Burgess&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] agents that enforced the policies of "The Terror" were referred to as "Terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrorism-research.com/history/early.php Early History of Terrorism], http://Terrorism-Research.com&lt;/ref&gt; The word "terrorism" was first recorded in English-language dictionaries in 1798 as meaning "systematic use of [[terror]] as a policy".&lt;ref name=com&gt;Harper&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Reign of Terror was imposed by the French government, in modern times "terrorism" usually refers to the killing of people by non-governmental political activists for political reasons, often as a public statement. This meaning originated with Russian radicals in the 1870s. [[Sergey Nechayev]], who founded the ''[[People's Reprisal]]'' (Народная расправа) in 1869, described himself as a "terrorist".&lt;ref name="Crenshaw77"&gt;Crenshaw, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; German radicalist writer [[Johann Most]] helped popularize the modern sense of the word by dispensing "advice for terrorists" in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw44"&gt;Crenshaw, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Myra Williamson]]: "The meaning of "terrorism" has undergone a transformation. During the reign of terror a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary state against the enemies of the people. Now the term "terrorism" is commonly used to describe terrorist acts committed by ''non-state or subnational entities'' against a state."&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Williamson, Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuJIPP9HfRsC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international law==

===The need to define terrorism in international criminal law===
[[Ben Saul]] has noted that a "A combination of pragmatic and principled arguments supports the case for defining terrorism in international law",&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 "Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; including the need to condemn violations to [[human rights]], to protect the [[State (polity)|state]] and deliberative politics, to differentiate public and private violence, and to ensure international peace and security.
 
Carlos Diaz-Paniagua, who coordinated the negotiations of the proposed United Nations [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], noted, on his part, the need to provide a precise definition of terrorist activities in international law: "Criminal law has three purposes: to declare that a conduct is forbidden, to prevent it, and to express society's condemnation for the wrongful acts.  The symbolic, normative role of criminalization is of particular importance in the case of terrorism.  The criminalization of terrorist acts expresses society's repugnance at them, invokes social censure and shame, and stigmatizes those who commit them.  Moreover, by creating and reaffirming values, criminalization may serve, in the long run, as a deterrent to terrorism, as those values are internalized."&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, international criminal law [[treaties]] that seek to prevent, condemn and punish terrorist activities, require precise definitions:

{{quote|The definition of the offence in criminal law treaty plays several roles.  First and foremost, it has the symbolic, normative role of expressing society's condemnation of the forbidden acts.  Second, it facilitates agreement.  Since states tend to be reluctant to undertake stringent obligations in matters related to the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction, a precise definition of the crime, which restricts the scope of those obligations, makes agreement less costly.  Third, it provides an inter-subjective basis for the homogeneous application of the treaty's obligations on judicial and police cooperation.  This function is of particular importance in extradition treaties because, to grant an extradition, most legal systems require that the crime be punishable both in the requesting state and the requested state.  Fourth, it helps states to enact domestic legislation to criminalize and punish the wrongful acts defined in the treaty in conformity with their human rights' obligations.  The principle of ''nullum crimen sine lege'' requires, in particular, that states define precisely which acts are prohibited before anyone can be prosecuted or punished for committing those same acts.&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) pp. 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saul noted in this sense that, missing a generally agreed, all-encompassing, definition of the term:
{{quote|'Terrorism' currently lacks the precision, objectivity and certainty demanded by legal discourse. Criminal law strives to avoid emotive terms to prevent prejudice to an accused, and shuns ambiguous or subjective terms as incompatible with the principle of non-retroactivity. If the law is to admit the term, advance definition is essential on grounds of fairness, and it is not sufficient to leave definition to the unilateral interpretations of States. Legal definition could plausibly retrieve terrorism from the ideological quagmire, by severing an agreed legal meaning from the remainder of the elastic, political concept. Ultimately it must do so without criminalizing legitimate violent resistance to oppressive regimes – and becoming complicit in that oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 "Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Obstacles to a comprehensive definition====
Diaz-Paniagua has noted that, to "...create an effective legal regime against terrorism, it would be necessary to formulate a comprehensive definition of that crime that, on the one hand, provides the strongest moral condemnation to terrorist activities while, on the other hand, has enough precision to permit the prosecution of criminal activities without condemning acts that should be deemed to be legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;See Marsavelski, A. (2013) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2329401 ''The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law']' (In Chapter II.A.4., entitled "Criteria for the Use of Revolutionary Force", Marsavelski provides four guiding principles for distinguishing legitimate acts of freedom fighters from terrorist acts). (Connecticut Journal of International law, Vol. 28) at pp. 278-75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, due to major divergences at the international level on the question of the legitimacy of the use of violence for political purposes, either by states or by self-determination and revolutionary groups, this has not yet been possible."&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, [[M. Cherif Bassiouni]] notes:
{{quote|to define 'terrorism' in a way that is both all-inclusive and unambiguous is very difficult, if not impossible.  One of the principle difficulties lies in the fundamental values at stake in the acceptance or rejection of terror-inspiring violence as means of accomplishing a given goal.  The obvious and well known range of views on these issues are what makes an internationally accepted specific definition of what is loosely called 'terrorism,' a largely impossible undertaking. That is why the search for and internationally agreed upon definition may well be a futile and unnecessary effort.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni, "A Policy-oriented Inquiry of 'International Terrorism'" in: M. Cherif Bassiouni, ed., ''Legal Responses to International Terrorism: U.S. Procedural Aspects'', (Dordrecht, Boston and London: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1988) xv – xvi.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Sami Zeidan, a Lebanese diplomat and scholar, explained the political reasons underlying the current difficulties to define terrorism as follows:
{{quote|There is no general consensus on the definition of terrorism. The difficulty of defining terrorism lies in the risk it entails of taking positions. The political value of the term currently prevails over its legal one. Left to its political meaning, terrorism easily falls prey to change that suits the interests of particular states at particular times. The Taliban and Osama bin Laden were once called freedom fighters (mujahideen) and backed by the CIA when they were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now they are on top of the international terrorist lists. Today, the United Nations views Palestinians as freedom fighters, struggling against the unlawful occupation of their land by Israel, and engaged in a long-established legitimate resistance, yet Israel regards them as terrorists. Israel also brands the Hizbullah of Lebanon as a terrorist group, whereas most of the international community regards it as a legitimate resistance group, fighting Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon. In fact, the successful ousting of Israeli forces from most of the South by the Hizbollah in 2000 made Lebanon the only Arab country to actually defeat the Israeli army. The repercussion of the current preponderance of the political over the legal value of terrorism is costly, leaving the war against terrorism selective, incomplete and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Sami Zeidan, Desperately Seeking Definition: The International Community's Quest for Identifying the Specter of Terrorism, 36 Cornell International Law Journal (2004) pp. 491-92&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same vein, [[Jason Burke]], a British reporter who writes about radical [[Islamist]] activity, said:
{{quote|There are multiple ways of defining terrorism, and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as "the use or threat of serious violence" to advance some kind of "cause". Some state clearly the kinds of group ("sub-national", "non-state") or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory, and grave problems with the use of the term persist. Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term "war on terrorism" is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term "Militancy". This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyse them in a clearer way.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke. ''Al Qaeda'', ch. 2, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The political and emotional connotation of the term "terrorism" makes difficult its use in legal discourse. In this sense, Saul notes that: 
{{quote|Despite the shifting and contested meaning of "terrorism" over time, the peculiar semantic power of the term, beyond its literal signification, is its capacity to stigmatize, delegitimize, denigrate, and dehumanize those at whom it is directed, including political opponents. The term is ideologically and politically loaded; pejorative; implies moral, social, and value judgment; and is "slippery and much-abused." In the absence of a definition of terrorism, the struggle over the representation of a violent act is a struggle over its legitimacy. The more confused a concept, the more it lends itself to opportunistic appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, ''Defining Terrorism in International Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historically, the dispute on the meaning of terrorism arose since the [[laws of war]] were first codified in 1899. The [[Martens Clause]] was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the [[Great Power]]s who considered [[francs-tireurs]] to be [[unlawful combatants]] subject to execution on capture, and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 1 cites The life and works of Martens are detailed by V. Pustogarov, "Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909) — A Humanist of Modern Times", ''International Review of the Red Cross'' (IRRC), No. 312, May–June 1996, pp. 300-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 2 cites  F. Kalshoven, ''Constraints on the Waging of War'', Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1987, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the 1977 [[Protocol I|Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts]], which applies in situations [[Protocol I#Part I GENERAL PROVISIONS|Article 1. Paragraph 4]] "... in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes...", contains many ambiguities that cloud the issue of who is or is not a legitimate combatant.&lt;ref&gt;Gardam [https://books.google.com/books?id=MGT2hJFS9MkC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=in+which+peoples+are+fighting+against+colonial+domination+and+alien+occupation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=K_N1cgeQ2L&amp;sig=Mysj3VFtq3WBNFXpbpjqkbQpPao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA91,M1  p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt;  
These difficulties have led Pamala Griset to conclude that: "the meaning of terrorism is embeded in a person's or nation's philosophy. Thus, the determination of the 'right' definition of terrorism is subjective." &lt;ref&gt;Griset, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YpmZ76zRW2oC&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false p. xiii]. See also: Smelser,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=KncntgBEQTMC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false p. 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The sectoral approach====
To elaborate an effective legal [[International regime|regime]] to prevent and punish international terrorism—rather than only working on a single, all-encompassing, comprehensive definition of terrorism—the [[international community]] has also adopted a "...'sectoral' approach aimed at identifying offences seen as belonging to the activities of terrorists and working out treaties in order to deal with specific categories thereof".&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Andrea Gioia, "The UN Conventions on the Prevention and Suppression of International Terrorism" in Giuseppe Nesi, ed., ''International Cooperation in Counter-terrorism: The United Nations And Regional Organizations in the Fight Against Terrorism'', p. 4 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The treaties that follow this approach focus on the wrongful nature of terrorist activities rather than on their [[intention (criminal law)|intent]]:

{{quote|On the whole, therefore, the 'sectoral' conventions confirm the assumption that some offences can be considered ''in themselves'' as offences of international concern, irrespective of any 'terrorist' intent or purpose. Indeed, the principal merit of the 'sectoral approach' is that it avoids the need to define 'terrorism' of 'terrorist acts' ... So long as the 'sectoral' approach is followed, there is no need to define terrorism; a definition would only be necessary if the punishment of the relevant offences were made conditional on the existence of a specific 'terrorist' intent; but this would be counter-productive, inasmuch as it would result in unduly restricting their suppression.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; }}

Following this approach, the international community has adopted the following sectoral [[counter-terrorism]] conventions, open to the [[ratification]] of all states:

* The 1963 [[Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft]]
* The 1970 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]
* The 1971 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation]]
* The 1979 [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]]
* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation]]
* The 1988 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]]
* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]]
* The 1991 [[Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Identification]]
* The 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]].
* The 1999 [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]]
* The 2005 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]]

Analyzing these treaties, Andrew Byrnes observed that: 
{{quote|These conventions – all of which are described by the United Nations as part of its panoply of anti-terrorist measures – share three principal characteristics:

(a) they all adopted an "operational definition" of a specific type of terrorist act that was defined without reference to the underlying political or ideological purpose or [[motive (law)|motivation]] of the perpetrator of the act – this reflected a [[consensus]] that there were some acts that were such a serious threat to the interests of all that they could not be justified by reference to such motives;

(b) they all focused on actions by [[non-state actor]]s (individuals and organisations) and the State was seen as an active ally in the struggle against terrorism – the question of the State itself as terrorist actor was left largely to one side; and

(c) they all adopted a [[criminal law]] enforcement model to address the problem, under which States would cooperate in the [[arrest|apprehension]] and prosecution of those alleged to have committed these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes (2002), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Byrnes notes that "this act-specific approach to addressing problems of terrorism in binding international treaties has continued up until relatively recently. Although political denunciation of terrorism in all its forms had continued apace, there had been no successful attempt to define 'terrorism' as such in a broad sense that was satisfactory for legal purposes. There was also some scepticism as to the necessity, desirability and feasibility of producing an agreed and workable general definition."&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes (2002),  p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, since 2000, the United Nations General Assembly has been working on a proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]].

===Comprehensive conventions===
The [[international community]] has worked on two comprehensive counter-terrorism treaties, the [[League of Nations]]' 1937 Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism, which never entered into force, and the [[United Nations]]' proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], which hasn't been finalized yet.

====League of Nations====
In the late 1930s, the [[international community]] made a first attempt at defining terrorism. Article 1.1 of the [[League of Nations]]' 1937 Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations' 1937 [http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf  Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185446/http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which never entered into force, defined "acts of terrorism" as "criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public". Article 2 included as terrorist acts, if they were directed against another state and if they constituted acts of terrorism within the meaning of the definition contained in article 1, the following:
{{quote|1. Any willful act causing death or grievous bodily harm or loss of liberty to:
:a) [[Head of state|Heads of State]], persons exercising the prerogatives of the head of the State, their [[Order of succession|hereditary or designated successors]];
:b) The wives or husbands or the above-mentioned persons;
:c) Persons charged with public functions or holding public positions when the act is directed against them in their public capacity.
2. Willful destruction of, or damage to, public property or property devoted to a public purpose belonging to or subject to the authority of another High Contracting Party.

3. Any willful act calculated to endanger the lives of members of the public.

4. Any attempt to commit an [[offence (law)|offence]] falling within the foregoing provisions of the present article.

5. The manufacture, obtaining, possession, or supplying of [[Weapon|arms]], [[ammunition]], [[explosives]] or harmful substances with the view to the commission in any country whatsoever of an offence falling within the present article.&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations, 1937 [http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf  Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185446/http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}, art 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism====

Since 2000, the United Nations General Assembly has been negotiating a [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]]. The definition of the crime of terrorism, which has been on the negotiating table since 2002 reads as follows:
{{quote|1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person, by any means, unlawfully and intentionally, causes:
:(a) Death or serious bodily injury to any person; or
:(b) Serious damage to public or [[private property]], including a place of public use, a State or government facility, a public transportation system, an infrastructure facility or the environment; or
:(c) Damage to property, places, facilities, or systems referred to in paragraph 1 (b) of this article, resulting or likely to result in major economic loss, when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an [[international organization]] to do or abstain from doing any act.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Sixth session (28 January-1 February 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113112445/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement |date=13 January 2012 }}, Annex II, art. 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the negotiators, that definition is not controversial in itself; the deadlock in the negotiations arises instead  from the opposing views on whether such a definition would be applicable to the [[armed forces]] of a state and to [[self-determination]] movements. Thalif Deen described the situation as follows: "The key sticking points in the draft treaty revolve around several controversial yet basic issues, including the definition of ´terrorism´. For example, what distinguishes a "terrorist organisation" from a 'liberation movement'? And do you exclude activities of national armed forces, even if they are perceived to commit acts of terrorism? If not, how much of this constitutes 'state terrorism'?"&lt;ref&gt;Thalif Deen, [http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29633 POLITICS:  U.N. Member States Struggle to Define Terrorism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053853/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29633 |date=June 11, 2011 }}, IPS 25 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The coordinator of the negotiations, supported by most western delegations, proposed the following exceptions to address those issues:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States, peoples and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international humanitarian law.

2. The activities of '''armed forces''' during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, '''inasmuch as they are governed''' by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.

4. Nothing in this article condones or makes lawful otherwise unlawful acts, nor precludes prosecution under other laws.&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"&gt;United Nations General Assembly, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Sixth session (28 January-1 February 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113112445/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement |date=13 January 2012 }}, Annex IV, art. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The state members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] proposed instead the following exceptions:
{{quote|2. The activities of 'the parties' during an armed conflict, 'including in situations of foreign occupation', as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, 'inasmuch as they are in conformity' with international law, are not governed by this Convention.&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"/&gt;}}

===Sectoral conventions===
The various sectoral counter-terrorism [[treaty|conventions]] defines as terrorist particular categories of activities.

====Terrorist Bombings Convention====
Article 2.1 of the 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]] defines the [[offence (law)|offence]] of terrorist bombing as follows:
{{quote|Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person unlawfully and intentionally delivers, places, discharges or detonates an explosive or other lethal device in, into or against a place of public use, a State or government facility, a public transportation system or an infrastructure facility:
:a) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or
:b) With the intent to cause extensive destruction of such a place, facility or system, where such a destruction results in or is likely to result in major economic loss.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorist Bombings Convention [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-9.pdf art. 2.1].
&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Article 19 expressly excluded from the scope of the convention certain activities of state [[armed forces]] and of [[self-determination]] movements as follows:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States, and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international humanitarian law.
2. The activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorist Bombings Convention [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-9.pdf art. 19].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Terrorist Financing Convention====
Article 2.1 of the 1999 sectoral United Nations [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]] (Terrorist Financing Convention) defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offence committed by "any person" who "by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out" an act "intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act."

====Nuclear Terrorism Convention====
The 2005 United Nations [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]] defines the crime of nuclear terrorism as follows:
{{quote|Article 2
1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person unlawfully and intentionally:
(a) Possesses [[radioactive material]] or makes or possesses a device:
:(i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily [[injury]]; or
:(ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the [[Natural environment|environment]];
(b) Uses in any way radioactive material or a device, or uses or damages a nuclear facility in a manner which releases or risks the release of radioactive material:
:(i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or
:(ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or
:(iii) With the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an [[international organization]] or a State to do or refrain from doing an act.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Terrorism Convention, [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-15.pdf art. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Article 4 of the convention expressly excluded from the application of the convention the use of [[nuclear weapon]]s during [[armed conflict]]s without, though, recognizing the legality of the use of those weapons:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law.

2. The activities of [[armed forces]] during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by [[military]] forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The provisions of paragraph 2 of the present article shall not be interpreted as condoning or making lawful otherwise unlawful acts, or precluding prosecution under other laws.

4. This Convention does not address, nor can it be interpreted as addressing, in any way, the issue of the [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons]] by States.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Terrorism Convention, [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-15.pdf art. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Definitions of terrorism in other UN decisions===
In parallel with the criminal law [[codification (law)|codification]] efforts, some [[United Nations System|United Nations organs]] have put forward some broad political definitions of terrorism.

====UN General Assembly Resolutions====
A 1996 non-binding United Nations Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, annexed to the UN General Assembly Resolution 51/210, described terrorist activities in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/51/a51r210.htm|title=A/RES/51/210.  Measures to eliminate international terrorism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.}}

[[Antonio Cassese]] has argued that the language of this and other similar UN declarations "sets out an acceptable definition of terrorism."&lt;ref name = "Cassese"&gt;Cassese (2002),  p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

====UN Security Council====
In 2004, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1566]] condemned terrorist acts as:
{{quote|criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act, which constitute offences within the scope of and as defined in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature.}}

====The High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and the Secretary General====
Also in 2004, a [[High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]] composed of independent experts and convened by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] called states to set aside their differences and to adopt, in the text of a proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], the following political "description of terrorism":
{{quote|any action, in addition to actions already specified by the existing conventions on aspects of terrorism, the Geneva Conventions and Security Council resolution 1566 (2004), that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to [[civilians]] or [[non-combatants]], when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pdf/historical/hlp_more_secure_world.pdf Report of the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change "A more secure world: Our shared responsibility"] (2004) para. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year, Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]] endorsed the High Level Panel's definition of terrorism and asked states to set aside their differences and to adopt that definition within the proposed comprehensive terrorism convention before the end of that year. He said:
{{quote|It is time to set aside debates on so-called "State terrorism". The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law. And the right to resist occupation must be understood in its true meaning. It cannot include the right to deliberately kill or maim civilians. I endorse fully the High-level Panel's call for a definition of terrorism, which would make it clear that, in addition to actions already proscribed by existing conventions, any action constitutes terrorism if it is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a Government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act. I believe this proposal has clear moral force, and I strongly urge world leaders to unite behind it and to conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism before the end of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Secretary General, Report of the Secretary-General ''In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all''  [https://www.un.org/largerfreedom/chap3.htm Chapter 3] (2005) para. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The suggestion of incorporating this definition of terrorism into the comprehensive convention was rejected. Some [[List of United Nations member states|United Nations' member states]] contended that a definition such as the one proposed by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and endorsed by the Secretary General, lacked the necessary requirements to be incorporated in a [[criminal law]] instrument. Carlos Diaz-Paniagua, who coordinated the [[negotiation]]s of the proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], stated that a comprehensive definition of terrorism to be included in a criminal law [[treaty]] must have "legal precision, certainty, and fair-labeling of the criminal conduct - all of which emanate from the basic human rights obligation to observe due process."&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Barnidge, ''Non-State Actors and Terrorism: Applying the Law of State Responsibility and the Due Diligence Principle'' 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The [[European Union]] defines terrorism for legal/official purposes in Art. 1 of the ''Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism'' (2002).&lt;ref name = "StateWatch"&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2002/jul/frameterr622en00030007.pdf State Watch].&lt;/ref&gt; This provides that terrorist offences are certain criminal offences set out in a list consisting largely of serious offences against persons and property that;
{{quote|...given their nature or context, may seriously damage a country or an international organisation where committed with the aim of: seriously intimidating a population; or unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act; or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation.}}

===North Atlantic Treaty Organization===
[[NATO]] defines terrorism in the AAP-06 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions, Edition 2014 as "The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence against individuals or property in an attempt to coerce or intimidate governments or societies to achieve political, religious or ideological objectives".&lt;ref&gt;http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now lapsed [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] specified the following definition of terrorism:

{{quote|Whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause, or as is likely to cause, death of, or injuries to, any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act, commits a terrorist act.}}

===Pakistan===
The Pakistan Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, 1999 states:

A person is said to commit a terrorist act if he,

(a) in order to, or if the effect of his actions will be to, strike terror or create a sense of fear and insecurity in the people, or any section of the people, does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive or inflammable substances, or such fire-arms or other lethal weapons as may be notified, or poisons or noxious gases or chemicals, in such a manner as to cause, or be likely to cause, the death of, or injury to, any person or persons, or damage to, or destruction of, property on a large scale, or a widespread disruption of supplies of services essential to the life of the community, or threatens with the use of force public servants in order to prevent them from discharging their lawful duties; or

{{See also|Domestic terrorism in the United States}}

====U.S. Code (U.S.C.)====
Title 22, Chapter 38 of the United States Code (regarding the [[U.S. Department of State|Department of State]]) contains a definition of terrorism in its requirement that annual country reports on terrorism be submitted by the [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] every year. It reads:
{{quote|[T]he term 'terrorism' means [[premeditated]], politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f-|title=22 U.S. Code § 2656f - Annual country reports on terrorism|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Title 18 of the United States Code]] (regarding criminal acts and criminal procedure) defines international terrorism as:
{{quote|(1) [T]he term 'international terrorism' means activities that — 
:(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the [[Criminal law of the United States|criminal laws of the United States]] or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; 
:(B) appear to be intended — 
:: (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
:: (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or 
:: (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, [[assassination]], or [[kidnapping]]; and 
:(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331-|title=18 U.S. Code § 2331 - Definitions|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commenting on the genesis of this provision, [[Edward Peck (American diplomat)|Edward Peck]], former U.S. Chief of Mission in [[Iraq]] (under [[Jimmy Carter]]) and former ambassador to [[Mauritania]] said:
{{quote| In 1985, when I was the Deputy Director of the Reagan White House Task Force on Terrorism, [my working group was asked] to come up with a definition of terrorism that could be used throughout the government. We produced about six, and each and every case, they were rejected, because careful reading would indicate that our own country had been involved in some of those activities. […] After the task force concluded its work, Congress [passed] U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2331 ... the US definition of terrorism. […] one of the terms, "international terrorism," means "activities that," I quote, "appear to be intended to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping." […] Yes, well, certainly, you can think of a number of countries that have been involved in such activities. Ours is one of them. […] And so, the terrorist, of course, is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/28/1440244 Democracy Now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060731140522/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F07%2F28%2F1440244 |date=2006-07-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====U.S. Code of Federal Regulations====
The U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]] defines terrorism as "the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives" (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85).

====U.S. Department of Defense====
The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] recently changed its definition of terrorism. Per Joint Pub 3-07.2, ''Antiterrorism,'' (24 November 2010), the Department of Defense defines it as "the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence to instill fear and coerce governments or societies. Terrorism is often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs and committed in the pursuit of goals that are usually political."

The new definition distinguishes between motivations for terrorism (religion, ideology, etc.) and goals of terrorism ("usually political"). This is in contrast to the previous definition which stated that the goals could be religious in nature.

====U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency====
The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) contains a definition of terrorism, which reads:

{{quote|Terrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or [[ransom]]. Terrorists often use threats to:
* Create fear among the public.
* Try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism.
* Get immediate publicity for their causes.}}

The new definition does not require that the act needs to be politically motivated. The FEMA also said that terrorism "include threats of terrorism; assassinations; kidnappings; [[hijacking (disambiguation)|hijacking]]s; [[Bomb threat|bomb scare]]s and [[bomb]]ings; [[cyber attack]]s (computer-based); and the use of [[chemical weapon|chemical]], [[biological weapon|biological]], [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[radiological weapon]]s" and also states that "[h]igh-risk targets for acts of terrorism include military and civilian government facilities, [[international airport]]s, large [[City|cities]], and high-profile [[landmark]]s. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. Further, terrorists are capable of spreading fear by sending [[explosives]] or chemical and biological agents through the mail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1549-20490-0802/terrorism.pdf|title=Federal Emergency Management Agency — Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. National Counterterrorism Center====
The U.S. [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC) define terrorism the same as United States Code 22 USC § 2656f(d)(2). The Center also defines a terrorist act as a "premeditated; perpetrated by a sub-national or clandestine agent; politically motivated, potentially including religious, philosophical, or culturally symbolic motivations; violent; and perpetrated against a non-combatant target."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghri.org/GHR-International%20Definitions.htm|title=GHR International Definitions|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422010111/http://www.ghri.org/GHR-International%20Definitions.htm|archivedate=2009-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. national security strategy====
In September 2002, the U.S. national security strategy defined terrorism as "premeditated, politically motivated violence against innocents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward P. |last=Halibozek |first2=Andy |last2=Jones |first3=Gerald L. |last3=Kovacich |year=2007 |title=The corporate security professional's handbook on terrorism |edition=illustrated |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-7506-8257-4 |page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpwcHUNXw-kC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition did not exclude actions by the United States government and it was qualified some months later with "premeditated, politically motivated violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Rockmore|first2=Joseph |last2=Margolis |first3=Armen |last3=Marsoobian|year=2005 |title=The philosophical challenge of September 11: Metaphilosophy |volume=35|number=3 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-0893-2 |page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Crs1bGcjAp8C&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====USA PATRIOT Act of 2001====
The [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act of 2001]] defines domestic terrorism as "activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S."

====Terrorism Risk Insurance Act====
Section 102(1)(a) of the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]] contains a definition of terrorism in order for insurance companies to provide coverage to all prospective policy holders at time of purchase and to all current policyholders at renewal and requires that the federal government pay 90 percent of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance company providing the coverage. It reads:
{{quote|(1) ACT OF TERRORISM-

::::(I) an air carrier or vessel described in paragraph
::::(5)(B); or
::::(II) the premises of a United States mission; and
:::(iv) to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/TRIAasamended-CompositeTextPost.pdf The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002(TRIA), as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (TRIEA) and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorizaton Act of 2007 (TRIPRA)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In general insurance policies==
Some insurance companies exclude terrorism from general property insurance (e.g. [[home insurance]]). An insurance company may include a specific definition of terrorism as part of its policy, for the purpose of excluding at least some loss or damage caused by terrorism. For example, [[RAC Insurance]] in Australia defines terrorism thus:
{{quote|
''terrorism'' – includes but is not limited to the use of force or violence and/or threat, by any person or group of persons done for or in connection with political, religious, ideological or similar purposes including the intention to influence any government and/or to put the public, or any section of the public, in fear.

==Social==
As [[Bruce Hoffman]] has noted: "terrorism is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. (...) Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization 'terrorist' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism."&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1998-p23"/&gt; For this and for political reasons, many news sources (such as [[Reuters]]) avoid using this term, opting instead for less accusatory words like "bombers", "militants", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/citydiary/2735455/City-Diary.html  City Diary: Reuters sticks to the facts], City Diary, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=O6QTfAkk22AC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Definitions+of+terrorism&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false pp. 28&amp;ndash;30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholars and recognized experts on terrorism==
Numerous scholars have proposed working definitions of terrorism.  [[Bruce Hoffman]], a well-known scholar, has thus noted that:
{{quote|It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, "Political terrorism: A Research Guide," Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definition of terrorism in a effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schimd was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the "search for an adequate definition is still on" Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt. "Ten years of debates on typologies and definitions,"  he responded to a survey on definitions to conducted by Schmid, "have not enhanced our knowledge of the subject to a significant degree." Laqueur's contention is supported by the twenty-two different word categories occurring in the 109 different definition that Schmid identified in survey. At the end of this exhaustive exercise, Schmid asks "whether the above list contains all the elements necessary for a good definition. The answer," he suggests" is probably 'no'."  If it is impossible to define terrorism, as Laqueur argues, and fruitless to attempt to cobble together a truly comprehensive definition, as Schmid admits, are we to conclude that terrorism is impervious to precise, much less accurate definition? Not entirely. If we cannot define terrorism, then we can at least usefully distinguish it from other types of violence and identify the characteristics that make terrorism the distinct phenomenon of political violence that it is.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that:
[[File:Iraq-terrorist attack on buses.jpg|thumb|The [[Baghdad]] bus station was the scene of a triple [[17 August 2005 Baghdad bombings|car bombing in August 2005]] that killed 43 people.]]
{{quote|By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:
* ineluctably political in aims and motives;
* violent – or, equally important, threatens violence;
* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;
* conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;
and
* perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}


A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008/&gt;}}

In this sense, after surveying the various academic definitions of terrorism, Vallis concluded that:
{{quote|Most of the formal definitions of terrorism have some common characteristics: a fundamental motive to make political/societal changes; the use of violence or illegal force; attacks on civilian targets by 'nonstate'/'Subnational actors'; and the goal of affecting society. This finding is reflected in Blee's listing of three components of terrorism:
# Acts or threats of violence;
# The communication of fear to an audience beyond the immediate victim, and;
# Political, economic, or religious aims by the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;Rhyll Vallis, Yubin Yang, Hussein A. Abbass, [http://www.itee.adfa.edu.au/~alar/techreps/200611015.pdf Disciplinary Approaches to Terrorism: A Survey], University of South Wales, p. 7. For similar surveys see also: Hoffman, Bruce ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed. Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34; and Alex Schmid, Statistics on Terrorism: The Challenge of Measuring Trends in Global Terrorism" in ''Forum on Crime and Society'', v. 4, N. 1-2 (2004) pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academics and practitioners may also be categorized by the definitions of terrorism that they use. [[Max Abrahms]] has introduced the distinction between what he calls "terrorist lumpers" and "terrorist splitters."  Lumpers define terrorism broadly, brooking no distinction between this tactic and guerrilla warfare or civil war.  Terrorist splitters, by contrast, define terrorism narrowly, as the select use of violence against civilians for putative political gain.  As Abrahms notes, these two definitions yield different policy implications:
{{quote|Lumpers invariably believe that terrorism is a winning tactic for coercing major government concessions. As evidence, they point to substate campaigns directed against military personnel that have indeed pressured concessions. Salient examples include the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the U.S. withdrawal from Lebanon in 1984, and the French withdrawal from Algeria in 1962. Significantly, terrorist splitters do not regard these substate campaigns as evidence of terrorism's political effectiveness. Rather, they contend that disaggregating substate campaigns directed against civilian targets versus military ones is critical for appreciating terrorism's abysmal political record.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "Lumpers versus Splitters: A Pivotal Battle in the Field of Terrorism Studies." Cato. http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/02/10/max-abrahms/lumpers-versus-splitters-a-pivotal-battle-in-the-field-of-terrorism-studies/.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

We may therefore now attempt to define terrorism as the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change. All terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence. Terrorism is specifically designed to have far-reaching psychological effects beyond the immediate victim(s) or object of the terrorist attack. It is meant to instil fear within, and thereby intimidate, a wider 'target audience' that might include a rival ethnic or religious group, an entire country, a national government or political party, or public opinion in general. Terrorism is designed to create power where there is none or to consolidate power where there is very little. Through the publicity generated by their violence, terrorists seek to obtain the leverage, influence and power they otherwise lack to effect political change on either a local or an international scale."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Dunnie''' is a small [[Brownie (folklore)|Brownie]]-like being in the [[folklore]] of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]s, specifically [[Northumberland]], the most famous being that of the ''Hazlerigg Dunnie'' of Hazlerigg in the [[parish]] of [[Chatton]], [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=henderson&gt;''Notes on the folk-lore of the northern counties of England and the borders'' By William Henderson, 1866, pages 227-228.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dunnie has been known to take the form of a horse in order to trick a rider into mounting him before disappearing and leaving them in the muddiest part of the road. He also is said to disguise as [[plough]]-[[horse]]s only to vanish when the [[ploughman]] takes him into the [[Stall (animal)|stalls]].&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

The Dunnie was also said to wander the crags and dales of the [[Cheviots]] singing:

:"Cockenheugh there's gear enough,
:Collierheugh there's mair,
:For I've lost the key o' the Bounders, (or "It is also "I've lost the key o' the Bowden-door.")
:An' I'm ruined for evermair."&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

The Dunnie is thus thought to be a [[ghost]] of a [[reiver]] who hoarded his loot in the [[fells]] and guards his ill-gotten gains to this day.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

In full the song of the dunnie goes:

:"Cockenheugh there's gear enough,
:Collierheugh there's mair,
:For I've lost the key o' the Bounders"

'''Embalming''' is the art and science of preserving human or animal remains by treating them (in its modern form with chemicals) to forestall [[decomposition]]. The intention is usually to make the deceased suitable for public or private viewing as part of the funeral ceremony, or keep them preserved for medical purposes in an anatomical laboratory. The three goals of embalming are [[disinfection|sanitization]], presentation, and preservation, with restoration being an important additional factor in some instances. Performed successfully embalming can help preserve the body for a duration of many years.&lt;ref name="Brenner-2014" /&gt; Embalming has a very long and [[cross-cultural]] history, with many cultures giving the embalming processes a greater religious meaning.

Embalming is distinct from [[taxidermy]]. Embalming preserves the human body intact, whereas taxidermy is the recreation of an animal's form often using only the creature's skin mounted on an anatomical form.

==History==
[[File:KV54-Pottery-Dishes-OtherItems MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|Pottery, dishes, and other miscellaneous items from the embalming cache of [[Tutankhamun]].]]
The [[Chinchorro mummies|Chinchorro culture]] in the Atacama desert of present-day Chile and Peru are among the earliest cultures known to have performed artificial mummification as early as 5000-6000 BC.&lt;ref name="Brenner-2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Erich|title=Human body preservation - old and new techniques|journal=Journal of Anatomy|date=January 2014|pages=316–344|doi=10.1111/joa.12160|volume=224|pmid=24438435|pmc=3931544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the ancient culture that had developed embalming to the greatest extent was [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. As early as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] (3200 BC), specialized priests were in charge of embalming and [[mummy|mummification]]. They did so by removing organs, ridding the body of moisture, and covering the body with [[natron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmnh/mummies.htm|title=Encyclopedia Smithsonian: Egyptian Mummies|website=www.si.edu|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Egyptians believed that preservation of the mummy empowered the soul after death, the latter of which would return to the preserved corpse.

Other cultures known to have used embalming techniques in antiquity include the [[Meroe|Meroites]], [[Guanches]], [[Peruvians]], [[Jivaro people|Jivaro]] Indians, [[Aztec]]s, [[Toltec]]s, [[Mayans]], and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and southern [[Nigerian]] tribes.&lt;ref name="Brenner-2014" /&gt;

The earliest known evidence of artificial preservation in Europe was found in [[Osorno la Mayor|Osorno]] (Spain) and are about 5000 years old human bones covered in [[cinnabar]] for preservation, but embalming remained unusual in Europe up to the time of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Brenner-2014" /&gt;

In China, artificially preserved remains have been recovered from the period of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD), the main examples being that of [[Xin Zhui]] and the [[Mawangdui|Mawangdui Han tombs site]]. While these remains have been extraordinarily well preserved, the embalming fluids and methods used are unknown.&lt;ref name="Brenner-2014" /&gt;

In Europe the knowledge and practice of artificial preservation had spread from these ancient cultures becoming widely spread by about 500 AD. The period of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] is known as the anatomists' period of embalming and is characterized by an increased inﬂuence of scientific developments in medicine and the need for bodies for dissection purposes. Early methods used are documented by contemporary physicians such as Peter Forestus (1522–1597) and [[Ambroise Pare]] (1510-1590). The first attempts to inject the vascular system were made by Alessandro Giliani of Persiceto, who died in 1326. Various attempts and procedures have been reported by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452-1519), Jacobus Berengar (1470–1550), [[Eustachius, Bartolomeo|Bartholomeo Eustachius]] (1520–1574), [[Reinier de Graaf]] (1641–1673), [[Jan Swammerdam]] (1637–1680), and [[Frederik Ruysch]] (1638–1731).&lt;ref name="Brenner-2014" /&gt;

===Modern methods===
In the United States, the Civil War era sparked an interest in embalming and it became very common across the nation.&lt;ref name="Problem of Embalming"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiappelli|first1=Jermiah|title=The Problem of Embalming|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|date=December 2008|volume=71|issue=5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Hunter (anatomist).jpg|thumb|[[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]] developed and popularized the modern technique of arterial embalming in the late 18th century.]]
The modern method of embalming involves the injection of various chemical solutions into the arterial network of the body to primarily disinfect and slow the decomposition process. [[William Harvey]], the 17th century English physician who was the first to detail the system of [[blood circulation]], made his discoveries by injecting coloured solutions into corpses.

The Scottish surgeon [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]] was the first to apply these methods to the art of embalming as part of mortuary practice. He wrote a widely read report on the appropriate methods for arterial and cavity embalming in order to preserve bodies for burial. His brother, [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]], applied these methods and advertised his embalming services to the general public from the mid-18th century.

One of his more notorious customers was the dentist [[Martin Van Butchell]]. When his wife Mary died on January 14, 1775, he decided to have her embalmed and turn her into an attraction in order to draw more customers. Hunter injected the body with preservatives and color additives that gave a glow to the corpse's cheeks, replaced her eyes with [[glass eye]]s, and dressed her in a fine lace gown. The body was then embedded in a layer of [[plaster of Paris]] in a glass-topped coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LT28AAAAIAAJ|title=Murdering to Dissect: Grave-robbing, Frankenstein, and the Anatomy Literature|author=Tim Marshall|year=1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butchell put the body on display in the window of his home. Many Londoners came to see the body, but Butchell also drew criticism for his gruesome display. A rumor, possibly started by Butchell himself, claimed that his wife's [[marriage certificate]] had specified that her husband would only have control over her estate after her death for as long as her body was kept unburied.&lt;ref name="years"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1999|title=Martin Van Butchell (1735-1814): the eccentric, "kook" dentist of old London.|journal=History of Dentistry|volume=47|pages=99–104|pmid=10726564|last1=Christen|first1=AG|last2=Christen|first2=JA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in, and demand for, embalming grew steadily in the 19th century largely for sentimental reasons. People wished to be buried at far-off locations, and mourners wanted the chance to display the body for visitors to pay their last respects. Another motive behind embalming at this time was to prevent the spread of disease while being able to prepare for burial without unseemly haste. After [[Lord Nelson]] was killed during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], his body was preserved in brandy and spirits of wine mixed with camphor and myrrh for over two months. At the time of his state funeral in 1805, his body was found to still be in excellent condition and completely plastic.&lt;ref name="Beatty 1807 72–73"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beatty|first=William|title=Authentic narrative of the death of lord Nelson|year=1807|pages=72–73|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Embalming fluid.jpg|thumb|left|Embalming fluids used in the early 20th century.]]
Alternative methods of preservation, such as ice packing or laying the body on so called 'cooling boards', gradually lost ground to the increasingly popular and effective methods of embalming. By the mid 19th century, the newly emerging profession of [[funeral director|businessmen-undertakers]] - who provided funeral and burial services - began adopting embalming methods as standard.

Embalming caught on in the United States during the [[American Civil War]], as a result of sentimental issues involving foreign officials and servicemen dying far from home, and the need for their remains to be returned home for local burial. This period starting in about 1861 is known as the funeral period of embalming and is marked by a separation of the fields of embalming by undertakers and embalming (anatomical wetting) for medical and scientific purposes.&lt;ref name="Brenner-2014" /&gt; Dr. [[Thomas Holmes (mortician)|Thomas Holmes]] received a commission from the [[Army Medical Corps]] to embalm the corpses of dead [[Union army|Union officers]] to return to their families. Military authorities also permitted private embalmers to work in military-controlled areas. The passage of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s body home for burial was made possible by embalming, and it brought the possibilities and potential of embalming to wider public notice.

Until the early 20th century, [[arsenic]] was frequently used as an embalming fluid, until it was supplanted by other more effective and less toxic chemicals. There was concern about the possibility of arsenic from embalmed bodies contaminating ground water supplies. There were also legal concerns because people suspected of murder by arsenic poisoning could claim that the levels of poison in the deceased's body were a result of post-mortem embalming rather than evidence of [[homicide]].

In 1867, the German chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] discovered [[formaldehyde]], whose preservative properties were soon discovered, and which became the foundation for modern methods of embalming, replacing previous methods.

Dr. Frederic Ryusch was the first one to have used the arterial injection method for embalming. His work of embalming was so nearly perfect that people thought the dead body was actually alive; however, he only used it to prepare specimens for his anatomical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Champion Text Book on Embalming|last=Myers|first=Eliab|publisher=Champion Chemical CO.|year=1897|location=Springfield, Ohio|pages=102|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Today===
Modern embalming is most often performed to ensure a better presentation of the deceased for [[viewing (funeral)|viewing]] by friends and relatives.

A successful viewing of the body is considered to be helpful in the [[grieving]] process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amsocembalmers.org/docs/viewing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/484135_2 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embalming has the potential to prevent mourners from having to deal with the rotting and eventual putrescence of the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;1991 Metcalf, Peter &amp; Richard Huntington. Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual. Cambridge Press, New York. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been challenged, however, by authors such as [[Jessica Mitford]], who point out that there is no general consensus that viewing an embalmed corpse is somehow "therapeutic" to the bereaved, and that terms such as "memory picture" were invented by the undertakers themselves, who have a financial interest in selling the costly process of embalming to the public. Mitford also points out that, in many countries, embalming is rare, and the populace of such countries are still able to grieve normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/american-way-death-revisited-salem/american-way-death-revisited |title=The American Way of Death Revisited Summary – Jessica Mitford – Magill Book Reviews |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embalming is also a general legal requirement for international repatriation of human remains (although exceptions do occur) and is required by a variety of laws depending on locality, such as for extended time between death and final disposition or above-ground entombment.

In the United Kingdom, viewing the deceased prior to the funeral is a common practice and embalming is recommended to prevent any natural deterioration of the remains, which would cause further distress to family and friends. It is not uncommon for the remains to be returned home or to be received into a place of religious worship prior to burial or cremation.  In such cases, the embalming process is always carried out.

==Terms for embalmers==
The roles of a [[funeral director]] and an embalmer are different, depending on the licensing body for a region in which the Funeral Director and/or Embalmer operate. A funeral director arranges for the final disposition of the deceased, and may or may not prepare (including embalming) the deceased for viewing (or other legal requirements). An embalmer is someone who has been trained in the art and science of, and may or may not have any contact with the family, although many people fill both roles. The term mortician is becoming outdated, but may refer to a someone who is a funeral director, an embalmer, or in some cases, both. Embalming training commonly involves formal study in [[anatomy]], [[thanatology]], [[chemistry]], and specific embalming theory (to widely varied levels depending on the region of the world one lives in) combined with practical instruction in a [[mortuary]] with a resultant formal qualification granted after the passing of a final practical examination and acceptance into a recognized society of professional embalmers.

Legal requirements over who can practice vary geographically; some regions or countries do not have specific requirements. Additionally, in many places, embalming is not done by trained embalmers, but rather by doctors who, while they have the required anatomical knowledge, are not trained specialists in this field. Today, embalming is common practice in North America, Australia and New Zealand while it is somewhat less frequent in Europe. In some countries, permits or licenses are required; in others it is performed only by medical practitioners, and the costs can be relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/185498/embalming/2096/Modern-procedures |title=embalming: Modern procedures. – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the title of an embalmer is largely based on the state in which they are licensed. In Virginia and Maryland, a funeral director is someone who is licensed only to make arrangements and handle the business side of the funeral home, while a mortician is licensed to do these things as well as to embalm. As recently as 2015, Virginia has required that funeral directors also perform 25-50 embalmings as well as 25-50 arrangements during their apprenticeships as a requirement for their licensing, culminating in 3000 hours per apprenticeship.

==Modern practices==
[[File:Utensils used for embalming.jpg|thumb|right|Instruments used for embalming]]
As practiced in the [[funeral home]]s of the Western World (notably North America), embalming involves several distinct steps. Modern embalming techniques are not the result of a single practitioner, but rather the accumulation of many decades, even centuries, of research, trial and error, and invention. A standardized version follows below, but variation on techniques is very common.

The first step in embalming is to verify the permissions and requests of the family followed by a careful plan for the deceased's preparation, including reviewing the medical certificate of death. The deceased is placed on the mortuary table in the [[supine position|supine anatomical position]] with the head elevated by a head rest. Before commencing any preparation the embalmer will verify the identity of the body (normally via wrist or leg tags). At this point, embalmers commonly perform an initial evaluation of the deceased's condition, noting things such as [[lividity]], [[rigor mortis]], skin condition, edema, swelling, intravenous injection sites, presence of fecal matter, tissue gas and numerous other factors which may affect the procedure and final outcome. The embalming procedure is a surgical one, albeit rather minimally invasive. The process requires significant effort over the course of multiple hours, including intensive planning, evaluation, and chemical selection.

Any clothing on the body is removed and set aside, and any personal effects such as jewelry are inventoried. A modesty cloth is sometimes placed over the [[genitalia]]. The body is washed in a germicidal soap. During this process the embalmer bends, flexes, and massages the arms and legs to relieve [[rigor mortis]]. The eyes are posed using an eye cap that keeps them shut and in the proper expression. The mouth may be closed via suturing with a needle and ligature, using an adhesive, or by setting a wire into the maxilla and mandible with a needle injector, a specialized device most commonly used in North America and unique to mortuary practice. Care is taken to make the expression look as relaxed and natural as possible, and ideally a recent photograph of the deceased in good health is used as a reference. The process of closing the mouth and eyes, shaving, etc. is collectively known as [[setting the features]]. Features may also be set after the completion of the arterial embalming process, which allows the embalmer to clean and remove any purge that occurs during the embalming process.

[[File:Container containing embalming fluid.jpg|thumb|right|Tank containing embalming fluid]]
The actual embalming process usually involves four parts:

#[[Artery|Arterial]] embalming, which involves the injection of embalming chemicals into the blood vessels, usually via the right [[common carotid artery]]. Blood and interstitial fluids are displaced by this injection and, along with excess arterial solution, are expelled from the right [[jugular vein]] and collectively referred to as drainage. The [[embalming solution]] is injected with a centrifugal pump, and the embalmer massages the body to break up circulatory clots so as to ensure the proper distribution of the embalming fluid. This process of raising vessels with injection and drainage from a solitary location is known as a single-point injection. In cases of poor circulation of the arterial solution, additional injection points (commonly the [[axillary artery|axillary]], [[brachial artery|brachial]], or [[femoral artery|femoral]] arteries, with the [[ulnar artery|ulnar]], [[radial artery|radial]], and [[posterior tibial artery|tibial]] vessels if necessary) are used. The corresponding veins are commonly also raised and utilized for drainage. Cases where more than one vessel is raised are referred to as multiple-point injection, with a reference to the number of vessels raised (i.e. a six-point injection or six-pointer). As a general rule, the more points needing to be raised, the greater the difficulty of the case. In some cases draining from a different site from injection (i.e. injecting arterial fluid into the right common carotid artery and draining from the right [[femoral vein]]) is referred to as a split (or sometimes cut) injection. In certain cases the embalmer may deem it necessary to perform a restricted cervical injection, which involves injecting the head of the deceased separately from the rest of body. This is done in cases where distention (swelling) has a greater chance of occurring. In many cases, an embalmer may select to perform what is known as a pre-injection. A pre-injection is a solution of chemicals that do not contain any preservative chemicals, but rather chemicals that encourage vasodilation, help disperse blood clots, and act as chelating agents. The focus of this "pre-injection" is to allow for a more complete drainage and better distribution of the arterial embalming solution.
#Cavity treatment/embalming refers to the removal of internal fluids inside body cavities via the use of an [[aspirator (medical device)|aspirator]] and [[trocar]]. The embalmer makes a small incision just above the [[navel]] (two inches superior and two inches to the right) and pushes the trocar into the chest and stomach cavities to puncture the hollow organs and [[nasogastric intubation|aspirate]] their contents. The emblamer then fills the cavities with concentrated chemicals (known as Cavity Chemicals) that contain formaldehyde. The incision is either sutured closed (commonly using the purse-string or 'N' suture methods) or a "trocar button" is secured into place.
#[[Hypodermic]] embalming is a supplemental method which refers to the injection of embalming chemicals into tissue with a hypodermic needle and syringe, which is generally used as needed on a case by case basis to treat areas where arterial fluid has not been successfully distributed during the main arterial injection.
#Surface embalming, another supplemental method, utilizes embalming chemicals to preserve and restore areas directly on the skin's surface and other superficial areas as well as areas of damage such as from accident, decomposition, cancerous growths, or skin donation.

The duration of an embalming can vary greatly, but a common approximate time of between two and four hours to complete an embalming is typical. However an embalming case that presents excessive complications could require substantially longer. The treatment of someone who has undergone an autopsy, cases of extreme trauma, or the restoration of a long-bone donor are a few such examples, and embalmings which require multipe days to complete are known.

Embalming is meant to temporarily preserve the body of a deceased person. Regardless of whether embalming is performed, the type of burial or entombment, and the materials used – such as wood or metal coffins and vaults – the body of the deceased will, under most circumstances, eventually decompose. Modern embalming is done to delay decomposition so that funeral services may take place or for the purpose of shipping the remains to a distant place for disposition.

==Grooming==
[[File:Mortician's resorative tools.JPG|thumb|Restoration tools, [[Museum of Funeral Customs]]]]

After the body is rewashed and dried, a moisturizing cream is applied to the face, hands and arms. Ideally the deceased will usually sit for as long as possible for observation by the embalmer. After being dressed for visitation or funeral services. Cosmetics are commonly, but not universally, applied to make the body appear more lifelike and to create a "memory picture" for the deceased's friends and relatives. For babies who have died, the embalmer may apply a light cosmetic massage cream after embalming to provide a natural appearance; massage cream is also used on the face to prevent them from dehydrating, and the infant's mouth is often kept slightly open for a more natural expression. If possible, the funeral director uses a light, translucent cosmetic; sometimes, heavier, opaque cosmetics are used to hide bruises, cuts, or discolored areas. Makeup is applied to the lips to mimic their natural color. Sometimes a very pale or light pink lipstick is applied on males, while brighter colored lipstick is applied to females. Hair Gels or [[baby oil]] is applied to style short hair; while hairspray is applied to style longer hair. Powders (especially baby powder) are applied to the body to eliminate odors, and it is also applied to the face to achieve a matte and fresh effect to prevent oiliness of the corpse. Mortuary cosmetizing is not done for the same reason as make-up for living people; rather, it is designed to add depth and dimension to a person's features that lack of blood circulation has removed. Warm areas – where blood vessels in living people are superficial, such as the cheeks, chin, and knuckles – have subtle reds added to recreate this effect, while browns are added to the palpabrae (eyelids) to add depth, especially important as viewing in a [[coffin]] creates an unusual perspective rarely seen in everyday life. During the viewing, pink-colored lighting is sometimes used near the body to lend a warmer tone to the deceased's complexion.

A photograph of the deceased in good health is often sought to guide the embalmer's hand in restoring the body to a more lifelike appearance. Blemishes and discolorations (such as bruises, in which the discoloration is not in the circulatory system, and cannot be removed by arterial injection) occasioned by the last illness, the settling of blood, or the embalming process itself are also dealt with at this time (although some embalmers utilize hypodermic bleaching agents, such as phenol-based cauterants, during injection to lighten discoloration and allow easier cosmetizing). It is also common for the embalmer to perform minor restoration of the deceased's appearance with tissue building chemicals and a hypodermic syringe. Tissue building chemicals (Tissue Builders) become solid with the introduction of liquids such as water or interstitial fluids. Commonly the area where the Spheoid and Temporal bones meet; this can also be referred to the temples. In the event of trauma or natural depressions on the face or hands, tissue builder can also be utilised to return those regions of the face to the expectations of the family.

==Clothing==
In the Western world, men are typically buried in [[informal attire|business attire]], such as a suit or coat and tie, and women in semi-formal dresses or pant suits. In recent years, a change has occurred, and many individuals are now buried in less formal clothing, such as what they would have worn on a daily basis, or other favorite attire. The clothing used can also reflect the deceased person's profession or vocation: priests and ministers are often dressed in their liturgical [[vestments]], and military and law enforcement personnel often wear their uniform. Underwear, singlets, bras, briefs, and hosiery are all used if the family so desires, and the deceased is dressed in them as they would be in life.

In certain instances a funeral director will request a specific style of clothing, such as a collared shirt or blouse, to cover traumatic marks or [[autopsy]] incisions. In other cases clothing may be cut down the back and placed on the deceased from the front to ensure a proper fit. In many areas of Asia and Europe, the custom of dressing the body in a specially designed [[shroud]] or funeral gown, rather than in clothing used by the living, is preferred.

After the deceased has been dressed, they are placed in the [[coffin]] or casket. In [[American English]], the word ''coffin'' is used to refer to an anthropoid (stretched hexagonal) form, whereas ''casket'' refers to a rectangular box. No such distinction is made in [[Commonwealth English]], where ''coffin'' is the preferred term and ''casket'' can be used interchangeably. It is common for photographs, notes, cards, and favourite personal items to be placed in the coffin with the deceased. Bulky and expensive items, such as electric guitars, are occasionally interred with a body. In some ways this mirrors the ancient practice of placing [[grave goods]] with a person for their use or enjoyment in the afterlife. In traditional Chinese culture, paper substitutes of the goods are buried or [[cremation|cremated]] with the deceased instead, as well as [[joss paper|paper money]] specifically purchased for the occasion.

==Chemicals==
{{Main|Embalming chemicals}}

Embalming chemicals are a variety of preservatives, sanitizers, disinfectant agents, and additives used in modern embalming to temporarily delay [[decomposition]] and restore a natural appearance for viewing a body after death. A mixture of these chemicals is known as embalming fluid, and is used to preserve deceased individuals, sometimes only until the funeral, other times indefinitely.

Typical embalming fluid contains a mixture of [[formaldehyde]], [[glutaraldehyde]], [[methanol]], humectants and wetting agents, and other solvents that can be used. The formaldehyde content generally ranges from 5 to 35 percent, and the ethanol content may range from 9 to 56 percent.

Environmentalists generally disapprove of embalming because of the harmful chemicals involved and their interactions with the environment. Recently, more eco-friendly embalming methods have become available. Both the Champion Company and the Dodge Company offer true Formaldehyde free chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.funeralhelper.org/embalming-information-about-embalming.html|title=Embalming - Information About Embalming|last=Administrator|website=www.funeralhelper.org|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialist embalming==
Badly decomposing bodies, trauma cases, frozen, or drowned bodies, and those to be transported over long distances also require special treatment beyond that for the "normal" case. The restoration of bodies and features damaged by accident or disease is commonly called restorative art or demisurgery, and all qualified embalmers have some degree of training and practice in it. For such cases, the benefit of embalming is startlingly apparent. In contrast, many people have unrealistic expectations of what a dead body should look like, due to the near-universal portrayal of dead bodies by live actors in movies and television shows. Ironically, the work of a skilled embalmer often results in the deceased appearing natural enough that the embalmer appears to have done nothing at all. Normally, a better result can be achieved when a photograph and the decedent's regular make-up (if worn) are available to help make the deceased appear more as they did when alive.

Embalming [[autopsy]] cases differs from standard embalming because the nature of the ''post mortem'' examination irrevocably disrupts the circulatory system, due to the removal of the organs and viscera. In these cases, a six-point injection is made through the two iliac or femoral arteries, subclavian or axillary vessels, and common carotids, with the [[viscera]] treated separately with cavity fluid or a special embalming powder in a viscera bag. 

Long-term preservation requires different techniques, such as using stronger preservatives and multiple injection sites to ensure thorough saturation of body tissues.

==For anatomy education==
A rather different process is used for [[cadaver]]s embalmed for dissection by medical professionals, students, and researchers. Here, the first priority is for long-term preservation, not presentation. As such, medical embalmers use anatomical wetting fluids that contain concentrated formaldehyde (37–40%, known as formalin) or [[glutaraldehyde]] and [[phenol]], and are made without dyes or perfumes. Many embalming chemical companies make specialized anatomical embalming fluids.

Anatomical embalming is performed into a closed circulatory system. The fluid is usually injected with an embalming machine into an artery under high pressure and flow, and allowed to swell and saturate the tissues. After the deceased is left to sit for a number of hours, the venous system is generally opened and the fluid allowed to drain out, although many anatomical embalmers do not use any drainage technique.

Anatomical embalmers may choose to use gravity-feed embalming, where the container dispensing the embalming fluid is elevated above the body's level, and fluid is slowly introduced over an extended time, sometimes as long as several days. Unlike standard arterial embalming, no drainage occurs, and the body distends extensively with fluid. The distension eventually reduces, often under extended (up to six months) refrigeration, leaving a fairly normal appearance. No separate cavity treatment of the internal organs is given. Anatomically embalmed cadavers have a typically uniform grey colouration, due both to the high formaldehyde concentration mixed with the blood and the lack of red colouration agents commonly added to standard, nonmedical, embalming fluids. Formaldehyde mixed with blood causes the grey discoloration also known as "formaldehyde grey" or "embalmer's grey".

==Religious practices==
Opinions differ among different faiths as to the permissibility of embalming. A brief overview of some of the larger faiths positions are:
*Most branches of the Christian faith generally allow embalming. Some bodies within [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] profess an absolute ban against embalming except when required by law or other necessity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/death/death_talk.aspx |title=Let's Talk About Death |publisher=Orthodoxinfo.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others may discourage but do not prohibit it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintgeorge.mn.goarch.org/PastorsCornerFunerals.htm Funerals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In general the decision on embalming is one that is dictated by the personal preference of the family rather than a specific church policy.
*[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] does not discourage or prohibit embalming. Often, due to the custom of church members dressing the deceased, embalming is given preference.
*Members of [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] allows embalming for the view of their loved ones. It forbids autopsy and cremation because they believe the body of the deceased is sacred and should be cared for with respect. They dress and groom the deceased as they looked in life. The preferred method is arterial embalming, in which formaldehyde is injected into the body.
*Some [[Neopagan]]s generally discourage embalming, believing it unnatural to disrupt the physical recycling of the body to the Earth. They encourage the use of [[natural burial|green graveyards]], where the body is placed in a biodegradable coffin and buried under a tree instead of a tombstone. This belief is based on the fact that embalmed corpses leach harmful chemicals in the soil.
*Members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are not embalmed. Instead, the body is washed and then placed in a cotton, linen, or silk shroud. The body is to be buried within one hour's journey from the place of death, if this is feasible. Cremation is also forbidden.
*[[Zoroastrians]] traditionally hold a type of [[sky burial]] within a structure known as a [[Tower of Silence]] in which the body is exposed to weathering and predation to dispose of the remains,  thus embalming the body is contrary to their funeral designs. This is due to the Zoroastrian belief that the dead body is unclean and the pure [[classical element|elements]] of earth and fire should not be allowed to come into contact with it. This practice was declared illegal in Iran by the government of the last shah, and Iranian Zoroastrians have turned to burials in concrete chambers which allow no contact between corpse and soil. Zoroastrians in India who are known locally as [[Parsi]]s continue to use the Tower of Silence.
*Traditional Jewish law forbids embalming or cremation, and burial is to be done as soon as possible – preferably within 24 hours. However, under certain circumstances, burial may be delayed if  burying a person immediately is impossible, or to permit the deceased to be buried in Israel. Guidance of a rabbi or the local ''[[chevra kadisha]]'' (Jewish burial society) should be sought regarding any questions, as particular circumstances may justify leniencies. Notably, the [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Biblical Joseph]] was, according to the ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 50:26), embalmed in the Egyptian fashion as was his father [[Israel (Bible)|Israel (Jacob)]] (Genesis 50:2). The ''chevra kadisha'' ensures the body is guarded (except during the Sabbath); typically these [[shemira|''shomrim'']] (guards) recite psalms within earshot of the deceased. The deceased is dressed in a ''kittel''—a white robe-like garment, and then in a white linen shroud. Burial in Israel is done without a coffin. Outside Israel, coffins may be used if required by local custom or law, but it must be a simple coffin, made without nails or glue, so as to permit natural processes to process the corpse.
*Embalming is not practiced by Muslims before they bury their deceased. They are urged to bury their deceased as soon as possible, as a form of honoring them in their view. The body is washed, usually by the spouse or a close relative of the same gender. He or she is then dressed in a clean, perfumed, plain white burial shroud, called ''kafan''. People gather to hold a joint prayer for the dead called ''Salat Al-Janaza''. They do not use coffins. Instead, the 2-m-deep grave has edging about 1 m down, and a slab is used to cover the grave, which is covered afterwards with loose soil.

==Notable embalmings==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012|talk=n}}
*[[Lord Nelson]] (1758–1805) was preserved for two months in brandy and spirits of wine mixed with camphor and myrrh after which time the body was found to be in excellent condition and completely plastic.&lt;ref name="Beatty 1807 72–73"/&gt;
*Various communist leaders have been embalmed and put on public display. Perhaps the most famous embalmed body of the 20th century is that of [[Vladimir Lenin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lenin-s-body-improves-with-age1%20scientificamerican.com scientificamerican.com 2015-04-22 Lenin's Body Improves with Age]&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to draw crowds decades after his death in 1924, and is seen in [[Lenin's Mausoleum|his Moscow mausoleum]]. [[Joseph Stalin]] was also embalmed and placed next to Lenin, but his body was buried in 1961 during [[de-Stalinization]]. [[Klement Gottwald]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], who died just five days after attending [[Stalin]]'s funeral, was embalmed and displayed in a mausoleum at [[National Monument in Vitkov]] in [[Prague]]. However, in 1962 due to a botched embalming, the body was decomposing, and was removed and cremated. [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] [[Georgi Dimitrov]] was embalmed and placed on display in the [[Sofia]] [[Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum]]. After the fall of [[Communism in Bulgaria]], his body was buried in 1990 in the Central cemetery of [[Sofia]]. Mongolia's [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]], Angola's [[Agostinho Neto]] and Guyana's [[Forbes Burnham]] were also embalmed by the same Russian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackey |first=Robert |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/north-korean-television-reports-plan-to-embalm-kims-body/ |title=North Korean television reports plan to embalm Kim's body |publisher=Thelede.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, embalmed communist leaders can also be found in the [[Mausoleum of Mao Zedong]], the [[Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum]], and the [[Kumsusan Palace of the Sun]] for [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]].
&lt;!-- *Having died in the summer when heat would hasten decomposition, [[Paul VI]] (1897 - pope 1963–1978) decomposed at his lying in state, prompting Vatican officials to install fans around the body to disperse the odor. (? SOURCE ?) --&gt;
*The botched embalming of Pope [[Pius XII]] (1876–1958; pope 1939–1958) by a charlatan doctor—which only sped up the rate of decomposition—led to his body turning black and his nose falling off while lying in state, and the body disintegrated in the coffin. The [[Swiss Guards]] stationed around Pius XII's body were forced to change shifts every 10 to 15 minutes, since the body's odor caused some guards to pass out. The doctor who performed the embalming had also taken photos of the pontiff in his death throes, intending to sell them to tabloids. The Italian tabloids refused to buy the photos, and the doctor was banned from entering the Vatican City-State by [[John XXIII]], who furthermore prohibited any photography of a deceased pope until the body is properly vested and laid out.
*[[Charles XII]] (1682–1718) is one of several [[King of Sweden|Swedish kings]] to have been embalmed. When Charles XII's sarcophagus was opened in 1917, his features were still recognizable, almost 200 years after his death. Photographs of his remains clearly show the gunshot wound to his head leading to his death.
*The body of [[Pope John XXIII]] (1881–1963; pope 1958–1963) is on display on an altar on the main floor of the [[Basilica of Saint Peter]] after having been exhumed from the grottoes beneath the main altar and has retained an extremely well preserved state. If a body's remains do not decompose, contrary to expectations, it is often treated as a miracle. However, the case of John XXIII's body did not enjoy the same acclamation, as it was held to have been due to embalming and [[adipocere]] formation.
*The body of [[Pope St. Pius X]] (1835–1914; pope 1903–1914) lies in a crystal coffin, in the Chapel of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary. On 17 February 1952, Pius X's body was transferred from the crypt of the Vatican grotto. The body is dressed in pontifical robes, while the face and hands are covered with silver. He lies within a glass and bronze-work sarcophagus for the faithful to see. Papal physicians had been in the habit of removing organs to aid the embalming process. Pius X expressly prohibited this, however, and none of his successors has allowed the practice to be reinstituted.
*Murdered civil rights activist [[Medgar Evers]] was so well embalmed that a valid [[autopsy]] was able to be performed on his corpse decades after his death, and this helped secure the conviction of his killer.
[[File:Lincolnatpeace2.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Lincoln]], detail from a ''[[carte de visite]]'' (photo caption from book, retouched [[Post-mortem photography|''post mortem'' photograph]] by [[John B. Bachelder]], Washington, DC, April 16, 1865)]]
*Famous Russian surgeon and scientist [[Nikolay Ivanovich Pirogov|N. I. Pirogov]] was embalmed after his death in 1881. He was embalmed using the technique he himself developed. His body rests in a church in [[Vinnytsia|Vinnitsa]], Ukraine. In contrast to the corpse of Lenin, which undergoes thorough maintenance in a special underground clinic twice a week, the body of Pirogov rests untouched and unchanging – reportedly only dust has to be brushed off of it. It rests at room temperature in a glass-lid coffin (while Lenin's body is preserved at a constant low temperature).
*[[Abraham Lincoln]] was embalmed after his assassination in 1865. To prevent anyone stealing Lincoln's body, Lincoln's eldest son [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert]] called for Lincoln's exhumation in 1901 to be buried in a concrete vault in the burial room of [[Lincoln Tomb|his tomb]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. Fearing that his body would have been stolen in the interim, Lincoln's coffin was opened, and his features were still recognizable, 36 years after his death.
*[[Rosalia Lombardo]], who died at age one on 6 December 1920, was one of the last corpses to be interred in the [[Capuchin catacombs of Palermo]], Sicily, before the local authorities banned the practice. Nicknamed the 'Sleeping Beauty', Rosalia's body is still perfectly intact. Embalmed by [[Alfredo Salafia]], she is in a glass case, looking very much like a surreal doll.
*[[Eva Perón]] was embalmed by Dr. Pedro Ara ordered by her husband [[Juan Perón]]. The body was preserved to look like it was in a [[sleep]]-like state. The procedure worked and the body showed no signs of decomposition when Eva was interred at her final resting place many years after the initial procedure.
*[[Kemal Ataturk]] was embalmed. His remains were originally laid to rest in the [[Ethnography Museum of Ankara]] from 10 November 1938 to 10 November 1953. He was subsequently moved to [[Anıtkabir]] in [[Ankara]], Turkey, buried in a 42-ton sarcophagus.
*[[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] were embalmed and rest at [[Cihu Mausoleum]] and [[Touliao Mausoleum]] in [[Daxi District]], [[Taoyuan City]], Taiwan.
*[[Ferdinand Marcos]] was embalmed in Hawaii upon his death. His body was flown home and is on display at [[Marcos Museum and Mausoleum]] in [[Batac]], [[Ilocos Norte]], Philippines from 1993 to 18 November 2016 .
*[[Diana, Princess of Wales]] was embalmed shortly after her death in France in August 1997. The decision to embalm her provoked conspiracy theories that she was pregnant; conspiracists claimed, incorrectly, that the embalming fluid would have destroyed any evidence of fetal presence in her womb. The official explanation for the embalming was that the warm conditions in the chapel of rest where her body was laid out would have sped up the decomposition of the remains.

'''Emperor Antoku''' (安徳天皇 ''Antoku-tennō'') (December 22, 1178 – April 25, 1185) was the 81st [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] of [[Japan]], according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1180 through 1185.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). ''Annales des empereurs du Japon,'' pp. 200–207; Brown, Delmer ''et al.'' (1979). ''Gukanshō,'' pp. 333–334; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki.'' pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial family]] was involved in a bitter [[Genpei War|struggle]] between warring clans. [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] with his cousin [[Minamoto no Yoshinaka]], led a force from the [[Minamoto clan]] against the [[Taira clan|Taira]], who controlled the emperor. During the climatic sea [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]] in April 1185, Antoku's grandmother [[Taira no Tokiko]] took him and plunged with him into the water in the Shimonoseki Straits, drowning the child emperor rather than allowing him to be captured by the opposing forces.

The conflict between the clans led to numerous legends and tales. The story of Emperor Antoku and his mother's family became the subject of the [[Kamakura period]] [[epic poem]] ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' (Heike is an alternate reading of the [[kanji|Japanese characters]] for "House of the Taira"). Antoku's tomb is said to be located in a number of places around western Japan, including the island of [[Iwo Jima]], a result of the spreading of legends about the emperor and the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Roberts: Japanese Mythology A to Z, 2nd edition, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-60413-435-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], his personal name (his ''imina'')&lt;ref&gt;Brown, pp. 264; n.b., up until the time of [[Emperor Jomei]], the personal names of the emperors (their ''imina'') were very long and people did not generally use them.  The number of characters in each name diminished after Jomei's reign.&lt;/ref&gt; was Tokohito''-shinnō'' (言仁親王).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 333; Varley, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also known as Kotohito''-shinnō''.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was [[Emperor Takakura]], and thus a grandson of [[Daijō Tennō|retired]] [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]].  His mother, [[Taira no Tokuko]] (平徳子), second daughter of [[Taira no Kiyomori]] (平清盛), was later referred to as Empress Dowager Kenrei (建礼門院, ''[[Kenrei-mon In]]'').

==Events of Antoku's life ==
Antoku was named [[crown prince]] at around one month of age.  He ascended the throne at the age of two.  Naturally, he held no actual power, but rather his grandfather Taira no Kiyomori ruled in his name, though not officially, as [[sessho|''sesshō'']] (regent).

* '''1180''' (''[[Jishō]] 4, 21st day of the 4th month''): In the 12th year of Takakura''-tennō'' 's reign (高倉天皇十二年), the emperor was forced to abdicate; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his infant son, the grandson of Taira Kiyomori.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Antoku is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 200; Brown, p. 333; Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]],  [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of his enthronement, the capital was moved to modern-day [[Kobe, Hyogo|Kōbe]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo]], but it was soon moved back to [[Kyoto|Heian-kyō]].

* '''1183''' (''[[Juei]] 2, 20th day of the 8th month''): Go-Toba is proclaimed emperor by the Minamoto; and consequently, there were two proclaimed emperors, one living in Heian-kyō and another in flight towards the south.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1183, when [[Minamoto no Yoshinaka]] entered the capital, the [[Taira clan]] fled with the young emperor and the [[Japanese imperial regalia|sacred treasures]] to Yashima (the name of a place inside modern-day [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], [[Kagawa prefecture|Kagawa]]).  Being defeated in ensuing battle, they fled westward.

The Taira were defeated.  Antoku's grandmother, [[Taira no Tokiko]], Kiyomori's widow, drowned herself along with the young emperor.  His mother also drowned herself, but apparently, according to [[The Tale of the Heike]] (''Heike Monogatari''), she was pulled out with a [[rake (tool)|rake]] by her long [[hair]].

According to Yoshitsune's dispatch, the sacred seal was found, but the [[Kusanagi|sacred sword]] was lost.  The sword was one of the three [[Japanese imperial regalia|sacred treasures]].&lt;ref name=Sansom&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sansom |first=George |title=A History of Japan to 1334 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1958 |ISBN=0804705232 |pages=303–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kugyō''===
''[[Kugyō]]'' (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Antoku's reign, this apex of the ''[[Daijō-kan]]'' included:
* ''[[Sesshō]]'', [[Konoe Motomichi]], 1160–1233.&lt;ref name="b333"&gt;Brown, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Udaijin]]''
* ''[[Nadaijin]]'', Taira Munemori, 1147–1185.&lt;ref name="b333"/&gt;
* ''[[Dainagon]]''

===Memorial site===
After his drowning, in order to mourn the body and placate any restless spirits, the [[Amidaji]] Goeidō was built.  Later, Antoku was enshrined at the Kurume-Suitengū in [[Kurume, Fukuoka|Kurume]], [[Fukuoka prefecture|Fukuoka]], and he came to be worshipped as Mizu-no-kami (水の神, lit. "water-god" or "god of water"), the god of easy delivery at ''Suitengū'' (水天宮, lit. "water-heaven/emperor-shrine") everywhere.

With the establishment of [[Shinto|Shintō]] as the [[state religion]] of [[Japan]], the Amidaji Temple was abandoned and the [[Akama Shrine]] was established in [[Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi|Shimonoseki]] in [[Yamaguchi prefecture]] to celebrate Antoku.

The [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates ''Amida-ji no misasagi'' (阿彌陀寺陵) near [[Akama Shrine]] in Shimonoseki as Antoku's tomb.&lt;ref name="pf422"&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 422; n.b., although Ponsonby-Fane indicates that the official shrine was in Kyoto in the 1930s, the credible, but unsourced text at the bottom of this article explains that the current location of the shrine is in Shimonoseki.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eras of Antoku's reign==
The years of Antoku's reign are more specifically identified by more than one [[Japanese era names|era name]] or ''[[nengō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, pp. 200–207; Brown, pp. 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Jishō]]''  (1177–1181)
* ''[[Yōwa]]''  (1181–1182)
* ''[[Juei]]''       (1182–1184)
* ''[[Genryaku]]''   (1184–1185)
* ''[[Bunji (Japanese era)|Bunji]]''      (1185–1190)

The '''Five Wisdoms'''{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit: ''pañca-jñāna''; {{bo|t=ཡེ་ཤེས་ལྔ|w=ye shes lnga}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/ye_shes_lnga Rangjung Yeshe Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese: ''go-chi''}} are five kinds of wisdoms which appear when the [[Eight Consciousnesses|mind]] is purified of the five disturbing emotions and the natural mind appears.&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen"&gt;[http://basicdharma.org/index.php/The_Five_Wisdoms Lone Hansen (Shenphen Chödron), ''The Five Wisdoms''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194208/http://basicdharma.org/index.php/The_Five_Wisdoms |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Anger, jealousy, pride, attachment and ignorance&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen" /&gt;}} All of those five wisdoms are represented by one of the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas|five buddha-families]].&lt;ref group=web name="Hansen" /&gt;

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
''Pañca-jñāna'' is orthographically rendered into English as:  Five Wisdoms, Five Awarenesses, Five Pristine Cognitions.

==Five Wisdoms==
The Five Wisdoms are:
# ''Tathatā-jñāna'', the wisdom of [[Suchness]] or ''[[Dharmadhatu]]'', "the bare non-conceptualizing awareness" of ''[[Śūnyatā]]'', the [[monism|universal substrate]] of the other four ''jñāna'';{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''Ādarśa-jñāna'', the wisdom of "Mirror-like Awareness", "devoid of all dualistic thought and ever united with its 'content' as a mirror is with its reflections";{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}{{refn|group=note|''Ādarśa'' is Sanskrit for "mirror", the term may be parsed into the [[etymon]] of ''[[darśana]]'' with a grammatical [[adposition]]}}
# ''Samatā-jñāna'', the wisdom of the "Awareness of Sameness", which perceives the sameness, the commonality of  ''[[dharmas]]'' or [[phenomena]].{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''{{IAST|Pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna}}'', the wisdom of "Investigative Awareness", that perceives the [[:wikt:specificity|specificity]], the uniqueness of ''dharmas''.{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}
# ''{{IAST|Kṛty-anuṣṭhāna-jñāna}}'', the wisdom of "Accomplishing Activities", the awareness that "spontaneously carries out all that has to be done for the welfare of beings, manifesting itself in all directions".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

The Five Wisdoms "emerge through a transformation (parāvṛtti) of the eight consciousnesses at the moment of enlightenment".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

==Five Dhyani Buddhas==
[[Image:BuddhaLoutsSm.jpg|thumb|Cloth with painting of the Buddha]]

The idea of the Five Wisdoms "underwent a considerable development" within [[Tibetan Buddhism]] where they are "symbolized or embodied" in the [[Five Dhyani Buddhas]].{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=209}}

According to [[Tenzin Wangyal]], the [[Five Pure Lights]] become the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|Five Poisons]] if we remain deluded, or the Five Wisdoms and the [[Five Buddha Families]] if we recognize their purity.&lt;ref&gt;Wangyal, Tenzin (author) &amp; Dahlby, Mark (editor). ''Healing with Form, Energy and Light: The Five Elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen''.  Ithaca, NY, USA: Snow Lion Publications.  {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Wisdoms, and the accompanying Five Buddhas, are represented in Tibetan Buddhism by the "symbolic bone ornaments".{{refn|group=note|Skt: aṣṭhiamudrā; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya}}&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 2005 p.493"&gt;[[Jamgon Kongtrul|Kongtrul, Jamgön]] (author); (English translators: Guarisco, Elio; McLeod, Ingrid) (2005).

Bolder, Colorado, USA: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-210-X}} (alk.paper) p.493&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' associates the Symbolic Bone Ornaments directly with the Five Wisdoms:{{refn|group=note|These are elucidated by a commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' by [[Jamgön Kongtrul]].&lt;ref&gt;refer CH, f. 66a6-b1; where CH = Kongtrul Lodrö Taé, ''Disclosing the Secret of the Invincible Vajra: Phrase by Phrase Commentary on the Hevajra Tantra Two Examinations'' (dPal kye'i rdo rje'i rgyud kyi rgyal po brtag pa gnyis pa'i tshig don rnam par 'grol ba bzhom med rdo rje'i gsang ba 'byed pa). Rumtex, Sikkim: Dharma Chakra Centre, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
# the 'wheel-like' (Tib.: 'khor lo) 'crown ornament' (sometimes called 'crown jewel') (Tib.: gtsug gi nor bu), symbolic of [[Akshobhya]] and 'mirror-like pristine awareness' (Ādarśa-jñāna);
# 'earrings' (Tib.: rna cha) represent of [[Amitabha]] and pristine awareness of discernment (Pratyavekṣaṇa-jñāna);
# 'necklace' (Tib.: mgul rgyan) symbolizing [[Ratnasambhava]] and pristine awareness of total sameness (Samatā-jñāna);
# 'bracelets' (Tib.: lag gdu) and 'anklets' (Tib.: gdu bu) as symbolic of [[Vairochana]] and pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena (Tathatā-jñāna);
# 'girdle' (Tib.: ske rags) symbolizing [[Amoghasiddhi]] and the accomplishing pristine awareness (Kṛty-anuṣṭhāna-jñāna);
The additional ornament spoken of in various texts related to Hevajra is ash from a cremation ground smeared on the body (Tib.: thal chen).&lt;ref name="Kongtrul 2005 p.493"/&gt;

Gilmore was born on February 7, 1930, at [[Goebel's Wild Animal Farm]] – a theme park and supplier of animals for Hollywood movies.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASM/&gt; The lion was sponsored by and named after the [[Gilmore Oil Company]], whose icon was a red lion with the slogan "Roar with Gilmore".&lt;ref name=NASM/&gt; The company gave Turner $15,000 to buy the lion and a plane that was decorated to advertise Gilmore Oil.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;  The Humane Society petitioned Turner to equip Gilmore with a parachute, which also resulted in enhancing the image of a "flying lion".&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; After he grew too large for flying, Gilmore accompanied Turner to publicity appearances over the next ten years. During a brief eight-month period, Gilmore logged over 25,000 miles in the air and was a passenger during multiple air speed record runs.  When not flying, Gilmore made public appearances including at the golf course and disconcerted the mailman and other visitors to Turner's home when he answered the door.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

Once he reached {{convert|150|lb}} in weight and had outgrown the cockpit and his parachute, he was kept at the airport in [[Burbank, California]] (then known as the [[Hollywood Burbank Airport|United Airport]]), and a Gilmore Oil service station in Beverly Hills until around 1940.&lt;ref name=NASM/&gt; He spent his last decade at the World Jungle Compound, where Turner continued to pay for his food and visited him,&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; and died on December 17, 1950.&lt;ref name=NASM/&gt; Turner then had him [[taxidermy|mounted]] and displayed him in his home.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; After Roscoe Turner's death in 1970, both the plane used during the 1930 campaign and Gilmore's stuffed remains were exhibited at the Turner Museum until it closed in 1972. They were then donated by his wife to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] where they were exhibited first at the [[Arts and Industries Building]] and then at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] until 1981.&lt;ref name=NASM/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

'''High Resolution Melt''' ('''HRM''') '''analysis''' is a powerful technique in [[molecular biology]] for the detection of [[mutation]]s, [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] and [[epigenetic]] differences in [[DNA|double-stranded DNA]] samples.  It was discovered and developed by Idaho Technology and the University of Utah.&lt;ref&gt;For academic treatment of the history of HRM see http://www.dna.utah.edu/Hi-Res/TOP_Hi-Res%20Melting.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has advantages over other [[genotyping]] technologies, namely:
* It is cost effective vs. other [[genotyping]] technologies such as [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] and [[TaqMan]] SNP typing. This makes it ideal for large scale genotyping projects.
* It is fast and powerful thus able to accurately genotype many samples rapidly.
* It is simple.  With a good quality HRM assay, powerful genotyping can be performed by non-geneticists in any laboratory with access to an HRM capable real-time PCR machine.

==Method==
HRM analysis is performed on double stranded DNA samples. Typically the user will use [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) prior to HRM analysis to amplify the DNA region in which their mutation of interest lies. In the sample tube there are now many copies of the DNA region of interest. This region that is amplified is known as the amplicon.
After the PCR process the HRM analysis begins.  The process is simply a precise warming of the amplicon DNA from around 50 ˚C up to around 95 ˚C.  At some point during this process, the melting temperature of the amplicon is reached and the two strands of DNA separate or "melt" apart.

[[File:DNA melting cartoon.jpg|500px]]

The secret of HRM is to monitor this process happening in real-time.  This is achieved by using a fluorescent dye.  The dyes that are used for HRM are known as intercalating dyes and have a unique property. They bind specifically to double-stranded DNA and when they are bound they fluoresce brightly. In the absence of double stranded DNA they have nothing to bind to and they only fluoresce at a low level.  
At the beginning of the HRM analysis there is a high level of fluorescence in the sample because of the billions of copies of the amplicon.  But as the sample is heated up and the two strands of the DNA melt apart, presence of double stranded DNA decreases and thus fluorescence is reduced.  The HRM machine has a camera that watches this process by measuring the fluorescence.  The machine then simply plots this data as a graph known as a melt curve, showing the level of fluorescence vs the temperature:

[[File:DNA melting scenatic curve.jpg|500px]]

===Spot the difference===
The melting temperature of the amplicon at which the two DNA strands come apart is entirely predictable. It is dependent on the sequence of the DNA bases. If you are comparing two samples from two different people, they should give exactly the same shaped melt curve.  However, if one person has a mutation in the DNA region you have amplified, then this will alter the temperature at which the DNA strands melt apart.  So now the two melt curves appear different.  The difference may only be tiny, perhaps a fraction of a degree, but because the HRM machine has the ability to monitor this process in "high resolution", it is possible to accurately document these changes and therefore identify if a mutation is present or not.

[[File:DNA melting scematic curve 2.jpg|500px]]

===Wild type, heterozygote or homozygote?===
Things become slightly more complicated than this because organisms contain two ([[Polyploidy|or more]]) copies of each gene,  known as the two [[allele]]s.  So, if a sample is taken from a patient and amplified using PCR both copies of the region of DNA (alleles)  of interest are amplified.  So if we are looking for mutation there are now three possibilities:

# Neither allele contains a mutation
# One or other allele contains a mutation
# Both alleles contain a mutation.

These three scenarios are known as "Wild–type", "Heterozygote" or "Homozygote" respectively.  Each gives a melt curve that is slightly different.  With a high quality HRM assay it is possible to distinguish between all three of these scenarios.

Homozygous allelic variants may be characterised by a temperature shift on the resulting melt curve produced by HRM analysis. In comparison, heterozygotes are characterised by changes in melt curve shape. This is due to base-pair mismatching generated as a result of destabilised heteroduplex annealing between wild-type and variant strands. These differences can be easily seen on the resulting melt curve and the melt profile differences between the different genotypes can be amplified visually via generating a difference curve &lt;ref&gt;S Taylor et al., 2010.

==Applications==

===SNP typing/Point mutation detection===
Conventional [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] typing methods are typically time consuming and expensive, requiring several probe based assays to be multiplexed together or the use of DNA microarrays. HRM is more cost effective and reduces the need to design multiple pairs of primers and the need to purchase expensive probes. The HRM method has been successfully used to detect a single G to A substitution in the gene Vssc (Voltage Sensitive Sodium Channel) which confers resistance to the acaricide [[permethrin]] in Scabies mite. This mutation results in a coding change in the protein (G1535D). The analysis of scabies mites collected from suspected permethrin susceptible and tolerant populations by HRM showed distinct melting profiles.  The [[amplicons]] from the sensitive mites were observed to have a higher melting temperature relative to the tolerant mites, as expected from the higher thermostability of the GC [[base pair]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pasay C, Arlian L, Morgan M, etal |title=High-resolution melt analysis for the detection of a mutation associated with permethrin resistance in a population of scabies mites |journal=Med. Vet. Entomol. |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=82–8 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18380658 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2915.2008.00716.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0269-283X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=22&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a field more relevant to clinical diagnostics, HRM has been shown to be suitable in principle for the detection of mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. More than 400 mutations have been identified in these genes.&lt;br /&gt;The sequencing of genes is the gold standard for identifying mutations. Sequencing is time consuming and labour-intensive and is often preceded by techniques used to identify heteroduplex DNA, which then further amplify these issues.  HRM  offers a faster and more convenient closed-tube method of assessing the presence of mutations and gives a result which can be further investigated if it is of interest.  In a study carried out by Scott et al. in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=James PA, Doherty R, Harris M, etal |title=Optimal selection of individuals for BRCA mutation testing: a comparison of available methods |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=707–15 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16446345 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.01.9737 |url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/24/4/707}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3 cell lines harbouring different BRCA mutations were used to assess the HRM methodology. It was found that the melting profiles of the resulting PCR products could be used to distinguish the presence or absence of a mutation in the amplicon. Similarly in 2007 Krypuy et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krypuy M, Ahmed AA, Etemadmoghadam D, etal |title=High resolution melting for mutation scanning of TP53 exons 5-8 |journal=BMC Cancer |volume=7 |issue= |pages=168 |year=2007 |pmid=17764544 |pmc=2025602 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-7-168 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/7/168}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the careful design of  HRM assays (with regards to primer placement) could be successfully employed to detect mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the tumour suppressor protein p53 in clinical samples of breast and ovarian cancer.  Both these studies highlighted the fact that changes in the melting profile can be in the form of a shift in the melting temperature or an obvious difference in the shape of the melt curve.  Both of these parameters are a function of the amplicon sequence.
The consensus is that HRM is a cost efficient method that can be employed as an initial screen for  samples suspected of harbouring polymorphisms or mutations.  This would reduce the number of samples which need to be investigated further using more conventional methods.

===Zygosity testing===
Currently there are many methods used to determine the [[zygosity]] status of a gene at a particular locus.  These methods include the use of PCR with specifically designed probes to detect the variants of the genes (SNP typing is the simplest case).  In cases where longer stretches of variation is implicated, post PCR analysis of the amplicons may be required.  Changes in enzyme restriction, electrophoretic and chromatographic profiles can be measured.  These methods are usually more time consuming and increase the risk of amplicon contamination in the laboratory, due to the need to work with high concentrations of amplicons in the lab post-PCR.  The use of HRM reduces the time required for analysis and the risk of contamination. HRM is a more cost effective solution and the high resolution element not only allows the determination of [[Homozygous#Homozygous|homo]] and [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygosity]], it also resolves information about the type of homo and heterozygosity, with different gene variants giving rise to differing melt curve shapes.  A study by Gundry et al. 2003,&lt;ref name=Gundry03/&gt; showed that  [[fluorescent labelling]] of one primer (in the pair) has been shown to be favourable over using an intercalating dye such as [[SYBR Green|SYBR green I]].  However, progress has been made in the development and use of improved intercalating dyes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wittwer CT, Reed GH, Gundry CN, Vandersteen JG, Pryor RJ |title=High-resolution genotyping by amplicon melting analysis using LCGreen |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=49 |issue=6 Pt 1 |pages=853–60 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12765979 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/49/6/853 |doi=10.1373/49.6.853}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduce the issue of PCR inhibition and concerns over non-saturating intercalation of the dye.

===Epigenetics===
The HRM methodology has also been exploited to provide a reliable analysis of the [[DNA methylation|methylation]] status of DNA.  This is of significance since changes to the methylation status of tumour suppressor genes, genes that regulate [[apoptosis]] and DNA repair, are characteristics of cancers and also have implications for responses to chemotherapy.  For example, cancer patients can be more sensitive to treatment with [[Alkylating antineoplastic agent|DNA alkylating agents]] if the promoter of the DNA repair gene [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|''MGMT'']] of the patient is methylated. In a study which tested the methylation status of the ''MGMT'' promoter on 19 colorectal samples, 8 samples were found to be methylated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wojdacz TK, Dobrovic A |title=Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM): a new approach for sensitive and high-throughput assessment of methylation |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=e41 |year=2007 |pmid=17289753 |pmc=1874596 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm013 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/35/6/e41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study compared the predictive power of ''MGMT'' promoter methylation in 83 high grade glioma patients obtained by either [[Methylation specific PCR|MSP]], [[pyrosequencing]], and HRM. The HRM method was found to be at least equivalent to pyrosequencing in quantifying the methylation level &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Switzeny|first=Olivier J.|last2=Christmann|first2=Markus|last3=Renovanz|first3=Mirjam|last4=Giese|first4=Alf|last5=Sommer|first5=Clemens|last6=Kaina|first6=Bernd|date=2016-05-05|title=MGMT promoter methylation determined by HRM in comparison to MSP and pyrosequencing for predicting high-grade glioma response|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13148-016-0204-7|journal=Clinical Epigenetics|volume=8|pages=49|doi=10.1186/s13148-016-0204-7|issn=1868-7083|pmc=4858829|pmid=27158275}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Methylated DNA can be treated by bi-sulphite modification, which converts non-methylated [[Deamination#Cytosine|cytosines to uracil]].  Therefore,  PCR products resulting from a template that was originally unmethylated will have a lower melting point than those derived from a methylated template. HRM also offers the possibility of determining the proportion of methylation in a given sample, by comparing it to a standard curve which is generated by mixing different ratios of methylated and non-methylated DNA together. This can offer information regarding the degree of methylation that a tumour may have and thus give an indication of the character of the tumour and how far it deviates from what is "normal".

HRM also is practically advantageous for use in diagnostics, due to its capacity to be adapted to high throughput screening testing, and again it minimises the possibility of amplicon spread and contamination within a laboratory, owing to its closed-tube format.

===Intercalating dyes===
To follow the transition of dsDNA (double-stranded) to ssDNA (single-stranded), intercalating dyes are employed. These dyes show differential fluorescence emission dependent on their association with double-stranded or single-stranded DNA. [[SYBR Green|SYBR Green I]] is a first generation dye for HRM. It fluoresces when intercalated into dsDNA and not ssDNA. Because it may inhibit PCR at high concentrations, it is used at sub-saturating concentrations.  Recently, some researchers have discouraged the use of SYBR Green I for HRM,&lt;ref name=Reed07&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reed GH, Kent JO, Wittwer CT |title=High-resolution DNA melting analysis for simple and efficient molecular diagnostics |journal=Pharmacogenomics |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=597–608 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17559349 |doi=10.2217/14622416.8.6.597 |url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/14622416.8.6.597?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}} [http://www.gene-quantification.de/reed-hrm-2007.pdf as PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that substantial protocol modifications are required. This is because it is suggested that the lack of accuracy may result from "dye jumping", where dye from a melted duplex may get reincorporated into regions of dsDNA which had not yet melted.&lt;ref name=Gundry03&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gundry CN, Vandersteen JG, Reed GH, Pryor RJ, Chen J, Wittwer CT |title=Amplicon melting analysis with labeled primers: a closed-tube method for differentiating homozygotes and heterozygotes |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=396–406 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12600951 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12600951 |doi=10.1373/49.3.396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reed07/&gt;  New saturating dyes such as LC Green and LC Green Plus, ResoLight, EvaGreen, Chromofy and SYTO 9 are available on the market and have been used successfully for HRM.  However, some groups have successfully used SYBR Green I for HRM with the Corbett Rotorgene instruments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pornprasert S, Phusua A, Suanta S, Saetung R, Sanguansermsri T |title=Detection of alpha-thalassemia-1 Southeast Asian type using real-time gap-PCR with SYBR Green1 and high resolution melting analysis |journal=Eur. J. Haematol. |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=510–4 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18284625 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01055.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0902-4441&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=80&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=510}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocate the use of SYBR Green I for HRM applications.

==Design of high-resolution melting experiments==

High resolution melting assays typically involve qPCR amplification followed by a melting curve collected using a fluorescent dye. Due to the sensitivity of high-resolution melting analysis, it is necessary to carefully consider PCR cycling conditions, template DNA quality, and melting curve parameters.&lt;ref name="Montgomery2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montgomery JL, Sanford LN, Wittwer CT |title=High-resolution DNA melting analysis in clinical research and diagnostics. |journal=Expert Rev Mol Diagn. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=219–240 |year=2010 |pmid=20214540 |doi=10.1586/erm.09.84}}&lt;/ref&gt; For accurate and repeatable results, PCR thermal cycling conditions must be optimized to ensure that the desired DNA region is amplified with high specificity and minimal bias between sequence variants. The melting curve is typically performed across a broad range of temperatures in small (~0.3&amp;nbsp;°C) increments that are long enough (~10 seconds) for the DNA to reach equilibrium at each temperature step.

In addition to typical [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] design considerations, the design of primers for high-resolution melting assays involves maximizing the thermodynamic differences between PCR products belonging to different genotypes. Smaller amplicons generally yield greater melting temperature variation than longer amplicons, but the variability cannot be predicted by eye. For this reason, it is critical to accurately predict the melting curve of PCR products when designing primers that will distinguish sequence variants. Specialty software, such as uMelt&lt;ref name="Dwight2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dwight Z, Palais R, Wittwer CT |title=uMELT: prediction of high-resolution melting curves and dynamic melting profiles of PCR products in a rich web application. |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=1019–1020 |year=2011 |pmid=21300699 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btr065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DECIPHER (software)|DesignSignatures]],&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright ES, Vetsigian KH |title=DesignSignatures: a tool for designing primers that yields amplicons with distinct signatures. |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=1565–1567 |year=2016 |pmid=26803162 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btw047}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available to help design primers that will maximize melting curve variability specifically for high-resolution melting assays.

==Reception==
The film, on the whole, was not received well, despite praise for Kim Basinger's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Basinger, Kim: I Dreamed of Africa | url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=3936&amp;Section=Interviews | publisher = Urban Cinefile | date = 17 Aug 2000 | accessdate = 27 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given a 10% ranking on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 102 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_dreamed_of_africa/ |title=I Dreamed of Africa |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basinger earned a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] (also for ''[[Bless the Child]]'').

It was also a huge financial [[Box office bomb|flop]]; its budget was $50 million while worldwide gross was less than $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = I Dreamed of Africa | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=idreamedofafrica.htm | publisher = Box Office Mojo | date = | accessdate = 27 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1276">'''Inouwa''' or '''Ilouwa''' is the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] belief in [[reincarnation]] in their [[Igbo mythology|mythology]], which translates form [[Igbo language|Igbo]] to [[English language|English]] as ''to come back to the world''. Reincarnation is believed to occur between immediate and [[extended family]] and sometimes the person who is reincarnated notifies the family, before their death, who they will come back to the world as.&lt;ref&gt;http://jas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/20/1-2/13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reincarnation ==
Relatives identify the reincarnated ancestor by checking the newborn for body markings/[[birthmark]]s or physical features the ancestor had had. Statements as well as the behavior of the baby similar to the deceased ancestor is made to confirm the identity of who the child was in their [[Reincarnation|past life]]. [[Oracles]] can also confirm the identity of the baby in their past life.&lt;ref&gt;http://jas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/20/1-2/13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ogbanje ==
{{Main|Ogbanje}}
Ogbanje are the negative or [[evil spirit]]s that are reincarnated to cause misfortune to the family by constantly dying and coming back again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Instantaneously trained neural networks''' are feedforward [[artificial neural networks]] that create a new hidden neuron node for each novel training sample. The weights to this hidden neuron separate out not only this training sample but others that are near it, thus providing generalization. &lt;ref name="kak93"&gt;Kak, S. On training feedforward neural networks. Pramana, vol. 40, pp. 35-42, 1993 [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02898040] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. New algorithms for training feedforward neural networks. Pattern Recognition Letters 15: 295-298, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; This separation is done using the nearest hyperplane that can be written down instantaneously. In the two most important implementations the neighborhood of generalization either varies with the training sample (CC1 network) or remains constant (CC4 network). These networks use [[unary coding]] for an effective representation of the data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. On generalization by neural networks, Information Sciences 111: 293-302, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of network was first proposed in a 1993 paper of [[Subhash Kak]].&lt;ref name="kak93"/&gt; Since then, instantaneously trained neural networks have been proposed as models of short term [[learning]] and used in [[web search]], and financial [[time series prediction]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S. Faster web search and prediction using instantaneously trained neural networks. IEEE Intelligent Systems 14: 79-82, November/December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been used in instant [[document classification|classification of documents]]&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Z. et al., TextCC: New feedforward neural network for classifying documents instantly. Advances in Neural Networks ISNN 2005. [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] 3497: 232-237, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[deep learning]] and [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Z. et al., Document Classification Via TextCC Based on Stereographic Projection and for deep learning, International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Dalin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidhuber, J. Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview, arXiv:1404.7828, 2014 https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7828&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other neural networks, their normal use is as software, but they have also been implemented in hardware using FPGAs&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, J. and G. Milne, Implementing Kak Neural Networks on a Reconfigurable Computing Platform, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 1896: 260-269, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and by optical implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Shortt, A., J.G. Keating, L. Moulinier, C.N. Pannell, Optical implementation of the Kak neural network, Information Sciences 171: 273-287, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CC4 network==

In the CC4 network, which is a three-stage network, the number of input nodes is one more than the size of the training vector, with the extra node serving as the biasing node whose input is always 1. For binary input vectors, the weights from the input nodes to the hidden neuron (say of index j) corresponding to the trained vector is given by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij} = \begin{cases}
   -1, &amp; \mbox{for } x_i = 0\\
                         +1, &amp; \mbox{for } x_i = 1\\
  r+s-1, &amp; \mbox{for } i = n+1
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r &lt;/math&gt; is the radius of generalization and &lt;math&gt;s &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamming weight]] (the number of 1s) of the binary sequence. From the hidden layer to the output layer the weights are 1 or -1 depending on whether the vector belongs to a given output class or not. The neurons in the hidden and output layers output 1 if the weighted sum to the input is 0 or positive and 0, if the weighted sum to the input is negative:

:&lt;math&gt;y = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; \mbox{if } \sum x_i \ge 0\\ 0 &amp; \mbox{if } \sum x_i&lt; 0\end{matrix} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
==Other networks==

The CC4 network has also been modified to include non-binary input with varying radii of generalization so that it effectively provides a CC1 implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, K.W. and Kak, S. Fast classification networks for signal processing. ''Circuits, Systems, Signal Processing'' 21, 2002, pp. 207-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In feedback networks the Willshaw network as well as the [[Hopfield network]] are able to learn instantaneously.

The '''International Center on Nonviolent Conflict''' is an independent, nonprofit educational foundation, founded by [[Jack DuVall]] and [[Peter Ackerman]]&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Ackerman - Founding Chair". International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. 2009. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002. It promotes the study and utilization of nonmilitary strategies by civilian-based movements to establish and defend [[human rights]], [[social justice]] and democracy.

==Aims==
Based in Washington, DC, ICNC works with educational institutions and [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] in the United States and around the world to educate the global public and to influence policies and media coverage of the growing phenomenon of strategic nonviolent action.

==History==
The ICNC was founded by [[Peter Ackerman]] and [[Jack DuVall]] in 2002. Jack DuVall serves as ICNC’s president and Founding Director, while Peter Ackerman serves as ICNC's Founding Chair.&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Ackerman - Founding Chair". International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. 2009. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A writer, former military intelligence officer, and former [[public television]] executive, Jack DuVall was the executive producer of a television series, "A Force More Powerful", on the television station [[PBS]] and is co-author of the companion book of the same name (Palgrave/St. Martin’s Press 2001), both of which explore major 20th century nonviolent action campaigns. Peter Ackerman, a venture capitalist who was a highly-paid associate of Michael Milken at Drexel Burham Lambert in the 1980s specializing in leveraged buyouts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1992-06-07/the-drexel-debacles-teflon-guy |title=The Drexel Debacle's Teflon Guy |last1=Bianco |first1=Anthony |publisher=Bloomberg |date=1992-06-08 |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; received his PhD. from Tufts University’s Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy, and  has written a series of scholarly books on strategic nonviolent action, has served on the board of Freedom House (including as chair between 2005-2009&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Peter Ackerman Becomes New Chairman of Freedom House". Freedom House. 2005-09-08. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom House Welcomes William H. Taft IV as New Chairman". Freedom House. 2009-01-08. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;) and is a member of Council on Foreign Relations.[1] In raising public awareness of the history and ideas of nonviolent conflict in both democratic and autocratic societies, ICNC has disseminated books, articles, broadcast media, video programming, computer games and other learning materials. Staff members and associated scholars have led seminars in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East for journalists, activists, educators and NGO leaders on the history and dynamics of strategic nonviolent action.

ICNC involvement in seminars and workshops involving activists in human rights, pro-democracy and social justice campaigns overseas have led to charges from some governments of foreign intervention, though ICNC policy prohibits its presenters from giving specific advice regarding any particular struggle. Such workshops, according to ICNC policy, come only in response to specific requests from activist groups themselves and are not initiated by ICNC. ICNC also maintains a strictly apolitical posture, in that it works with groups challenging autocratic governments regardless of a given regime's ideological orientation or relations with the United States.

However, ICNC allegedly maintains connections with the "US-based 'democracy promoting' establishment groups of USAID and Reagan's National Endowment for Democracy as well as links to the CIA."&lt;ref&gt;Marty Branagan (2013). Global Warming, Militarism and Nonviolence: The Art of Active Resistance, pp. 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICNC has cooperated with other independent non-profit groups concerned with strategic nonviolent action, including the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], Nonviolence International, and the Serbian-based Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). ICNC is funded exclusively through a private family endowment and maintains a strict policy of not accepting funding from nor collaborating with any government or government-funded entities.

Hardy Merriman who is president of the ICNC&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/about/who-we-are/&lt;/ref&gt; worked for the Albert Einstein Institution from 2002-2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://hardymerriman.com/hardy-merriman/&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Ackerman funded the Albert Einstein Institution from its founding in 1983 until 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122127204268531319/|title=American Revolutionary Quiet Boston Scholar Inspires Rebels Around the World|last1=Shishkin |first1=Philip|publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2008-09-13 |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged ICNC intervention in Venezuelan politics===
ICNC has been criticized for involvement in US-backed regime change operations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gowans (2010). "The Revolution Will Not Be Assisted By The ICNC (The Counter-Revolution Is Another Matter)." https://gowans.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/the-revolution-will-not-be-assisted-by-the-icnc-the-counter-revolution-is-another-matter/.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, American-Venezuelan lawyer Eva Golinger alleged that during 2005 and 2006, the ICNC trained Venezuelan youths to try to reverse the government of Hugo Chávez, through "[impeding] the electoral process and [creating] a scenario of fraud,"&lt;ref&gt;Golinger, Eva (2010-02-07). "Colored Revolutions: A New Form of Regime Change, Made in USA". Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the ICNC did this together with USAID and NED as part of a systemic plan of implementing United States foreign policy aims in democratic countries.&lt;ref&gt;Golinger, Eva (2010-02-07). "Colored Revolutions: A New Form of Regime Change, Made in USA". Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;   ICNC denies it ever engaged in such trainings,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38024&lt;/ref&gt; which are a violation of its charter. Jack Duvall has claimed that the only time ICNC was ever involved in Venezuela was in 2006 when it supported the travel of two nonviolent activists to the World Social Forum in Caracas, at which they met with Chavez supporters to discuss methods of resisting any possible coup attempt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38024&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to Criticisms==
In response to criticisms made by Michael Barker, Stephen Zunes, who acts as the chair of the ICNC's advisory board wrote that the...

:"...ICNC does not 'work closely' with the Albert Einstein Institution, does not 'provide its theoretical underpinnings' and has never had a single operational meeting with anyone representing them. The primary connection between the two independent non-profit institutes has been ICNC's support for foreign-language translations of their literature, which have been used by nonviolent activists struggling for freedom and justice in dozens of countries." &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Zunes, [http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38238 Inaccurate and unfair attacks on the ICNC], ''Green Left Weekly'', August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Mellon''' (born February 1957), is a British [[billionaire]] businessman.

==Early life==
James Mellon was born in February 1957 in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="richlist2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rich List 2017: #140, £920 million|work=The Sunday Times Magazine|date=7 May 2017|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is the former diplomat, Sir James Mellon, who was [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Ghana|High Commissioner to Ghana]] (1978–1983), [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Denmark|Ambassador to Denmark]] (1983–1986) and [[List of Consuls-General of the United Kingdom in New York|Consul General in New York]] (1986–1988). The family are distantly related to the [[Mellon family|Pittsburgh Mellon banking dynasty]].&lt;ref name=spear's&gt;{{cite news|author=Ivan Lindsay |title=It’s Going to the Dogs… |url=http://www.spearswms.com/its-going-to-the-dogs/ |work=Spear's Magazine |date=29 September 2009 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Ampleforth College]] and then [[Oriel College, Oxford]] where he obtained a master's degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics.&lt;ref name=spear's/&gt;&lt;ref name=FT2012&gt;{{cite news|author=Natalie Graham |title=I’m an opportunistic plagiarist |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7eab96ce-bf96-11e1-bb88-00144feabdc0 |work=Financial Times |date=29 June 2012 |access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After university, in 1979, Mellon went to work as a trainee [[fund manager]] at Griffin Thornton (GT Management), spending six months in [[Hong Kong]], before moving to [[San Francisco]]. Leaving with Richard Thornton in 1984 to cofound Thornton Management, Mellon returned to Hong Kong to run the company's operation there. Thornton sold for £25 million four years later, making him a millionaire aged 28. He then spent two years setting-up a Hong Kong operation for Tyndall Holdings.&lt;ref name=FT2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/308657/energetic-jim-mellon-man-many-parts-writes-charlotte-parsons |title=The energetic Jim Mellon is a man of many parts, writes Charlotte Parsons |date=21 February 2000 |work=South China Morning Post |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spear's/&gt;

Along with Jayne Sutcliffe in 1992, he founded Regent Pacific as an [[emerging markets]] investment vehicle, with [[Sir John Templeton]] their first customer. In 1994 came what Mellon calls his "first really big break". Having read about [[privatization in Russia]] he travelled to Moscow and find Russians selling vouchers on the streets that could be swapped for stock in Russian industries. In a single day he and Sutcliffe spent $2 million in the covered markets buying the vouchers for about $25 each from "old ladies" who thought them worth no more "than a bottle of vodka". A few weeks later the shares were worth $17 million.&lt;ref name=spear's/&gt;&lt;ref name=FT2012/&gt;

A spin-off of from Regent Pacific that specialises in [[Eastern Europe]], the fund management firm [[Charlemagne Capital]], was also founded in the 1990s and listed on the stock market in 2006.&lt;ref name=spear's/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Oxlade |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/11480957/Jim-Mellon-Now-is-the-time-for-Britons-to-buy-European-property.html |title=Jim Mellon: Now is the time for Britons to buy European property |publisher=Telegraph |date=19 March 2015 |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] was disastrous for Regent, with the value of investments in the company's Russian and East European funds becoming almost worthless, and most of its cash tied-up in local currency bonds as the rouble was devalued.&lt;ref name=SCMP/&gt;

When Regent Pacific acquired a stake in [[Hambros Bank]], Mellon launched a public attack on the board's performance which preceded the break-up of the bank. This and Regent's methods of breaking-up of [[closed-end fund]]s led to accusations of [[asset stripping]] and a 1997 [[Business Week]] article referred to him and the company's investment director, Peter Everington as "the Bad Boys of Emerging Markets". In 2009 Mellon said "in hindsight I was overly vociferous, and I have not done it again like that — I’m now more behind the scenes".&lt;ref name=spear's/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark L Clifford |title=The Bad Boys Of Emerging Markets |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1997-06-22/the-bad-boys-of-emerging-markets |work=Bloomberg Business Week |date=29 June 1997 |access-date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Stephen Dattels, Mellon founded the [[uranium]] mining company Uramin in 2005 with just $100,000. Also listed on the stock market in 2006, it sold the following year to [[Areva]] for around £1.6 billion, reportedly making him about £80 million. Areva later had to accept a huge [[write-down]] in Uramin's value.&lt;ref name=FT2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Lyall |title=Britain's answer to Warren Buffett backs the biotech sector in new investing book |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-2185618/JIM-MELLON-INTERVIEW-Britains-answer-Warren-Buffett-cracks-wealth-code-investing-book.html |work=This is money |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=8 August 2012 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mellon has said he (financially) “had a good day” after the Brexit vote with his trades returning almost 25 percent profit on the year.&lt;ref name=Inde&gt;{{cite web|author=Stefania Spezzati |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/investor-who-predicted-brexit-now-says-the-euro-will-collapse-a7446271.html |title=Investor who predicted Brexit now says the euro will collapse &amp;#124; Business News &amp;#124; News |publisher=The Independent |date=29 November 2016 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In 2009 was a leading financial backer of (then future [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) [[David Cameron]] and critical of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's "crazy crackdown on the non-[[Domicile (law)|domiciles]] who bring so much money and expertise into the country".&lt;ref name=spear's/&gt;

Mellon is reportedly the man who first introduced Arron Banks to then [[UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Laura Pitel |title=Farage’s millionaire donors find ways to save money on tax |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farages-millionaire-donors-find-ways-to-save-money-on-tax-ncxc8cg99ld |work=The Times |date=3 October 2015 |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|author1=David D.

He donated at least £100,000 towards campaigns to leave the EU in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hope |first=Christopher |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11717415/Millionaire-Jim-Mellon-backs-20million-anti-politics-campaign-to-leave-EU-as-name-revealed.html |title=Millionaire Jim Mellon backs £20million 'anti-politics' campaign to leave EU as name revealed |publisher=Telegraph |date=11 July 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Mellon said he was less “ideologically committed” to Brexit than his friend Arron Banks, and that there were “good arguments to be made on both sides” of what he saw as a “nuanced” debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Ward |title=Brexit backer calls halt on scaremongering |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7852d156-e7b1-11e5-bc31-138df2ae9ee6 |work=Financial Times |date=13 March 2016 |access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Mellon felt that "Brexit is going to be a sideshow to the problems of Europe" and predicted that the Euro would not last, saying that "the euro as it stands at the moment is just a very inappropriate mechanism — I give the euro between one and five years of life."&lt;ref name=Inde/&gt; He also serves on the executive board of the [[Initiative for Free Trade]], a London-based research foundation founded by another prominent leave-supporter [[Daniel Hannan]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], after the Brexit vote, that aims to promote [[free trade]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|author=Lizzy Buchan |title=Boris Johnson under fire for waiving £6,000 fee for hard Brexit event at Foreign Office |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-fee-hard-brexit-event-foreign-office-ift-daniel-hannan-a8223971.html |work=Independent |date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifreetrade.org/about|title=IFT|website=IFT|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Mellon said there would be "a second referendum" that "remain will win".&lt;ref name="masterinvestor.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Mellon |title=Jim Mellon: Reality sinks in for the FANGs |url=https://masterinvestor.co.uk/economics/jim-mellon-reality-sinks-in-for-the-fangs/ |work=Master Investor |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Mellon donated £100,000 to the Institute of Healthy Ageing at [[University College London|UCL]], which allowed them to purchase a [[Super-resolution microscopy#Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)|structured illumination microscope]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/biosciences-news-publication/2017-2018/philanthropic-donation-institute-healthy-ageing|title=Philanthropic Donation to the Institute of Healthy Ageing

'''MODAM''' ('''Olinka Barankova''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=June 2016}}
MODAM first appeared in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' #36 and was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Al Milgrom]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] mutated one of their female agents into a large-headed creature similar to [[MODOK]]. This agent claimed to be Maria Trovaya, [[Hank Pym]]'s deceased first wife.&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' #36&lt;/ref&gt; Pym took her in, believing she was the late wife, but she was secretly a spy and returned to AIM. There, she was further mutated into a being nearly identical in appearance to [[MODOK]] called '''SODAM''' ('''S'''pecialized '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned for '''A'''ggressive '''M'''aneuvers). In this new form, she opposed [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and Dr. Pym.&lt;ref&gt;''Solo Avengers'' #14-16&lt;/ref&gt; Her code name was later changed to '''MODAM''' ('''M'''ental '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned for '''A'''ggressive '''M'''aneuvers). Her first assignment as MODAM was acquiring [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'s [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum Bands|quantum bands]].&lt;ref&gt;''Quasar'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; MODAM later appeared as one of [[Superia]]'s [[Femizons]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #387-392&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Omega Red]] believed that MODAM was not Maria Trovaya, but Olinka Barankova, a woman who had once betrayed the mercenary. However, MODAM herself stated that "A.I.M. personnel files are routinely falsified".&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #296&lt;/ref&gt;

She finally perished (or at least vanished) when A.I.M. sent her in to attempt to fix a breach in reality, caused by a defective [[Cosmic Cube]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #440&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
MODAM was empowered through artificial acceleration of her brain tissue growth by means of mutagenic chemicals and radiation, plus cybernetic implants. As a result, she possesses a superhuman intellect, and the ability to project psionic force for a number of effects, including: concussive energy, generation of heat, and protective fields. She also possesses limited telepathy and imposition of her will upon others. MODAM's headband contains equipment which aids her in the focusing of her psionic powers.

MODAM is permanently encased within an exo-skeletal shell of life-supporting machinery which augments her musculature, provides mobility, and performs various bodily functions. Sensors equipped throughout the exoskeleton monitor both her body's functions and the system's mechanical functions and transmit this data telemetrically to AIM headquarters. Thus they monitor both her blood sugar level and her rocket fuel level. MODAM is equipped with two telescoping tentacle-like arms within which her own arms fit. Each terminates in a pronged "hand". Maximum elongation of these arms is {{convert|15|ft|m}}. MODAM's "hover-chair" contains anti-gravity generators enabling it to hover and chemically fueled rocket boosters to propel it. MODAM's musculature is [[atrophied]] (at least proportionally) while her head has been enlarged, thus she is physically dependent on the exoskeleton provided by her hover-chair for physical support and movement.

'''Man-Bat''' ('''Robert Kirkland "Kirk" Langstrom''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]]. Man-Bat was created by [[Frank Robbins]] and [[Neal Adams]] in collaboration with editor [[Julius Schwartz]], and the character debuted in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #400 (June [[1970 in comics|1970]]).

==Publication history==
The character made his first appearance in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #400 (June [[1970 in comics|1970]]) and was created by [[Frank Robbins]] and [[Neal Adams]] in collaboration with editor [[Julius Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first= Julius, ed.|title = Man of Two Worlds|publisher=Harper Paperbacks |year=2000 |isbn= 978-0380810512 |page= 129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-Bat was the star of his own eponymous series in 1975–1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 168 |quote =  Thanks to his appearances in ''Detective Comics'' and ''Batman'', Man-Bat's popularity soared to the point where writer Gerry Conway and artist Steve Ditko launched the [character] into his own series.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lasted two issues before being cancelled.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Dr. Kirk Langstrom''', a [[zoologist]] who specialized in the study of [[bat|chiropterology]], developed an extract intended to give humans a bat's [[sonar]] sense, and tested the formula on himself. The extract worked, but it had a horrible side effect: it transformed him into a hideous man-bat hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-X|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serum also took away his intelligence, so he went on a mad rampage until [[Batman]] found a way to reverse the effects.

Later, Langstrom takes the concoction again, and Man-Bat returns. He also coaxes his wife, [[Francine Langstrom]], into drinking the serum, and she goes through the same transformation, becoming She-Bat. Together, they terrorize [[Gotham City]] until Batman can once again restore them.

On some occasions, Langstrom takes the serum and retains enough intelligence to work for the forces of good. During one of these periods he works with the detective [[Jason Bard]]. On another occasion, in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #600, [[Jimmy Olsen]] inadvertently puts [[Superman]] into a cave occupied by Man-Bat to protect him from [[Kryptonite]] radiation that had reached Earth following the explosion of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. Man-Bat calms the maddened Superman and then summons [[Hawkman]], who helps Superman overcome the radiation.

Kirk and Francine have a daughter, Rebecca ("Becky"), and a son, Aaron. Because of the effects the serum had on Aaron's DNA, he is born with a deadly illness. Francine turns him into a young Man-Bat to save his life. This occurred in issue #3 of the ''Man-Bat'' miniseries by [[Chuck Dixon]].

===Infinite Crisis and beyond===
Man-Bat is sighted in [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] during the events of the 2005–2006 storyline "[[Infinite Crisis]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #7 (June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of that storyline, both Kirk and Francine are shown to be alive in the 2006 "[[One Year Later]]" storyline. [[Talia al Ghul]] ties up and gags Francine, and then threatens to poison her if Kirk does not give her the Man-Bat formula. After Langstrom gives her the formula, she releases Francine as promised. Talia utilizes the Man-Bat to turn some generic members of the [[League of Assassins]] into Man-Bat Commandos.&lt;ref name="Batman #655"&gt;''Batman'' #655 (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ManBatCv3.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Man-Bat'' vol. 3 #3 (August 2006). Art by [[Mike Huddleston]].]]
In ''[[Gotham Underground]]'', Man-Bat is apprehended by the Suicide Squad.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham Underground'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the villains seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvation Run'' #2 (February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Francine has appeared in ''[[Batman and the Outsiders]]'', serving as the team's technical advisor, and her assistant Salah Miandad operates the "blank" OMAC drone known as [[ReMAC]]. In issue #10 of that series, Kirk appeared, seemingly healthy and also aiding Francine.

In the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Man-Bat has been turned into a [[Justifiers|Justifier]] and was shown attacking [[Switzerland]]'s Checkmate Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Final Crisis]]'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009 "[[Battle for the Cowl]]" storyline, following Batman's death, Kirk is haunted by nightmares of becoming Man-Bat and killing his wife. When Francine disappears, he takes the serum and tries to follow her. After an altercation with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], he returns to his human form and is captured by [[Doctor Phosphorus]], who reveals the serum is not necessary to trigger the change. Kirk discovers that Phosphorus has also captured Francine, and becomes Man-Bat to save her.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Battle for the Cowl]]: Man-Bat #1''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009–2010 "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline, Francine tracks down Kirk (as Man-Bat), having created a cure, and revealed that Kirk's next transformation would be permanent if he did not drink it.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #66&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk attempts to take the cure, but his Man-Bat persona will not let him. Just as Kirk is about to drink it, Francine is wounded in the crossfire of the battle between [[Black Lantern]] [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and [[Bizarro]] (the latter of whom is already at the scene, trying to prevent Kirk from taking the cure). Distraught at Francine's injuries, Kirk transforms into Man-Bat, seemingly permanently.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #67&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Batgirl'' vol. 3, Man-Bat is seen under the control of the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]] as a techno-zombie.&lt;ref&gt;''Batgirl'' (vol.3) #10-#11 (July 2010-August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
[[File:Man-Bat Batman The Dark Knight Vol 2 28.png|thumb|upright|The Man-Bat in ''Batman: The Dark Knight'' vol. 2 #28 (April 2014). Art by [[Ethan Van Sciver]].]]
In [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), the majority of Kirk Langstrom's history is rebooted. The Man-Bat serum first appears in ''Detective Comics'' #18 (May 2013). [[Emperor Penguin (comics)|Ignatius Ogilvy]] also comes into possession of the Man-Bat serum which he uses as an airborne virus to spread throughout Gotham City's "900 Block".&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #18 (May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Detective Comics'' #19 (June 2013), Kirk Langstrom first appears where he and his wife Francine are escorted by Batwoman to Batman's location. Langstrom reveals that he is the creator of the serum, intending to help deaf people. Taking responsibility as the creator of the serum, he uses a sample of the serum Batman had obtained to inject himself. This creates an anti-virus which also spreads through the air. Langstrom is turned into a Man-Bat (the last remaining Man-Bat) as his anti-virus cures the remaining citizens of Gotham.&lt;ref name = det19/&gt;

Langstrom re-appears in ''Batman Inc.'' (vol. 2) #10 (June 2013) apparently giving Batman the serum. He claims to be working on an aerosol antidote to the serum as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Inc.'' (vol. 2) #10 (June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The backup feature of ''Detective Comics'' #21 (August 2013), focuses on Langstrom and his wife. He changes from the Man-Bat form into his human form and becomes addicted to the Man-Bat serum, taking it every night. He apparently does not remember his actions from the previous night, yet worries that a string of reported killings are his fault.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #21 (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Man-Bat is among the villains that were recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Scarecrow and Man-Bat attempt to steal the frozen Talons (assassins that are associated with the [[Court of Owls]]) from Blackgate while Penguin is having a meeting with Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as Man-Bat and his fellow Man-Bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

The final issues of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight]]'' series would establish that Kirk is the son of a corrupt wealthy pharmaceutical businessman named Abraham Langstrom, who considers his son as a failure when compared to Bruce Wayne, the son of his business rival Thomas Wayne. Abraham would steal his son's serum, make some of his own improvements and use it to target the homeless (because no one would miss them) before being stopped by Batman, though he is able to plead temporary insanity to avoid going to prison.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Dark Knight'' (vol. 2) #28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC Rebirth===
In the [[DC Rebirth]] rebooted universe, Man-Bat has a cameo appearance as one of the many trials that Batman's apprentice [[Duke Thomas (comics)|Duke Thomas]] has faced in his training.&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Batman'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Man-Bat is featured on the news as an example of the "Superman Theory" where the government has been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Harley Quinn Rebirth'' Langston's wife goes on a rampage against Harley and her friends turning Harley and her friend Tony into Man-bats as part of Penguin's plan to break Harley's spirit. Their other friends go get Langston released and he helps them find the antidote before predictably escaping himself.

==Powers and abilities==
By taking his bat-gland formula, Kirk Langstrom can transform himself into a bat-like creature. By taking an antidote or if the bat-gland formula wears off, he can return to human form.

As Man-Bat, his strength, agility and endurance are all enhanced to superhuman levels. Kirk possesses an extra set of digits that form leathery bat wings that allow him to fly, super-sensitive hearing, and a natural sonar. He emits high-pitched sound waves and can hear the echoes they make when they bounce off nearby objects, enabling Man-Bat to navigate perfectly in pitch black darkness.

If in Man-Bat form for a prolonged time, he loses control over his animalistic side and works purely on instinct, making him prone to harm friend and foe alike.

==Man-Bat Commandos==
As mentioned above, Talia al Ghul captured Kirk Langstrom and threatened to poison Francine if he did not give her the Man-Bat formula. Kirk gives in to Talia al Ghul's commands where she uses the Man-Bat formula on some generic members of the League of Assassins to turn them into the group's Man-Bat Commandos.&lt;ref name="Batman #655"/&gt;

In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), various Man-Bats have appeared under the control of [[Talia al Ghul]] in her plot to destroy Batman.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman, Inc.'' (vol. 2) #1&lt;/ref&gt; It is later explained that Talia al Ghul had an agent steal the serum from Langstrom's laboratory to use on her soldiers to create the Man-Bat Commandos.&lt;ref name = det19&gt;''Detective Comics'' #19 (June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, some Man-Bat Commandos were used to help the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] hunt down the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. [[Mirror Master]] managed to trap some of them in the Mirror World. When a Man-Bat snatches up [[Weather Wizard]], the other Rogues members chase after it until it crashes into a solid wall of ice upon arriving in [[Mr. Freeze]]'s territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: Rogues' Rebellion'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comic series set decades after ''Batman: The Animated Series''. Kirk returns as a white-bearded Man-Bat who has now perfected the serum to the point where he is able to talk and control his actions, unlike before. It is revealed that shortly after Batman cured Francine of the Man-Bat serum, the two started to live a peaceful life as they started studying sonics and had two children. However, Francine developed an aggressive form of Parkinson's and had a short life expectancy, leading Kirk to try and perfect the Man-Bat serum to save her life. But by the time he made it, it was too late. His children left him, angered that he did not spend as much time with her during her final days. He rescues a girl named Tey, who was a hostage of the Jokerz, and injects her with the Man-Bat serum, leading the two to fall in love. Kirk tries building his own cult of Man-Bats, plans to use Kanium to help his cult control themselves better in their Man-Bat forms and sets up a destructive weapon that concerns the police. Bruce tries to reason with Kirk, but it only results in Kirk viewing the both of them as monsters and setting up his bomb to destroy the two of them. However, Batman rescues Bruce in time as Man-Bat tells Bruce to use his second chance wisely as he detonates the bomb to kill himself.

===''Smallville Season Eleven''===
Man-Bat appears in the ''[[Smallville]]'' comic ''Smallville Season Eleven''. In [[Gotham City]], the yellow rings of [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] head to [[Arkham Asylum]].

Luckily, [[Superman]] arrives just in time to offer assistance to Batman and [[Nightwing]]. Superman is fighting with Man-Bat and before taking him down, Superman says to Man-Bat that, if there is more man than bat inside of him, then he takes no joy in this. [[Emil Hamilton]] succeeds into finding a way to reboot the rings, so when he does, all the Yellow Lanterns, including Man-Bat, are released from the influence of fear and lose their powers with the rings turning black. After their rings get rebooted and they lose their powers, the inmates of Arkham fall from the sky unable to do anything to escape from their eventual death, but Superman manages to save them all. After Parallax's defeat, all the now-depowered criminals return to Arkham Asylum.

[[File:Man-Bat (Batman-The Animated Series).jpg|right|150px|thumb|Kirk Langstrom/Man-Bat as depicted in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.]]
* Kirk Langstrom/Man-Bat appeared in the [[DC animated universe]], voiced by [[Marc Singer]] while sound effects were used for Man-Bat.
** Dr. Kirk Langstrom first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. This version was a [[zoology|zoologist]] at the [[Gotham City]] Zoo. He appears in the first produced episode "[[On Leather Wings]]" where he steals serums from the chemical labs and is mistaken for [[Batman]]. The beast then commits other thefts at night and people start to question if it is Batman or some other masked hero. Batman recovers a strand of hair from the lab to which Bruce Wayne takes to Dr. March (Langstrom's father-in-law) to be analyzed and told that is only from a brown bat. But shortly after, Batman discovers that March is lying and travels to the lab. On the same night, Langstrom drinks the serum, when Batman arrives to question him—revealing Dr. March as the thief of the serum from the chemical labs. Langstrom tells Batman that he had discovered a chemical that created a new species that was neither man or bat, which he started taking, but could not control it. Langstrom reveals to Batman that the creature is in him and he transforms into a half-man/half-bat monster before attacking Batman. After a battle across the Gotham City skyline, Man-Bat is knocked out and taken back to the Batcave. Batman manages to flush the formula out of Langstrom's system after discovering the chemicals that were stolen and he is returned to normal. Langstrom next appears in the episode "Tyger, Tyger" where he analyzes the chemical that Dr. Emile Dorian used for experiments. In the episode "Terror in the Sky", Langstrom is having a dream that he transforms into Man-Bat and he begins to commit crimes. Then Langstrom is awakened, just to find the remains of a fruit and scratches from a rag. Batman and Langstrom eventually discover that the other Man-Bat turns out to be his wife [[Francine Langstrom]] accidentally exposed to an alternate Man-Bat serum created by Francine's scientist father who was trying to alter Langstrom's work. In the end, Batman cures Francine as well and she returns to her husband.
** Kirk Langstrom appeared in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. He made a [[cameo appearance]] during Bruce Wayne's wedding in the episode "Chemistry".
** In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', a new trend dubbed "splicing" involves fusing together animal and human DNA. The new [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] (Terry McGinnis) ends up captured by the Splicers' leader Abel Cuvier (aka Chimera) and is injected with [[vampire bat]] DNA which transforms Batman into a Man-Bat. Batman is later returned to normal by Bruce Wayne. Kirk Langstrom never appeared in this series.
** Kirk Langstrom is mentioned in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.  In the episode "The Doomsday Sanction", [[Professor Milo]] mentions that Langstrom's research has proven useful to experiments splicing together human and animal [[DNA]] for [[Project Cadmus]].

* Kirk Langstrom/Man-Bat appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]] while special sound effects provide Man-Bat's vocal effects. This version is an employee at [[Wayne Enterprises]] doing [[research]] on bats and apparently afflicted with [[albinism]]. When Bruce Wayne begins to cut off the funding for his project, Langstrom tells Bruce that he needs the project to cure his niece's [[hearing impairment|deafness]]. When Bruce discovers that Langstrom is lying, he goes to Langstrom's office to discover both Langstrom's obsession with Batman and the project's real purpose. Langstrom arrived in his vault to find his boss there; he admits that he created the formula so he could be feared like Batman, and drinks a serum, resulting in his Man-Bat transformation. He attacks Bruce at his office, and escapes. Batman confronts Man-Bat in [[Gotham City]]'s skies, landing on the ground, and Langstrom reverts to his human form. To be safe, Batman destroys one of Langstrom's vials. Langstrom drinks the remaining vial, transforms into Man-Bat, and [[kidnapping|kidnap]]s Detective [[Ethan Bennett]]. Batman confronts Man-Bat in a [[sanitary sewer|sewer]], and Langstrom reverts to his human form, and is taken away to [[Arkham Asylum]]. While in Arkham Asylum, Langstrom is trying to recreate the Man-Bat serum, while the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] finds a sonar device to control a large condor but ends up with a sonar designed to control bats. When the Penguin uses the device, dormant remnants of the Man-Bat formula still inside Langstrom reawaken, resulting in his Man-Bat transformation and instinctively leading him to the Penguin's hideout. With the sonar device, the Man-Bat does the Penguin's bidding, returning him to his human form by saying "rest". Langstrom is furious with the Penguin when he learns the Penguin's plans, promising the Penguin will feel Man-Bat's wrath. At the docks, Batman confronts Man-Bat and, using his own sonar device, induces a reversion back to his human form. Langstrom and Penguin are both taken back to Arkham. Langstrom later returns in as one of the many villains captured by the vigilante Rumor. He was shown in his human form and later in his Man-Bat form, implying he has full control over his transformation. Langstrom made one last appearance, no longer a villain and renouncing the Man-Bat name. Batman charged Langstrom with creating an antidote for his own mutagen that [[Terrible Trio|some college students]] had stolen from him and were planning on infecting the entire student body with.
* Man-Bats appear in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. In the episode "Last Bat on Earth!", Batman travels to the future to stop [[Gorilla Grodd]] now leading the apes. When Batman goes into the [[Batcave]] with [[Kamandi]] and Dr. Canus, humanoid "Man-Bats" are encountered that can talk like the rest of the humanoid animals. Batman and Kamandi manage to drive the Man-Bats out after defeating their leader. The Man-Bats later assist Batman in an all-out war against the apes, having gained respect for the Dark Knight.
* Kirk Langstrom/Man-Bat appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. In "Doppelgänger", Dr. Langstrom works on a cure for diseases with bat DNA before [[Professor Pyg]] and [[Mister Toad (comics)|Mister Toad]] raided his laboratory and forced him at gunpoint to mutate into a man/bat hybrid with a corrupted version of his formula. The two used a drug-filled mechanical collar to control Man-Bat and force him to rob chemicals so they can recreate Dr. Langstrom's formula and turn humans into animal hybrids. After Man-Bat is captured and freed from control by Batman and [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], he repays the two by helping defeat Professor Pyg and Mister Toad. After defeating the villains, Man-Bat swears to work in the shadows on a cure for his condition. In "Alone", Man-Bat is recruited by Katana alongside [[Metamorpho]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to help Batman in the final battle against [[Deathstroke]]. They all go to the Batcave to take down Deathstroke's C4 bombs spread around. Man-Bat comes up with a ZIP formula for Metamorpho to create so that it can wipe out Deathstroke's memory of Batman's true identity.
* Man-Bat appears in the TV special ''[[Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leaguered]]'', with vocal effects provided by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]''.
* Man-Bat is alluded in the live-action series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]''. In the [[Gotham (season 4)|season 4]] finale "No Man's Land", two junkies search for items in a deserted church, when a man-like creature above them drops down and releases a pair of bat wings as it shrieks.

When Batman sees Man-Bat flying over Miagani Island, he intercepts it and takes a blood sample to determine the creature's identity. Batman uploads the sample analysis to Alfred who identifies that the blood belonged to Dr. Kirk Langstrom. Batman goes to Langstrom's lab in Chinatown and sees video tapes showing Man-Bat's origins. Similar to the comics, Man-Bat's was created by testing a formula based on vampire bat DNA to cure his deafness while in the presence of Francine Langstrom. When Kirk transforms, he loses control of his Man-Bat form and accidentally kills Francine. Batman identifies the cause of death as blunt trauma to the head, deducing that Langstrom had no idea what he was doing. After several encounters, Batman creates an antidote and injects it into Man-Bat to change him back to Kirk Langstrom, locking him in the Batmobile's trunk while the process completes. Once at the Gotham City Police Station, Batman then places Kirk in an isolation cell. Kirk is last seen crying in his cell over his role in Francine's death. If Batman walks inside Langstrom's lab after this side mission, he discovers Francine's body gone and a blooded painting on the broken window which says "Forever my love" implying that she became She-Bat. If the date on the console or computer the game is on is changed to 31/10/15 (Halloween), grappling around buildings will eventually make the Man-Bat jumpscare occur once again. Returning to the Gotham City Police Department and speaking to Officer Boulden will reveal that Kirk Langstrom apparently morphed back into Man-Bat and broke out of his cage with Cash firing at him but missing due to the speed at which he flew. Batman will state how "He was afraid this would happen" prompting Boulden to reply with "Happy Halloween, huh?"

In issue #21, Kirk Langstrom was later forcefully transformed into Man-Bat and recruited by Dr. Emile Dorian who hoped to use his assistance to form a "House of Dorian" with [[Anthony Lupus|Anthony Romulus]]'s Werewolf form, Tygrus (who Emile duped into working for him again), and Man-Bat.
* Man-Bat appears in issue 12 of the ''All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' (which is based on ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'').
* In issue 4 of the comic book spin-off of ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', a new Man-Bat appears in the form of Tim Quan, an acquaintance of [[Barbara Gordon]] with a crush on her. He was mutated when he sneaked into the lab of Kirk Langstrom (who is still stuck in his Man-Bat form and was looking for a cure). Having become more unstable than Langstrom, Quan goes in a rampage and kidnaps Barbara. Batman teams up with Langstrom to find and cure Quan at the expense of Langstrom's own cure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">'''Maximally informative dimensions''' is a [[dimensionality reduction]] technique used in the statistical analyses of [[neural coding|neural responses]]. Specifically, it is a way of projecting a stimulus onto a low-dimensional [[Linear subspace|subspace]] so that as much [[mutual information|information]] as possible about the stimulus is preserved in the neural response. It is motivated by the fact that natural stimuli are typically confined by their [[statistics]] to a lower-dimensional space than that [[linear span|spanned]] by [[white noise]].&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Field. "Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells." J. Opt. Soc. am. A 4:2479-2394, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this subspace, however, [[stimulus-response model|stimulus-response functions]] may be either [[linear]] or [[nonlinear]]. The idea was originally developed by Tatyana Sharpee, Nicole Rust, and [[William Bialek]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpee, Tatyana, Nicole C. Rust, and William Bialek. "Maximally informative dimensions: analyzing neural responses to natural signals." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (2003): 277-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==
Neural stimulus-response functions are typically given as the probability of a [[neuron]] generating an [[action potential]], or spike, in response to a stimulus &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;. The goal of maximally informative dimensions is to find a small relevant subspace of the much larger stimulus space that accurately captures the salient features of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; denote the dimensionality of the entire stimulus space and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; denote the dimensionality of the relevant subspace, such that &lt;math&gt;K \ll D&lt;/math&gt;. We let &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{v}^K\}&lt;/math&gt; denote the basis of the relevant subspace, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}^K&lt;/math&gt; the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf{v}^K \}&lt;/math&gt;. Using [[Bayes' theorem]] we can write out the probability of a spike given a stimulus:

: &lt;math&gt;P(spike|\mathbf{s}^K) = P(spike)f(\mathbf{s}^K)&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{s}^K) = \frac{P(\mathbf{s}^K|spike)}{P(\mathbf{s}^K)}&lt;/math&gt;

is some nonlinear function of the projected stimulus.

In order to choose the optimal &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf{v}^K \}&lt;/math&gt;, we compare the prior stimulus distribution &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt; with the spike-triggered stimulus distribution &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{s}|spike)&lt;/math&gt; using the [[mutual information|Shannon information]]. The [[mean|average]] information (averaged across all presented stimuli) per spike is given by

: &lt;math&gt;I_{spike} = \sum_{\mathbf{s}} P(\mathbf{s}|spike) log_2 [P(\mathbf{s}|spike)/P(\mathbf{s})]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;N. Brenner, S. P. Strong, R. Koberle, W. Bialek, and R. R. de Ruyter van Steveninck. "Synergy in a neural code. Neural Comp., 12:1531-1552, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now consider a &lt;math&gt;K = 1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional subspace defined by a single direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. The average information conveyed by a single spike about the projection &lt;math&gt;x = \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;I(\mathbf{v}) = \int dx P_{\mathbf{v}}(x|spike)log2[P_{\mathbf{v}}(x|spike)/P_{\mathbf{v}}(x)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where the probability distributions are approximated by a measured data set via &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}}(x|spike) = \langle \delta(x - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}) |spike \rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}}(x) = \langle \delta(x - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v})\rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., each presented stimulus is represented by a scaled [[Dirac delta function]] and the probability distributions are created by averaging over all spike-eliciting stimuli, in the former case, or the entire presented stimulus set, in the latter case. For a given dataset, the average information is a function only of the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. Under this formulation, the relevant subspace of dimension &lt;math&gt;K = 1&lt;/math&gt; would be defined by the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the average information &lt;math&gt;I(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;.

This procedure can readily be extended to a relevant subspace of dimension &lt;math&gt;K &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; by defining

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}^K}(\mathbf{x}|spike) = \langle \prod_{i=1}^K \delta(x_i - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i) |spike \rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}^K}(\mathbf{x}) = \langle \prod_{i=1}^K \delta(x_i - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i) \rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

and maximizing &lt;math&gt;I({\mathbf{v}^K})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Importance==

Maximally informative dimensions does not make any assumptions about the [[normal distribution|Gaussianity]] of the stimulus set, which is important, because naturalistic stimuli tend to have non-Gaussian statistics. In this way the technique is more robust than other dimensionality reduction techniques such as [[spike-triggered covariance]] analyses.

'''Major The Rt Hon. John Maynard Sinclair''' (4 August 1896 – 31 January 1953) was a [[Ulster Unionist Party|unionist]] politician in [[Northern Ireland]]. Born in [[Belfast]], in 1896, son of John Sinclair DL and Alice Montgomery, he was educated at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]], and in [[Switzerland]]. He served in the [[British Army]] during [[World War I]]. He was a director of the Eagle Star Insurance Company and Chairman of Vulcanite Ltd.

==Political career==
His first attempt to be elected to the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] was unsuccessful; he contested the [[Mourne (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Mourne]] division in 1933. He was elected to the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] in 1938 for the division of [[Belfast Cromac (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Belfast Cromac]]. On 16 January 1941, he was appointed Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Minister of Finance (i.e. a junior minister). In May 1943, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]] succeeded [[John Miller Andrews]] as [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]]; Maynard Sinclair was appointed Minister of Finance (''[[de facto]]'' Deputy Prime Minister) in the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] on 6 May 1943 and was made a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Councillor (Northern Ireland)]].
Major Sinclair owed his title major to the fact that he commanded 591 (Antrim) Independent Field Squadron Royal Engineers a Territorial Army (TA)) unit at Victoria Barracks Belfast when the TA was reformed after World War 2. He was regarded by the officers of that unit as a much more liberal individual than his Prime Minister, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Sir Basil Brooke]]. The opinion of those former officers who knew him was that his politics were not unlike those of Captain Terence O'Neill and that, had he lived to become Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, the complete history of the province would have been different.

==Death==
Maynard Sinclair was one of 133 passengers drowned in the sinking of the ferry [[MV Princess Victoria|MV ''Princess Victoria'']] on 31 January 1953, en route across the [[North Channel (British Isles)|North Channel]] from [[Stranraer]] to [[Larne]]. He was survived by his wife, Marjorie Claridge.

==Memorials==
The pavilion of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) Sports and Social Club on the [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont Estate]] in Belfast is named the ''"Maynard Sinclair Pavilion"''. The children’s ward at the [[Ulster Hospital]] at [[Dundonald]] is named the ''"Maynard Sinclair Children’s Ward".''
There is also a Major J. M. Sinclair Memorial Pipe Band which was formed shortly after his death and can still be found in competition throughout Ireland and Scotland.

'''Michael John Clement Burgess''', [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 31 March 1946) was the [[Coroner of the Queen's Household]]. He was educated at [[Beaumont College]] and [[King's College London]]. He was appointed deputy coroner in 1991 and was appointed coroner in 2002. 

He was in charge of the [[inquest]] into the deaths of [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana, Princess of Wales]] and [[Dodi Fayed]] until July 2006. He then announced that he wished to stand down from the case due to a "heavy and constant" workload [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5204944.stm].

He has been the [[Surrey]] coroner since 1986.

He was appointed [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO) in the 2016 Birthday Honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61608|supp=y|page=B4|date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virology==
The virus MERS-CoV is a new member of the beta group of coronavirus, ''[[Betacoronavirus]]'', lineage C. MERS-CoV genomes are phylogenetically classified into two [[clades]], clade A and B. The earliest cases of MERS were of clade A clusters (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012), and new cases are genetically distinct (clade B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0299_article.htm|title=MERS Coronaviruses in Dromedary Camels, Egypt|date=June 2014|access-date=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MERS-CoV is distinct from [[SARS coronavirus]] and distinct from the common-cold coronavirus and known endemic human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1.&lt;ref name="rapid"/&gt; Until 23 May 2013, MERS-CoV had frequently been referred to as a SARS-like virus,&lt;ref name=sciencenews27feb2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/scin.5591830603 |title=Story one: Scientists race to understand deadly new virus: SARS-like infection causes severe illness, but may not spread quickly among people |journal=Science News |volume=183 |issue=6 |pages=5–6 |year=2013 |last1=Saey |first1=Tina Hesman }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the novel coronavirus, and earlier it was referred to colloquially on messageboards as the "Saudi SARS".
[[File:Mers-virus-3D-image.jpg|thumb|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3-D image]]

Over 2,000 cases of MERS have been reported by 2017 and the case fatality rate is &gt;30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/risk-assessment-july-2017.pdf|title=WHO MERS-CoV Global Summary and Assessment of Risk |date=21 July 2017|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 182 genomes have been sequenced by 2015 (94 from humans and 88 from dromedary camels). All sequences are &gt;99% similar. The genomes can be divided into two clades - A and B - with the majority of cases being caused by clade B. Human and camel strains are intermixed suggesting multiple transmission events.

A second case was found in September 2012, a 49-year-old male living in Qatar presented with similar flu symptoms, and a sequence of the virus was nearly identical to that of the first case.&lt;ref name="rapid"/&gt; In November 2012, similar cases appeared in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Additional cases were noted, with deaths associated, and rapid research and monitoring of this novel coronavirus began.

It is not certain whether the infections are the result of a single [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] event with subsequent human-to-human transmission, or if the multiple geographic sites of infection represent multiple zoonotic events from a common unknown source.

A study by Ziad Memish of Riyadh University and colleagues suggests that the virus arose sometime between July 2007 and June 2012, with perhaps as many as 7 separate zoonotic transmissions. Among animal reservoirs, CoV has a large genetic diversity yet the samples from patients suggest a similar genome, and therefore common source, though the data are limited. It has been determined through molecular clock analysis, that viruses from the EMC/2012 and England/Qatar/2012 date to early 2011 suggesting that these cases are descended from a single zoonotic event. It would appear the MERS-CoV has been circulating in the human population for greater than one year without detection and suggests independent transmission from an unknown source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/5/13-0057_article.htm |title=Full-Genome Deep Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis of Novel Human Betacoronavirus - Vol. 19 No. 5 - May 2013 - CDC |publisher=[[Emerging Infectious Diseases]]|date=2013-05-19 |access-date=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lau SK, Lee P, Tsang AK, Yip CC, Tse H, Lee RA, So LY, Lau YL, Chan KH, Woo PC, Yuen KY | title = Molecular epidemiology of human coronavirus OC43 reveals evolution of different genotypes over time and recent emergence of a novel genotype due to natural recombination | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 85 | issue = 21 | pages = 11325–37 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21849456 | pmc = 3194943 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.05512-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tropism===
In humans, the virus has a strong [[tropism]] for nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells, and it has been shown to effectively evade the innate immune responses and antagonize [[interferon]] (IFN) production in these cells. This tropism is unique in that most respiratory viruses target ciliated cells.&lt;ref name="Kindler-2013"&gt;

Due to the clinical similarity between MERS-CoV and [[SARS-CoV]], it was proposed that they may use the same cellular receptor; the exopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ([[ACE2]]).&lt;ref name=nih_expr&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jia HP, Look DC, Shi L, Hickey M, Pewe L, Netland J, Farzan M, Wohlford-Lenane C, Perlman S, McCray PB | title = ACE2 receptor expression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection depend on differentiation of human airway epithelia | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 79 | issue = 23 | pages = 14614–21 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16282461 | pmc = 1287568 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.79.23.14614-14621.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later discovered that neutralization of ACE2 by recombinant antibodies does not prevent MERS-CoV infection.&lt;ref name="Müller-2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Müller MA, Raj VS, Muth D, Meyer B, Kallies S, Smits SL, Wollny R, Bestebroer TM, Specht S, Suliman T, Zimmermann K, Binger T, Eckerle I, Tschapka M, Zaki AM, Osterhaus AD, Fouchier RA, Haagmans BL, Drosten C | title = Human coronavirus EMC does not require the SARS-coronavirus receptor and maintains broad replicative capability in mammalian cell lines | journal = mBio | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23232719 | pmc = 3520110 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00515-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research identified dipeptyl peptidase 4 ([[DPP4]]; also known as [[CD26]]) as a functional cellular receptor for MERS-CoV.&lt;ref name="Raj-2013" /&gt; Unlike other known coronavirus receptors, the [[enzymatic activity]] of DPP4 is not required for infection.

===Transmission===
On 13 February 2013, the [[World Health Organization]] stated "the risk of sustained person-to-person transmission appears to be very low."&lt;ref name=WHO(13Feb2013)&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_02_13/en/index.html WHO: Novel coronavirus infection&amp;nbsp;– update (13 February 2013)] (accessed 13 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The cells MERS-CoV infects in the lungs only account for 20% of respiratory epithelial cells, so a large number of virions are likely needed to be inhaled to cause infection.&lt;ref name="dpp4_receptor" /&gt;

Dr. [[Anthony S. Fauci]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in Bethesda, Maryland, stated that as of now MERS-CoV "does not spread in a sustained person to person way at all." Dr. Fauci stated that there is potential danger in that it is possible for the virus to mutate into a strain that does transmit from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/video/national-news/fauci-new-virus-not-yet-a-threat-to-the-world/ |title=Fauci: New Virus Not Yet a 'threat to the world' (video) |publisher=Washington Times |date=2012-08-31 |access-date=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the infection of healthcare workers (HCW) has led to concerns of human to human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2014/04/20/concerns-spread-as-new-saudi-mers-cases-spike/|title=Concerns Spread as New Saudi MERS Cases Spike|last=Knickmeyer|first=Ellen|last2=Al Omran|first2=Ahmed | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 Apr 2014|access-date=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) list MERS as transmissible from human-to-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/faq.html|title=MERS-CoV - Frequently Asked Questions and Answers - Coronavirus - CDC|date=14 September 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; From their FAQ, in answer to the question "Does MERS-CoV spread from person to person?", they answer "MERS-CoV has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact. Transmission from infected patients to healthcare personnel has also been observed. Clusters of cases in several countries are being investigated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/faq.html|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention FAQ on MERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a ''[[New York Times]]'' article which provides some correlative context for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/health/fast-spreading-virus-under-inquiry-in-saudi-arabia.html|title=Investigation Follows Trail of a Virus in Hospitals| first= Denise | last = Grady | name-list-format = vanc |date=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the 28th of May, the CDC revealed that the Illinois man who was originally thought to have been the first incidence of person to person spread (from the Indiana man at a business meeting), had in fact tested negative for MERS-CoV. After completing additional and more definitive tests using a neutralising antibody assay, experts at the CDC have concluded that the Indiana patient did not spread the virus to the Illinois patient. Tests concluded that the Illinois man had not been previously infected. It is possible for silent MERS to occur, this is when the patient does not develop symptoms. Early research has shown that up to 20% of cases show no signs of active infection but have MERS-CoV antibodies in their blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/mers-mystery/cdc-backtracks-illinois-man-didnt-have-mers-after-all-n116436|title=CDC Backtracks: Illinois Man Didn't Have MERS After All|access-date=2 June 2014|date=28 May 2014 | first = Jonrl | last = Aleccia | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===

The virus appears to have originated in bats.&lt;ref name=Corman2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corman VM, Ithete NL, Richards LR, Schoeman MC, Preiser W, Drosten C, Drexler JF | title = Rooting the phylogenetic tree of middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus by characterization of a conspecific virus from an African bat | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 88 | issue = 19 | pages = 11297–303 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25031349 | pmc = 4178802 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01498-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus itself has been isolated from a bat.&lt;ref name=Memish2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Memish ZA, Mishra N, Olival KJ, Fagbo SF, Kapoor V, Epstein JH, Alhakeem R, Durosinloun A, Al Asmari M, Islam A, Kapoor A, Briese T, Daszak P, Al Rabeeah AA, Lipkin WI | title = Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in bats, Saudi Arabia | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 19 | issue = 11 | pages = 1819–23 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24206838 | pmc = 3837665 | doi = 10.3201/eid1911.131172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This virus is closely related to the Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5.&lt;ref name=Wang2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Q, Qi J, Yuan Y, Xuan Y, Han P, Wan Y, Ji W, Li Y, Wu Y, Wang J, Iwamoto A, Woo PC, Yuen KY, Yan J, Lu G, Gao GF | title = Bat origins of MERS-CoV supported by bat coronavirus HKU4 usage of human receptor CD26 | journal = Cell Host &amp; Microbe | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 328–37 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25211075 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2014.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serological evidence shows that these viruses have infected camels for at least 20 years. The most recent common ancestor of several human strains has been dated to March 2012 (95% confidence interval December 2011 to June 2012).&lt;ref name=Cotten2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cotten M, Watson SJ, Zumla AI, Makhdoom HQ, Palser AL, Ong SH, Al Rabeeah AA, Alhakeem RF, Assiri A, Al-Tawfiq JA, Albarrak A, Barry M, Shibl A, Alrabiah FA, Hajjar S, Balkhy HH, Flemban H, Rambaut A, Kellam P, Memish ZA | title = Spread, circulation, and evolution of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e01062–13 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24549846 | pmc = 3944817 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.01062-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence available to date suggests that the viruses have been present in bats for some time and had spread to camels by the mid 1990s. The viruses appear to have spread from camels to humans in the early 2010s. The original bat host species and the time of initial infection in this species has yet to be determined.

Examination of the sequences of 238 isolates suggested that this virus has evolved into three clades differing in codon usage, host, and geographic distribution.&lt;ref name=Alnazawi2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alnazawi M, Altaher A, Kandeel M | title = Comparative Genomic Analysis MERS CoV Isolated from Humans and Camels with Special Reference to Virus Encoded Helicase | journal = Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 1289–1298 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28769010 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.b17-00241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural reservoir===

Early research suggested the virus is related to one found in the [[Egyptian tomb bat]]. In September 2012 Ron Fouchier speculated that the virus might have originated in bats.&lt;ref name=NPRFouchierbats&gt;{{cite news |last=Doucleff |first=Michaeleen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Holy Bat Virus!

Recent work links [[camel]]s to the virus. An ahead-of-print dispatch for the journal ''[[Emerging Infectious Diseases]]'' records research showing the coronavirus infection in [[dromedary camel]] calves and adults, 99.9% matching to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hemida MG, Chu DK, Poon LL, Perera RA, Alhammadi MA, Ng HY, Siu LY, Guan Y, Alnaeem A, Peiris M | title = MERS coronavirus in dromedary camel herd, Saudi Arabia | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 1231–4 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24964193 | pmc = 4073860 | doi = 10.3201/eid2007.140571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one person who has fallen sick with MERS was known to have come into contact with camels or recently drank [[camel milk]].&lt;ref name="camel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/04/mers-outbreaks-grow-malaysian-case-had-camel-link|title=MERS outbreaks grow; Malaysian case had camel link|date=17 Apr 2014|last=Roos|first=Robert | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] produce and consume large amounts of [[camel meat]]. The possibility exists that African or Australian [[bat]]s harbor the virus and transmit it to camels. Imported camels from these regions might have carried the virus to the Middle East.&lt;ref name=scimag_camel&gt;{{cite web|title=Camels May Transmit New Middle Eastern Virus|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2013/08/camels-may-transmit-new-middle-eastern-virus|date=8 August 2013|access-date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 MERS-CoV was identified in three members of a dromedary camel herd held in a Qatar barn, which was linked to two confirmed human cases who have since recovered. The presence of MERS-CoV in the camels was confirmed by the [[RIVM|National Institute of Public Health and Environment]] (RIVM) of the Ministry of Health and the [[Erasmus Medical Center]] (WHO Collaborating Center), the Netherlands. None of the camels showed any sign of disease when the samples were collected. The Qatar Supreme Council of Health advised in November 2013 that people with underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, respiratory disease, the immunosuppressed, and the elderly, avoid any close animal contacts when visiting farms and markets, and to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three camels hit by MERS coronavirus in Qatar|url=http://www.sch.gov.qa/sch/En/catcontent.jsp?scatId=833&amp;scatType=1&amp;CSRT=8118031749383040885|publisher=Qatar Supreme Council of Health|access-date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further study on dromedary camels from Saudi Arabia published in December 2013 revealed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedary camels (310), suggesting that dromedary camels not only could be the main reservoir of MERS-CoV, but also the animal source of MERS.&lt;ref name="pmid24342517"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hemida MG, Perera RA, Wang P, Alhammadi MA, Siu LY, Li M, Poon LL, Saif L, Alnaeem A, Peiris M | title = Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus seroprevalence in domestic livestock in Saudi Arabia, 2010 to 2013 | journal = Euro Surveillance : Bulletin Europeen Sur Les Maladies Transmissibles = European Communicable Disease Bulletin | volume = 18 | issue = 50 | pages = 20659 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24342517 | doi = | url = http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 27 March 2014 MERS-CoV summary update, recent studies support that camels serve as the primary source of the MERS-CoV infecting humans, while bats may be the ultimate reservoir of the virus. Evidence includes the frequency with which the virus has been found in camels to which human cases have been exposed, seriological data which shows widespread transmission in camels, and the similarity of the camel CoV to the human CoV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_CoV_Update_27_March_2014.pdf?ua=1|title=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV)Summary and literature update – as of 27 March2014|date=27 March 2014|access-date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2014, the ''[[Arab News]]'' newspaper highlighted the latest research findings in the New England Journal of Medicine in which a 44-year-old Saudi man who kept a herd of nine camels died of MERS in November 2013.  His friends said they witnessed him applying a topical medicine to the nose of one of his ill camels—four of them reportedly sick with nasal discharge—seven days before he himself became stricken with MERS.  Researchers sequenced the virus found in one of the sick camels and the virus that killed the man, and found that their genomes were identical.  In that same article, the ''Arab News'' reported that as of 6 June 2014, there have been 689 cases of MERS reported within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 283 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Mohammed Rasooldeen | last = Fakeih | name-list-format = vanc | title = 80% drop in MERS infections | journal = Arab News| volume = XXXIX | issue = 183 | page = 1 | date = 6 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomy===
MERS-CoV is more closely related to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 (lineage 2C) than it is to SARS-CoV (lineage 2B) (2, 9), sharing more than 90% sequence identity with their closest relationships, bat coronaviruses HKU4 and [[Pipistrellus Bat coronavirus HKU5|HKU5]] and therefore considered to belong to the same species by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV).

==Microbiology==

The virus grows readily on [[Vero cells]] and LLC-MK2 cells.&lt;ref name="promedmail.org"/&gt;

The receptor for this virus is [[CD26]] (dipeptidyl peptidase 4).&lt;ref name="pmid23486063"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raj VS, Mou H, Smits SL, Dekkers DH, Müller MA, Dijkman R, Muth D, Demmers JA, Zaki A, Fouchier RA, Thiel V, Drosten C, Rottier PJ, Osterhaus AD, Bosch BJ, Haagmans BL | title = Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC | journal = Nature | volume = 495 | issue = 7440 | pages = 251–4 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23486063 | doi = 10.1038/nature12005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and patent==

Saudi officials had not given permission for Dr. Zaki, the first isolator of the human strain, to send a sample of the virus to Fouchier and were angered when Fouchier claimed the patent on the full genetic sequence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.&lt;ref name=Economist20apr2013&gt;

At their annual meeting of the [[World Health Assembly]] in May 2013, WHO chief Margaret Chan declared that [[intellectual property]], or patents on strains of new virus, should not impede nations from protecting their citizens by limiting scientific investigations. Deputy Health Minister Ziad Memish raised concerns that scientists who held the patent for the MERS-CoV virus would not allow other scientists to use patented material and were therefore delaying the development of diagnostic tests.&lt;ref name=coronavirus_patent23may2013&gt;
{{cite news|date=23 May 2013|title=WHO urges information sharing over novel coronavirus|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22649922|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmus MC responded that the patent application did not restrict public health research into MERS coronavirus,&lt;ref name=erasmus&gt;{{cite press release|title=Erasmus MC: no restrictions for public health research into MERS coronavirus|date=24 May 2013|publisher=Erasmus MC|location=Rotterdam|url=http://www.erasmusmc.nl/perskamer/archief/2013/4164294/?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the virus and diagnostic tests were shipped—free of charge—to all that requested such reagents.

==Mapping==
There are a number of mapping efforts focused on tracking MERS coronavirus. On 2 May 2014, the Corona Map&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://CoronaMap.com/|title=CoronaMap: Realtime tracking of MERS Corona virus on world map|website=coronamap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched to track the MERS coronavirus in realtime on the world map.

Aqeel was suspected of involvement in the February 2008 assassination of Lieutenant General [[Mushtaq Ahmed Baig]], the Surgeon General of the Army Medical Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-10-13/us/28073477_1_pakistani-journalist-mastermind-ilyas-kashmiri Soldiers turning rogue Pak's new terror headache]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Usman was also arrested in connection with the [[Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing]] in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\10\25\story_25-10-2008_pg7_9 Four Marriott accused linked to suicide network, ATC told ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqeel is the suspected mastermind of March 3, [[2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team]].

Months later Aqeel took part in the [[2009 Pakistan Army General Headquarters attack|attack on the Pakistan Army General Headquarters]] in [[Rawalpindi]].

'''Reyna Angélica Marroquín''' (1941–1969) was a [[Salvadoran]] woman who was murdered in the [[United States]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; Marroquín's murder was not discovered until 1999, 30 years after its occurrence, when her body was found in the former [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]], [[New York (state)|New York]] home of Howard B. Elkins, a businessman who was identified as the prime suspect. Elkins committed [[suicide]] before he could be charged or thoroughly questioned.

==Crime==
On September 2, 1999, an old [[55-gallon drum]] in the [[crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of a house in [[Jericho, New York|Jericho]], [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], was found to contain the [[mummified]] remains of a pregnant [[Hispanic]] female in her late 20s between 145 and 152 cm (4'9" and 5'0") tall, with unusual dental work.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; The cause of death was determined to be [[blunt force trauma]] to the head. The drum also contained [[polystyrene]] pellets, two rings (one inscribed "M.H.R."), a [[locket]] inscribed "To Patrice Love Uncle Phil", green [[dye]], and an address book.&lt;ref name=trust&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Broken Trust |access-date=July 9, 2018 |series=[[The New Detectives]] |date=November 13, 2004 |season=9 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eGUXZg2bAk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drum had been made in 1965 and used for transporting dye, with markings showing it had been shipped to Melrose Plastics, a synthetic flower company partly owned by Howard B. Elkins, a local businessman who had owned the Jericho house until 1972, when he sold the plastic business and moved to [[Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], with his wife.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;&lt;ref name=in/&gt;&lt;ref name=is/&gt;&lt;ref name=affair/&gt; Under [[infrared]] light some of the deteriorated address book was legible.&lt;ref name=FDM&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Flower Drum Murder|date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=July 9, 2018 |series=Murder Book |network=Investigation Discovery |season=2 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4981464/}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Permanent residence (United States)|alien card number]] written on the first page belonged to Reyna Angélica Marroquín, a 28-year-old immigrant from [[El Salvador]], who had worked as a [[nanny]], and for a manufacturer of synthetic flowers at a factory on East 34th Street, [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=FDM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman In Barrel Id'd 30-year-old Murder Mystery |author=Robert Gearty and Corky Siemazsko |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-09-30/news/18121971_1_detectives-howard-elkins-address-book |newspaper=NY Daily News |date=September 30, 1999 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A phone number in the book belonged to Kathy Andrade, who had been a friend of Marroquín. When contacted, Andrade told the police that Marroquín had been having an [[extramarital affair]] with Elkins, but had called Andrade to say she had become afraid of him after telling Elkins' wife about the affair.&lt;ref name=adds/&gt;&lt;ref name=affair/&gt;&lt;ref name=FDM/&gt; Andrade went to Marroquín's apartment but found it empty, and she was never heard from again.&lt;ref name=is&gt;{{cite news |title=Body Is Identified, Linked To West Boca |author=Kevin Krause |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-09-30/news/9909290806_1_barrel-el-salvador-howard-elkins |newspaper=Sun Sentinel |date=September 30, 1999 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports that when a woman fitting Marroquín's description appeared once with a toddler at Melrose Plastics, employees had joked that the child's father was Elkins.&lt;ref name=affair/&gt;

==Investigation==
Detectives who interviewed Elkins found him uncooperative, and told him they intended to obtain an order to take his [[DNA]] for comparison with that of the [[fetus]] found inside Marroquín. The next day, September 10, 1999, Elkins was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&lt;ref name=adds&gt;{{cite news |title=Suicide Adds to Mystery Of Corpse Found in Barrel |author=Robert McFadden |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/13/nyregion/suicide-adds-to-mystery-of-corpse-found-in-barrel.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 13, 1999 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=links/&gt;&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;&lt;ref name=in&gt;{{cite news |title=Body in Barrel Is Believed to Be Woman Who Vanished in '69 |author=John T.

The DNA testing found that Elkins was almost certainly the father of the fetus.&lt;ref name=links&gt;{{cite news |title=DNA Links Suicide To Killing |author=Kevin Krause |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-01-22/news/0001220143_1_elkins-unborn-child-dna |newspaper=Sun Sentinel |date=January 22, 2000 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators believe Elkins either went to Marroquín's [[New Jersey]] apartment or lured her to the factory and killed her.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt; He then took her body to the Nassau County house, possibly with the intention of dumping her in the ocean from his boat, but after filling the barrel with plastic [[wikt:pellet|pellet]]s to ensure it would sink, he found it too heavy to move and left it in the crawl space.&lt;ref name=FDM/&gt;&lt;ref name=voice/&gt;

Writer [[Oscar J. Corral|Oscar Corral]] went to [[San Martín, San Salvador]], where Marroquín's 95-year-old mother told him she had dreamt about Marroquín trapped inside a barrel.&lt;ref name=newsdaydream&gt;{{cite news |title='I Had a Dream ...

'''Pete the Pup''' (original, 1924 &amp;ndash; June 1930; second Pete, September 9, 1929 &amp;ndash; January 28, 1946) was a [[Fictional character|character]] in [[Hal Roach]]'s ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies (later known as ''The Little Rascals'') during the 1930s. Otherwise known as "Pete, the dog with the ring around his eye", or simply "Petey". He was well known for having a circled eye which was added by [[Hollywood]] make-up artist [[Max Factor, Sr.|Max Factor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Circus Tricks for Your Dog: 25 Crowd-Pleasers That Will Make Your Dog a Star |first= Rick |last=Martin|page=97|publisher =Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year= 2007|ISBN =978-1-57990-816-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and credited as an oddity in ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not]]''. The original Pete (sired by "Tudor's Black Jack") was a [[United Kennel Club|UKC]] registered [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] named "Pal, the Wonder Dog"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedigreedatabase.com/community.read?post=361-favorite-well-known-dog-past-or-present Favorite well known dog, past or present - Page 1.

==History==
[[File:Our Gang with Director Robert McGowan.jpg|thumb|260px|Pal the Wonder Dog as Pete, along with ''Our Gang'' cast with Director Robert McGowan.]]
When he was about six months old, Pal the Wonder Dog made a cameo appearance in the [[Harold Lloyd]] film ''[[The Freshman (1925 film)|The Freshman]]'', in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by Leonard Maltin, Richard Correll, and Richard W. Bann, from The Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection Giftset, Volume 2 - disc one&lt;/ref&gt;

Pal first started out as "Tige" in the ''[[Buster Brown]]'' series in the 1920s. It was during this time that he acquired the circled eye, and when he was recruited to appear in the ''Our Gang'' comedies later that year, [[Hal Roach]] simply left it on, creating one of the most recognized dogs in film history. 

Trainer and owner Lt. Harry Lucenay used one of Pal's offspring as Pete in the series after Pal was poisoned and died in 1930.&lt;ref name="maltin"&gt;[[Leonard Maltin|Maltin, Leonard]] and Bann, Richard W. (1977, rev. 1992). ''The Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang'',  pp. 281-283. New York: Crown Publishing/Three Rivers Press. {{ISBN|0-517-58325-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog, named Lucenay's Peter, was bred by A. A. Keller. The second Pete looked very similar to the first Pete but was a mirror image; the circle around first Pete's right eye was around the left eye of his son, the second Pete. The second Pete appeared as a puppy on ''[[Pups Is Pups]]'' and was nearly full-grown on his second appearance, ''[[School's Out (1930 film)|School's Out]]''. The second Pete's last ''Our Gang'' appearance was ''[[The Pooch]]'' in 1933. The plot had a [[dog catcher]] who attempts to  catch Pete and euthanise him, but is unsuccessful. After Lucenay was fired from the ''Our Gang'' series in 1932, he retired Peter to [[Atlantic City]], where he was photographed with children at the [[Steel Pier]]. Beginning with ''[[Hook and Ladder (1932 film)|Hook and Ladder]]'' (filmed the same year), an unrelated dog played Pete, after which, various unrelated dogs would play the role through 1938.

In the [[The Little Rascals (animated TV series)|1982 cartoon series]] produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions|Hanna-Barbera]], he was voiced by [[Peter Cullen]].  In the 1994 feature film remake of ''[[The Little Rascals (film)|The Little Rascals]]'', Pete is an American Bulldog, and in the 2014 movie ''[[The Little Rascals Save the Day]]'', Pete is a [[mongrel|mutt]].

A parody of Pete appeared briefly in the Bob Hope short [[Watch the Birdie (1935 film)|Watch the Birdie]], produced by competitor, [[Warner Bros.]]

==Death==
Roach used a number of unrelated dogs to portray Pete in ''Our Gang'' until 1938.&lt;ref name="maltin" /&gt; Lucenay's Peter continued on and died of old age on January 28, 1946, in [[Los Angeles, California]], at age 16 years/4 months, two years after the ''Our Gang'' series ended. Pete is buried at [[Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park]] at [[Calabasas]], [[Los Angeles]] County, California, United States.

'''Plant breeding''' is the science of changing the traits of [[plants]] in order to produce desired characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Breeding Field Crops. 1995. Sleper and Poehlman. Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to improve the quality of nutrition in products for humans and animals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartung|first=Frank|last2=Schiemann|first2=Joachim|date=|title=Precise plant breeding using new genome editing techniques: opportunities, safety and regulation in the EU|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.libproxy.uregina.ca:2048/doi/10.1111/tpj.12413/full|journal=The Plant Journal|volume=78|issue=5|pages=|doi=10.1111/tpj.12413|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant breeding can be accomplished through many different techniques ranging from simply selecting plants with desirable characteristics for propagation, to methods that make use of knowledge of genetics and chromosomes, to more complex molecular techniques (see [[cultigen]] and [[cultivar]]). Genes in a plant are what determine what type of qualitative or quantitative traits it will have. Plant breeders strive to create a specific outcome of plants and potentially new plant varieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years, since near the beginning of human civilization. It is practiced worldwide by individuals such as gardeners and farmers, and by professional plant breeders employed by organizations such as [[government]] institutions, universities, crop-specific industry associations or research centers.

International development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for ensuring [[food security]] by developing new varieties that are higher yielding, disease resistant, drought tolerant or regionally adapted to different environments and growing conditions.

== History ==
{{Main|History of plant breeding}}
'''Plant breeding''' started with sedentary agriculture and particularly the domestication of the first [[agriculture|agricultural]] plants, a practice which is estimated to date back 9,000 to 11,000 years.&lt;ref name="Piperno et al. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piperno|first=D. R.|author2=Ranere, A. J. |author3=Holst, I. |author4=Iriarte, J. |author5=Dickau, R. |title=Starch grain and phytolith evidence for early ninth millennium B.P. maize from the Central Balsas River Valley, Mexico|journal=PNAS|year=2009|volume=106|issue=13|pages=5019–5024|doi=10.1073/pnas.0812525106 |pmid=19307570 |pmc=2664021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics, and employed these as [[progenitor]]s for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of valuable [[Phenotypic trait|trait]]s over time.

[[Grafting]] technology had been practiced in China before 2000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Meng |first1=Chao |last2=Xu |first2=Dong |last3=Son |first3=Young-Jun |last4=Kubota |first4=Chieri |title=Simulation-based Economic Feasibility Analysis of Grafting Technology for Propagation Operation|book-title=Proceedings of the 2012 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference |editor-first1=G. |editor-last1=Lim |last-author-amp=yes |editor-first2=J.W. |editor-last2=Herrmann |publisher=Institute of Industrial Engineers |publication-date=2012|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/6c3b482f80771517ccffca5ac3eced7f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=51908 |conference=IIE Annual Conference |place=Norcross |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 500 BCE grafting was well established and practiced. &lt;ref name="history_grafting"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mudge |first1=K. |last2=Janick |first2=J. |last3=Scofield |first3=S. |last4=Goldschmidt |first4=E. |date=2009 |title=A History of Grafting |journal=Horticultural Reviews |volume=35 |pages=449–475 |url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?id=39857&amp;content=PDF |format=PDF |doi=10.1002/9780470593776.ch9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregor Mendel]] (1822–84) is considered the "father of modern [[genetics]]".  His experiments with plant [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] led to his establishing [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of inheritance]]. Genetics stimulated research to improve crop production through plant breeding.

Modern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[entomology]], [[chemistry]], and [[statistics]] ([[biometrics]]). It has also developed its own technology.

== Classical plant breeding ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
{{For|the role of crossing and plant breeding in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}

One major technique of plant breeding is selection, the process of selectively propagating plants with desirable characteristics and eliminating or "culling" those with less desirable characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deppe |first=Carol |date=2000 |title=Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing}} |page=237-244&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique is the deliberate interbreeding ('''crossing''') of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties. Plants are crossbred to introduce [[Trait (biological)|traits]]/[[gene]]s from one variety or line into a new genetic background. For example, a [[mildew]]-resistant [[pea]] may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, ('''[[backcrossing]]'''). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield (selection, as described above) and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce '''inbred''' varieties for breeding. Pollinators may be [[Pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]] through the use of [[pollination bags]].

Classical breeding relies largely on [[genetic recombination|homologous recombination]] between chromosomes to generate [[genetic diversity]]. The classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of ''in vitro'' techniques such as [[somatic fusion|protoplast fusion]], [[embryo rescue]] or [[mutagenesis]] (see below) to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in [[nature]].

Traits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include:
# Improved [[Quality (business)|quality]], such as increased nutrition, improved flavor, or greater beauty
# Increased [[Crop yield|yield]] of the crop
# Increased [[Physiological tolerance|tolerance]] of environmental pressures ([[salinity]], extreme [[temperature]], [[drought]])
# Resistance to [[virus]]es, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]
# Increased tolerance to [[insect]] pests
# Increased tolerance of [[herbicide]]s
# Longer storage period for the harvested crop

=== Before World War II ===
[[File:Gartons-1902-Catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|Garton's catalogue from 1902]]

Successful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late 19th century.{{clarify|and a citation that there were none before that time|date=October 2013}} [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through cross-pollination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|title=Plant breeding|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021184545/http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|archivedate=2013-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's first introduction was Abundance [[Oat]], one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, plant breeders realized that [[gregor mendel|Mendel's]]  findings on the non-random nature of [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]] could be applied to [[seedling]] populations produced through deliberate [[pollination]]s to predict the frequencies of different types. Wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of [[Italy]] during the so-called "[[Battle for Grain]]" (1925–1940). [[Heterosis]] was explained by [[George Harrison Shull]]. It describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. [[Maize]] was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids.

[[statistics|Statistical]] methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] (CMS), developed in maize, was described by [[Marcus Morton Rhoades]]. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile [[pollen]]. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive [[detasseling]].

These early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after [[World War II]], the [[Green Revolution]] increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s.

=== After World War II ===
[[File:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]
Following [[World War II]] a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species, and artificially induce genetic diversity.

When distantly related species are crossed, plant breeders make use of a number of [[plant tissue culture]] techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating. Interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally [[reproduction|sexually reproduce]] with each other. These crosses are referred to as ''Wide crosses''. For example, the [[cereal]] [[triticale]] is a [[wheat]] and [[rye]] hybrid. The cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as result was sterile. The [[cell division]] inhibitor [[colchicine]] was used to double the number of [[chromosome]]s in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and thus allow the production of a fertile line.

Failure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre- or post-[[fertilization]] incompatibility. If fertilization is possible between two species or genera, the hybrid [[embryo]] may abort before maturation. If this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant. Such a method is referred to as [[Embryo Rescue]]. This technique has been used to produce [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]], an interspecific cross of Asian rice ''(Oryza sativa)'' and [[African rice]] ''(Oryza glaberrima)''.

Hybrids may also be produced by a technique called [[protoplast]] fusion. In this case protoplasts are fused, usually in an electric field. Viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture.

Chemical [[mutagen]]s like [[ethyl methanesulfonate|EMS]] and [[dimethyl sulfate|DMS]], [[radiation]] and [[transposon]]s are used to generate [[mutant]]s with desirable traits to be bred with other [[cultivar]]s – a process known as ''Mutation Breeding''. Classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called [[somaclonal variation]], which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture, particularly plants derived from [[plant tissue culture|callus]]. Induced [[polyploidy]], and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called [[chromosome engineering]] may also be used.
[[File:Отбор образцов мини-растений картофеля.jpg|left|thumb|Agricultural research on potato plants]]

When a desirable trait has been bred into a species, a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible. Returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the high-yielding parent, the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations (See [[backcrossing]] ). This process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent. Classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process.

With classical breeding techniques, the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars. Some [[scientist]]s therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] plants. There have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption, for example the [[poison]] [[solanine]] was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of [[potato]] through plant breeding. New potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace.

== Modern plant breeding ==
Modern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select, or in the case of genetic modification, to insert, desirable traits into plants. Application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as [[molecular breeding]].

[[File:Adelport 270.jpg|350px|thumb|Modern facilities in molecular biology are now used in plant breeding.]]

=== Marker assisted selection ===
{{Main|Marker assisted selection}}
Sometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding. The use of tools such as [[molecular marker]]s or [[DNA fingerprinting]] can map thousands of genes. This allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest. The screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures, rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant. The purpose of marker assisted selection, or plant genomes analysis, is to identify the location and function ([[phenotype]]) of various genes within the genome. If all of the genes are identified it leads to [[Genome sequence]]. All plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins, but many are also the same. If a gene's location and function is identified in one plant species, a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another species genome.&lt;ref name="Biotech and food supply"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com.libproxy.uregina.ca:2048/doi/pdf/10.1139/g99-043|title=Biotechnology and world food supply|last1=Kasha|first1=Ken|publisher=Genome|pages=642–645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse breeding and doubled haploids (DH) ===
{{Main|Doubled haploidy}}
{{clarify|reason=some explanation of reverse breeding is still missing here|date=March 2017}}[[Homozygous]] plants with desirable traits can be produced from [[heterozygous]] starting plants, if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced, and then used to make a [[Doubled haploidy|doubled haploid]]. The doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits. Furthermore, two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of [[F1 hybrid]] plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits. Thus, an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety (F1 hybrid) without the necessity of [[vegetative reproduction]] but as the result of the cross of two homozygous/doubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2003017753|title=Reverse Breeding|website=wipo.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations. This minimizes the amount of genetic diversity among that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals. Using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homologous for the desired traits, therefore save much time in the process. There are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve the haploid plants, but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them.&lt;ref name="Biotech and food supply" /&gt;

=== Genetic modification ===
{{Main|Transgenic plants}}
[[Genetic modification]] of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with [[RNAi]], to produce a desirable [[phenotype]]. The plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as [[transgenic plants]]. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called [[cisgenesis|cisgenic plants]]. Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered.

To genetically modify a plant, a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant. To do this, a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] to drive [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene, and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant. A marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included. In the [[laboratory]], [[antibiotic resistance]] is a commonly used marker: Plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics; plants that have not been transformed will die. In some instances markers for selection are removed by [[backcrossing]] with the parent plant prior to commercial release.

The construct can be inserted in the plant genome by [[genetic recombination]] using the bacteria ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|A. rhizogenes]]'', or by direct methods like the [[gene gun]] or [[microinjection]]. Using plant [[virus]]es to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility, but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus. For example, [[Cauliflower mosaic virus]] (CaMV) only infects [[cauliflower]] and related species. Another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on the progeny, so every plant has to be inoculated.

The majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to [[insect]] [[pest (animal)|pests]] and [[herbicide]]s. Insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) that encodes a [[protein]] that is toxic to some insects. For example, the [[Helicoverpa zea|cotton bollworm]], a common cotton pest, feeds on [[Bt cotton]] it will ingest the toxin and die. Herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreland|first=D E|title=Mechanisms of Action of Herbicides|url=http://www.annualreviews.org.libproxy.uregina.ca:2048/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=597–638|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.31.060180.003121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides ''target site''.  Herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of ''target site'' protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide. This is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant crop plants (See [[Glyphosate#Glyphosate resistance|Glyphosate]])

Genetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment. Stresses such as temperature variation, are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a [[Transcription factor]] to regulate [[Gene expression]]. Overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to become more resistant to freezing, which is one common cause of yield loss&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang, Wangxia; Vinocur, Basia; Altmann, Arie|first=|date=|title=Plant responses to drought, salinity and extreme temperatures: towards genetic engineering for stress tolerance|url=https://link-springer-com.libproxy.uregina.ca:8443/article/10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5#Sec5|journal=Planta|volume=218|pages=1–14|doi=10.1007/s00425-003-1105-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic modification of plants that can produce [[pharmaceutical]]s (and industrial chemicals), sometimes called ''[[pharming (genetics)|pharming]]'', is a rather radical new area of plant breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Genetically modified plants and human health | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | date=1 June 2008 |author1=Suzie Key |author2=Julian K-C Ma |author3=Pascal MW Drake  |last-author-amp=yes | pages=290–298 | pmc=2408621 | pmid=18515776 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.070372 | volume=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues and concerns ==
Modern plant breeding, whether classical or through genetic engineering, comes with issues of concern, particularly with regard to food crops. The question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on [[nutrition]]al value is central in this respect. Although relatively little direct research in this area has been done, there are scientific indications that, by favoring certain aspects of a plant's development, other aspects may be retarded. A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American College of Nutrition]]'' in 2004, entitled ''Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999'', compared nutritional analysis of [[vegetable]]s done in 1950 and in 1999, and found substantial decreases in six of 13 [[nutrient]]s measured, including 6% of [[protein]] and 38% of [[riboflavin]]. Reductions in [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[iron]] and [[ascorbic acid]] were also found. The study, conducted at the Biochemical Institute, [[University of Texas at Austin]], concluded in summary: ''"We suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between 1950 and 1999, in which there may be trade-offs between [[Crop yield|yield]] and nutrient content."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = D.R. | last2 = Epp | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Riordan | first3 = H.D. | year = 2004 | title =  Changes in USDA Food Composition Data for 43 Garden Crops, 1950 to 1999| url = | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 669–682 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2004.10719409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate surrounding genetically modified food during the 1990s peaked in 1999 in terms of media coverage and risk perception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa-Font | first1 = J. | last2 = Mossialos | first2 = E. | year = 2007 | title =  Are perceptions of ‘risks’ and ‘benefits’ of genetically modified food (in)dependent?| url = | journal = Food Quality and Preference | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 173–182 | doi=10.1016/j.foodqual.2005.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues today – for example, "''Germany has thrown its weight behind a growing European mutiny over [[genetically modified crops]] by banning the planting of a widely grown pest-resistant corn variety.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/14/germany-gm-crops|title=Germany deals blow to GM crops|last=Connoly|first=Kate|date=2009-04-14|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate encompasses the [[Ecological impact of transgenic plants|ecological impact of genetically modified plants]], the safety of [[genetically modified food]] and concepts used for safety evaluation like [[substantial equivalence]]. Such concerns are not new to plant breeding. Most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers' needs. Examples include variety registration, seed schemes, regulatory authorizations for GM plants, etc.

[[Plant breeders' rights]] is also a major and controversial issue. Today, production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders, who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in [[intellectual property rights]]. The range of related issues is complex. In the simplest terms, critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that, through a combination of technical and economic pressures, commercial breeders are reducing [[biodiversity]] and significantly constraining individuals (such as farmers) from developing and trading seed on a regional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luby|first=C.

When new plant breeds or cultivars are bred,  they must be maintained and propagated. Some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds. Seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results. Isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting. Isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops, plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages (most commonly used when producing F1 hybrids.)

== Role of plant breeding in organic agriculture ==
Critics of [[organic agriculture]] claim it is too low-yielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture.  However, part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Kevin M. |author2=K.G. Campbell |author3=S.R. Lyon |author4=S.S. Jones|title=Evidence of varietal adaptation to organic farming systems|journal=Field Crops Research|year=2007|volume=102|pages=172–177|doi=10.1016/j.fcr.2007.03.011|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lammerts 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lammerts van Bueren|first=E.T. |author2=S.S.

Messmer|title=The need to breed crop varieties suitable for organic farming, using wheat, tomato and broccoli as examples: A review|journal=NJAS- Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.njas.2010.04.001|volume=58|issue=3–4|pages=193–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that over 95% of organic agriculture is based on conventionally adapted varieties, even though the production environments found in organic vs. conventional farming systems are vastly different due to their distinctive management practices.&lt;ref name="Lammerts 1" /&gt;  Most notably, organic farmers have fewer inputs available than conventional growers to control their production environments.  Breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential.  This requires selection for traits such as:&lt;ref name="Lammerts 1" /&gt;
* Water use efficiency
* Nutrient use efficiency (particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]])
* Weed competitiveness
* Tolerance of [[mechanical weed control]]
* Pest/disease resistance
* Early maturity (as a mechanism for avoidance of particular stresses)
* Abiotic stress tolerance (i.e. drought, salinity, etc...)

Currently, few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection (i.e. selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture).  However, because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large, a given [[genotype]] may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment (see [[gene-environment interaction]]).  If this interaction is severe enough, an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment, which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt;  To ensure the most adapted varieties are identified, advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection (i.e. selection in the target environment) for many agronomic traits.

There are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on [[genetically modified organisms]].  For instance, controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes.  [[Marker assisted selection]] can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired trait(s), greatly speeding up the breeding process.&lt;ref name="Lammerts 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lammerts van Bueren|first=E. T.|author2=G. Backes |author3=H. de Vriend |author4=H. Ostergard |title=The role of molecular markers and marker assisted selection in breeding for organic agriculture|journal=Euphytica|year=2010|volume=175|pages=51–64|doi=10.1007/s10681-010-0169-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique has proven particularly useful for the introgression of resistance genes into new backgrounds, as well as the efficient selection of many resistance genes pyramided into a single individual.  Unfortunately, [[molecular markers]] are not currently available for many important traits, especially complex ones controlled by many genes.

== Addressing global food security through plant breeding ==
For future agriculture to thrive there are necessary changes which must be made in accordance to arising [[global issue]]s. These issues are arable land, harsh cropping conditions and food security which involves, being able to provide the world population with food containing sufficient nutrients. These crops need to be able to mature in several environments allowing for worldwide access, this is involves issues such as drought tolerance. These global issues are achievable through the process of plant breeding, as it offers the ability to select specific genes allowing the crop to perform at a level which yields the desired results.

=== Increased yield without expansion ===

With an increasing population, the production of food needs to increase with it.  It is estimated that a 70% increase in food production is needed by 2050 in order to meet the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security. But with the degradation of agricultural land, simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option. New varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area. An example of this can be seen in Asia, where food production per capita has increased twofold.  This has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers, but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area.&lt;ref name="Tester, Langridge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tester|last2= Langridge|first1= Mark |first2= Peter |title=Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=February 2010 |volume=327 |issue=5967 |pages=818–822 | publisher = AAAS: American Association for the Advancement of Science |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1183700|doi=10.1126/science.1183700 |pmid=20150489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfray, Crute, Haddad, Lawrence, Muir, Pretty, Robinson.

=== Breeding for increased nutritional value ===

Plant breeding can contribute to global food security as it is a cost-effective tool for increasing nutritional value of forage and crops. Improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since 1960; this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time, meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker. The main area genetic increases were made was in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) resulting in 0.7-2.5% increase, at just 1% increase in IVDMD a single Bos Taurus also known as beef cattle reported 3.2% increase in daily gains. This improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level.

=== Breeding for tolerance ===

Plant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment. With long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture. Plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions; a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen. It is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security.

In countries that experience harsh winters such as Iceland, Germany and further east in Europe, plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost, continuous snow-cover, frost-drought (desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost) and high moisture levels in soil in winter.&lt;ref&gt;Link, W.; Balko, C.; Stoddard, F.; Winter hardiness in faba bean: Physiology and breeding.

Participatory plant breeding (PPB) is when farmers are involved in a crop improvement programme with opportunities to make decisions and contribute to the research process at different stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prgaprogram.org/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=9|title=PRGA Program|website=PRGA Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sperling et al. 2001.

== Etymology ==
In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the word ''prabhát(a)'' (প্রভাত - {{IPA-bn|pɾɔbhat̪}}) means ''dawn'', ''morning'' or ''daybreak''.&lt;ref name="Samsad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4&amp;table=biswas-bengali|title=Samsad Bengali-English Dictionary|last=Biswas|first=Sailendra|publisher=[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/ Digital Dictionaries of South Asia]|language=Bengali, English|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''sauṋgiit(a)'' (সঙ্গীত -  {{IPA-bn|ʃɔŋɡit̪}})&lt;ref name="Vol1"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar|Sarkár]]|first=Shrii Prabhát Raiṋjan|title=Prabhát Sauṋgiit (First Volume)|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|location=[[Kolkata]], [[India]]|date=2007-10-21|edition=Third|pages=1|isbn=81-7252-255-X|language=Bengali}}&lt;/ref&gt; also spelled ''saḿgiit(a)'' (সংগীত - {{IPA-bn|ʃɔŋɡɡit̪}}) means ''song'' and ''music''.&lt;ref name="Samsad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%97%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%A4&amp;table=biswas-bengali|title=Samsad Bengali-English Dictionary|last=Biswas|first=Sailendra|publisher=[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/ Digital Dictionaries of South Asia]|language=Bengali, English|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''prabhát(a) sauṋgiit(a)'' or ''prabhát(a) saḿgiit(a)'' etymologically means "morning song"&lt;ref name="Samsad" /&gt; or "songs of dawn".&lt;ref name="Sd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2009/06/19/stories/2009061950100300.htm|title=Friday Review Delhi - Songs of dawn|last=Avadhuta|first=Acharya Divyachetananda|date=2009-06-19|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been interpreted as "songs of a new dawn".&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Songs of a new dawn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-12/holistic-living/30144778_1_humanism-prabhat-samgita-shri-shri-anandamurti|title=Songs of a new dawn|last=Sarkar|first=Subhas|date=2011-09-12|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrelevant of the etymology, ''Prabhát(a)'' being the name of the composer, signifies "songs of [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]"&lt;ref name="Subhas Sarkar" /&gt;

== Name and Variants ==
Prabhát Saḿgiit has two most commonly used definitions, namely: "Songs of a New Down"&lt;ref name="Songs of a new dawn" /&gt; and "Songs of [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar|Prabhat]]".&lt;ref name="Subhas Sarkar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bangalore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/03/21/stories/2008032151150300.htm|title=Friday Review Bangalore - Music for humanity|date=2008-03-21|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=5 February 2013|location=[[Bangalore]], India}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has many spelling variants, with the following reasons: the word ''saḿgiit'' has two different spellings in Bengali, there is no fix transliteration rule for most Indian languages, there are also different transcription conventions used in English for Indian languages, the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation has an "a" at the end of both words, which is normally silent in Bengali and [[Hindi]].

Thus we have the word '''''prabhat''''' that can be spelled as:
*''Prabhat'', ''Prabhát'', ''Prabhāt'', ''Prabhata'', ''Prabháta'', ''Prabhāta''

And we have the word '''''samgiit''''' that can be spelled as:

*''Sangit'', ''Sangeet'', ''Sangiit'', ''Samgiit'', ''Saḿgiit'', ''Saṃgīt'', ''Sauṋgiit'', ''Saŋgīt'' and all of these with "a" at the end:
*''Sangita'', ''Sangeeta'', ''Sangiita'', ''Samgiita'', ''Saḿgiita'', ''Saṃgīta'', ''Sauṋgiita'' and ''Saŋgīta''

If combined, all these variations could create a huge number of spelling variants for Prabhat Samgiit, however not all combinations are used. Subhas Sarkar mainly prefers the variant '''Prabháta Saḿgiita''' and sometimes uses '''Prabhāta saṃgīta'''.&lt;ref name="Subhas Sarkar" /&gt; There is no consistency of spelling, even within the same newspapers. [[The Hindu]] often spells '''Prabhat Samgiita'''&lt;ref name=Sd /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bangalore" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ND&gt;{{cite news|title=Prabhat Samgiita Divas celebrated|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/09/15/stories/2009091557350400.htm|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=2009-09-15|location=[[New Delhi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; however also spells '''Prabhat Sangit'''&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/06/15/stories/2007061550170300.htm|title=Music and memories|date=2007-06-15|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also '''Prabhat Sangeet'''.&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/09/20/stories/2004092001980200.htm|title=Metro cultural round-up|date=2004-09-20|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Times of India]] uses both '''Prabhat Samgiita'''&lt;ref name="Songs of a new dawn" /&gt; and ''Prabhat Sangeet''.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-27/faith-and-ritual/28101854_1_beauty-divine-music-music-heals|title=Divine music that evokes blissful experience|date=2009-09-27|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most other newspapers spell ''Prabhat Sangeet'', though some articles prefer ''Prabhat Sangit'' and '''Prabhata Samgiita'''.

Sarkar created the [[Ananda Marga]] organization in 1955 and by 1973 Ananda Marga Publications was established to translate and distribute his work as well as works relating to Sarkar.  The multivolume English/Bengali edition was published in 1993 and two smaller volumes of selected works in English followed.  Another Ananda Marga-affiliated group, the Renaissance Artists and Writers Association (RAWA), has sponsored several performances and recordings of selected songs.  These performances have featured artists such as [[Acarya Tattvavedananda Avadhuta]], [[Acarya Priyashivananda Avadhuta]], [[Madhuri Chattopadhay]], [[Srikanto Acharya]], [[Arundhati Home Choudhury]], [[Ramkumar Chattopadhay]], [[Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande]], [[Rashid Khan (musician)|Rashid Khan]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Manoj Kumar]], [[Vithal Rao]], [[Shruti Sadolikar]], [[Haimanti Sukla]] and [[Archana Udupa]].{{citation needed |date=February 2013}}

'''''Reincarnation in Venice''''' is a [[science fiction]] or [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] book written by [[popular fiction]] author [[Max Simon Ehrlich]] and published in 1979 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in New York.

The author begins his story by declaring that on one balmy September morning in 1954 a 25-year-old [[Venice|Venetian]] man steps out of a mansion just off the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] and into the street:

:''He was young, perhaps no more than twenty-five, with a darkly handsome patrician face, and was, like most Venetians of his class, exquisitely tailored.   He paused for a moment, in front of the great doors of the palazzo and looked up.   His wife was at one of the upper windows.   He smiled at her and blew her a kiss.  She waved back at him.''  Page 13.

Before the day is through, he will have died unceremoniously, and his body thrown into one of the canals.

The story picks up again on page 23, apparently decades later in another part of the world when a young and wealthy computer programmer walking down East 50th Street in [[New York City|New York]], notices in the window of an antique shop an item that catches his eye.

:'''The window was cluttered with a variety of articles for sale - guitars, typewriters, tape recorders, clocks, golf clubs, and a hodgepodge of jewelry, rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings.  The medallion itself was large in size, about two inches in diameter, and hung on a gold chain. Mixed with the rest of the jewelry in the window, it was rather inconspicuous.  Yet, somehow, it had drawn his attention.''  Page 27.

and he just ''has'' to have it, even if it is overpriced, and not a legitimate hedge against inflation.   Even if it is gold, it is possibly overpriced.   But the medallion carries a curious [[coat of arms]] upon its face, and must have been minted privately by some noble family in [[Italy]].   And thus begins a long journey that takes him back to another man's life - and death - in Venice.

A '''Spinal Cord Stimulator''' (SCS) or Dorsal Column Stimulator (DCS) is a type of implantable [[neuromodulation]] device (sometimes called a "pain pacemaker") that is used to send electrical signals to select areas of the [[spinal cord]] (dorsal columns) for the treatment of certain pain conditions. SCS is a consideration for people who have a pain condition that has not responded to more conservative therapy.&lt;ref name=Uptodate&gt;{{cite web |last1=McKenzie-Brown |first1=Anne Marie |title=Spinal cord stimulation: Placement and management |url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-stimulation-placement-and-management?source=search_result&amp;search=spinal%20cord%20stimuator&amp;selectedTitle=1~150 |publisher=UptoDate |date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Failed Back Surgery Syndrome is the most common use while in Europe the most common use is peripheral ischemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eldabe |first=Sam |last2=Kumar |first2=Krishna |last3=Buchser |first3=Eric |last4=Taylor |first4=Rod S. |date=July 2010 |title=An analysis of the components of pain, function, and health-related quality of life in patients with failed back surgery syndrome treated with spinal cord stimulation or conventional medical management |journal=Neuromodulation  |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=201–209 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1403.2009.00271.x |pmid=21992833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 the FDA had approved SCS as a treatment for [[Failed Back Surgery Syndrome|failed back surgery syndrome]] (FBSS), chronic pain, [[Complex regional pain syndrome|Complex Regional Pain Syndrome]], intractable angina, as well as visceral abdominal and perineal pain&lt;ref name=Uptodate/&gt; and pain in the extremities from nerve damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Song |first=Jason J. |last2=Popescu |first2=Adrian |last3=Bell |first3=Russell L. |date=May 2014 |title=Present and potential use of spinal cord stimulation to control chronic pain |journal=Pain Physician |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=235–246 |pmid=24850105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
The most common use of SCS is [[Failed back syndrome|failed back surgery syndrome]] (FBSS) in the United States and peripheral ischemic pain in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turner |first=J. A. |last2=Loeser |first2=J. D. |last3=Bell |first3=K. G. |date=December 1995 |title=Spinal cord stimulation for chronic low back pain: a systematic literature synthesis |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1088–1095; discussion 1095–1096 |pmid=8584149 |doi=10.1097/00006123-199512000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patel2015&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Patel |first=Vikram B. |last2=Wasserman |first2=Ronald |last3=Imani |first3=Farnad |date=2015-08-22 |title=Interventional Therapies for Chronic Low Back Pain: A Focused Review (Efficacy and Outcomes) |journal=Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e29716 |doi=10.5812/aapm.29716 |pmc=4604560 |pmid=26484298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a person has had a [[psychological evaluation]] and deemed an appropriate candidate for SCS, a temporary implant is placed, called a trial, to determine the best stimulation pattern, and the person is sent home for three to ten days with an external pulse generator.  If pain control and increased activity was achieved, a permanent system, with leads and a pulse generator, is placed.&lt;ref name=Patel2015/&gt;

== Contraindications ==

SCS may be contraindicated in people who have [[Coagulopathy|coagulation]] related disorders, or are on [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulant therapy.]]&lt;ref name=Uptodate/&gt; Other contraindications include local and systemic infection, [[pacemakers]], or those people for whom pre-surgical imaging studies show have anatomy that makes placement difficult, or if concerns arise during psychological evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Narouze |first=Samer |last2=Benzon |first2=Honorio T. |last3=Provenzano |first3=David A. |last4=Buvanendran |first4=Asokumar |last5=De Andres |first5=José |last6=Deer |first6=Timothy R. |last7=Rauck |first7=Richard |last8=Huntoon |first8=Marc A. |date=May 2015 |title=Interventional spine and pain procedures in patients on antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the European Society of Regional Anaesthesia and Pain Therapy, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the International Neuromodulation Society, the North American Neuromodulation Society, and the World Institute of Pain |journal=Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=182–212 |doi=10.1097/AAP.0000000000000223 |pmid=25899949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Deer |first=Timothy R. |last2=Mekhail |first2=Nagy |last3=Provenzano |first3=David |last4=Pope |first4=Jason |last5=Krames |first5=Elliot |last6=Leong |first6=Michael |last7=Levy |first7=Robert M. |last8=Abejon |first8=David |last9=Buchser |first9=Eric |date=August 2014 |title=The appropriate use of neurostimulation of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system for the treatment of chronic pain and ischemic diseases: the Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee |journal=Neuromodulation  |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=515–550; discussion 550 |doi=10.1111/ner.12208 |pmid=25112889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knezevic |first=Nebojsa N. |last2=Candido |first2=Kenneth D. |last3=Rana |first3=Shalini |last4=Knezevic |first4=Ivana |date=July 2015 |title=The Use of Spinal Cord Neuromodulation in the Management of HIV-Related Polyneuropathy |journal=Pain Physician |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=E643–650 |pmid=26218955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects and complications==
Complications with SCS range from simple easily correctable problems to devastating paralysis, nerve injury and death. In a 7-year follow-up, the overall complication rate was 5-18%. The most common complications include lead migration, lead breakage, and infection. Other complications include rotation of the pulse generator, [[haematoma]]s (subcutaneous or epidural), [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) leak, [[post dural puncture headache]], discomfort at pulse generator site, [[seroma]] and transient [[paraplegia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hayek |first=Salim M. |last2=Veizi |first2=Elias |last3=Hanes |first3=Michael |date=October 2015 |title=Treatment-Limiting Complications of Percutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulator Implants: A Review of Eight Years of Experience From an Academic Center Database |journal=Neuromodulation |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=603–608; discussion 608–609 |doi=10.1111/ner.12312 |pmid=26053499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people find the tingling sensation caused by SPS to be unpleasant.&lt;ref name=Deer2014/&gt;

The most common hardware related complication is lead migration, in which the implanted electrodes move from their original placement. With this complication, recapturing paraesthesia coverage can be attempted with reprogramming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eldabe |first=Sam |last2=Buchser |first2=Eric |last3=Duarte |first3=Rui V. |date=2016-02-01 |title=Complications of Spinal Cord Stimulation and Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Techniques: A Review of the Literature |url=https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/17/2/325/2460710/Complications-of-Spinal-Cord-Stimulation-and |journal=Pain Medicine |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=325–336 |doi=10.1093/pm/pnv025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In circumstances involving major lead migration a reoperation may be required to reset the lead placement.&lt;ref name=Kumar2007&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kumar |first=Krishna |last2=Buchser |first2=Eric |last3=Linderoth |first3=Bengt |last4=Meglio |first4=Mario |last5=Van Buyten |first5=Jean-Pierre |date=January 2007 |title=Avoiding complications from spinal cord stimulation: practical recommendations from an international panel of experts |journal=Neuromodulation |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=24–33 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1403.2007.00084.x |pmid=22151809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies differ greatly in reporting the percentage of people who have lead migration but the majority of studies report in the range of 10-25% of lead migration for spinal cord stimulation.&lt;ref name=Kumar2007/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The neurophysiological mechanisms of action of spinal cord stimulation are not completely understood but may involve masking pain sensation with [[paresthesia |tingling]] by altering the pain processing of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name=Deer2014&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Deer |first=Timothy R. |last2=Krames |first2=Elliot |last3=Mekhail |first3=Nagy |last4=Pope |first4=Jason |last5=Leong |first5=Michael |last6=Stanton-Hicks |first6=Michael |last7=Golovac |first7=Stan |last8=Kapural |first8=Leo |last9=Alo |first9=Ken |date=August 2014 |title=The appropriate use of neurostimulation: new and evolving neurostimulation therapies and applicable treatment for chronic pain and selected disease states.

D. |date=July 1999 |title=Physiology of spinal cord stimulation: review and update |journal=Neuromodulation |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=150–164 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1403.1999.00150.x |pmid=22151202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Oakley |first=John C. |last2=Prager |first2=Joshua P. |date=2002-11-15 |title=Spinal cord stimulation: mechanisms of action |journal=Spine |volume=27 |issue=22 |pages=2574–2583 |doi= 10.1097/00007632-200211150-00034|pmid=12435996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In neuropathic pain states, experimental evidence shows that SCS alters the local neurochemistry in dorsal horn, suppressing the hyperexcitability of the neurons. Specifically, there is some evidence for increased levels of [[GABA]] release, [[serotonin]], and perhaps suppression of levels of some excitatory amino acids, including [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]]. In the case of ischemic pain, analgesia seems to derive from restoration of the oxygen demand supply. This effect could be mediated by inhibition of the [[sympathetic system]], although [[vasodilation]] is another possibility. It is also probable that a combination of the two above mentioned mechanisms is involved.&lt;ref name="Kunnumourath"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kunnumpurath |first1=Sreekumar |last2=Srinivasagopalan |first2=Ravi |last3=Vadivelu |first3=Nalini |title=Spinal cord stimulation: principles of past, present and future practice: a review |journal=Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing |date=1 September 2009 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=333–339 |doi=10.1007/s10877-009-9201-0 |pmid=19728120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Electrotherapy of pain by neurostimulation began shortly after Melzack and Wall proposed the [[Pain#Gate control|gate control theory]] in 1965. This theory proposed that nerves carrying painful peripheral stimuli and nerves carrying touch and vibratory sensation both terminate in the [[Posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] (the gate) of spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kirkpatrick |first=Daniel R. |last2=McEntire |first2=Dan M. |last3=Hambsch |first3=Zakary J. |last4=Kerfeld |first4=Mitchell J. |last5=Smith |first5=Tyler A. |last6=Reisbig |first6=Mark D. |last7=Youngblood |first7=Charles F. |last8=Agrawal |first8=Devendra K. |date=December 2015 |title=Therapeutic Basis of Clinical Pain Modulation |journal=Clinical and Translational Science |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=848–856 |doi=10.1111/cts.12282 |pmc=4641846 |pmid=25962969}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hypothesized that input to the latter could be manipulated to “close the gate” to the former. As an application of the gate control theory, Shealy et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shealy |first=C. N. |last2=Mortimer |first2=J. T. |last3=Reswick |first3=J. B. |date=July 1967 |title=Electrical inhibition of pain by stimulation of the dorsal columns: preliminary clinical report |journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=489–491 |pmid=4952225 |doi=10.1213/00000539-196707000-00025}}&lt;/ref&gt; implanted the first spinal cord stimulator device directly on the dorsal column for the treatment of chronic pain and in 1971, Shimogi and colleagues first reported the analgesic properties of epidural spinal cord stimulation. Since then this technique has undergone numerous technical and clinical developments.

At this time neurostimulation for the treatment of pain is used with [[nerve]] stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, [[deep brain stimulation]], and [[motor cortex]] stimulation.

== Research ==
SCS has been studied in people with Parkinson's disease&lt;ref name=PD&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Andrade |first=Emerson Magno |last2=Ghilardi |first2=Maria Gabriela |last3=Cury |first3=Rubens Gisbert |last4=Barbosa |first4=Egberto Reis |last5=Fuentes |first5=Romulo |last6=Teixeira |first6=Manoel Jacobsen |last7=Fonoff |first7=Erich Talamoni |date=January 2016 |title=Spinal cord stimulation for Parkinson's disease: a systematic review |journal=Neurosurgical Review |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=27–35; discussion 35 |doi=10.1007/s10143-015-0651-1 |pmid=26219854}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[angina pectoris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Rod S. |last2=De Vries |first2=Jessica |last3=Buchser |first3=Eric |last4=Dejongste |first4=Mike J.

Research on improving the devices and software has included efforts to increasing the battery life, efforts to develop [[Feedback|closed loop]] control, and combining stimulation with implanted drug delivery systems.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

'''''Streptomyces'' isolates '''have yielded the majority of human, animal, and agricultural antibiotics, as well as a number of fundamental chemotherapy medicines. ''[[Streptomyces]]'' is the largest [[antibiotic]]-producing genus of [[actinobacteria]], producing chemotherapy, antibacterial, [[antifungal drug|antifungal]], antiparasitic drugs, and [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressants]].&lt;ref name="pmid11702082"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watve MG, Tickoo R, Jog MM, Bhole BD |title=How many antibiotics are produced by the genus Streptomyces? |journal=Arch.

== Anticancer medicines ==
[[Image:Doxorubicin–DNA complex 1D12.png|thumb|150px|Doxorubicin [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalating DNA]].]]

''Streptomyces'', yielded the medicines [[doxorubicin]] ('''Doxil'''), [[daunorubicin]] ('''DaunoXome'''), and [[streptozotocin]] ('''Zanosar'''). Doxorubicin is the precursor to [[valrubicin]] ('''Valstar'''), [[myocet]], and [[pirarubicin]]. Daunorubicin is the precursor to [[idarubicin]] ('''Idamycin'''), [[epirubicin]] ('''Ellence'''), and [[zorubicin]].

''Streptomyces'' is the original source of [[dactinomycin]] ('''Cosmegen'''), [[bleomycin]] ('''Blenoxane'''), [[pingyangmycin]] ('''Bleomycin A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''), [[mitomycin C]] ('''Mutamycin'''), [[rebeccamycin]], [[staurosporine]] (precursor to [[stauprimide]] and [[midostaurin]]), [[neothramycin]], [[aclarubicin]], tomaymycin, sibiromycin, and mazethramycin.

Derivatives of ''Streptomycetes'' isolate [[migrastatin]], including [[isomigrastatin]], dorrigocin A &amp; B, and the synthetic derivative [[macroketone]], are being researched for anticancer activity.

== Antibiotics ==
Most clinical antibiotics were found during the "golden age of antibiotics" (1940s–1960s). [[Actinomycin]] was the first antibiotic isolated from ''Streptomyces'' in 1940, followed by [[streptomycin]] three years later. ''Streptomycetes'' isolates (including various [[aminoglycoside]]s) would go on to comprise over two-thirds of all marketed antibiotics.

''Streptomyces'' antibiotics include:

[[Clavulanic acid]] (''[[Streptomyces clavuligerus]]'') is used in combination with some antibiotics (like [[amoxicillin]]) to weaken bacterial-resistance. Novel antiinfectives being developed include [[Guadinomine]] (''Streptomyces'' sp. K01-0509),&lt;ref name="Holmes2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 23030602|year= 2012|last1= Holmes|first1= TC|last2= May|first2= AE|last3= Zaleta-Rivera|first3= K|last4= Ruby|first4= JG|last5= Skewes-Cox|first5= P|last6= Fischbach|first6= MA|last7= Derisi|first7= JL|last8= Iwatsuki|first8= M|last9= Ōmura|first9= S|last10= Khosla|first10= C|title= Molecular insights into the biosynthesis of guadinomine: A type III secretion system inhibitor|volume= 134|issue= 42|pages= 17797–806|doi= 10.1021/ja308622d|pmc= 3483642|journal= Journal of the American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; an inhibitor of the [[type III secretion system]].

Non-''Streptomyces'' [[actinomycetes]], filamentous [[fungi]], and non-filamentous [[bacteria]], have also yielded important antibiotics.

== Antifungals ==

[[Nystatin]] (''[[Streptomyces noursei]]''), [[amphotericin B]] (''[[Streptomyces nodosus]]''), and [[natamycin]] (''[[Streptomyces natalensis]]'') are antifungals isolated from ''Streptomyces''.

== Immunosuppressants ==
[[Sirolimus]] ('''Rapamycin'''), [[ascomycin]], and [[tacrolimus]] were isolated from ''Streptomyces''.  [[Pimecrolimus]] is a derivative of ascomycin. [[Ubenimex]] is derived from ''S. olivoreticuli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauvois|first=B|author2=Dauzonne, D |title=Aminopeptidase-N/CD13 (EC 3.4.11.2) inhibitors: Chemistry, biological evaluations, and therapeutic prospects|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|volume=26|issue=1|pages=88–130|doi=10.1002/med.20044|pmid=16216010|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antiparasitics ==
''[[Streptomyces avermitilis]]'' synthesizes the antiparasitic [[ivermectin]] ('''Stromectol'''). Other antiparasitics made by ''Streptomyces'' include, [[milbemycin oxime]], [[moxidectin]], and [[milbemycin]].

Traditionally, ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is the choice bacterium to express [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] genes.

''Streptomyces'' offers potential advantages including superior secretion mechanisms, higher yields, a simpler end-product purification process, making ''Streptomyces'' an attractive alternative to ''E. coli'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''.&lt;ref name="Binnie_1997"/&gt;

''[[Streptomyces coelicolor]]'', ''[[Streptomyces avermitilis]]'', ''[[Streptomyces griseus]]'', and ''[[Saccharopolyspora erythraea]]'', are capable of secondary metabolite production. ''[[Streptomyces coelicolor]]'' has shown useful for the [[heterologous expression]] of proteins.

'''Ted Potter Jr. '''(born November 9, 1983) is an American [[professional golfer]] who plays on the [[PGA Tour]]. He is a left-handed golfer, but is naturally right-handed. He is a two-time winner on the PGA Tour, having also won twice on the [[Web.com Tour]]. He is often described as a career journeyman golfer and mini-tour legend, due to his dominance of numerous minor league golfing tours.

==Early life==
Potter was born in [[Ocala, Florida]], and resided the majority of his childhood in nearby [[Silver Springs, Florida|Silver Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ted Potter, Jr. Profile |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/02/75/56/ |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of Ted Potter Sr. and Dale Potter. His father is a retired a golf course maintenance professional who worked at Silver Springs Shores Country Club and various other Ocala area courses.  His mother currently still works for [[Walmart]] as a Department Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://golfweek.com/2012/07/08/ted-potter-jr-shows-his-power-perservere/ |title=Potter Jr. shows his power to persevere |magazine=Golfweek |date=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to play golf at a very early age. His father made him a custom set of clubs as soon as he could grip a golf club and was his chief instructor of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marks |first=Andy |title=Marion County's Potter on golf's biggest stage |url=http://preps.ocala.com/news/article/29283/marion-countys-potter-on-golfs-biggest-stage/?pa=1&amp;tc=pg |date=January 12, 2012 |website=Ocala.com |accessdate=August 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715024657/http://preps.ocala.com/news/article/29283/marion-countys-potter-on-golfs-biggest-stage/?pa=1&amp;tc=pg |archivedate=July 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Potter would go on to dominate Florida youth golfing tours winning numerous youth events. His success continued through his high school career. He won all-district honors three times in high school. He graduated in 2002 from [[Lake Weir High School]] in southeastern [[Marion County, Florida|Marion County]], and chose to turn pro instead of attending college.

==Professional career==
===Mini-tours career===
Potter turned pro at the age of 19 where he first competed on the Central Florida-based Moonlight Tour. He supplemented his income working in the cart barn at Lake Diamond Golf &amp; Country Club in Ocala, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Elling |first=Steve |title=Long Shot Takes Best Shot At PGA |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-12-03/sports/0312030404_1_ted-potter-antithesis-magee |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=December 3, 2003 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/notebook/_/page/weekly18110213/jason-sobel-weekly-18 |last=Sobel |first=Jason |title=Jason Sobel's Weekly 18 (#4 Ted Potter, Jr.) |work=ESPN |date=February 13, 2011 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potter is estimated to have over 60 mini-tour victories at various levels of mini-tour competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=

He did not regain his Nationwide Tour card and returned to mini-tour competition for 2008 and 2009.

Potter regained his Nationwide Tour card again in 2010. He entered 11 events making only three cuts and finished in 148th place. He did not regain his Nationwide Tour card and returned to mini-tour competition again for the start of 2011.

The 2011 season was Potter's breakout as a professional golfer.

The only thing that stands between them and world domination is a brilliant but troubled high school student with a penchant for pranks.

'''Thomas Lynn Bradford''' (died February 6, 1921) of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], is best known for committing [[suicide]] in an attempt to ascertain the existence of an [[afterlife]] and communicate that information to a living accomplice, Ruth Doran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Mary Roach | first = Mary | last = Roach | title = Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife | year = 2005 | publisher = W.

Some weeks earlier, Bradford had sought a fellow spiritualist in a newspaper advertisement and Doran responded. The two agreed "that there was but one way to solve the mystery—two minds properly attuned, one of which must shed its earthly mantle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-994814/the-afterlife-real-or-imagined/?pageNum=3&amp;tag=contentMain;contentBody | title = The Afterlife: Real Or Imagined? | page = 3 | work = CBS Sunday Morning News | date = October 30, 2005 | first = Sean | last = Alfano}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a follow-up under the headline "Dead Spiritualist Silent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A1EFD395810738DDDA10894DA405B818EF1D3 |title = DEAD SPIRITUALIST SILENT.; Detroit Woman Awaits Message, but Denies Any Compact. | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = February 8, 1921 |page =3 | location = Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Correct title|title=#WhyIStayed/#WhyILeft|reason=#}}

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;WhyIStayed''' became a trending hashtag in November 2014 in defense of [[Domestic Violence|domestic abuse]] victims after a media release of security camera footage that appeared to show [[NFL]] player, [[Ray Rice#Domestic Violence|Ray Rice]], punching his then-fiancee, Janay Rice, sparked public conversation on why Janay and other victims of abuse choose to stay in abusive relationships. The [[hashtag]] was started by writer and domestic abuse survivor [[Beverly Gooden]] via [[Twitter]] in an effort to "change the tone of the conversation."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/09/living/rice-video-why-i-stayed/|title=Meredith Vieira Explains #WhyIStayed|website=cnn.com|last1=Grinberg|first1=Emanuella|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began to trend nationally five hours after its creation&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/news/beyond-ray-rice-whyistayed-hashtag-personalizes-domestic-violence-1D80137572|title=Beyond Ray Rice: #WhyIStayed personalizes domestic violence|website=today.com|last1=Serico|first1=Chris|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used more than 46,000 times that day, according to the Web analytics tool, [[Topsy (analytics)|Topsy]].&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/09/10/why-i-stayed-hashtag-twitter-ray-rice/15385027/|title=#WhyIStayed: Powerful Stories of Domestic Violence|website=usatoday.com|last1=Lee|first1=Jolie|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''#WhyILeft''' was a later addition to the Twitter conversation.

== Background ==
Beverly Gooden's rationale for staying with her husband was that it was step one in her move to eventually leave her abusive relationship; Janay Rice, on the other hand, expressed that she has no intention of divorcing her now-husband and does not view herself as an abuse victim.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/11913473/janay-rice-gives-own-account-night-atlantic-city|title=Janay Rice, in her own words|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of media attention after the release of the tape, Janay came out in support of Ray on [[Instagram]], writing, "To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3308901/janay-rice-ray-rice-nfl-baltimore-ravens/|title=Janay Rice Instagrams a statement defending her husband and criticizing the media and NFL|website=Time|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the pull to stay together for the sake of their daughter, Rayven, Janay argued that the violent night in [[Atlantic City]] was an anomaly in their relationship. In an interview with [[ESPN]], she said, "As angry as I was, I knew it was something that we could move on from because I know Ray."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She added that the violence was not one-sided; Janay was the one to initiate it, slapping Ray before he assaulted her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She stressed that she hopes people can see the love that the two have for one another despite one isolated incident, and how much they have grown because of it.

On November 8, 2014, creator [[Beverly Gooden]] posted the following message to her website to elaborate on her inspiration for #WhyIStayed:

"The internet exploded with questions about [Janay Rice] … why didn't she leave? Why did she marry him? Why did she stay? I can't speak for Janay Rice, but I can speak for Beverly Gooden. Why did I stay? … Leaving was a process, not an event. And sometimes it takes a while to navigate through the process. I believe in storytelling. I believe in the power of shared experience. I believe that we find strength in community. That is why I created this hashtag. I hope those tweeting using #WhyIStayed find a voice, find love, find compassion, and find hope."&lt;ref name="Today" /&gt;

Stories of why victims stayed varied from feeling unable to leave out of fear to not knowing that abuse was abnormal. Victims left because they realized their lives were in jeopardy, they started to believe they deserved better, and/or they wanted to protect their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/national/domestic-abuse-the-spotlight-with-whyistayed-and-whyileft-hashtag-campaigns/EPLRCWUFgJ4XEZD4DQUn6M/|title=Domestic abuse in the spotlight with #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft...|last=Desk|first=Cox Media Group National Content|website=ajc|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
In response to #WhyIStayed/#WhyIleft, Janay said she was thankful that her experience with domestic violence instigated the movement. Despite the difficulty of enduring the scrutiny that comes from the publicization of a private moment, Janay said that the fact that it began a conversation about abuse was a silver lining.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hashtag gained significant attention from national media, as well as from the [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]] via Twitter. The organization thanked all who were sharing their stories with #WhyIStayed and informed users about their services.&lt;ref name="Today" /&gt;

== Misuse of the hashtag ==
After #WhyIStayed became a trending topic on [[Twitter]], it was mistakenly used by the [[DiGiorno|DiGiorno's Pizza]] Twitter handle as a marketing effort. They tweeted, "#WhyIStayed You had pizza."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/twitter-backlash-when-digiorno-uses-whyistayed-to-sell-pizzas-after-ray-rice-scandal/301149/|title=Twitter backlash when DiGiorno uses #WhyIStayed to sell pizzas after Ray Rice scandal|date=2014-09-09|work=ABC7 Chicago|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrator for the account later removed the tweet and apologized for the mistake, claiming that no one had looked into the implication of the trending hashtag before taking to Twitter. While many Twitter users brushed over the error, others were deeply angered as they believed DiGiorno was making light of an incredibly serious topic. In response, DiGiorno answered every negative tweet with personal messages conveying their apologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katrina-sands/a-lesson-in-crisis-commun_b_5794122.html|title=A Lesson in Crisis Communications, Courtesy of DiGiorno|last=Sands|first=Katrina|date=2014-09-10|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiGiorno has since removed the original tweet—but not before screenshots were taken to verify the event.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3308861/digiorno-social-media-pizza/|title=DiGiorno Used a Hashtag About Domestic Violence to Sell Pizza|website=time.com|last1=Stampler|first1=Laura|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2014/09/09/whyistayed-digiorno-and-other-corporate-disasters/|title=#WhyIStayed, DiGiorno, and Other Corporate Disasters|website=washingtonpost.com|last1=Petri|first1=Alexandra|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
