[[File:Back of Iford Manor, from Peto Garden - geograph.org.uk - 1009631.jpg|thumb|right|The back garden of [[Iford Manor]] was designed by [[Harold Peto]].]]
A '''back garden''' is a [[residential garden]] located at the rear of a property, on the other side of the [[house]] from the [[front garden]].  Such gardens have a special place in English [[suburban]] and [[gardening]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=From woollen carpet to grass carpet: bridging house and garden in an English suburb|isbn=0-226-52601-1|title=Material Cultures: Why Some Things Matter|author=S Chevalier|year=1998|quote=Every resident ... has a private garden divided into two areas, the front and the back garden whose social role is ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtiXlOKW4qYC|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A back garden arises when the main building divides the surrounding gardens into two.  This happens especially in the high density housing of British cities and towns.  A [[semi-detached house]] typical of the British suburbs of the 20th century will have front gardens which face the road and provide access.  The back gardens in such cases will be more secluded and access will typically be via the dwelling or by a path around the side.

If the housing is [[terraced house|terraced]], then no side path is possible and access may be provided by an alley which runs behind the rear of the terrace. While buildings opening directly onto a street may not have a front garden, most will have some space at the back, however small; the exception being [[back-to-back houses]] found in northern industrial towns in England such as [[Architecture_of_Leeds#Housing|Leeds]], but now mostly demolished. A private back yard with a "privy" (toilet) was a defining feature of the [[byelaw terraced house]], a type of dwelling built to comply with the [[Public Health Act 1875]].

A front garden is a formal and semi-public space and so subject to the constraints of convention and law.  However, the back garden is more private and casual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=The back garden is usually more private and casual|title= Feng Shui in the Garden|page=47|author=Richard Webster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nM_dmNdgCWMC|isbn=1-56718-793-5|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so can be put to more purposes.

==Number and size==
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] there are over 10 million back gardens.&lt;ref name=EarthEndures&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTDpl_bgh8wC|title=The Earth Only Endures: On Reconnecting With Nature and Our Place in It|author=Jules N. Pretty|isbn=1-84407-432-3|publisher=Earthscan|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British planning require minimum distances between the rear faces of adjacent dwellings and so there is usually space for a back garden of some sort.  In other countries, such as Australia, this does not apply and preference for buildings with a large footprint has tended to squeeze out the space at the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=86 |title=The Life and Death of the Australian Backyard |author=Tony Hall |publisher=Csiro Publishing |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-643-09816-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Because of weather constraints, it is usual to use a garden more in the summer than in the winter, although some usages are traditional, such as for a bonfire on [[Bonfire Night]], 5 November.  Similarly, [[daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] usage is more common than nighttime.

[[File:View to NW from Bell Harry Tower of Canterbury Cathedral - geograph.org.uk - 139263.jpg|thumb|right|The back garden of the [[Archdeacon of Canterbury]] contains a [[mulberry]] which is said to have been planted by [[Erasmus]].]]
Functionally, it may be used for:

* Growing food&lt;ref name=EarthEndures/&gt;
* Playing games
* Relaxing and [[sunbathing]]
* Raising plants
* Housing pets
* Drying clothes
* Making a [[compost heap]]
* Hobbies
* Locating a [[greenhouse]], [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], [[shed]], [[workshop]], [[outhouse]], or [[Garage (residential)|garage]] (if access to  a [[road]] is possible)
* [[Party]]ing
* [[Wildlife refuge]] 
* Safe area for children
* Location of an [[air raid shelter]] such as the [[Anderson shelter]] of World War II&lt;ref name=PoH&gt;{{citation |pages=176–199 |chapter=Gardens and External Space |title=The Place of Home: English domestic environments, 1914-2000 |author=Alison Ravetz, Richard Turkington |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-419-17980-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, its functional and [[recreational]] use is so varied, that it cannot be easily categorised. Many of the freedoms of the use of the back garden come from the restrictions, social or legal of what are not done in the front.

Usually, clothes are not dried, vegetables are not grown, and sunbathing is not carried out in a front garden. All these can happen in the privacy of the back garden.

Traditionally, people treat a back garden as private to themselves, and not those they are neighbours to. The social etiquette of how one can greet and interact one's neighbours may be complex and defined by many informal social rules.

In some areas, talking to one's neighbours over the back wall (the side wall following the property boundary line) is usual, and is a welcome form of neighbourliness and in other places it is not.

[[image:Broad Fourteens delisle 1743.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Broad Fourteens on a map by Delisle (1743)]]
The '''Broad Fourteens''' is an area of the southern [[North Sea]] that is fairly consistently fourteen [[fathom]]s (84 feet/26 metres) deep. Thus, on a [[nautical chart]] with depths given in fathoms, a broad area with many "14" notations can be seen.

== Extent ==
The Broad Fourteens region is located off the coast of the [[Netherlands]] and south of the [[Dogger Bank]], roughly between longitude [[3rd meridian east|3°E]] and 4°30'E and latitude 52°30'N and 53°30'N.

The area is known to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Germany|German]] navies as the ''Breeveertien''.

Geologically it is comparable to the [[Long Forties]], another submerged plateau that has related origins.

== Naval Battles ==
The area has been the scene of many naval engagements throughout history.  For example:

* The torpedoing of three British cruisers in the [[Action of 22 September 1914]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corbett |first1=J S |title=Naval Operations |date=1938 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=London |isbn=1-84342-489-4 |pages=172-173 |edition=2nd repr. Imperial War Museum and Naval &amp; Military Press |url=https://archive.org/details/navaloperations01corb/page/172 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Navigation ==
The shallowness of this area means that the largest [[oil tanker]]s, when fully loaded cannot traverse the Broad Fourteens to reach the [[English Channel]] from the North Sea because their [[draft (hull)|draft]] is too deep.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5290">'''The cartography of Asia''' can refer to the representation of [[Asia]] on a [[map]], or to depictions of the world by [[Cartography|cartographers]] from Asia. Depictions of portions of Asia have existed on maps as early as the 6th century BCE, with maps being drafted to depict the [[Babylon|Babylonian]], [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greek]], and [[Han dynasty]] empires. 

During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Muslim geographers]] drew maps with more accurate depictions of [[South Asia|Southern]], [[Western Asia|Western]], and [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe|European]] maps began to more frequently represent Asia's landmass. [[Chinese geography]] from this period includes more detailed portrayals of the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Arabian Peninsula]], and [[East Africa]]. European maps of Asia would become much more accurate during the European [[Age of Discovery]], starting in the 15th century.

Modern maps of Asia make use of [[digitization]], photographic surveys, and [[satellite imagery]].[[File:Kashgari map.jpg|thumb|200px|Map from [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]]'s ''Diwanu Lughat at-Turk'', showing the 11th century distribution of Turkic tribes.]]

[[File:Iran e Bozorg2.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Asia, ca. 1719]]

== Antiquity ==
[[Babylon]] in [[Southwest Asia]] is at the center of the very [[ancient world maps|earliest world maps]], beginning with the [[Babylonian world map]] in the 6th century BCE; it is a [[clay tablet]] 'localized' [[Babylonian Map of the World|world map of Babylon]], rivers, encircling ocean, and terrain, surrounded by 'islands' in a 7-star format. In [[classical Greek geography]], "Asia" is one of three major landmasses, besides [[Europe]] and [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]. Asia is given higher resolution in Hellenistic geography, in particular on [[Ptolemy world map]]. [[Cartography of India]] begins with early charts for navigation&lt;ref name=Sircar3&gt;Sircar, page 330&lt;/ref&gt; and constructional plans for buildings.&lt;ref name=gole1990&gt;Gole 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese geography]] from the 2nd century BC ([[Han dynasty]]) becomes aware of [[Turkestan]], where Hellenistic Greek and Han Chinese spheres of influence overlap.

==Middle Ages==
In medieval [[T and O map]]s, Asia makes for half the world's landmass, with [[Africa]] and [[Europe]] accounting for a quarter each. With the [[High Middle Ages]], Southwest and Central Asia receive better resolution in [[Muslim geography]], and the 11th century map by [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] is the first world map drawn from a Central Asian point of view. In the same period, European explorers of the [[Silk road]] like [[William Rubruck]] and [[Marco Polo]] increase geographical knowledge of Asia in the west, in particular establishing that the [[Caspian Sea]] is not connected to the northern ocean.

[[Chinese exploration]] by medieval times extends Chinese geographical knowledge to the Indian Ocean, the Arabian peninsula and East Africa as well as Southeast Asia.

==Age of exploration==
{{further|Age  of Discovery}}
European maps of Asia become much more detailed from the 15th century, the 1459 [[Fra Mauro map]] showing a reasonable complete picture, including correctly placed Korea and Japan.

==Modern maps==
Modern map making techniques in Asia, like other parts of the world, employ [[digitization]], [[photograph|photographic survey]]s and [[printing]].&lt;ref name=ie99/&gt; [[Satellite imagery|Satellite imageries]], [[aerial photograph]]s and [[video|video surveying]] techniques  are also used.&lt;ref name=ie99&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990224/ige24144.html Indian Express (1999).

[[Image:belize36.jpg|right|thumb|Gathering oranges in [[Cayo District|Cayo]], [[Belize]]]]

'''Citrus fruits''' are the highest-value fruit crop in terms of international trade. There are two main [[Market (economics)|market]]s for [[citrus]] [[fruit]]:
* The fresh fruit market
* The processed citrus fruits market (mainly [[orange juice]])

[[orange (fruit)|Oranges]] account for the majority of citrus production but the industry also sees significant quantities of [[grapefruit]]s, [[pomelo]]es, [[lemon]]s, and [[lime (fruit)|lime]]s.

==History==
While the origin of citrus fruits cannot be precisely identified, researchers believe they began to appear in [[Southeast Asia]] at least 4,000 BC.  From there, they slowly spread to northern [[Africa]], mainly through migration and trade.  During the period of the [[Roman Empire]] demand by higher-ranking members of society, along with increased trade, allowed the fruits to spread to southern Europe.  Citrus fruits spread throughout Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], and were then brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers.  Worldwide trade in citrus fruits didn't appear until the 20th century and trade in orange juice developed as late as 1940.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|author=H. John Webber|year=1967|title=History and Development of the Citrus Industry|publisher=University of California Division of Agricultural Sciences|url=http://lib.ucr.edu/agnic/webber/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604204203/http://lib.ucr.edu/agnic/webber/|archivedate=2004-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume==
Total production and consumption of citrus fruit has grown strongly since the 1980s. Current annual worldwide citrus production is estimated at over 70 million [[ton]]s, with more than half of this being oranges{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.  According to the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), the rise in citrus production is mainly due to the increase in [[tillage|cultivation]] areas, improvements in transportation and packaging, rising incomes and [[consumer]] [[preference]] for healthy foods.

This trend was projected to change from 2000 to 2010 since the high production levels have slowed the rate of new plantings.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Countries involved==
&lt;!--needs tables for major citrus crops, too--&gt;

Citrus fruits are produced all over the world; according to [[UNCTAD]], as of 2004 there were 140 citrus-producing countries. Around 70% of the world's total citrus production is grown in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in particular countries around the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[United States]], although [[Brazil]] is the largest citrus producer. 

In the United States, most orange juice and grapefruit is produced in [[Florida]], while citrus fruits for consumption as fresh fruit are mainly grown in [[California]], [[Arizona]], and [[Texas]]. Smaller markets for citrus growth in the United States originate in [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Tennessee]], and the [[gulf coast]]al states, including [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as well as [[North Carolina]]. Independent cultivars are found in [[Kentucky]], [[Virginia]], and even [[Missouri]], Southern [[Illinois]], and far Southern [[Kansas]]. The farther north the range, the more seasonal the cultivation.&lt;ref name=us&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/citrus/2004%20Citrus.pdf |format=pdf |title=USDA - U.S and the World Situation: Citrus |author=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604113031/http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/citrus/2004%20Citrus.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Florida produces approximately 100 million boxes annually (each box is 90 lbs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez|first1=Marvin|title=Orange Juice Enters Bull Market With Biggest Rally Since ’98|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/orange-juice-enters-bull-market-with-biggest-rally-since-1998|accessdate=25 March 2015|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] could be a major player in the orange juice and processed citrus markets, except for high [[tariff]]s on citrus that make domestic sale more profitable.  Though citrus originated in southeast [[Asia]], current citrus production is low due to lower-than-average yields, high production and marketing costs, and disease.&lt;ref name=asia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnet.org/library/article/ac1996c.html |title=Citrus Production in Asia|author= Cheju Citrus Research Institute, Korea|publisher=Asian Studies on the Pacific Coast |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061007163603/http://www.agnet.org/library/article/ac1996c.html |archivedate = 2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citrus production in [[Europe]] continues to decline, although the [[clementine]]s produced by [[Spain]] are increasing in popularity among consumers.&lt;ref name=spread&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas H. Spreen|title=Projections of World Production and Consumption of Citrus to 2010|url=http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/003/X6732E/x6732e02.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oranges and orange juice==
About a third of citrus fruit production goes for processing: more than 80% of this is for orange juice production. Demand for fresh and processed oranges continues to rise in excess of production, especially in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Vange Salem&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main players are [[Florida]] in the United States and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in Brazil. Production of orange juice between these two makes up roughly 85% of the world market. Brazil exports 99 percent of its production, while 90 percent of Florida’s production is consumed in the United States.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Orange juice is traded internationally in the form of frozen concentrated orange juice to reduce the volume used, so that storage and transportation costs are lower.&lt;ref name=spread/&gt;

==Citrus canker==
{{main|Citrus canker}}

Citrus production is often cut short in many areas by outbreaks of bacteria known as ''Xanthomonas axonopodis'', or [[Citrus canker]], which cause unsightly lesions on all parts of the plant, affecting tree vitality and early drop of fruit.  While not harmful to human consumption, the fruit becomes too unsightly to be sold, and entire orchards are often destroyed to protect the outbreak from spreading.&lt;ref name="gottwald2002"&gt;Gottwald, T.R, Graham, J.H. and Schubert, J.S. (2002). [http://www.apsnet.org/online/feature/citruscanker/ "Citrus canker: The pathogen and its impact"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130101632/http://www.apsnet.org/online/feature/citruscanker/ |date=2007-11-30 }}. Online. ''Plant Health Progress'' {{doi|10.1094/PHP-2002-0812-01-RV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citrus canker affects all varieties of citrus trees, and recent outbreaks in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], and the [[United States]] have slowed citrus production in parts of those countries. Citrus leafminer moths are a major concern where citrus canker exists. The openings created by citrus leafminer make the tree highly susceptible to the ''X. axonopodis'' bacteria which leads to citrus canker.

==Citrus greening disease in Florida==

===Introductory and effects of disease===
Huanglongbing (HLB), called [[citrus greening]] within the industry, is recognized as the deadliest citrus disease the Florida citrus industry has ever faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shen |first1=W |last2=Crevallos-Crevallos |first2=J |last3=Nunes da Rocha |first3=U |last4=Arevalo |first4=H |last5=Stansly |first5=P |last6=Roberts |first6=P |last7=H.C. van Bruggen |first7=A |title=Relation Between Plant Nutrition, Hormones, Insecticide, Applications, Bacterial Endophytes, and Candidatus Liberibacter ct Values in Citrus Trees Infected with Huanglongbing |journal=Eur J Plant Pathol |date=2013 |issue=137 |pages=727–742}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to the economic costs of implementing new care-taking strategies, and overall tree loss creating a loss of revenues.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodges|first1=A|last2=Spreen|first2=T|title=Economic Impacts of Citrus Greening (HLB) in Florida, 2006/07-2010/11|journal=IFAS|date=2012|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A look at total Florida citrus-growing acreage provides a tangible impression to the hardships citrus greening provides; in 2000 there was 665,529 commercially producing citrus acres, while in 2011 there were 473,086 commercially producing citrus acres in Florida.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=D|last2=Richardson|first2=M|last3=El-Desouky|first3=A|last4=Halbert|first4=S|title=Asian Citrus Psyllid, Diaphorina Citri, Vector of Citrus Huanglongbing Disease|journal=Entomol. Exp. Appl.|date=2012|issue=146|pages=207–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year citrus reports indicate a continued loss of citrus production. Citrus greening is being attributed for a total output impact of -4.51 billion, and a loss of 8,257 jobs within Florida.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The disease has now spread throughout the entire state, and affects every Florida citrus grower.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gottwald|first1=T|last2=Graca|first2=J|last3=Bassanezi|first3=R|title=Citrus huanglongbing: The Pathogen and Its Impact|journal=Plant Health Progress|date=2007|issue=10|pages=1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease is spread through an insect vector, the [[Asian citrus psyllid]]. The psyllid was previously introduced into Florida in 1998. At this time citrus greening was never found within the state, thus the psyllids spread was left unchecked. By the time citrus greening had reached Florida psyllid populations were well established throughout the state of Florida. The first positive case of greening disease was in August 2005, when a greening positive citrus tree was discovered in Miami-Dade County. It was at this time the entire Florida citrus industry changed its citriculture practices overnight. Intensive pesticide applications, aggressive removal of citrus greening positive trees, and the complete switch from outdoor to indoor citrus nursery operations transpired.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Symptoms===
[[File:CitrusGreeningNegativevsPositive.JPG|thumb|400px|Negative citrus greening tree vs Positive citrus greening tree]]
Symptoms of citrus greening are numerous, and can be varied in citrus trees. A tree will develop yellow shoots instead of the expected deep green colors. The disease presents itself on the leaves by giving an asymmetrical blotchy-mottle appearance. This is the key diagnosing characteristic of citrus greening. On affected limbs, fruit tend to be lopsided. The fruit will also never ripen and have a sour taste, making them unmarketable for both juice and fresh fruit productions. In later stages of infection the tree will suffer from heavy leaf drop, high percentages of fruit drop, and deep twig die back. A greening positive citrus tree’s canopies will be airy due to the defoliation the disease causes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; After a tree becomes infected with citrus greening it becomes uneconomical and may die within 2–5 years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croxton|first1=S|last2=Stansly|first2=P|title=Metalized Polyethylene Mulch to Repel Asian Citrus Psyllid, Slow Spread of Huanglongbing and Improve Growth of New Citrus Plantings|journal=Pest Manag Sci|date=2013|issue=70|pages=318–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecology of spread===
Vector control of citrus greening began when the disease was first introduced in 2005. All commercial citrus growers are advised in applying two dormancy pesticide sprays. These broad-spectrum pesticide sprays are applied in winter when adult psyllid populations decline to almost exclusive overwintering adults. With this strategy, significant reductions of populations withhold for up to 6 months. This fact is crucial as it protects the spring flush, which accounts for over 70% of new leaves for the year, from the infectious psyllid attacks. The spring flush typically occurs 3 months past winter.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stansly|first1=P|last2=Arevalo|first2=H|last3=Qureshi|first3=J|last4=Jones|first4=M|last5=Hendricks|first5=K|last6=Roberts|first6=P|last7=Roka|first7=F|title=Vector control and foliar nutrition to maintain economic sustainability of bearing citrus in Florida groves affected by huanglongbing|journal=Pest Manag Sci|date=2013|issue=70|pages=415–426}}&lt;/ref&gt; More aggressive citrus grove care-takers may employ a wide host of pesticides to try to keep psyllid populations low yearround. These growers may spray pesticides up to 7 times a year rotating various pesticides to employ different modes of actions against the psyllid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiwari|first1=S|last2=Mann|first2=R|last3=Rogers|first3=M|last4=Stelinski|first4=L|title=Insecticide Resistance in Field Populations of Asian Citrus Psyllid in Florida|journal=Pest Manag Sci|date=2011|issue=67|pages=1258–1268}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in an attempt to prevent resistances of psyllids to the various pesticides. The spraying of pesticides is the only method of control for the citrus greening vector, the psyllid. It is impossible to kill all psyllids through pesticides, thus strategic timing of pesticide sprays are done to try and slow the gradual spread of HLB throughout the citrus grove. Unfortunately, at this time it is inevitable that a commercial citrus grove will reach 100 percent infection rates even with aggressive sprays.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===New care-taking strategies===
Productivity of a citrus groves can be retained at pre-Huanglongbing levels through a three pronged strategy. Current research is aimed at the goal of giving the greatest yields for the lowest costs. Indeed, these lower costs are necessitated by the increased per acre cost of caretaking brought upon by Huanglongbing infection. Huanglongbing forces the commercial citrus caretaker to spray his/her block of citrus many more times a year than normal, considerably increasing costs. Per pound prices of citrus must continue increasing for citrus to remain profitable due to disease pressure.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Foliar fertilizers are now being sprayed on citrus trees at considerably higher rates than before citrus greening disease. Inspiration for the mixture of foliar nutrients was drawn from a local citrus grower, Maury Boyd. Mr. Boyd was the first to try a strategy of not removing greening positive citrus trees, and instead attempt aggressive nutritional sprays. His grove was as a result the first to remain economical with a high percentage rate of greening disease infection. His spray program is under considerable research by the [[University of Florida]]’s [[Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences|IFAS department]]. Further research is still needed, and being carried out to determine which specific fertilizer compounds, and the quantities used are the most efficient.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Vector control of the psyllid, which is the sole means for citrus greening to spread is now done routinely. Before citrus greening disease was introduced, commercial citrus growers did not have to spray pesticides targeting insects. Current research is aimed at pesticide application timing, and pesticide choice for efficacy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

After the introduction of citrus greening disease, all commercial nurseries, where new young trees are purchased, were relocated indoors and a bud wood registration program was enacted. Previously young citrus trees were grown outdoors before disease pressure became an issue. This is to certify that Florida grove owners are able to purchase clean citrus trees for the planting of citrus groves. A greening positive young citrus tree will never reach maturity, even with intensive sprays.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

These three keystone citriculture practices vector control, foliar nutrition, and certified young trees make up the new best management practices for commercial citrus growers against the citrus greening disease fight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Citrus nutrition ==

=== Citrus macronutrients ===
Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus are the main macronutrients needed in citrus production, as well as Calcium, Magnesium and Sulfur.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citrus Plantmaster|last=|first=|publisher=Yara|year=2015|isbn=|location=Oslo, Norway|pages=30-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nitrogen ====
Nitrogen is important for overall tree and leaf growth and peel thickness, and fruit acidity. 

==== Phosphorus ====
Phosphorus improves root growth, fruit yield and weight and juice while it reduces peel thickness. 

==== Potassium ====
Potassium maintains fruit size, acidity, juice and disease tolerance, and it is taken up largely by the citrus fruit; too little K can lead to splitting and plugging of the fruit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Citrus micronutrients&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ===

==== Boron ====
Boron is involved in many enzymatic systems, when it is deficient, the tree suffers in fruit and leaf quality, and the tree loses apical dominance.  

==== Copper ====
Copper affects photosynthesis and fruit set. Deficiency causes drooping of shoots, "brown gum" eruptions, and death may occur from the tip. If copper based fungicides are used, this is not usually a problem. 

==== Iron ====
Acting as a catalyst for reactions, this element is a cofactor for many enzymes, important for sweetness, increasing total soluble solids and boosting vitamin C and juice content for fruit. Iron deficiency is the most common of the micronutrients, causing symptoms of increased prominence of leaf veins and leaves turning white. 

==== Manganese ====
Deficiency is associated with zinc and iron reductions as well, causing a mottled yellowing of the leaf, almost of a variegated quality. It improves overall sugar production in fruit juice.

[[Image:ClipperRoute.png|thumb|right|250px|The clipper route followed by ships sailing between England and Australia/New Zealand.]]
In [[sailing]], the '''clipper route''' was the traditional route derived from the [[Brouwer Route]] and sailed by [[clipper|clipper ships]] between [[Europe]] and the [[Far East]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].  The route ran from west to east through the [[Southern Ocean]], in order to make use of the strong westerly winds of the [[Roaring Forties]].  Many ships and sailors were lost in the heavy conditions along the route, particularly at [[Cape Horn]], which the clippers had to round on their return to Europe.

The clipper route fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of [[steamboat|steam ships]], and the opening of the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal]]s.  However, it remains the fastest sailing route around the world, and as such has been the route for several prominent [[yacht racing|yacht races]], such as the ''[[Around Alone]]'' and ''[[Vendée Globe]]''.

== Australia and New Zealand ==
[[File:Unidentified tall ship near Cape Horn - Nla.pic-vn3299637-v.jpg|thumb|right|Unidentified ship rounding Cape Horn]] 
The clipper route from [[England]] to Australia and New Zealand, returning via [[Cape Horn]], offered captains the fastest [[circumnavigation]] of the world, and hence potentially the greatest rewards; many grain, wool and gold clippers sailed this route, returning home with valuable cargos in a relatively short time.  However, this route, passing south of the three [[great capes]] and running for much of its length through the [[Southern Ocean]], also carried the greatest risks, exposing ships to the hazards of fierce winds, huge waves, and [[iceberg]]s.  This combination of the fastest ships, the highest risks, and the greatest rewards combined to give this route a particular aura of romance and drama.&lt;ref name=Chichester&gt;{{cite book |title=Along the Clipper Way |first=Francis |last=Chichester |pages=15–16 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |year=1966 |isbn=0-340-00191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outbound ===

This route ran from England down the east [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Equator]], crossing at about the position of [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]], around [[20th meridian west|20 degrees west]].  A good sailing time for the {{convert|3275|mi|km}} to this point would have been around 21 days; however, an unlucky ship could spend an additional three weeks crossing the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|doldrums]].&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pages 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The route then ran south through the western South Atlantic, following the natural circulation of winds and currents, passing close to [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Trindade]], then curving south-east past [[Tristan da Cunha]].&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The route crossed the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]] at about [[40th parallel south|40 degrees south]], taking the clippers into the [[Roaring Forties]] after about {{convert|6500|mi|km}} sailed from [[Plymouth]].  A good time for this run would have been about 43 days.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pages 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once into the forties, a ship was also inside the ice zone, the area of the Southern Ocean where there was a significant chance of encountering [[iceberg]]s.  Safety would dictate keeping to the north edge of this zone, roughly along the parallel of [[40th parallel south|40 degrees south]]; however, the [[great circle]] route from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Australia, curving down to [[60th parallel south|60 degrees south]], is {{convert|1000|mi|km}} shorter, and would also offer the strongest winds.  Ship's masters would therefore go as far south as they dared, weighing the risk of ice against a fast passage.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pages 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clipper ships bound for Australia and New Zealand would call at a variety of ports.  A ship sailing from Plymouth to [[Sydney]], for example, would cover around {{convert|13750|mi|km}}; a fast time for this passage would be around 100 days.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' made the fastest passage on this route by a clipper, in 72 days.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Thermopylae (clipper)|Thermopylae]]'' made the slightly shorter passage from London to [[Melbourne]], {{convert|13150|mi|km}}, in just 61 days in 1868–69.&lt;ref name="Along the Clipper Way; page 68"&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following map traces the outbound route of the 1874 voyage from [[London]] to [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], of the clipper ship ''[[City of Adelaide (1864)|City of Adelaide]]'', which today is the world's oldest surviving clipper ship. The latitudes and longitudes are obtained from the surviving diary of 21-year-old passenger James McLauchlan.&lt;ref name=JMdiary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org/wiki/Diary_of_James_McLauchlan |title=Diary of James Anderson McLauchlan |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homeward ===

The return passage continued east from Australia; ships stopping at [[Wellington]] would pass through the [[Cook Strait]], but otherwise this tricky passage was avoided, with ships passing instead around the south end of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again, eastbound ships would be running more or less within the ice zone, staying as far south as possible for the shortest route and strongest winds.  Most ships stayed north of the latitude of Cape Horn, at [[56th parallel south|56 degrees south]], following a southward dip in the ice zone as they approached the Horn.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horn itself had, and still has, an infamous reputation among sailors.  The strong winds and currents which flow perpetually around the Southern Ocean without interruption are funnelled by the Horn into the relatively narrow [[Drake Passage]]; coupled with turbulent cyclones coming off the [[Andes]], and the shallow water near the Horn, this combination of factors can create violently hazardous conditions for ships.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pages 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those ships which survived the Horn then made the passage back up the Atlantic, following the natural wind circulation up the eastern South Atlantic and more westerly in the North Atlantic.  A good run for the {{convert|14750|mi|km}} from Sydney to Plymouth would be around 100 days; ''Cutty Sark'' made it in 84 days, and ''Thermopylae'' in 77 days.&lt;ref name="Along the Clipper Way; page 68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pages 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Lightning (clipper)|Lightning]]'' made the longer passage from Melbourne to Liverpool in 65 days in 1854–55, completing a circumnavigation of the world in 5 months, 9 days, which included 20 days spent in port.&lt;ref&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The later [[windjammer]]s, which were usually large four-masted barques optimized on cargo and handling rather than running, usually made the voyage in 90 to 105 days. The fastest recorded time on Great Grain Races was on Finnish four-masted [[barque]] ''Parma'', 83 days in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pamir.chez-alice.fr/Voiliers/Classe_A/Grainwe.htm |title=The Grain Races: Pamir and Parma |publisher=Philippe Bellamit |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her master on the voyage was the Finnish captain Ruben de Cloux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Visual Encyclopedia of Nautical Terms under Sail |publisher=Crown Publishers |location=New York |year=1978 |chapter=section 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following map traces the homeward route of the 1867 voyage from Adelaide to London of the clipper ship ''City of Adelaide''. The latitudes and longitudes were obtained from the surviving diary of 15-year-old passenger [[Frederick Bullock]].&lt;ref name=FBdiary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org/wiki/Diary_of_Frederick_Bullock |title=Diary of Frederick Bullock |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A visual comparison of this map with the previous map shows that the ''City of Adelaide'' travelled a figure-of-eight route around the North and South [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, following the natural circulation of winds and currents. On other homeward voyages the ''City of Adelaide'' sometimes travelled around [[Cape Horn]].&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org/wiki/Wilcox_Family |title=Wilcox Family |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A2L1878&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org/wiki/Voyage_to_London_in_1878 |title=Voyage to London in 1878 |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StateLibQld 1 100620.jpg|right|thumb|225px|S. V. ''Garthneill'']]
The route sailed by a sailing ship was always heavily dictated by the wind conditions, which are generally reliable from the west in the forties and fifties.  Even here, however, winds are variable, and the precise route and distance sailed would depend on the conditions on a particular voyage.  Ships in the deep Southern Ocean could find themselves faced with persistent headwinds, or even becalmed.

Sailing ships attempting to go against the route, however, could have even greater problems.  In 1922, ''Garthwray'' attempted to sail west around the Horn carrying cargo from the [[Firth of Forth]] to [[Iquique]], [[Chile]].  After two attempts to round the Horn the "wrong way", her master gave up and sailed east instead, reaching Chile from the other direction.&lt;ref name=atcw-72&gt;''Along the Clipper Way''; pages 72–73., quoted from ''Falmouth for Orders'' by Alan Villiers&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more remarkable was the voyage of ''Garthneill'' in 1919.  Attempting to sail from Melbourne to [[Bunbury, Western Australia]], a distance of {{convert|2000|mi|km}}, she was unable to make way against the forties winds south of Australia, and was faced by strong westerly winds again when she attempted to pass through the [[Torres Strait]] to the north.  She finally turned and sailed the other way, passing the Pacific, Cape Horn, the Atlantic, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Indian Ocean to finally arrive in Bunbury after 76 days at sea.&lt;ref name=atcw-72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dehaa.sa.gov.au//heritage/ships_graveyards/pdfs/garthneill.pdf ''Garthneill – Garden Island''], from the [http://www.dehaa.sa.gov.au/ South Australia department of Environment and Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210040654/http://www.dehaa.sa.gov.au/ |date=2005-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth pointing out that the first person to [[Sailing Alone Around the World|circumnavigate the world solo]], [[Joshua Slocum]] in the [[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]], did it rounding Cape Horn from east to west.  His was not the fastest circumnavigation on record, and he took more than one try to get through Cape Horn.

== Modern use of the route ==

The introduction of [[steamboat|steam ships]], and the opening of the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal]]s, spelled the demise of the clipper route as a major trade route.  However, it remains the fastest sailing route around the world, and so the growth in recreational long-distance sailing has brought about a revival of sailing on the route.

The first person to attempt a high-speed circumnavigation of the clipper route was [[Francis Chichester]].  Chichester was already a notable aviation pioneer, who had flown solo from London to Sydney, and also a pioneer of [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] [[yacht racing]], being one of the founders of the [[Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race]] (the ''OSTAR'').  After the success of the ''OSTAR'', Chichester started looking into a clipper-route circumnavigation.  He wanted to make the fastest ever circumnavigation in a small boat, but specifically set himself the goal of beating a "fast" clipper-ship passage of 100 days to Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;''Gipsy Moth Circles the World'', Sir Francis Chichester; page 6.  International Marine, 2001.  {{ISBN|0-07-136449-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He set off in 1966, and completed the run to Sydney in 107 days; after a stop of 48 days, he returned via Cape Horn in 119 days.&lt;ref&gt;''Gipsy Moth Circles the World''; page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gipsy Moth Circles the World''; page 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chichester's success inspired several others to attempt the next logical step: a non-stop single-handed circumnavigation along the clipper route.  The result was the [[Sunday Times Golden Globe Race]], which was not only the first single-handed round-the world yacht race, but in fact the first round-the world yacht race in any format.  Possibly the strangest yacht race ever run, it culminated in a successful non-stop circumnavigation by just one competitor, [[Robin Knox-Johnston]], who became the first person to sail the clipper route single-handed and non-stop. However [[Bernard Moitessier]] decided to withdraw from the race after rounding Cape Horn in a promising position. Instead of heading home to Europe he decided to continue to [[Tahiti]], completing his circumnavigation south of Cape Town and doing actual one and a half&lt;!--????--&gt; when arriving in [[Papeete]].

Today, there are several major races held regularly along the clipper route.  The [[Volvo Ocean Race]] is a crewed race with stops which sails the clipper route every four years.  Two single-handed races, inspired by Chichester and the Golden Globe race, are the ''[[Around Alone]]'', which circumnavigates with stops, and the ''[[Vendée Globe]]'', which is non-stop.

In March 2005, [[Bruno Peyron]] and crew on the [[catamaran]] ''[[Orange II]]'' set a new world record for a circumnavigation by the clipper route, of 50 days, 16 hours, 20 minutes and 4 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yachtsandyachting.com/news/?article=16425 ''Orange II smashes the round the world sailing record''], from Yachts and Yachting&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, [[Ellen MacArthur]] set a new world record for a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation in the trimaran ''B&amp;Q/Castorama''.  Her time along the clipper route of 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes 33 seconds is the fastest ever circumnavigation of the world by a single-hander.&lt;ref name="WSSRC Ratified Passage Records"&gt;[http://www.sailspeedrecords.com/content/view/19/21 ''WSSRC Ratified Passage Records''] – "Round the World, non stop, singlehanded", from the [[World Sailing Speed Record Council]]&lt;/ref&gt;  While this record still leaves MacArthur as the fastest female singlehanded circumnavigator, in 2008 [[Francis Joyon]] eclipsed that record in the trimaran ''IDEC'' with a time of 57 days, 13 hours, 34 minutes 6 seconds.&lt;ref name="WSSRC Ratified Passage Records"/&gt;

Colombia shares a border to the northwest with [[Panama]], to the east with [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]] and to the south with [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="Land borders" /&gt; It shares its maritime limits with [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="Maritime borders" /&gt; The [[sovereign state]] of Colombia is a [[Unitary state|unitary]], constitutional [[republic]] comprising thirty-two [[Departments of Colombia|departments]].

Colombia has been inhabited by various [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous peoples]] since 12,000 BCE, including the [[Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and the [[Tairona]]. The Spanish arrived in 1499 and by the mid-16th century [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|conquered and colonized]] much of the region, establishing the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], with [[Bogotá|Santafé de Bogotá]] as its capital. [[Spanish American wars of independence|Independence]] from [[Spain]] was achieved in 1819, but by 1830 the "[[Gran Colombia]]" Federation was dissolved, with what is now Colombia and Panama emerged as the [[Republic of New Granada]]. The new nation experimented with federalism as the [[Granadine Confederation]] (1858), and then the [[United States of Colombia]] (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|Panama seceded]] in 1903. Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]], which escalated in the 1990s but then decreased from 2005 onward.&lt;ref name="Enough Already!" /&gt;

Colombia is one of the most [[Race and ethnicity in Colombia|ethnically]] and [[Languages of Colombia|linguistically]] diverse countries in the world, with its rich [[cultural heritage]] reflecting various European, Middle Eastern, African, and indigenous influences. Its urban centres are mostly located in the highlands of the [[Andean natural region|Andes mountains]] and the Caribbean coast.

Colombian territory also encompasses [[Amazon natural region|Amazon rainforest]], [[Orinoquía natural region|tropical grassland]] and both [[Caribbean natural region|Caribbean]] and [[Pacific/Chocó natural region|Pacific]] coastlines. Subsequently, it is one of the world's 17 [[megadiverse countries]], and the most densely [[Biodiversity of Colombia|biodiverse]] of these per square kilometer.&lt;ref name="Biodiversity of Colombia" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Christopher Columbus Face.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|''Colombia'' is named after [[Christopher Columbus]]]]
The name "Colombia" is derived from the last name of [[Christopher Columbus]] ({{lang-it|Cristoforo Colombo}}, {{lang-es|Cristóbal Colón}}). It was conceived by the Venezuelan revolutionary [[Francisco de Miranda]] as a reference to all the New World, but especially to those portions under Spanish rule (by then from Mississippi river to Patagonia). The name was later adopted by the [[Greater Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] of 1819, formed from the territories of the old [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (modern-day Colombia, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, and northwest Brazil).&lt;ref name="LABLAA5"&gt;{{cite web|author=Carlos Restrepo Piedrahita|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/febrero1992/febrero2.htm|title=El nombre "Colombia", El único país que lleva el nombre del Descubrimiento|work=Revista Credencial|date=February 1992|accessdate=29 February 2008|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Venezuela, Ecuador and [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]] came to exist as independent states, the former [[Cundinamarca Province|Department of Cundinamarca]] adopted the name "[[Republic of New Granada]]". New Granada officially changed its name in 1858 to the [[Granadine Confederation]]. In 1863 the name was again changed, this time to [[United States of Colombia]], before finally adopting its present name – the Republic of Colombia – in 1886.&lt;ref name="LABLAA5" /&gt;

To refer to this country, the Colombian government uses the terms ''Colombia'' and ''República de Colombia''.

Owing to its location, the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human migration from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the [[Andes]] and [[Amazon basin]]. The oldest archaeological finds are from the [[Pubenza archaeological site|Pubenza]] and [[El Totumo archaeological site|El Totumo]] sites in the Magdalena Valley {{convert|100|km|mi}} southwest of Bogotá.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correal|first=Urrego G.|title=Nuevas evidencias culturales pleistocenicas y megafauna en Colombia|journal=Boletin de Arqueologia|year=1993|issue=8|pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites date from the [[Paleoindian]] period (18,000–8000&amp;nbsp;BCE). At [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]] and other sites, traces from the [[Archaic period in South America|Archaic Period]] (~8000–2000&amp;nbsp;BCE) have been found. Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of [[El Abra]] and [[Tequendama (archaeological site)|Tequendama]] in [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]]. The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas, found at [[San Jacinto archaeological site|San Jacinto]], dates to 5000–4000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1717 the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] was originally created, and then it was temporarily removed, to finally be reestablished in 1739. The Viceroyalty had Santa Fé de Bogotá as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalties of New Spain]] or [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and correspond mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama.

The 18th-century priest, botanist and mathematician [[José Celestino Mutis]] was delegated by Viceroy [[Antonio Caballero y Góngora]] to conduct an inventory of the nature of the New Granada.

Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization, there were several rebel movements against Spanish rule, but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation. The last one that sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the [[Colombian Declaration of Independence]], issued on 20 July 1810, a day which is now celebrated as the nation's Independence Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/07/20/colombia/1500541945_902382.html |title=Independencia de Colombia: ¿por qué se celebra el 20 de julio? |trans-title=Independence of Colombia: Why is it celebrated on 20 July? |date=20 July 2017 |work=El País |access-date=18 July 2018 |language=es |issn=1134-6582 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement followed the independence of [[St. Domingue]] (present-day Haiti) in 1804, which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion: [[Simón Bolívar]].

Soon after, Colombia achieved some degree of political stability, which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s, a period known as ''[[La Violencia]]'' ("The Violence"). Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties, which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]] on 9 April 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El Bogotazo: Memorias Del Olvido |author=Alape, Arturo |publisher=Fundación Universidad Central |year=1983 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mataron a Gaitán: vida pública y violencia urbana en Colombia |author=Braun, Herbert |publisher=[[National University of Colombia|Universidad Nacional de Colombia]], Centro Editorial |year=1987 |isbn=9789581700066 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing riots in Bogotá, known as [[El Bogotazo]], spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Charles Bergquist |author2=David J.

Colombia entered the [[Korean War]] when [[Laureano Gómez]] was elected president. It was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the United States. Particularly important was the resistance of the Colombian troops at [[Battle of Old Baldy|Old Baldy]].&lt;ref name="Colombia's legacy with Korea"&gt;{{cite web |title=Colombia y los Estados Unidos en la Guerra de Corea |author1=Carlos Horacio Urán |publisher=The Kellogg Institute for International Studies |year=1986 |url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/publications/workingpapers/WPS/069.pdf |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The violence between the two political parties decreased first when [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla|Gustavo Rojas]] deposed the [[Laureano Gómez|President]] of Colombia in a coup d'état and negotiated with the guerrillas, and then under the [[Colombian Military Junta|military junta]] of General [[Gabriel París]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El golpe de Rojas y el poder de los militares |publisher=scielo.org.co |url=http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/folios/n31/n31a03.pdf |author=Atehortúa Cruz, Adolfo León |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ayala Diago, César Augusto |year=2000 |title=Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, 100 años, 1900–1975 |publisher=[[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Banco de la República]] |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/marzo2000/123gustavo.htm |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rojas' deposition, the Colombian Conservative Party and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]], a coalition which would jointly govern the country. Under the deal, the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 1957–1974 El Frente Nacional|publisher= Revista Credencial Historia|year= 2006|url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/septiembre2006/frente.htm|author = Alarcón Núñez, Óscar|language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Front ended "La Violencia", and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the [[Alliance for Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;ROJAS, Diana Marcela.

[[File:Mapa de Colombia (relieve).svg|upright=1.05|thumb|Relief map]]
The geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main [[Natural regions of Colombia|natural regions]] that present their own unique characteristics, from the [[Andes|Andes mountain range]] region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela; the [[Pacific Coast|Pacific coastal region]] shared with Panama and Ecuador; the Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama; the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'' (plains) shared with Venezuela; the [[Amazon Rainforest]] region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador; to the [[Insular Region (Colombia)|insular area]], comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.&lt;ref name="Geography of Colombia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.colombia-sa.com/geografia/geografia-in.html|title= Natural regions of Colombia and description of the three branches of the andes cordillera|publisher = colombia-sa.com |accessdate= 7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombia is bordered to the northwest by [[Panama]]; to the east by [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]]; to the south by [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]];&lt;ref name = "Land borders"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/politica/fronteras-terrestres|title= The Republic of Colombia shares land borders with five (5) countries |publisher = cancilleria.gov.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; it established its maritime boundaries with neighboring countries through seven agreements on the Caribbean Sea and three on the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name = "Maritime borders"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/en/politica/fronteras-maritimas|title= Maritime borders|publisher = cancilleria.gov.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12°N]] and [[4th parallel south|4°S]], and longitudes [[67th meridian west|67°]] and [[79th meridian west|79°W]].

Most of Colombia's population centers are located in these interior highlands. Beyond the [[Colombian Massif]] (in the south-western departments of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] and [[Nariño Department|Nariño]]) these are divided into three branches known as ''cordilleras'' (mountain ranges): the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]], running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]]; the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]], running between the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] and [[Magdalena River]] valleys (to the west and east respectively) and including the cities of [[Medellín]], [[Manizales]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] and [[Armenia, Quindío|Armenia]]; and the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]], extending north east to the [[Guajira Peninsula]] and including Bogotá, [[Bucaramanga]] and [[Cúcuta]].&lt;ref name="Geography of Colombia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="populationbyregions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Population density"/&gt;

Peaks in the Cordillera Occidental exceed {{convert|4700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental they reach {{convert|5000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. At {{convert|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.&lt;ref name="Geography of Colombia"/&gt;

East of the Andes lies the [[savanna]] of the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'', part of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River basin]], and, in the far south east, the [[jungle]] of the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 6% of the population. To the north the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]], home to 21.9% of the population and the location of the major port cities of [[Barranquilla]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks ([[Pico Cristóbal Colón]] and [[Pico Simón Bolívar]]), and the [[La Guajira Desert]]. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous [[Pacific Region of Colombia|Pacific coastal lowlands]], backed by the [[Baudó Mountains|Serranía de Baudó]] mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]].&lt;ref name="Geography of Colombia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="populationbyregions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Population density"/&gt;

The main rivers of Colombia are [[Magdalena River|Magdalena]], [[Cauca River|Cauca]], [[Guaviare River|Guaviare]], [[Atrato River|Atrato]], [[Meta River|Meta]], [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]] and [[Caquetá River|Caquetá]]. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. The [[Orinoco]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.&lt;ref name="Hydrography"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.colombia-sa.com/geografia/geografia-in-2.html|title= Hydrography of Colombia|publisher = colombia-sa.com |accessdate= 7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Colombia}}
The climate of Colombia is characterized for being [[tropical]] presenting variations within [[Natural regions of Colombia|six natural regions]] and depending on the altitude, temperature, [[humidity]], [[wind]]s and [[rainfall]].&lt;ref name="Thermal floors"/&gt; The diversity of climate zones in Colombia is characterized for having [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[steppe]]s, [[desert]]s and mountain climate.

[[Mountain climate]] is one of the unique features of the Andes and other high altitude reliefs where climate is determined by elevation. Below {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation is the [[tierra caliente|warm altitudinal zone]], where [[temperature]]s are above {{convert|24|°C|°F|1}}. About 82.5% of the country's total area lies in the warm altitudinal zone. The [[tierra templada|temperate climate altitudinal zone]] located between {{convert|1001|and|2000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} is characterized for presenting an average temperature ranging between {{convert|17|and|24|°C|°F|1}}. The [[tierra fría|cold climate]] is present between {{convert|2001|and|3000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and the temperatures vary between {{convert|12|and|17|°C|°F|1}}. Beyond the cold land lie the alpine conditions of the forested zone and then the treeless grasslands of the [[páramo]]s.

The Colombian military is divided into three branches: the [[National Army of Colombia]]; the [[Colombian Air Force]]; and the [[Colombian Navy]]. The National Police functions as a [[gendarmerie]], operating independently from the military as the law enforcement agency for the entire country. Each of these operates with their own intelligence apparatus separate from the [[National Intelligence Directorate (Colombia)|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DNI, in Spanish).&lt;ref name="The Colombian military"&gt;{{cite web|title= Colombian Constitution of 1991 (TITLE VII: The Executive Branch – Chapter VII: The Public Force)|language=Spanish |publisher=  banrepcultural.org|accessdate=20 May 2017 |url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/derecho/constitucion-politica-de-colombia-1991/titulo-7-capitulo-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Departments of Colombia|Municipalities of Colombia}}
{{See also|List of cities in Colombia|Corregimientos of Colombia}}
Colombia is divided into 32 [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] and one [[Bogotá|capital district]], which is treated as a department (Bogotá also serves as the capital of the [[Cundinamarca Department|department of Cundinamarca]]). Departments are subdivided into [[Municipalities of Colombia|municipalities]], each of which is assigned a municipal seat, and municipalities are in turn subdivided into ''[[Corregimientos of Colombia|corregimientos]]'' in rural areas and into ''[[Comunas of Colombia|comunas]]'' in urban areas. Each department has a local government with a governor and assembly directly elected to four-year terms, and each municipality is headed by a mayor and council. There is a popularly elected local administrative board in each of the ''corregimientos'' or ''comunas''.&lt;ref name="Administrative divisions"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dane.gov.co/Divipola/|title= Codificación de la División Político-Administrativa de Colombia (Divipola)|language= Spanish|publisher= dane.gov.co|accessdate= 15 March 2014|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140209012507/http://dane.gov.co/Divipola/|archivedate= 9 February 2014|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concerning the territorial organization"&gt;Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title XI – Concerning the territorial organization)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title XI – Concerning the territorial organization – Chapter 3 – Concerning the municipal regime – Article 318)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Herrera Llanos|first= W |year= 2011|title= Régimen municipal en Colombia (Continuación del tema sobre Organización Territorial)|publisher= Universidad del Norte|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the capital four other cities have been designated [[Districts of Colombia|districts]] (in effect special municipalities), on the basis of special distinguishing features. These are [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Santa Marta]] and [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]]. Some departments have local administrative subdivisions, where towns have a large concentration of population and municipalities are near each other (for example in Antioquia and Cundinamarca). Where departments have a low population (for example Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada), special administrative divisions are employed, such as "department ''corregimientos''", which are a hybrid of a municipality and a ''corregimiento''.&lt;ref name="Administrative divisions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Concerning the territorial organization"/&gt;

Colombia's [[market economy]] grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a [[recession]] in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the [[Great Depression]]), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|highest rates of growth]] in Latin America.&lt;ref name="Colombia's GDP growth"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/countries/CO?display=graph|title= Colombia's GDP growth|publisher= World Bank|accessdate = 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[International Monetary Fund]] estimates, in 2012 Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500&amp;nbsp;billion ([[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|28th in the world]] and third in South America).

The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] ''campesinos'' (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian [[chiefdoms]]. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Bushnell &amp; Hudson, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 census reported that the "non-ethnic population", consisting of [[White Colombian|whites]] and [[Mestizo Colombian|mestizos]] (those of mixed white European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population. 10.6% is of [[Afro-Colombian|African]] ancestry. [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous Amerindians]] comprise 3.4% of the population. 0.01% of the population are [[Romani people|Roma]]. An extraofficial estimate considers that the 49% of the Colombian population is [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, and that approximately 37% is [[White Colombian|White]], mainly of [[Spanish immigration to Colombia|Spanish]] lineage, but there is also a large population of [[Arab Colombians|Middle East]] descent; in some sectors of society there is a considerable input of [[Italian Colombian|Italian]] and [[German Colombian|German]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="The Society and Its Environment"/&gt;

Colombian art has over 3,000 years of history. Colombian artists have captured the country's changing political and cultural backdrop using a range of styles and mediums. There is archeological evidence of ceramics being produced earlier in Colombia than anywhere else in the Americas, dating as early as 3,000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="donquijote.org"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.donquijote.org/culture/colombia/art/ |publisher= donquijote.org | title= Colombian Art|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "artecolombiano"&gt;{{cite book|title= El arte colombiano.

The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/gold-museum/tumaco |publisher= banrepcultural.org | title= Tumaco: People and Gold on the Pacific Coast|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pacific coast and date to around 325&amp;nbsp;BCE. Roughly between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE and 800 CE, the [[San Agustín, Huila|San Agustín culture]], masters of [[Stonemasonry|stonecutting]], entered its "classical period". They erected raised [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] centres, [[sarcophagi]], and large stone [[monolith]]s depicting [[anthropomorphic]] and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphhic]] forms out of [[Rock (geology)|stone]].&lt;ref name = "artecolombiano"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "San Agustín"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/744|publisher= UNESCO| title= San Agustín Archaeological Park|accessdate= 22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian art has followed the trends of the time, so during the 16th to 18th centuries, [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish Catholicism]] had a huge influence on Colombian art, and the popular [[baroque]] style was replaced with [[rococo]] when the Bourbons ascended to the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/ext/ext13.htm#12b|publisher= banrepcultural.org|title= El espíritu barroco en el arte colonial|author = Marta Fajardo De Rueda|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/junio2001/joaquin.htm|publisher= banrepcultural.org|title= Joaquín Gutiérrez, el "pintor de los virreyes": Expresión del estilo rococó en la Nueva Granada|author = Uribe Restrepo, Fernando|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Colombian artists [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martínez Delgado]] started the Colombian Murial Movement in the 1940s, featuring the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] features of [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref name="donquijote.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "artecolombiano"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/biografias/gomepedr.htm|publisher= banrepcultural.org|title= Pedro Nel Gómez Agudelo|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Miradas a la plástica colombiana de 1900 a 1950: un debate histórico y estético|author1= Luz Guillermina Sinning Téllez|author2 = Ruth Nohemí Acuña Prieto|publisher= U.

Since the 1950s, the Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing traditional elements under the concepts of the 20th century. Examples of this are the Greiff [[portrait]]s by [[Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo]], showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his [[paradigm]]atic "Naturaleza muerta en silencio" (silent dead nature), combines geometrical [[Abstraction (art)|abstraction]] and [[cubism]]. [[Alejandro Obregón]] is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] and [[Expressionism|expressionist]] use of animals, (specially the [[Andean condor]]).&lt;ref name = "artecolombiano"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iadb.org/EXR/cultural/catalogues/Colombia/spabeggining1.htm|publisher= iadb.org|title= Puntos de partida en el arte contemporáneo de Colombia|language= Spanish|accessdate= 9 May 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160416052215/http://www.iadb.org/EXR/cultural/catalogues/Colombia/spabeggining1.htm|archive-date= 16 April 2016|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.banrepcultural.org/coleccion-de-arte-banco-de-la-republica/cl%C3%A1sicos-experimentales-y-radicales-1950-%E2%80%93-1980|publisher= banrepcultural.org|title= Clásicos, experimentales y radicales 1950 – 1980|author1 = Carmen María Jaramillo|author2= Sylvia Suárez|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernando Botero]], [[Omar Rayo]], [[Enrique Grau]], [[Édgar Negret]], [[David Manzur]], [[Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt]], [[Oscar Murillo (artist)|Oscar Murillo]], [[Doris Salcedo]] and [[Oscar Muñoz (artist)|Oscar Muñoz]] are some of the Colombian artists featured at the international level.&lt;ref name="donquijote.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Arte en Colombia, 1981–2006|author = Carlos Arturo Fernández|publisher= Universidad de Antioquia|isbn = 9789587140170|year= 2007|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=D8bHJutOqqwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Geografía del arte en Colombia.

The Colombian sculpture from the sixteenth to 18th centuries was mostly devoted to [[Religious art|religious depictions]] of ecclesiastic art, strongly influenced by the Spanish schools of [[sacred]] sculpture. During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians and public figures, in a plain [[neoclassicist]] trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.academia.edu/2074247/Pietro_Tenerani_y_la_escultura_en_Colombia_en_el_siglo_XIX|publisher= academia.edu|title= Pietro Tenerani y la escultura en Colombia en el siglo XIX|author = Carolina Vanegas Carrasco |language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.&lt;ref name = "artecolombiano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colombian sculptors"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.colombia.com/cultura/resenas/escultura.asp |title= Colombian sculptors|publisher = colombia.com|language = Spanish|accessdate= 9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian photography was marked by the arrival of the [[daguerreotype]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros]] was who brought the daguerreotype process to Colombia in 1841.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Colombian cuisine}}
[[File:Sancocho de gallina criolla.jpg|thumb|Sancocho de gallina criolla is a traditional soup in Colombia.]]

Colombia's varied cuisine is influenced by its diverse fauna and flora as well as the cultural traditions of the ethnic groups. Colombian dishes and ingredients vary widely by region. Some of the most common ingredients are: cereals such as rice and maize; tubers such as potato and [[cassava]]; assorted [[legume]]s; meats, including beef, chicken, pork and goat; fish; and seafood.&lt;ref name="Paseo de olla"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.mincultura.gov.co/Sitios/patrimonio/bibliotecas-de-cocinas/tomos/tomo10.pdf |title= Paseo de olla.

The overall [[life expectancy]] in Colombia at birth is 74.8 years (71.2 years for males and 78.4 years for females).&lt;ref name="Life expectancy at birth"/&gt; Health standards in Colombia have improved very much since the 1980s, healthcare reforms have led to the massive improvements in the healthcare systems of the country. Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 96% in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/colombia/noticias/ministra-dice-cobertura-en-salud-fue-96|title = Ministra de Salud dice que la cobertura en este sector subió al 96%|language=Spanish|accessdate = 18 August 2013 |publisher= elpais.com.co}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health equity|health disparities]] persist.

Through [[Medical tourism|health tourism]], many people from over the world travel from their places of residence to other countries in search of medical treatment and the attractions in the countries visited. Colombia is projected as one of Latin America's main destinations in terms of health tourism due to the quality of its [[health care professional]]s, a good number of institutions devoted to health, and an immense inventory of natural and architectural sites. Cities such as Bogotá, Cali, Medellín and Bucaramanga are the most visited in [[cardiology]] procedures, [[neurology]], [[dental treatment]]s, [[stem cell therapy]], [[Otorhinolaryngology|ENT]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[joint replacement]]s because of the quality of medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/colombia|publisher = mymedholiday.com |title= Colombia Medical Tourism |accessdate= 8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Colombia}}
[[File:UNAL-Bloque M5-Facultad de Minas-Medellin2.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|M5 building – [[National University of Colombia]], designed by [[Pedro Nel Gómez]]]]
[[File:Universidad de los Andes (3326108271).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Mario Laserna Building – [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)|University of Los Andes]]]]
The educational experience of many Colombian children begins with attendance at a [[preschool]] academy until age five (''Educación preescolar''). Basic education (''Educación básica'') is compulsory by law.&lt;ref&gt;Colombian Constitution of 1991 (Title II – Concerning rights, guarantees, and duties – Chapter 2 – Concerning social, economic and cultural rights – Article 67)&lt;/ref&gt; It has two stages: Primary basic education (''Educación básica primaria'') which goes from first to fifth grade – children from six to ten years old, and Secondary basic education (''Educación básica secundaria''), which goes from sixth to ninth grade. Basic education is followed by Middle vocational education (''Educación media vocacional'') that comprises the tenth and eleventh grades. It may have different vocational training modalities or specialties (academic, technical, business, and so on.) according to the curriculum adopted by each school.&lt;ref name="sistema educativo"/&gt;

After the successful completion of all the basic and middle education years, a [[high-school diploma]] is awarded. The high-school graduate is known as a  ''bachiller'', because secondary basic school and middle education are traditionally considered together as a unit called ''bachillerato'' (sixth to eleventh grade). Students in their final year of middle education take the [[ICFES Examination|ICFES test]] (now renamed Saber 11) in order to gain access to higher education (''Educación superior''). This higher education includes undergraduate professional studies, technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies. Technical professional institutions of Higher Education are also opened to students holder of a qualification in Arts and Business. This qualification is usually awarded by the [[National Service of Learning (Colombia)|SENA]] after a two years [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=COL|title=UNESCO-UNEVOC World TVET Database|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bachilleres'' (high-school graduates) may enter into a professional undergraduate career program offered by a university; these programs last up to five years (or less for technical, technological and intermediate professional education, and post-graduate studies), even as much to six to seven years for some careers, such as medicine. In Colombia, there is not an institution such as college; students go directly into a career program at a university or any other educational institution to obtain a professional, technical or technological title. Once graduated from the university, people are granted a (professional, technical or technological) diploma and licensed (if required) to practice the career they have chosen. For some professional career programs, students are required to take the Saber-Pro test, in their final year of undergraduate academic education.&lt;ref name="sistema educativo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menweb.mineducacion.gov.co/nnormas/normas_basicas_4.swf |title=Ministerio de Educación de Colombia, Estructura del sistema educativo |date=29 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629194012/http://menweb.mineducacion.gov.co/nnormas/normas_basicas_4.swf |archivedate=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public spending on education as a proportion of gross domestic product in 2015 was 4.49%. This represented 15.05% of total government expenditure. The [[Gross enrolment ratio|primary and secondary gross enrolment ratios]] stood at 113.56% and 98.09% respectively. [[School-life expectancy]] was 14.42 years. A total of 94.58% of the population aged 15 and older were recorded as literate, including 98.66% of those aged 15–24.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://uis.unesco.org/en/country/co|title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics Colombia Profile |accessdate= 5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europäische Wasserscheiden.png|thumb|300px|Major drainage divides (red ridgelines&lt;ref name="RndmHse1"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 September 2013|publisher=Random House Inc.|title=ridgeline. Dictionary.com|edition=Dictionary.com Unabridged
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ridgeline?s=t }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[drainage basin]]s (green regions) in Europe. (Note the German labels.)]]

A '''drainage divide''', '''water divide''', '''divide''', '''ridgeline''',&lt;ref name="RndmHse1"/&gt; '''watershed''', or '''water parting''' is the line that separates neighbouring [[drainage basin]]s. On rugged land, the divide lies along [[topography|topographical]] [[ridge]]s, and may be in the form of a single range of [[hill]]s or [[mountain]]s, known as a '''dividing range'''. On flat terrain, especially where the ground is [[marsh]]y, the divide may be harder to discern.

A '''valley floor divide''' is a low drainage divide that runs across a valley, sometimes created by deposition or [[stream capture]].

Since ridgelines are relatively easy to see and agree about, drainage divides are often [[Border#Natural borders|natural borders]] defining political boundaries, as with the 18th century North America [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] that preceded the [[American Revolution]].

==Types==
Drainage divides can be divided into three types:
*[[Continental divide]] in which waters on each side flow to different oceans, such as the [[Congo-Nile Divide]].
*Major drainage divide in which waters on each side of the divide never meet but flow into the same ocean, such as the divide between the [[Yellow River]] basin and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]].  Another, more subtle, example is the Schuylkill-Lehigh divide at [[Pisgah Mountain]] in Pennsylvania in which two minor creeks divide to flow and grow east and west respectively joining the [[Lehigh River]] and [[Delaware River]] or the [[Susquehanna River]] and [[Potomac River]], with each tributary complex having separate outlets into the Atlantic.
*Minor drainage divide in which waters part but eventually rejoin at a river confluence, such as the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Missouri River]] drainage divides.

== Valley-floor divides ==
A valley-floor divide occurs on the bottom of a valley and arises as a result of subsequent depositions, such as [[scree]], in a valley through which a river originally flowed continuously.&lt;ref&gt;Leser, Hartmut, ed. (2005). ''Wörterbuch Allgemeine Geographie'', 13th ed., dtv, Munich, p. 935. {{ISBN|978-3-423-03422-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include the [[Kartitsch Saddle]] in the [[Gail (river)|Gail]] valley in [[East Tyrol]], which forms the watershed between the [[Drau]] and the Gail, and the divides in the ''Toblacher Feld'' between [[Innichen]] and [[Toblach]] in [[Italy]], where the [[Drau]] empties into the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Rienz]] into the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].

Settlements are often built on valley-floor divides in the Alps. Examples are [[Eben im Pongau]], [[Kirchberg in Tirol]] and [[Waidring]] (In all of these, the village name indicates the pass and the watershed is even explicitly displayed in the coat of arms). Extremely low divides with heights of less than two metres are found on the [[North German Plain]] within the ''[[Urstromtäler]]'', for example, between [[Havel]] and [[Finow]] in the ''Eberswalde Urstromtal''. In marsh deltas such as the [[Okavango Delta|Okavango]], the largest drainage area on earth, or in large lakes areas, such as the [[Finnish Lakeland]], it is difficult to find a meaningful definition of a watershed. Another case is [[bifurcation (river)|bifurcation]], where the watershed is effectively in the river bed, a wetland or underground. The largest watershed of this type is the bifurcation of the [[Orinoco]] in the north of [[South America]], whose main stream empties into the [[Caribbean]], but which also drains into the South Atlantic via the [[Casiquiare canal]] and [[Amazon River]].

== Impact on communication ==
Drainage divides hinder river [[navigation]]. In pre-industrial times, water divides were crossed at [[portage]]s. Later, [[canal]]s connected adjoining drainage basins; a key problem in such canals is ensuring a sufficient water supply. Important examples are the [[Chicago Portage]], connecting the Great Lakes and Mississippi by the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], and the [[Canal des Deux Mers]] in France, connecting the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

'''Environmental engineering''' is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments, both local and global, from  potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and improvement of environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaees.org/ The American Academy of Environmental Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental engineering system can also be described as a branch of applied science and technology that addresses the issues of energy preservation, protection of assets and control of waste from human and animal activities. Furthermore, it is concerned with finding plausible solutions in the field of public health, such as [[waterborne diseases]], implementing laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. It involves [[Water pollution|waste water management]], [[air pollution]] control, recycling, [[waste disposal]], radiation protection, industrial hygiene, animal agriculture, environmental sustainability, [[public health]] and [[environmental engineering law]]. It also includes studies on the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.

Environmental engineers system study the effect of technological advances on the environment. To do so, they conduct studies on hazardous-[[waste management]] to evaluate the significance of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. Environmental engineers design [[water purification|municipal water supply]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] | edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1967 | id= [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tchobanoglous, G. |author2=Burton, F.L. |author3= Stensel, H.D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Wastewater Engineering (Treatment Disposal Reuse) / Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=2003|isbn=0-07-041878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They address local and worldwide environmental issues such as the effects of [[acid rain]], [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]], water pollution and air pollution from [[Automobile emissions control|automobile exhausts]] and [[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors|industrial sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor.U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm |title=Architecture and Engineering Occupations : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Career Information Center.

Many universities offer environmental engineering programs at either the department of [[civil engineering]] or the department of [[chemical engineering]] at engineering faculties. Environmental "civil" engineers focus on hydrology, water resources management, [[bioremediation]], and water treatment plant design. Environmental "chemical" engineers, on the other hand, focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies and separation processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Some subdivision of environmental engineering include [[natural resources engineering]] and agricultural engineering.

More engineers are obtaining specialized training in law ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) and are utilizing their technical expertise in the practices of [[environmental engineering law]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Most jurisdictions also impose licensing and registration requirements.

{{anchor|History}}

==Development==
Ever since people first recognized that their health is related to the [[Environmental quality|quality of their environment]], they have applied principles to attempt to improve the quality of their environment. The ancient Indian [[Harappan civilization]] utilized early sewers in some cities more than 5000 years ago. More specifically, the Indus Valley Civilization (also called the Harappan civilization) had advanced control over the water in their society. The public work structures found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths, storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system. They also had an early version of a canal irrigation system that was needed for their large scale agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution of Sanitation and Wastewater Technologies through the Centuries|last=Angelakis|first=Andreas N.|last2=Rose|first2=Joan B.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781780404851|location=|pages=25-40|chapter=Chapter 2: "Sanitation and wastewater technologies in Harappa/Indus valley civilization (ca. 2600-1900 BC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman aqueduct|Romans constructed aqueducts]] to prevent drought and to create a clean, healthful water supply for the [[Metropolitan area|metropolis]] of [[Rome]]. In the 15th century, [[Bavaria]] created laws restricting the development and degradation of alpine country that constituted the region's water supply.

The field emerged as a separate environmental discipline during the middle third of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and pollution and increasingly extensive environmental quality degradation. However, its roots extend back to early efforts in public health engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation.(Dec. 3, 2009).Environmental Engineering"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501029 |title=Funding - Environmental Engineering - US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern environmental engineering began in [[London]] in the mid-19th century when [[Joseph Bazalgette]] designed the first major [[sewage collection and disposal|sewerage]] system that reduced the incidence of waterborne diseases such as [[cholera]]. The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities.&lt;ref name="Water industry from The Oxford Companion to British History online"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Waterborne_infections.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, as societies grew, actions that were intended to achieve benefits for those societies had longer-term impacts which reduced other environmental qualities. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide [[DDT]] to control agricultural pests in the years following [[World War II]]. While the [[agriculture|agricultural]] benefits were outstanding and crop yields increased dramatically thus reducing world hunger substantially, and [[malaria]] was controlled better than it ever had been, numerous species were brought to the verge of extinction due to the impact of the DDT on their reproductive cycles. The story of DDT as vividly told in [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement and of the modern field of "environmental engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Sustainable Development (n.d.) Environmental Science|publisher=Detroit|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation movement]]s and [[law]]s restricting public actions that would harm the environment have been developed by various societies for millennia. Notable examples are the laws decreeing the construction of [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]]s in [[London sewerage system|London]] and [[Paris Sewer Museum|Paris]] in the 19th century and the creation of the U.S. national park system in the early 20th century.

===Environmental impact assessment and mitigation===
{{Main article|Environmental impact assessment}}

Scientists have air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes.
They apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality, [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] quality, [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], agricultural capacity, [[traffic]] impacts, social impacts, ecological impacts, noise impacts, visual (landscape) impacts, etc. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of [[wetland]]s in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road.

In the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United States.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill, Inc"&gt;{{cite book|title= McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Environmental Science and Engineering |edition=3rd|publisher= McGraw-Hill, Inc|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply and treatment===
[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]]]]
Engineers evaluate the water balance within a [[drainage basin|watershed]] and determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses. Water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the case of a [[potable water]] supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of [[infectious disease]] transmission, the risk of non-infectious illness, and to create a palatable water flavor. Water distribution systems are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and [[irrigation]].

===Wastewater treatment===
[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|Water pollution]]

There are numerous wastewater treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an [[aeration]] basin followed by [[flocculation]] and [[settling|sedimentation]] or an [[activated sludge]] system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological [[nitrogen]] removal system, and a final [[disinfection]] process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge).  The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and [[phosphorus]] and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sims, J.|title= Activated sludge, Environmental Encyclopedia |publisher=Detroit|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution management===

Scientists have developed [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]] to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle [[Exhaust system|exhausts]] and industrial [[flue gas stack]] emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from combustion processes.

==Environmental Protection Agency==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve key issues. An important component of EPA's mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall environmental quality in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects.

==Ecological engineering for sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid West African regions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. Masse|author2=JL. Chotte|author3=E. Scopel|title=Ecological engineering for sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid West African regions|journal=Fiche thématique du CSFD|date=2015|issue=11|page=2|url=http://www.csf-desertification.eu/combating-desertification/item/ecological-engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Ecological engineering offers new alternatives for the management of agricultural systems that are more tailored to the ever-changing social and environmental necessities in these regions. This requires managing the complexity of agrosystems, while striving to mimic the functioning of natural ecosystems of West African drylands and taking advantage of traditional practices and local know-how resulting from a long process of adaptation to environmental constraints.
# Acting on biodiversity. Biodiversity is essential to the productivity of ecosystems and their temporal stability under the impact of external disturbances. Several ecological processes related to biodiversity may be intensified for the benefit of agrosilvopastoral systems: promoting diversity and soil microorganism activity to benefit&amp;nbsp;plants, associating and utilizing the mutual benefits of plants
# Utilizing organic matter and nutrient cycles. The productivity of agrosystems with low chemical input use in dryland regions is primarily based on efficient organic resource management, and in turn on the nutrient and energy flows they induce. It is thus possible to intervene at several levels: enhancing crop-livestock farming integration to preserve natural resources, restoring the biological activity of soils via specific organic&amp;nbsp;inputs, supplying nutrients to plants locally.
# Enhancing available water use. Water supplies are limited and irregular in dryland areas. Current management of these supplies—which involves capturing rainwater and surface runoff—could be improved in several ways: adapting to erratic rainfall or drought risks by focusing on: (i) the organization of the farm and community (farm plot patterns in association with the random rainfall distribution, etc.), and on (ii) cropping techniques to reduce crop water needs (plant choices, weeding, etc.), preserving water in crop fields by hampering runoff, accounting for the essential role of trees regarding soil and water in drylands.
# Managing landscapes and associated ecological processes. Ecological crop pest regulation by their natural enemies is one ecosystem service provided by biodiversity. Better pest management could be considered in association with promoting biodiversity at different scales, e.g. from the plant to the landscape.

==Education==
Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into broad classes:
*''[[Mechanical engineering]]'' courses oriented towards designing machines and mechanical systems for environmental use such as water treatment facilities, pumping stations, garbage segregation plants and other mechanical facilities;
*''Environmental engineering or environmental systems'' courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment;
*''[[Environmental chemistry]]'', ''sustainable chemistry'' or ''environmental [[Chemical engineer|chemical]] engineering'' courses oriented towards understanding the effects (good and bad) of chemicals in the environment.  Focus on mining processes, pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes;
*''[[Environmental technology]]'' courses oriented towards producing electronic or electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources.

'''Epidemiology''' is the study and analysis of the distribution (who, when, and where) and [[risk factor|determinants]] of health and disease conditions in defined [[population]]s.

It is the cornerstone of [[public health]], and shapes policy decisions and [[evidence-based practice]] by identifying [[risk factor]]s for disease and targets for [[preventive healthcare]]. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and [[statistical analysis]] of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including [[peer review]] and occasional [[systematic review]]). Epidemiology has helped develop [[methodology]] used in [[clinical research]], [[public health]] studies, and, to a lesser extent, [[basic research]] in the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miquel Porta |title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology |url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-dictionary-of-epidemiology-9780199976737?cc=us&amp;lang=en |edition=6th |year=2014 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-997673-7 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major areas of epidemiological study include disease causation, [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], [[outbreak]] investigation, [[disease surveillance]], [[forensic epidemiology]], [[occupational epidemiology]], [[screening (medicine)|screening]], [[biomonitoring]], and comparisons of treatment effects such as in [[clinical trials]]. Epidemiologists rely on other scientific disciplines like [[biology]] to better understand disease processes, [[statistics]] to make efficient use of the data and draw appropriate conclusions, [[social science]]s to better understand proximate and distal causes, and [[engineering]] for [[exposure assessment]].

== Etymology ==
''Epidemiology'', literally meaning "the study of what is upon the people", is derived {{ety|gre|epi|upon, among||[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]|people, district||[[logos]]|study, word, discourse}}, suggesting that it applies only to human populations. However, the term is widely used in studies of zoological populations (veterinary epidemiology), although the term "[[epizoology]]" is available, and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations (botanical or [[plant disease epidemiology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Nutter, Jr. |first= F.W. |title= Understanding the interrelationships between botanical, human, and veterinary epidemiology: the Ys and Rs of it all |journal= Ecosys Health |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=131–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.1999.09922.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between "epidemic" and "endemic" was first drawn by [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref&gt;Hippocrates. (~200BC). Airs, Waters, Places.&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish between diseases that are "visited upon" a population (epidemic) from those that "reside within" a population (endemic).&lt;ref name="Carol Buck 1998 p3"&gt;Carol Buck, Alvaro Llopis, Enrique Nájera, Milton Terris. (1998). The Challenge of Epidemiology: Issues and Selected Readings. Scientific Publication No. 505. Pan American Health Organization. Washington, DC. p3.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "epidemiology" appears to have first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba in ''Epidemiología Española''.&lt;ref name="Carol Buck 1998 p3"/&gt; Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a [[syndemic]].

The term epidemiology is now widely applied to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic disease, but of disease in general, and even many non-disease, health-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and [[obesity]]. Therefore, this epidemiology is based upon how the pattern of the disease causes change in the function of everyone.

== History ==

The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]], known as the father of [[medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E-OZbEmPSTkC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage |title=A history of epidemiologic methods and concepts |author=Alfredo Morabia |year=2004 |publisher=Birkhäuser |page=93 |isbn=3-7643-6818-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://samples.jbpub.com/9780763766221/66221_CH02_5398.pdf Historical Developments in Epidemiology].

Merrill |year=2010 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |page=24 |isbn=0-7637-6622-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates believed sickness of the human body to be caused by an imbalance of the four [[humorism|humors]] (air, fire, water and earth “atoms”). The cure to the sickness was to remove or add the humor in question to balance the body. This belief led to the application of bloodletting and dieting in medicine.&lt;ref name="Merril, Ray M. 2010"&gt;Merril, Ray M., PhD, MPH. "An Introduction to Epidemiology, Fifth Edition".

=== Modern era ===
{{See also|History of emerging infectious diseases}}
In the middle of the 16th century, a doctor from [[Verona]] named [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted [[Galen]]'s [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]] (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book ''[[De contagione et contagiosis morbis]]'', in which he was the first to promote personal and environmental [[hygiene]] to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a [[germ theory of disease]].

[[Wu Youke]] (1582–1652) developed the concept that some diseases were caused by transmissible agents, which he called liqi (pestilential factors). His book Wenyi Lun (Treatise on Acute Epidemic Febrile Diseases) can be regarded as the main etiological work that brought forward the concept, ultimately attributed to Westerners, of germs as a cause of epidemic diseases (source: http://baike.baidu.com/view/143117.htm). His concepts are still considered in current scientific research in relation to Traditional Chinese Medicine studies (see: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js6170e/4.html).

Another pioneer, [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624–1689), was the first to distinguish the fevers of Londoners in the later 1600s. His theories on cures of fevers met with much resistance from traditional physicians at the time. He was not able to find the initial cause of the [[smallpox]] fever he researched and treated.&lt;ref name="Merril, Ray M. 2010"/&gt;

[[File:Snow-cholera-map.jpg|thumb|350px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[cluster (epidemiology)|cluster]]s of cholera cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]
[[John Graunt]], a [[haberdasher]] and amateur statistician, published ''Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality'' in 1662. In it, he analysed the mortality rolls in [[London]] before the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]], presented one of the first [[life tables]], and reported time trends for many diseases, new and old. He provided statistical evidence for many theories on disease, and also refuted some widespread ideas on them.

[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] is famous for his investigations into the causes of the 19th century cholera epidemics, and is also known as the father of (modern) epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/fatherofepidemiology.html Doctor John Snow Blames Water Pollution for Cholera Epidemic, by David Vachon] UCLA Department of Epidemlology, School of Public Health May &amp; June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3935461 John Snow, Father of Epidemiology] NPR Talk of the Nation. 24 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the [[Broadwick Street|Broad Street]] pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example of epidemiology. Snow used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and removed the handle; this ended the outbreak. This has been perceived as a major event in the history of [[public health]] and regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology, having helped shape public health policies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;

Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] 'discovered' [[antiseptics]] in 1865 in light of the work of [[Louis Pasteur]].

In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by [[Ronald Ross]], [[Janet Lane-Claypon]], [[Anderson Gray McKendrick]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DD1FKq6fFoC&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q=mathematical%20methods%20were%20introduced%20into%20epidemiology%2020th%20century%20ross Statisticians of the centuries].

Another breakthrough was the 1954 publication of the results of a [[British Doctors Study]], led by [[Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill]], which lent very strong statistical support to the link between [[tobacco smoking]] and [[lung cancer]].

In the late 20th century, with advancement of biomedical sciences, a number of molecular markers in blood, other biospecimens and environment were identified as predictors of development or risk of a certain disease. Epidemiology research to examine the relationship between these [[biomarker]]s analyzed at the molecular level, and disease was broadly named “[[molecular epidemiology]]”. Specifically, "[[genetic epidemiology]]" has been used for epidemiology of germline genetic variation and disease. Genetic variation is typically determined using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Since the 2000s, [[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS) have been commonly performed to identify genetic risk factors for many diseases and health conditions.

While most molecular epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease [[diagnosis]] and classification systems, it is increasingly recognized that disease progression represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual (“the unique disease principle”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = How many molecular subtypes?

Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly [[cancer]]) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of [[molecular pathology]] in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized [[Statistics|statistical]] methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, King EE, Beck AH, Sherman ME, Milner DA, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = Interdisciplinary education to integrate pathology and epidemiology: Towards molecular and population-level health science | url = | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 176 | issue = | pages = 659–67 | doi=10.1093/aje/kws226| pmc = 3571252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular [[precision medicine]], “[[molecular pathology]]” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “[[molecular pathological epidemiology]]” (MPE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Stampfer M | year = 2010 | title = Lifestyle factors and microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer: the evolving field of molecular pathological epidemiology | url = | journal = J Natl Cancer Inst | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 365–7 | doi=10.1093/jnci/djq031 | pmid=20208016 | pmc=2841039}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Chan AT, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2011 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of colorectal neoplasia: an emerging transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 397–411 | doi=10.1136/gut.2010.217182 | pmid=21036793 | pmc=3040598}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as “epidemiology of [[molecular pathology]] and heterogeneity of disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease.

== Types of studies ==
{{Main|Study design}}
Epidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and generally categorized as descriptive, analytic (aiming to further examine known associations or hypothesized relationships), and experimental (a term often equated with clinical or community trials of treatments and other interventions). In observational studies, nature is allowed to “take its course," as epidemiologists observe from the sidelines. Conversely, in experimental studies, the epidemiologist is the one in control of all of the factors entering a certain case study.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"&gt;"Principles of Epidemiology." Key Concepts in Public Health. London: Sage UK, 2009. Credo Reference. 1 August 2011. Web. 30 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between [[Exposure Assessment#Exposure|exposures]] such as alcohol or smoking, [[infections|biological agents]], [[stress (medicine)|stress]], or [[Chemical compound|chemicals]] to [[death|mortality]] or [[morbidity]]. The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology. Modern epidemiologists use [[Health informatics|informatics]] as a tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Nichole A.|last2=Spinelli|first2=John J.|last3=Gotay|first3=Carolyn C.|last4=Teschke|first4=Kay|date=2018-07-03|title=Literature review: dermal monitoring data for pesticide exposure assessment of farm workers|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=187–214|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1448734|pmid=30047858|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observational studies have two components, descriptive and analytical. Descriptive observations pertain to the “who, what, where and when of health-related state occurrence”. However, analytical observations deal more with the ‘how’ of a health-related event.&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"/&gt; [[Experimental epidemiology]] contains three case types: randomized controlled trials (often used for new medicine or drug testing), field trials (conducted on those at a high risk of contracting a disease), and community trials (research on social originating diseases).&lt;ref name="Epidemiology 2009"/&gt;

The term 'epidemiologic triad' is used to describe the intersection of ''Host'', ''Agent'', and ''Environment'' in analyzing an outbreak.

=== Case series ===
Case-series may refer to the qualitative study of the experience of a single patient, or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis, or to a statistical factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed.

The former type of study is purely descriptive and cannot be used to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to a formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case-control studies or prospective studies. A case-control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hennekens |first1=Charles H. |author2=Julie E. Buring |year=1987 |title=Epidemiology in Medicine |editor=Mayrent, Sherry L. (Ed.) |publisher=Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins |isbn=978-0-316-35636-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter type, more formally described as self-controlled case-series studies, divide individual patient follow-up time into exposed and unexposed periods and use fixed-effects Poisson regression processes to compare the incidence rate of a given outcome between exposed and unexposed periods. This technique has been extensively used in the study of adverse reactions to vaccination and has been shown in some circumstances to provide statistical power comparable to that available in cohort studies.

=== Case-control studies ===
[[case-control study|Case-control studies]] select subjects based on their disease status. It is a retrospective study. A group of individuals that are disease positive (the "case" group) is compared with a group of disease negative individuals (the "control" group). The control group should ideally come from the same population that gave rise to the cases. The case-control study looks back through time at potential exposures that both groups (cases and controls) may have encountered. A 2×2 table is constructed, displaying exposed cases (A), exposed controls (B), unexposed cases (C) and unexposed controls (D). The statistic generated to measure association is the [[odds ratio]] (OR), which is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases (A/C) to the odds of exposure in the controls (B/D), i.e. OR = (AD/BC).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| A
| B
|-
| Unexposed
| C
| D
|}

If the OR is significantly greater than 1, then the conclusion is "those with the disease are more likely to have been exposed," whereas if it is close to 1 then the exposure and disease are not likely associated. If the OR is far less than one, then this suggests that the exposure is a protective factor in the causation of the disease.
Case-control studies are usually faster and more cost effective than [[cohort studies]], but are sensitive to bias (such as [[recall bias]] and [[selection bias]]). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should be representative of the distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.

A major drawback for case control studies is that, in order to be considered to be statistically significant, the minimum number of cases required at the 95% confidence interval is related to the odds ratio by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{total cases} = A+C = 1.96^2 (1+N) \left(\frac{1}{\ln(OR)}\right)^2 \left(\frac{OR+2\sqrt{OR}+1}{\sqrt{OR}}\right) \approx 15.5 (1+N) \left(\frac{1}{\ln(OR)}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the ratio of cases to controls.
As the odds ratio approached 1, approaches 0; rendering case control studies all but useless for low odds ratios. For instance, for an odds ratio of 1.5 and cases = controls, the table shown above would look like this:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| 103
| 84
|-
| Unexposed
| 84
| 103
|}

For an odds ratio of 1.1:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cases
! Controls
|-
| Exposed
| 1732
| 1652
|-
| Unexposed
| 1652
| 1732
|}

=== Cohort studies ===
[[Cohort studies]] select subjects based on their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the [[relative risk]] (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'') over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(''C''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''D''), i.e. ''RR''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! .....

|-
| Unexposed
| ''C''
| ''D''
| (''C''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''D'')
|}

As with the OR, a RR greater than 1 shows association, where the conclusion can be read "those with the exposure were more likely to develop disease."

Prospective studies have many benefits over case control studies. The RR is a more powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, and there is a greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.

Cohort studies also are limited by the same equation for number of cases as for cohort studies, but, if the base incidence rate in the study population is very low, the number of cases required is reduced by&amp;nbsp;½.

== Causal inference ==
{{main|Causal inference}}
Although epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering ''causal'' relationships.

"[[Correlation does not imply causation]]" is a common theme for much of the epidemiological literature. For epidemiologists, the key is in the term [[inference]]. Correlation, or at least association between two variables, is  a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inference that one variable causes the other. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal.

Epidemiologists emphasize that the "'''one cause – one effect'''" understanding is a simplistic mis-belief.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Most outcomes, whether disease or death, are caused by a chain or web consisting of many component causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Epidemiology|last=Rothman|first=Kenneth J.|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1986|isbn=0-316-75776-4|location=Boston/Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes can be distinguished as necessary, sufficient or probabilistic conditions. If a necessary condition can be identified and controlled (e.g., antibodies to a disease agent, energy in an injury), the harmful outcome can be avoided (Robertson, 2015).

=== Bradford Hill criteria ===
{{Main|Bradford Hill criteria}}
In 1965, [[Austin Bradford Hill]] proposed a series of considerations to help assess evidence of causation,&lt;ref name="bh65"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hill |first=Austin Bradford |year=1965 |title=The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation? |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=58 |pages=295–300 |url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill |pmid=14283879 |pmc=1898525 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have come to be commonly known as the "[[Bradford Hill criteria]]". In contrast to the explicit intentions of their author, Hill's considerations are now sometimes taught as a checklist to be implemented for assessing causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Carl V. |author2=Karen J. Goodman |title=The missed lessons of Sir Austin Bradford Hill |journal=Epidemiologic Perspectives and Innovations |volume=1 |issue=3 |url=http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/1/1/3 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15507128 |pmc=524370 |doi=10.1186/1742-5573-1-3 |pages=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523185244/http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/1/1/3 |archivedate=23 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill himself said "None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required ''sine qua non''."&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;

# '''Strength of Association''': A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Consistency of Data''': Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Specificity''': Causation is likely if a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Temporality''': The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Biological gradient''': Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Plausibility''': A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Coherence''': Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that "... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations".&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Experiment''': "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;
# '''Analogy''': The effect of similar factors may be considered.&lt;ref name="bh65" /&gt;

=== Legal interpretation ===
[[Epidemiological study|Epidemiological studies]] can only go to prove that an agent could have caused, but not that it did cause, an effect in any particular case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Epidemiology is concerned with the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of disease in populations and does not address the question of the cause of an individual's disease. This question, sometimes referred to as specific causation, is beyond the domain of the science of epidemiology. Epidemiology has its limits at the point where an inference is made that the relationship between an agent and a disease is causal (general causation) and where the magnitude of excess risk attributed to the agent has been determined; that is, epidemiology addresses whether an agent can cause a disease, not whether an agent did cause a specific plaintiff's disease."&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Green |first1= Michael D. |author2= D. Michal Freedman, and Leon Gordis |title= Reference Guide on Epidemiology |publisher= Federal Judicial Centre |url= http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman06.pdf/$file/sciman06.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 3 February 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080227143925/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman06.pdf/$file/sciman06.pdf |archivedate= 27 February 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In United States law, epidemiology alone cannot prove that a causal association does not exist in general. Conversely, it can be (and is in some circumstances) taken by US courts, in an individual case, to justify an inference that a causal association does exist, based upon a balance of [[probability]].

The subdiscipline of forensic epidemiology is directed at the investigation of specific causation of disease or injury in individuals or groups of individuals in instances in which causation is disputed or is unclear, for presentation in legal settings.

Epidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks.

Population-based health management encompasses the ability to:

* Assess the health states and health needs of a target population;
* Implement and evaluate interventions that are designed to improve the health of that population; and
* Efficiently and effectively provide care for members of that population in a way that is consistent with the community's cultural, policy and health resource values.

Modern population-based health management is complex, requiring a multiple set of skills (medical, political, technological, mathematical etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues, but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Health and Disease I: Introduction to Epidemiology |url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/public-health/epidemiology/intro-epidemiology/2010 |accessdate=16 December 2011 |author1=Neil Myburgh |author2=Debra Jackson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801204104/https://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/public-health/epidemiology/intro-epidemiology/2010 |archivedate=1 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of organizations that use population-based health management that leverage the work and results of epidemiological practice include Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control, Health Canada Tobacco Control Programs, Rick Hansen Foundation, Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Smetanin |first1=P. |author2=P.

Each of these organizations use a population-based health management framework called Life at Risk that combines epidemiological quantitative analysis with demographics, health agency operational research and economics to perform:

* ''Population Life Impacts Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the population with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death as well as potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* ''Labour Force Life Impacts Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the labour force with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death and potential years of life lost from disability and death;
* ''Economic Impacts of Disease Simulations'': Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon private sector disposable income impacts (wages, corporate profits, private health care costs) and public sector disposable income impacts (personal income tax, corporate income tax, consumption taxes, [[publicly funded health care]] costs).

== Applied field epidemiology ==

Applied epidemiology is the practice of using epidemiological methods to protect or improve the health of a population. Applied field epidemiology can include investigating communicable and non-communicable disease outbreaks, mortality and morbidity rates, and nutritional status, among other indicators of health, with the purpose of communicating the results to those who can implement appropriate policies or disease control measures.

=== Humanitarian context ===

As the surveillance and reporting of diseases and other health factors becomes increasingly difficult in humanitarian crisis situations, the methodologies used to report the data are compromised. One study found that less than half (42.4%) of nutrition surveys sampled from humanitarian contexts correctly calculated the prevalence of malnutrition and only one-third (35.3%) of the surveys met the criteria for quality. Among the mortality surveys, only 3.2% met the criteria for quality. As nutritional status and mortality rates help indicate the severity of a crisis, the tracking and reporting of these health factors is crucial.

Vital registries are usually the most effective ways to collect data, but in humanitarian contexts these registries can be non-existent, unreliable, or inaccessible.  As such, mortality is often inaccurately measured using either prospective demographic surveillance or retrospective mortality surveys. Prospective demographic surveillance requires lots of manpower and is difficult to implement in a spread-out population. Retrospective morality surveys are prone to selection and reporting biases. Other methods are being developed, but are not common practice yet.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, “Health topics: Epidemiology.” http://www.who.int/topics/epidemiology/en/ Accessed: October 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miquel Porta.

== Validity: precision and bias ==
Different fields in epidemiology have different levels of validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives.&lt;ref name="Ioannides2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J. P. A. | last2 = Tarone | first2 = R. | last3 = McLaughlin | first3 = J. K. | title = The False-positive to False-negative Ratio in Epidemiologic Studies | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 450–456 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21490505 | doi = 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31821b506e }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.&lt;ref name="Ioannides2011"/&gt;

=== Random error ===
Random error is the result of fluctuations around a true value because of sampling variability. Random error is just that: random. It can occur during data collection, coding, transfer, or analysis. Examples of random error include: poorly worded questions, a misunderstanding in interpreting an individual answer from a particular respondent, or a typographical error during coding. Random error affects measurement in a transient, inconsistent manner and it is impossible to correct for random error.

There is random error in all sampling procedures. This is called [[sampling error]].

Precision in epidemiological variables is a measure of random error. Precision is also inversely related to random error, so that to reduce random error is to increase precision. Confidence intervals are computed to demonstrate the precision of relative risk estimates. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the relative risk estimate.

There are two basic ways to reduce random error in an [[epidemiological study]]. The first is to increase the sample size of the study. In other words, add more subjects to your study. The second is to reduce the variability in measurement in the study. This might be accomplished by using a more precise measuring device or by increasing the number of measurements.

Note, that if sample size or number of measurements are increased, or a more precise measuring tool is purchased, the costs of the study are usually increased. There is usually an uneasy balance between the need for adequate precision and the practical issue of study cost.

=== Systematic error ===
A systematic error or bias occurs when there is a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of systematic error is if, unknown to you, the [[pulse oximeter]] you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be [[Accuracy and precision|precise but not accurate]]. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).

A mistake in coding that affects ''all'' responses for that particular question is another example of a systematic error.

The validity of a study is dependent on the degree of systematic error. Validity is usually separated into two components:

* [[Internal validity]] is dependent on the amount of error in measurements, including exposure, disease, and the associations between these variables. Good internal validity implies a lack of error in measurement and suggests that inferences may be drawn at least as they pertain to the subjects under study.
* [[External validity]] pertains to the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. Internal validity is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.

==== Selection bias ====
[[Selection bias]] occurs when study subjects are selected or become part of the study as a result of a third, unmeasured variable which is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest.&lt;ref name="Hernán2004"/&gt; For instance, it has repeatedly been noted that cigarette smokers and non smokers tend to differ in their study participation rates. (Sackett D cites the example of Seltzer et al., in which 85% of non smokers and 67% of smokers returned mailed questionnaires.)&lt;ref name="Sackett D. Bias in analytic research. J Chron Dis 1979; vol. 32:51–63."&gt;[http://www.epidemiology.ch/history/PDF%20bg/Sackett%20DL%201979%20bias%20in%20analytic%20research.pdf] 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that such a difference in response will not lead to bias if it is not also associated with a systematic difference in outcome between the two response groups.

==== Information bias ====
[[Information bias (epidemiology)|Information bias]] is bias arising from systematic error in the assessment of a variable.&lt;ref name=Rothman2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rothman|first1=K.|title=Epidemiology: An Introduction|date=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=0195135547}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is recall bias. A typical example is again provided by Sackett in his discussion of a study examining the effect of specific exposures on fetal health: "in questioning mothers whose recent pregnancies had ended in fetal death or malformation (cases) and a matched group of mothers whose pregnancies ended normally (controls) it was found that 28% of the former, but only 20% of the latter, reported exposure to drugs which could not be substantiated either in earlier prospective
interviews or in other health records".&lt;ref name="Sackett D. Bias in analytic research. J Chron Dis 1979; vol. 32:51–63." /&gt; In this example, recall bias probably occurred as a result of women who had had miscarriages having an apparent tendency to better recall and therefore report previous exposures.

==== Confounding ====
[[Confounding]] has traditionally been defined as bias arising from the co-occurrence or mixing of effects of extraneous factors, referred to as confounders, with the main effect(s) of interest.&lt;ref name=Rothman2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenland&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenland S, Morgenstern H | year = 2001 | title = Confounding in Health Research | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.189 | journal = Annu. Rev. Public Health | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 189–212 | doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.189}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent definition of confounding invokes the notion of ''counterfactual'' effects.&lt;ref name=Greenland/&gt; According to this view, when one observes an outcome of interest, say Y=1 (as opposed to Y=0), in a given population A which is entirely exposed (i.e. exposure ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for every unit of the population) the risk of this event will be ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;. The counterfactual or unobserved risk ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the risk which would have been observed if these same individuals had been unexposed (i.e. ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for every unit of the population). The true effect of exposure therefore is: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; (if one is interested in risk differences) or ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; (if one is interested in relative risk). Since the counterfactual risk ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt; is unobservable we approximate it using a second population B and we actually measure the following relations: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt; or ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A1&lt;/sub&gt;/''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt;. In this situation, confounding occurs when ''R''&lt;sub&gt;A0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;B0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenland/&gt; (NB: Example assumes binary outcome and exposure variables.)

Some epidemiologists prefer to think of confounding separately from common categorizations of bias since, unlike selection and information bias, confounding stems from real causal effects.&lt;ref name="Hernán2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hernán | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Hernández-Díaz | first2 = S. | last3 = Robins | first3 = J. M. | title = A structural approach to selection bias | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 615–625 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15308962 | doi=10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The profession ==
To date, few [[universities]] offer epidemiology as a course of study at the undergraduate level. One notable undergraduate program exists at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where students who major in public health can take graduate level courses, including epidemiology, their senior year at the [[Bloomberg School of Public Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Health Studies|url=http://krieger.jhu.edu/publichealth/|website=Public Health Studies at Johns Hopkins|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although epidemiologic research is conducted by individuals from diverse disciplines, including clinically trained professionals such as physicians, formal training is available through Masters or Doctoral programs including [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH), [[Master of Science]] of Epidemiology (MSc.), [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH), [[Doctor of Pharmacy]] (PharmD), [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD).  Many other graduate programs, e.g., [[Doctor of Social Work]] (DSW), [[Doctor of Clinical Practice]] (DClinP), [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine]] (DPM), [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] (DVM), [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] (DNP), [[Doctor of Physical Therapy]] (DPT), or for clinically trained physicians, [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) or [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (MBBS or MBChB) and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (DO), include some training in epidemiologic research or related topics, but this training is generally substantially less than offered in training programs focused on epidemiology or public health. Reflecting the strong historical tie between epidemiology and medicine, formal training programs may be set in either schools of public health and medical schools.

As public health/health protection practitioners, epidemiologists work in a number of different settings. Some epidemiologists work 'in the field'; i.e., in the community, commonly in a public health/health protection service, and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals and larger government entities such as state and local health departments, various Ministries of Health, [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the [[Health Protection Agency]], the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), or the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]. Epidemiologists can also work in for-profit organizations such as pharmaceutical and medical device companies in groups such as market research or clinical development.

'''Ewald Banse''' (born 23 May 1883 in [[Braunschweig]] – died 31 October 1953 in Braunschweig) was a [[Germans|German]] [[geographer]].

Banse was a professor at the technical college in his native city.  Allied propaganda cited Banse's main work, ''Raum und Volk im Weltkriege'' ("Space and People in the World War") (1925), as proof of Germany's war lust.  Banse advocated the union of all areas settled by Germans in a Great German Reich extending far beyond the 1914 frontiers.  To achieve this he expressly demanded military action. The warrior was to be the carrier of the coming rule of "Nordic nobility".

It works by embedding locations in the message text, where the locations are formatted as [[geo URI|'geo' URI]]s as defined in RFC 5870.&lt;ref name="RFC5870"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870|title=RFC 5870 - A Uniform Resource Identifier for Geographic Locations ('geo' URI)|date=2010-06-08|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in 2010 by Matthew Kwan, a PhD Candidate at the [[RMIT School of Mathematical and Geospatial Sciences]] and should not be confused with the [[Open GeoSMS]] standard.

==Examples==
[[Image:IAmHereCompass.png|thumb|right|A geotagged SMS as displayed by the '''I Am Here''' application.]]

A simple geotagged SMS might look like:

:&lt;code&gt;I'm at the pub geo:-37.801631,144.980294;u=10&lt;/code&gt;

which would contain the message '''I'm at the pub''' and a location with latitude 37.801631 degrees south, longitude 144.980294 degrees east, and an uncertainty of (+ or -) 10 metres.

Messages using GeoSMS can also contain multiple locations, for example:

:&lt;code&gt;I'll be at the pub geo:-37.801631,144.980294;u=10 until midnight, then heading to a gig geo:-37.864225,144.97294&lt;/code&gt;

which contains two locations.

==Applications==
GeoSMS is used by the free [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application '''I Am Here''' (available through the [[Android Market]]) to send and receive geotagged SMS messages. It displays received messages using either a compass or map view. The GeoSMS specification is also being used to allow ships and cruising vessels to send position updates from an [[SMS]]-capable [[satellite phone]], such as one of the recent models marketed by [[Iridium Communications]] or [[Globalstar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://squidd.io/faq#follow] Sending GeoSMS position updates from offshore through a satellite phone.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open GeoSMS ==

The [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] also has an approved [[Open GeoSMS]] standard, published in 2011. This standard has been broadly implemented in Asia.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The OGC Open GeoSMS standard was originally developed in Taiwan by ITRI in 2008 and submitted into the OGC in 2009.

'''Loran-C''' was a ''[[Hyperbolic navigation|hyperbolic]]'' [[radio navigation]] system which allowed a receiver to determine its position by listening to [[low frequency]] radio signals transmitted by fixed land-based [[radio transmitters|radio beacons]]. Loran-C combined two different techniques to provide a signal that was both long-range and highly accurate, traits that had formerly been at odds. The downside was the expense of the equipment needed to interpret the signals, which meant that Loran-C was used primarily by militaries after it was first introduced in 1957.

By the 1970s the electronics needed to implement Loran-C had been dramatically reduced due to the introduction of [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] radio electronics, and especially the use of early [[microcontroller]]s to interpret the signal. Low-cost and easy-to-use Loran-C units became common from the late 1970s, especially in the early 1980s, leading to the earlier [[LORAN]]{{efn|The original system was known as LORAN, a short-form for LOng RAnge Navigation.

Loran-C became one of the most common and widely used navigation systems for large areas of North America, Europe, Japan and the entire Atlantic and Pacific areas. The [[Soviet Union]] operated a nearly identical system, [[CHAYKA]].

The introduction of civilian [[satellite navigation]] in the 1990s led to a very rapid drop-off in Loran-C use. Discussions about the future of Loran-C began in the 1990s, and several turn-off dates were announced and then cancelled. In 2010 the US and Canadian systems were shut down, along with shared Loran-C/CHAYKA stations with Russia.&lt;ref name="USCG LORAN"/&gt;&lt;ref name=can/&gt; Several other chains remained active, and some had been upgraded for continued use.

==History==

=== Loran-A===
{{main article|Loran-A}}
The original LORAN was proposed by [[Alfred Lee Loomis]] at a meeting of the Microwave Committee. The [[US Army Air Corps]] was interested in the concept for aircraft navigation, and after some discussion they returned a requirement for a system offering accuracy of about {{convert|1|mi|km}} at a range of {{convert|200|mi|km}}, and a maximum range as great as {{convert|500|mi|km}} for high-flying aircraft. The Microwave Committee, by this time organized into what would become the [[Radiation Laboratory]], took up development as '''Project 3'''. During the initial meetings, a member of the UK liaison team, [[Edward George Bowen|Taffy Bowen]], mentioned that he was aware the British were also working on a similar concept, but had no information on its performance.{{sfn|Halford|Davidson|Waldschmitt|1948|p=19}}

The development team, led by Loomis, made rapid progress on the transmitter design and tested several systems during 1940 before settling on a 3&amp;nbsp;MHz design. Extensive signal-strength measurements were made by mounting a conventional radio receiver in a [[station wagon]] and driving around the eastern states.&lt;ref name=halford&gt;Halford, Davidson and Waldschmitt, [https://www.jlab.org/ir/MITSeries/V4.PDF "History of LORAN"], MIT Radiation Laboratory, pp. 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the custom receiver design and its associated [[cathode ray tube]] displays proved to be a bigger problem. In spite of several efforts to design around the problem, instability in the display prevented accurate measurements.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|pp=305–306}}

By this time the team had become much more familiar with the British [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] system, and were aware of their related work on "strobes", a [[time base generator]] that produced well-positioned "pips" on the display that could be used for accurate measurement. They met with the Gee team in 1941, and immediately adopted this solution. But this meeting also revealed that Project 3 and Gee called for almost identical systems, with similar performance, range and accuracy. But Gee had already completed basic development and was entering into initial production, making Project 3 superfluous.{{sfn|Halford|Davidson|Waldschmitt|1948|p=22}}

In response, the Project 3 team told the Army Air Force to adopt Gee, and realigned their own efforts to provide long-range navigation on the oceans. This led to [[US Navy]] interest, and a series of experiments quickly demonstrated that systems using the basic Gee concept but operating at a lower frequency around 2&amp;nbsp;MHz would offer reasonable accuracy on the order of a few miles over distances on the order of {{convert|1250|mi|km}}, at least at night when signals of this frequency range were able to skip off the [[ionosphere]].{{sfn|Halford|Davidson|Waldschmitt|1948|p=22}} Rapid development followed, and a system covering the western Atlantic was operational in 1943. Additional stations followed, first covering the European side of the Atlantic, and then a massive expansion in the Pacific. By the end of the war, there were 72 operational LORAN stations and as many as 75,000 receivers.

In 1958 the operation of the LORAN system was handed over to the [[US Coast Guard]], which renamed the system "Loran-A", the lower-case name being introduced at that time.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|p=xi}}

===LF LORAN===
There are two ways to implement the timing measurements needed for a hyperbolic navigation system, pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN, and phase-timing systems like the [[Decca Navigator System]].{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|pp=302-303}}

The former requires sharp pulses of signal, and their accuracy is generally limited to how rapidly the pulses can be turned on and off, which is a function of the [[Center frequency|carrier frequency]]. There is an ambiguity in the signal; the same measurements can be valid at two locations relative to the broadcasters, but in normal operation, they are hundreds of kilometres apart, so one possibility can be eliminated.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|pp=302-303}}

The second system uses constant signals ("continuous wave") and takes measurements by comparing the phase of two signals. This system is easy to use even at very low frequencies. However, its signal is ambiguous over the distance of a wavelength, meaning there are hundreds of locations that will return the same signal. Decca referred to these ambiguous locations as ''cells'' in Decca. This demands some other navigation method to be used in conjunction to pick which cell the receiver is within, and then using the phase measurements to place the receiver accurately within the cell.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|pp=302-303}}

Numerous efforts were made to provide some sort of secondary low-accuracy system that could be used with a phase-comparison system like Decca in order to resolve the ambiguity. Among the many methods were a directional broadcast systems known as [[Post Office Position Indicator|POPI]], and a variety of systems combining pulse-timing for low-accuracy navigation and then using phase-comparison for fine adjustment. Decca themselves had set aside one frequency, "9f", for testing this concept, but did not have the chance to do so until much later. Similar concepts were also used in the experimental [[Navarho]] system in the US.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=302}}

It was known from the start of the LORAN project that the same CRT displays that showed the LORAN pulses could, when suitably magnified, also show the individual waves of the [[intermediate frequency]]. This meant that pulse-matching could be used to get a rough fix, and then the operator could gain additional timing accuracy by lining up the individual waves within the pulse, like Decca. This could either be used to greatly increase the accuracy of LORAN, or alternately, offer similar accuracy using much lower carrier frequencies, and thus greatly extend range. This would require the transmitter stations to be synchronized both in time and phase, but much of this problem had been solved by Decca engineers.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|pp=302-303}}

The long-range option was of considerable interest to the Coast Guard, who set up an experimental system known as '''LF LORAN''' in 1945. This operated at much lower frequencies than the original LORAN, at 180&amp;nbsp;kHz, and required very long balloon-borne antennas. Testing was carried out throughout the year, including several long-distance flights as far as [[Brazil]]. The experimental system was then sent to Canada where it was used during [[Operation Muskox]] in the Arctic. Accuracy was found to be {{convert|150|feet}} at {{convert|750|mi}}, a significant advance over LORAN. With the ending of Muskox it was decided to keep the system running under what became known as "Operation Musk Calf", run by a group consisting of the [[US Air Force]], [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and Royal Corps of Signals. The system ran until September 1947.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|p=16}}

This led to another major test series, this time by the newly formed USAF, known as Operation Beetle. Beetle was located in the far north, on the Canada-Alaska border, and used new guy-stayed {{convert|625|ft|m}} steel towers, replacing the earlier system's balloon-lofted cable antennas. The system became operational in 1948 and ran for two years until February 1950. Unfortunately, the stations proved poorly sited, as the radio transmission over the [[permafrost]] was much shorter than expected and synchronization of the signals between the stations using groundwaves proved impossible. The tests also showed that the system was extremely difficult to use in practice; it was easy for the operator to select the wrong sections of the waveforms on their display, leading to significant real-world inaccuracy.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|p=16}}

===CYCLAN and Whyn===
In 1946 the [[Rome Air Development Center]] sent out contracts for longer-ranged and more-accurate navigation systems that would be used for long-range bombing navigation. As the [[US Army Air Force]] was moving towards smaller crews, only three in the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] for instance, a high degree of automation was desired. Two contracts were accepted; [[Sperry Gyroscope]] proposed the '''CYCLAN''' system (CYCLe matching LorAN) which was broadly similar to LF LORAN but with additional automation, and Sylvania proposed '''Whyn''' using continuous wave navigation like Decca, but with additional coding using [[frequency modulation]]. In spite of great efforts, Whyn could never be made to work, and was abandoned.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=19-20}}

CYCLAN operated by sending the same LF LORAN-like signals on two frequencies, LF LORAN's 180&amp;nbsp;kHz and again on 200&amp;nbsp;kHz. The associated equipment would look for a rising amplitude that indicated the start of the signal pulse, and then use sampling gates to extract the carrier phase. Using two receivers solved the problem of mis-aligning the pulses, because the phases would only align properly between the two copies of the signal when the same pulses were being compared. None of this was trivial; using the era's tube-based electronics, the experimental CYCLAN system filled much of a [[semi-trailer]].{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=20-21}}

CYCLAN proved highly successful, so much so that it became increasingly clear that the problems that led the engineers to use two frequencies were simply not as bad as expected. It appeared that a system using a single frequency would work just as well, given the right electronics. This was especially good news, as the 200&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency was interfering with existing broadcasts, and had to be moved to 160&amp;nbsp;kHz during testing.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=23-24}}

Through this period the issue of radio spectrum use was becoming a major concern, and had led to international efforts to decide on a frequency band suitable for long-range navigation. This process eventually settled on the band from 90 to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. CYCLAN appeared to suggest that accuracy at even lower frequencies was not a problem, and the only real concern was the expense of the equipment involved.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=23-24}}

===Cytac===
The success of the CYCLAN system led to a further contract with Sperry in 1952 for a new system with the twin goals of working in the 100&amp;nbsp;kHz range while being equally accurate, less complex and less expensive. These goals would normally be contradictory, but the CYCLAN system gave all involved the confidence that these could be met. The resulting system was known as Cytac.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=25}}

To solve the complexity problem, a new circuit was developed to properly time the sampling of the signal. This consisted of a circuit to extract the envelope of the pulse, another to extract the derivative of the envelope, and finally another that subtracted the derivative from the envelope. The result of this final operation would become negative during a very specific and stable part of the rising edge of the pulse, and this zero-crossing was used to trigger a very short-time sampling gate. This system replaced the complex system of clocks used in CYCLAN. By simply measuring the time between the zero-crossings of the master and slave, pulse-timing was extracted.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=26}}

The output of the envelope sampler was also sent to a phase-shifter that adjusted the output of a local clock that locked to the master carrier using a [[phase-locked loop]]. This retained the phase of the master signal long enough for the slave signal to arrive. Gating on the slave signal was then compared to this master signal in a [[phase detector]], and a varying voltage was produced depending on the difference in phase. This voltage represented the fine-positioning measurement.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=26}}

The system was generally successful during testing through 1953, but there were concerns raised about the signal power at long ranges, and the possibility of jamming. This led to further modifications of the basic signal. The first was to broadcast a series of pulses instead of just one, broadcasting more energy during a given time and improving the ability of the receivers to tune in a useful signal. They also added a fixed 45° phase shift to every pulse, so simple continuous-wave jamming signals could be identified and rejected.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=33}}

The Cytac system underwent an enormous series of tests across the United States and offshore. Given the potential accuracy of the system, even minor changes to the groundwave synchronization were found to cause errors that could be eliminated - issues such as the number of rivers the signal crossed caused predictable delays that could be measured and then factored into navigation solutions. This led to a series of ''correction contours'' that could be added to the received signal to adjust for these concerns, and these were printed on the Cytac charts. Using prominent features on dams as target points, a series of tests demonstrated that the uncorrected signals provided accuracy on the order of 100 yards, while adding the correction contour adjustments reduced this to the order of ten yards.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=58}}

===Loran-B and -C===
It was at this moment that the [[US Air Force]] (having taken over these efforts while moving from the USAAF) dropped their interest in the project. Although the reasons are not well recorded, it appears the idea of a fully automated bombing system using radio aids was no longer considered possible.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=25}} The AAF had been involved in missions covering about 1000&amp;nbsp;km (the distance from London to Berlin) and the Cytac system would work well at these ranges. But as the mission changed to trans-polar missions of 5,000&amp;nbsp;km or more, even Cytac did not offer the range and accuracy needed. They turned their attention to the use of [[inertial platform]]s and Doppler radar systems, cancelling work on Cytac as well as a competing system known as Navarho.&lt;ref&gt;Gil McElroy, [http://www.jproc.ca/hyperbolic/loran_c_history.html "Loran-C History']&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this period the Navy began work on a similar system using combined pulse and phase comparison, but based on the existing LORAN frequency of 200&amp;nbsp;kHz. By this time the Navy had handed operational control of the LORAN system to the Coast Guard, and it was assumed the same arrangement would be true for any new system as well. Thus the Coast Guard was given the choice of naming the systems, and decided to rename the existing system Loran-A, and the new system Loran-B.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|p=xi.}}

With Cytac fully developed and its test system on the US east coast mothballed, the Navy also decided to re-commission Cytac for tests in the long-range role. An extensive series of tests across the Atlantic were carried out by the USCGC ''Androscoggin'' (WHEC-68) starting in April 1956. Meanwhile, Loran-B proved to have serious problems keeping their transmitters in phase, and that work was abandoned.{{efn|Very little information on Loran-B is available in the public record, and any reasons for its failure even less so.}} Minor changes were made to the Cytac systems to further simplify it, including a reduction in the pulse-chain spacing from 1200 to 1000&amp;nbsp;µs, the pulse rate changed to 20&amp;nbsp;[[pulse per second|pps]] to match the existing Loran-A system, and the phase-shifting between pulses to an alternating 0, 180 degree shift instead of 45 degrees at every pulse within the chain.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=72}}

The result was Loran-C. Testing of the new system was intensive, and overwater flights around [[Bermuda]] demonstrated that 50% of fixes lay within a {{convert|260|foot|m}} circle.{{sfn|Hefley|1972|pp=78}} This was a dramatic improvement over the original Loran-A, meeting the accuracy of the Gee system but at much greater range. The first chain were set up using the original experimental Cytac system, along with a second in the Mediterranean in 1957. Further chains covering the North Atlantic and large areas of the Pacific followed. At the time global charts were printed with shaded sections representing the area where a {{convert|3|mile|km}} accurate fix could be obtained under most operational conditions.

===Improving systems===
Loran-C had originally been designed to be highly automated, allowing the system to be operated more rapidly than the original LORAN's multi-minute measurement. It was also operated in "chains" of linked stations, allowing a fix to be made by simultaneously comparing two slaves to a single master. The downside of this approach was that the required electronic equipment, built using 1950s-era tube technology, was very large. Looking for companies with knowledge of seaborne, multi-channel phase-comparison electronics led, ironically, to Decca, who built the AN/SPN-31, the first widely used Loran-C receiver. The AN/SPN-31 weighed over {{convert|100|lbs|kg}} and had 52 controls.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=310}}

Airborne units followed, and an adapted AN/SPN-31 was tested in an [[Avro Vulcan]] in 1963. By the mid-1960s, units with some transistorization were becoming more common, and a chain was set up in [[Viet Nam]] to support the US [[Vietnam War|war efforts]] there. A number of commercial airline operators experimented with the system as well, using it for navigation on the [[great circle]] route between North America and Europe. However, [[inertial platform]]s ultimately became more common in this role.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=310}}

In 1969, Decca sued the Navy for patent infringement, producing ample documentation of their work on the basic concept as early as 1944, along with the "missing" 9f frequency{{efn|Blanchard uses 7f and 9f on different pages.}} at 98&amp;nbsp;kHz that had been set aside for experiments using this system. Decca won the initial suit, but the judgement was overturned on appeal when the Navy claimed "wartime expediency".{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=311}}

===Loran-D and -F===
When Loran-C became widespread, the USAF once again became interested in using it as a guidance system. They proposed a new system layered on top of Loran-C, using it as the coarse guidance signal in much the same way that pulses were the coarse guidance and phase-comparison used for fine. To provide an extra-fine guidance signal, '''Loran-D''' interleaved another train of eight pulses immediately after the signals from one of the existing Loran-C stations, folding the two signals together. This technique became known as "Supernumary Interpulse Modulation" (SIM). These were broadcast from low-power portable transmitters, offering relatively short-range service of high accuracy.&lt;ref name=leave&gt;George Galdorisi and Thomas Phillips, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNSQm05eFy4C&amp;pg=PA391 "Leave No Man Behind"], MBI Publishing, 2009, pg. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loran-D was used only experimentally during war-games in the 1960s from a transmitter set in the UK. The system was also used in a limited fashion during the [[Vietnam War]], combined with the Pave Spot [[laser designator]] system, a combination known as Pave Nail. Using mobile transmitters, the AN/ARN-92 LORAN navigation receiver could achieve accuracy on the order of {{convert|60|feet|m}}, which the Spot system improved to about {{convert|20|feet|m}}.&lt;ref name=leave/&gt; The SIM concept became a system for sending additional data.&lt;ref&gt;James Caffery, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vbAf4OPAnGoC&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=%22Loran-D%22&amp;pg=PA6 "Wireless Location in CDMA Cellular Radio Systems"], Springer, 2000, pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrel Whitcomb, [http://www.loran-history.info/Operation_Tight_Reign/PAVE%20NAIL.pdf "PAVE NAIL: there at the beginning of the precision weapons revolutions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530065238/http://www.loran-history.info/Operation_Tight_Reign/PAVE%20NAIL.pdf |date=30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, [[Motorola]] proposed a new system using pseudo-random pulse-chains. This mechanism ensures that no two chains within a given period (on the order of many seconds) will have the same pattern, making it easy to determine if the signal is a groundwave from a recent transmission or a multi-hop signal from a previous one. The system, '''Multi-User Tactical Navigation Systems''' (MUTNS) was used briefly but it was found that Loran-D met the same requirements but had the added advantage of being a standard Loran-C signal as well. Although MUTNS was unrelated to the Loran systems, it was sometimes referred to as '''Loran-F'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ko5KAAAAYAAJ "Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual Technical Symposium"], pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
In spite of its many advantages, the high cost of implementing a Loran-C receiver made it uneconomical for many users. Additionally, as military users upgraded from Loran-A to Loran-C, large numbers of surplus Loran-A receivers were dumped on the market. This made Loran-A popular in spite of being less accurate and fairly difficult to operate. By the early 1970s the introduction of [[integrated circuit]]s combining a complete radio receiver began to greatly reduce the complexity of Loran-A measurements, and fully automated units the size of a [[Receiver (radio)|stereo receiver]] became common. For those users requiring higher accuracy, Decca had considerable success with their Decca Navigator system, and produced units that combined both receivers, using Loran to eliminate the ambiguities in Decca.

The same rapid development of microelectronics that made Loran-A so easy to operate worked equally well on the Loran-C signals, and the obvious desire to have a long-range system that could also provide enough accuracy for lake and harbour navigation led to the "opening" of the Loran-C system to public use in 1974. Civilian receivers quickly followed, and dual-system A/C receivers were also common for a time. The switch from A to C was extremely rapid, due largely to rapidly falling prices which led to many users' first receiver being Loran-C. By the late 1970s the Coast Guard decided to turn off Loran-A, in favour of adding additional Loran-C stations to cover gaps is its coverage. The original Loran-A network was shut down in 1979 and 1980, with a few units used in the Pacific for some time. Given the widespread availability of Loran-A charts, many Loran-C receivers included a system for converting coordinates between A and C units.

One of the reasons for Loran-C's opening to the public was the move from Loran to new forms of navigation, including INS, [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] and [[OMEGA Navigation System|OMEGA]], meant that the security of Loran was no longer as stringent as it was as a primary form of navigation. As these newer systems gave way to GPS through the 1980s and 90s, this process repeated itself, but this time the military was able to separate GPS's signals in such a way that it could provide both secure military and insecure civilian signals at the same time. GPS was more difficult to receive and decode, but by the 1990s the required electronics were already as small and inexpensive as Loran-C, leading to rapid adoption that has become largely universal.

===Loran-C in the 21st century===
Although Loran-C was largely redundant by 2000, it has not universally disappeared {{as of|2014|lc=y}} due to a number of concerns. One is that the GPS system can be jammed through a variety of means; although the same is true of Loran-C, the transmitters are close-at-hand and can be adjusted if need be. More importantly, there are effects that might cause the GPS system to become unusable over wide areas, notably [[space weather]] events and potential [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] events. Loran, located entirely under the atmosphere, offers more resilience to these sorts of issues. There has been considerable debate about the relative merits of keeping the Loran-C system operational as a result of considerations like these.

In November 2009, the [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] announced that Loran-C is not needed by the U.S. for maritime navigation. This decision left the fate of LORAN and eLORAN in the U.S. to the Secretary of the [[Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref name="dhs"&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/LORAN-letter-secretary-napolitano-9124 Senate committee letter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212021228/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/LORAN-letter-secretary-napolitano-9124 |date=12 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Per a subsequent announcement, the U.S. Coast Guard, in accordance with the DHS Appropriations Act, terminated the transmission of all U.S. LORAN-C signals on 8 February 2010.&lt;ref name="USCG LORAN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=loranMain|title=LORAN-C General Information|work=|accessdate=4 August 2010|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2010 the U.S. transmission of the Russian American signal was terminated,&lt;ref name="USCG LORAN"/&gt; and on 3 August 2010 all Canadian signals were shut down by the USCG and the CCG.&lt;ref name="USCG LORAN"/&gt;&lt;ref name=can&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.notmar.gc.ca/go.php?doc=eng/services/notmar/Loran-C-eng |title=Termination of the Loran-C Service |work=notmar.gc.ca |accessdate=4 August 2010}} (for access click on "I have read..." and "Accept")&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] had decided that the potential security advantages of Loran are worthy not only of keeping the system operational, but upgrading it and adding new stations. This is part of the wider [[Eurofix]] system which combines GPS, [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] and nine Loran stations into a single integrated system.

However, in 2014, Norway and France both announced that all of their remaining transmitters, which make up a significant part of the Eurofix system, will be shut down on 31 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://kartverket.no/efs-documents/editions/2015/efs01-2015.pdf, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; The two remaining transmitters in Europe ([[Anthorn Radio Station|Anthorn]], UK and [[LORAN-C transmitter Rantum|Sylt]], Germany) will no longer be able to sustain a positioning and navigation Loran service, with the result that the UK announced its trial eLoran service would be discontinued from the same date.

[[File:Crude LORAN diagram.svg|thumb|right|A crude diagram of the LORAN principle—the difference between the time of reception of synchronized signals from radio stations A and B is constant along each hyperbolic curve; when demarcated on a map, such curves are known as "TD lines".  "TD" stands for "Time Difference".]]
In conventional navigation, measuring one's location, or ''taking a fix'', is accomplished by taking two measurements against well known locations. In optical systems this is typically accomplished by measuring the angle to two landmarks, and then drawing lines on a [[nautical chart]] at those angles, producing an intersection that reveals the ship's location. Radio methods can also use the same concept with the aid of a [[radio direction finder]], but due to the nature of radio propagation, such instruments are subject to significant errors, especially at night. More accurate radio navigation can be made using pulse timing or phase comparison techniques, which rely on the time-of-flight of the signals. In comparison to angle measurements, these remain fairly steady over time, and most of the effects that change these values are fixed objects like rivers and lakes that can be accounted for on charts.

Timing systems can reveal the absolute distance to an object, as is the case in [[radar]]. The problem in the navigational case is that the receiver has to know when the original signal was sent. In theory, one could synchronize an accurate clock to the signal before leaving port, and then use that to compare the timing of the signal during the voyage. However, in the 1940s no suitable system was available that could hold an accurate signal over the time span of an operational mission.

Instead, radio navigation systems adopted the ''[[multilateration]]'' concept. which is based on the difference in times (or phase) instead of the absolute time. The basic idea is that it is relatively easy to synchronize two ground stations, using a signal shared over a phone line for instance, so one can be sure that the signals received were sent at exactly the same time. They will not be received at exactly the same time, however, as the receiver will receive the signal from the closer station first. Timing the difference between two signals can be easily accomplished, first by physically measuring them on a [[cathode ray tube]], or simple electronics in the case of phase comparison.

The difference in signal timing does not reveal the location by itself. Instead, it determines a series of locations where that timing is possible. For instance, if the two stations are 300&amp;nbsp;km apart and the receiver measures no difference in the two signals, that implies that the receiver is somewhere along a line equidistant between the two. If the signal from one is received exactly 100&amp;nbsp;µs, then the receiver is {{convert|30|km}} closer to one station than the other. Plotting all the locations where one station is 30&amp;nbsp;km closer than the other produces a curved line. Taking a fix is accomplished by making two such measurements with different pairs of stations, and then looking up both curves on a navigational chart. The curves are known as ''lines of position'' or LOP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Appleyard, S.F. |author2=Linford, R.S. |author3=Yarwood, P.J.| title=Marine Electronic Navigation (2nd Edition) |year=1988 | publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul| pages=77–83 | isbn=0-7102-1271-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, radio navigation systems normally use a ''chain'' of three or four stations, all synchronized to a ''master'' signal that is broadcast from one of the stations. The others, the ''secondaries'', are positioned so their LOPs cross at acute angles, which increases the accuracy of the fix. So for instance, a given chain might have four stations with the master in the center, allowing a receiver to pick the signals from two secondaries that are currently as close to right angles as possible given their current location. Modern systems, which know the locations of all the broadcasters, can automate which stations to pick.

===LORAN method===
[[File:loran pulse.svg|thumb|left|LORAN pulse]]
In the case of LORAN, one station remains constant in each application of the principle, the ''primary'', being paired up separately with two other ''secondary'' stations. Given two secondary stations, the time difference (TD) between the primary and first secondary identifies one curve, and the time difference between the primary and second secondary identifies another curve, the intersections of which will determine a [[geographic]] point in relation to the position of the three stations. These curves are referred to as ''TD lines''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/maritime/?epi_menuItemID=c56aa099e2bff9525b2a7fbd3227a759&amp;epi_menuID=35ad5b8aabcefa1a0fc133443927a759&amp;epi_baseMenuID=e106a3b5e50edce1fec24fd73927a759 The American Practical Navigator, An Epitome of Navigation, page 173] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201173931/http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/maritime/?epi_menuItemID=c56aa099e2bff9525b2a7fbd3227a759&amp;epi_menuID=35ad5b8aabcefa1a0fc133443927a759&amp;epi_baseMenuID=e106a3b5e50edce1fec24fd73927a759 |date=1 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, LORAN is implemented in integrated regional [[phased array|arrays]], or ''chains'', consisting of one ''primary'' station and at least two (but often more) ''secondary''  stations, with a uniform ''group repetition interval'' (GRI) defined in [[microsecond]]s. The amount of time before transmitting the next set of pulses is defined by the distance between the start of transmission of primary to the next start of transmission of primary signal.

The secondary stations receive this pulse signal from the primary, then wait a preset number of [[millisecond]]s, known as the ''secondary coding [[Propagation delay|delay]]'', to transmit a response signal. In a given chain, each secondary's coding delay is different, allowing for separate identification of each secondary's signal. (In practice, however, modern LORAN receivers do not rely on this for secondary identification.){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===LORAN chains (GRIs)===
[[File:LORAN Station Malone-Outside-Large.jpg|thumb|right|LORAN Station Malone, [[Malone, Florida]] Great Lakes chain (GRI 8970)/Southeast U.S. chain (GRI 7980)]]
Every LORAN chain in the world uses a unique Group Repetition Interval, the number of which, when multiplied by ten, gives how many microseconds pass between pulses from a given station in the chain. (In practice, the delays in many, but not all, chains are multiples of 100 microseconds.) LORAN chains are often referred to by this designation (e.g., GRI 9960, the designation for the LORAN chain serving the Northeast [[United States]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Due to the nature of hyperbolic curves, a particular combination of a primary and two secondary stations can possibly result in a "grid" where the grid lines intersect at shallow angles. For ideal positional accuracy, it is desirable to operate on a navigational grid where the grid lines are closer to right angles ([[orthogonal]]) to each other. As the receiver travels through a chain, a certain selection of secondaries whose TD lines initially formed a near-orthogonal grid can become a grid that is significantly skewed. As a result, the selection of one or both secondaries should be changed so that the TD lines of the new combination are closer to right angles. To allow this, nearly all chains provide at least three, and as many as five, secondaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===LORAN charts===
[[File:New York Harbor Nautical Chart.jpg|thumb|200px|right|This nautical chart of [[New York City|New York]] Harbor includes LORAN-A TD lines. Note that the printed lines do not extend into inland waterway areas.]]
Where available, common marine [[nautical charts]] include visible representations of TD lines at regular intervals over water areas. The TD lines representing a given primary-secondary pairing are printed with distinct colors, and note the specific time difference indicated by each line.  On a nautical chart, the denotation for each Line of Position from a receiver, relative to axis and color, can be found at the bottom of the chart.  The color on official charts for stations and the timed-lines of position follow no specific conformance for the purpose of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO).  However, local chart producers may color these in a specific conformance to their standard.  Always consult the chart notes, administrations Chart1 reference, and information given on the chart for the most accurate information regarding surveys, datum, and reliability.&lt;!--Most of this sounds like it was copied verbatim from a disclaimer on a chart, and doesn't really say anything useful, that couldn't be said by "there is no standard for the colors used for the lines" --&gt;

There are three major factors when considering signal delay and [[Radio propagation|propagation]] in relation to LORAN-C:
#Primary Phase Factor (PF)&amp;nbsp;– This allows for the fact that the speed of the propagated signal in the atmosphere is slightly lower than in a  vacuum.
#Secondary Phase Factor (SF)&amp;nbsp;– This allows for the fact that the speed of propagation of the signal is slowed when traveling over the seawater because of the greater conductivity of seawater compared to land.
#Additional Secondary Factors (ASF)&amp;nbsp;– Because LORAN-C transmitters are mainly land based, the signal will travel partly over land and partly over seawater.  ASF may be treated as land and water segments, each with a uniform conductivity depending on whether the path is over land or water.

The chart notes should indicate whether ASF corrections have been made (Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) charts, for example, include them). Otherwise, the appropriate correction factors must be obtained before use.

Due to interference and propagation issues suffered from land features and artificial structures such as tall buildings, the accuracy of the LORAN signal can be degraded considerably in inland areas (see [[#Limitations|Limitations]]). As a result, nautical charts will not show TD lines in those areas, to prevent reliance on LORAN-C for navigation.

&lt;!--More gibberish deleted, that only seemed to say "there can be dashed lines on a chart"--&gt;
Traditional LORAN receivers display the time difference between each pairing of the primary and one of the two selected secondary stations, which is then used to find the appropriate TD line on the chart.  Modern LORAN receivers display latitude and longitude coordinates instead of time differences, and, with the advent of time difference comparison and electronics, provide improved accuracy and better position fixing, allowing the observer to plot their position on a nautical chart more easily. When using such coordinates, the [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]] used by the receiver (usually [[WGS84]]) must match that of the chart, or manual conversion calculations must be performed before the coordinates can be used.

==Timing and synchronization==
[[File:LORAN Station Malone-Cesiums-Large.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cesium atomic clocks]]

Each LORAN station is equipped with a suite of specialized equipment to generate the precisely timed signals used to modulate / drive the transmitting equipment.  Up to three commercial cesium [[atomic clocks]] are used to generate 5&amp;nbsp;MHz and [[pulse per second]] (or 1&amp;nbsp;Hz) signals that are used by timing equipment to generate the various GRI-dependent drive signals for the transmitting equipment.

While each U.S.-operated LORAN station is supposed to be synchronized to within 100&amp;nbsp;ns of [[UTC]], the actual accuracy achieved as of 1994 was within 500&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref name=LORANC2-6&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 2 ̣– LORAN-C Transmissions|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/loran/sigSpec/chapt2c.pdf|work=Specification of the Transmitted LORAN-C Signal / COMDTINST M16562.4A|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard|accessdate=4 September 2012|pages=6, 7|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmitters and antennas==
[[File:LORAN Station Malone-Transmitter Middle-Large.jpg|thumb|right|LORAN transmitter bank]]

LORAN-C transmitters operate at peak powers of 100–4,000&amp;nbsp;kilowatts, comparable to [[longwave]] broadcasting stations.  Most use 190–220&amp;nbsp;metre tall mast radiators, insulated from ground. The masts are inductively lengthened and fed by a [[loading coil]] (see: [[electrical lengthening]]). A well known-example of a station using such an antenna is [[LORAN-C transmitter Rantum|Rantum]]. Free-standing [[mast radiator|tower radiators]] in this height range are also used{{clarify|date=September 2012}}&lt;!--How is this supposed to be different than the sentence before last?--&gt;. [[LORAN-C transmitter Carolina Beach|Carolina Beach]] uses a free-standing antenna tower. Some LORAN-C transmitters with output powers of 1,000&amp;nbsp;kW and higher used [[supertall]] 412&amp;nbsp;metre mast radiators (see below). Other high power LORAN-C stations, like [[LORAN-C transmitter George|George]], used four T-antennas mounted on four guyed masts arranged in a square.

All LORAN-C antennas are designed to radiate an omnidirectional pattern. Unlike longwave broadcasting stations, LORAN-C stations cannot use backup antennas because the exact position of the antenna is a part of the navigation calculation. The slightly different physical location of a backup antenna would produce Lines of Position different from those of the primary antenna.

==Limitations==
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
LORAN suffers from electronic effects of weather and the ionospheric effects of sunrise and sunset. The most accurate signal is the [[groundwave]] that follows the Earth's surface, ideally over seawater. At night the indirect [[skywave]], bent back to the surface by the [[ionosphere]], is a problem as multiple signals may arrive via different paths ([[multipath interference]]). The ionosphere's reaction to sunrise and sunset accounts for the particular disturbance during those periods. [[Magnetic storm]]s have serious effects as with any radio based system.

LORAN uses ground-based transmitters that only cover certain regions.  Coverage is quite good in North America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.

The absolute accuracy of LORAN-C varies from {{convert|0.10|to|0.25|nmi|m|0|lk=in|abbr=on}}. Repeatable accuracy is much greater, typically from {{convert|60|to|300|ft|m|0|lk=in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;COMDTPUB P16562.6, "LORAN-C Users Handbook", 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==LORAN Data Channel (LDC)==
LORAN Data Channel (LDC) is a project underway between the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and [[United States Coast Guard|USCG]] to send low bit rate data using the LORAN system. Messages to be sent include station identification, absolute time, and position correction messages. In 2001, data similar to [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] correction messages were sent as part of a test of the Alaskan LORAN chain. As of November 2005, test messages using LDC were being broadcast from several U.S. LORAN stations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In recent years, LORAN-C has been used in Europe to send differential GPS and other messages, employing a similar method of transmission known as EUROFIX.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

A system called SPS (Saudi Positioning System), similar to EUROFIX, is in use in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  GPS differential corrections and GPS integrity information are added to the LORAN signal. A combined GPS/LORAN receiver is used, and if a GPS fix is not available it automatically switches over to LORAN.

==The future of LORAN==

As LORAN systems are maintained and operated by governments, their continued existence is subject to public policy. With the evolution of other electronic navigation systems, such as [[satellite navigation]] systems, funding for existing systems is not always assured.

Critics, who have called for the elimination of the system, state that the LORAN system has too few users, lacks cost-effectiveness, and that [[GNSS]] signals are superior to LORAN.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Supporters of continued and improved LORAN operation note that LORAN uses a strong signal, which is difficult to jam, and that LORAN is an independent, dissimilar, and complementary system to other forms of electronic navigation, which helps ensure availability of navigation signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loran.org/ILAArchive/eLoran%20Definition%20Document/eLoran%20Definition%20Document-1.0.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902092846/http://www.loran.org/ILAArchive/eLoran%20Definition%20Document/eLoran%20Definition%20Document-1.0.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 September 2009|title=Enhanced Loran (eloran) Definition Document|publisher=International Loran Association|work=|accessdate=18 July 2010|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7459213.stm  "GPS back-up 'needs more research' "]. [[bbc.co.uk]], 20 June 2008, Retrieved 5 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2009, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget released the first blueprint for the [[2010 United States federal budget|Financial Year 2010 budget]].&lt;ref&gt;Office of Management and Budget. ( www.budget.gov), "A New Era of Responsibility Renewing America's Promise"  The FY 2010 Budget, Department of Homeland Security Section, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; This document identified the LORAN-C system as “outdated” and supported its termination at an estimated savings of $36 million in 2010 and $190 million over five years. 

On 21 April 2009 the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released inputs to the FY 2010 Concurrent Budget Resolution with backing for the continued support for the LORAN system, acknowledging the investment already made in infrastructure upgrades and recognizing the studies performed and multi-departmental conclusion that eLORAN is the best backup to GPS.

Senator Jay Rockefeller, Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, wrote that the committee recognized the priority in "Maintaining LORAN-C while transitioning to eLORAN" as means of enhancing the national security, marine safety and environmental protection missions of the Coast Guard.

Senator Collins, the ranking member on the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs wrote that the President's budget overview proposal to terminate the LORAN-C system is inconsistent with the recent investments, recognized studies and the mission of the U.S. Coast Guard. The committee also recognizes the $160 million investment already made toward upgrading the LORAN-C system to support the full deployment of eLORAN.

Further, the Committees also recognize the many studies which evaluated GPS backup systems and concluded both the need to back up GPS and identified eLORAN as the best and most viable backup. "This proposal is inconsistent with the recently released (January 2009) Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP), which was jointly prepared by DHS and the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Transportation (DOT). The FRP proposed the eLORAN program to serve as a Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) backup to GPS (Global Positioning System)."

On 7 May 2009, President Barack Obama proposed cutting funding (approx. $35 million/year) for LORAN, citing its redundancy alongside GPS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/05/obama_budget_cu.html Obama: Budget cuts add up to 'real money']&lt;/ref&gt;  In regard to the pending Congressional bill, H.R. 2892, it was subsequently announced that "[t]he Administration supports the Committee's aim to achieve an orderly termination through a phased decommissioning beginning in January 2010, and the requirement that certifications be provided to document that the LORAN-C termination will not impair maritime safety or the development of possible GPS backup capabilities or needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node/77531&amp;id=9008247 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723173756/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/congress/?q=node/77531&amp;id=9008247 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2012 |title=H.R. 2892--Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 |date=8 July 2009 |publisher=C-SPAN.org |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 7 May 2009, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, released a report citing the very real potential for the GPS system to degrade or fail in light of program delays which have resulted in scheduled GPS satellite launches slipping by up to three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-670T&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2009 the March 2007 Independent Assessment Team (IAT) report on LORAN was released to the public.  In its report the ITA stated that it "unanimously recommends that the U.S. government complete the eLORAN upgrade and commit to eLORAN as the national backup to GPS for 20 years."  The release of the report followed an extensive Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) battle waged by industry representatives against the federal government.  Originally completed 20 March 2007 and presented to the co-sponsoring Department of Transportation and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Executive Committees, the report carefully considered existing navigation systems, including GPS.  The unanimous recommendation for keeping the LORAN system and upgrading to eLORAN was based on the team's conclusion that LORAN is operational, deployed and sufficiently accurate to supplement GPS.  The team also concluded that the cost to decommission the LORAN system would exceed the cost of deploying eLORAN, thus negating any stated savings as offered by the Obama administration and revealing the vulnerability of the U.S. to GPS disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sidt.gpsworld.com/gpssidt/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=597861 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529024126/http://sidt.gpsworld.com/gpssidt/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=597861 |archivedate=29 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that the LORAN-C stations under its control would be closed down for budgetary reasons after 4 January 2010 provided the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security certified that LORAN is not needed as a backup for GPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

On 7 January 2010, Homeland Security published a notice of the permanent discontinuation of LORAN-C operation.  Effective 2000 UTC 8 February 2010, the United States Coast Guard terminated all operation and broadcast of LORAN-C signals in the USA.  The U.S. Coast Guard transmission of the Russian American CHAYKA signal was terminated on 1 August 2010. The transmission of Canadian LORAN-C signals was terminated on 3 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=loranMain&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the US Coast Guard has reported several episodes of GPS interference in the Black Sea. South Korea has claimed that North Korea has jammed GPS near the border, interfering with airplanes and ships. By 2018, the United States will build a new eLoran system as a complement to and backup for the GPS system. And the South Korean government has already pushed plans to have three eLoran beacons active by 2019, which is enough to provide accurate corrections for all shipments in the region if North Korea (or anyone else) tries to block GPS again.&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/08/radio-navigation-set-to-make-global-return-as-gps-backup-because-cyber/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gps.gov/policy/legislation/loran-c/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gps.gov/governance/advisory/meetings/2014-06/narins.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

eLORAN: The UK government has granted approval for seven differential eLoran ship-positioning technology stations to be built along the south and east coasts of the UK to help counter the threat of jamming of global positioning systems. They are set to reach initial operational capability by summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Nautilus International Newspaper August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs) of the UK and Ireland announced October 31 the initial operational capability of UK maritime eLoran. Seven differential reference stations now provide additional position, navigation, and timing (PNT) information via low-frequency pulses to ships fitted with eLoran receivers. The service will help ensure they can navigate safely in the event of GPS failure in one of the busiest shipping regions in the world, with expected annual traffic of 200,000 vessels by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;GPS World. December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these plans, in light of the decision by France and Norway to cease Loran transmissions on 31 December 2015, the UK announced at the start of that month that its eLoran service would be discontinued on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Lovecraft Country.svg|thumb|300px|Detailed map of Lovecraft Country]]
'''Lovecraft Country''' is a term coined by [[Keith Herber]] for the [[New England]] setting, combining real and fictitious locations, used by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] in many of his [[weird fiction]] stories, and later elaborated by other writers working in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. The term was popularized by [[Chaosium]], the producers of the Lovecraftian [[role-playing game]] ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]''. Lovecraft scholar [[S. T. Joshi]] refers to the area as the '''"Miskatonic region"''', after its fictional [[Miskatonic River|river]] and [[Miskatonic University|university]],&lt;ref&gt;''More Annotated H. P. Lovecraft'', S.T. Joshi and Peter Cannon&lt;/ref&gt; while Lovecraft biographer [[Lin Carter]] calls it '''Miskatonic County''',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos]]'', Lin Carter&lt;/ref&gt; though Lovecraft indicates that at least some of his fictional towns were located in the real-life [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]] of [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Shadow Over Innsmouth", "Dreams in the Witch House".&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 1998 supplement ''Dead Reckonings'', Chaosium defined Lovecraft Country as "a land located in the northeast of [[Massachusetts]]. The most important portion stretches along the [[Miskatonic River]] valley, from [[Dunwich (Lovecraft)|Dunwich]] in the far west to where it enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[Arkham]], [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]], and Martin's Beach."&lt;ref&gt;''Dead Reckonings'', Kevin Ross &amp; Shannon Appel eds.&lt;/ref&gt; These locations, along with [[Innsmouth]], are a list of the most significant locations in Lovecraft Country.

Sometimes the phrase is used in a more inclusive sense, encompassing not only northeastern Massachusetts but also the southern hills of [[Vermont]] (the setting of ''[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]'') as well as Lovecraft's hometown of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where he set such works as ''[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward]]'' and ''[[The Haunter of the Dark]]''.

==Lovecraft's fiction==

[[Image:Lovecraft country.jpg|thumb|300 px|Map of Lovecraft country.]]

Lovecraft first used a New England setting in his [[1920 in literature|1920]] short story "[[The Terrible Old Man]]", set in [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]]. "[[The Picture in the House]]" (written later in 1920), is the first of his stories to mention both Arkham and the Miskatonic Valley.  The story begins with something of a manifesto for why the New England countryside is a fitting backdrop for his horror stories:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the true epicure of the terrible, to whom a new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and justification of existence, esteem most of all the ancient, lonely farmhouses of backwoods New England; for there the dark elements of strength, solitude, grotesqueness, and ignorance combine to form the perfection of the hideous."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/fiction/ph.asp "H. P. Lovecraft's 'The Picture in the House'"], The H. P. Lovecraft Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1930 letter to [[Robert E. Howard]], Lovecraft attempted to explain his fascination with New England as a setting for [[weird fiction]]: "It is the night-black [[Massachusetts]] legendary which packs the really macabre 'kick'. Here is material for a really profound study in group neuroticism; for certainly, none can deny the existence of a profoundly morbid streak in the Puritan imagination." &lt;ref&gt;''The Annotated Lovecraft'', Joshi and Cannon, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovecraft first mentioned Arkham's [[Miskatonic University]] in "[[Herbert West–Reanimator]]", written in 1921-1922. He added Dunwich to his imaginary landscape in 1928's "[[The Dunwich Horror]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythostomes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=70 ''The Dunwich Horror,'' by H. P. Lovecraft.] Lovecraft's original story featuring Dunwich.&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded it to include Innsmouth in 1931's ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythostomes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=75 ''The Shadow over Innsmouth,'' by H. P. Lovecraft.] Lovecraft's original story featuring Innsmouth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Lovecraft stories that make use of Lovecraft Country settings include "[[The Festival (short story)|The Festival]]", "[[The Colour out of Space]]", "[[The Strange High House in the Mist]]", "[[The Dreams in the Witch House]]", and "[[The Thing on the Doorstep]]".

==Derleth's additions==

[[August Derleth]], Lovecraft's friend and literary executor, discouraged other Cthulhu Mythos writers from setting their stories in Lovecraft's New England. But he himself attempted to fill in the blanks of the setting, particularly in his posthumous "collaborations" with Lovecraft &amp;mdash; actually Derleth's stories based on fragments, notes or ideas that Lovecraft left behind after his death.

''[[The Lurker at the Threshold]]'' is set in [[John Billington|Billington's Wood]], a fictional forest north of Arkham, while "Witches' Hollow" takes place in the titular valley in the hills to the west of the town. The title of "The Fisherman of Falcon Point" refers to a promontory on the Atlantic coast south of Innsmouth. "Wentworth's Day" and "The Horror from the Middle Span" take place in the area north of Dunwich, while "The Gable Window" concerns a house on the Aylesbury Pike.

==Roleplaying games==

Between 1990 and 1998, Chaosium released a number of Lovecraft Country gamebooks for the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' roleplaying game, series created by author/editor [[Keith Herber]]. Most were background supplements which codified descriptions of Lovecraft's named cities, but there were also a number of adventure books. These included:

* ''Arkham Unveiled'' (1990)
* ''Return to Dunwich'' (1991)
* ''Kingsport: The City in the Mist'' (1991)
* ''Escape from Innsmouth'' (1992)
* ''Adventures in Arkham Country'' (1993)
* ''Miskatonic University'' (1994)
* ''Tales of the Miskatonic Valley''
* ''Dead Reckonings'' (1998)
* ''Before the Fall'' (1998)
* ''Children of the Deep'' (unreleased sequel that explored Innsmouth after its fall described in ''Escape from Innsmouth'')

Some of the books have been rereleased in the 2000s (''H.P. Lovecraft's Dunwich'', ''H.P. Lovecraft's Arkham'', and ''H.P. Lovecraft's Kingsport'').

[[Skotos]], an online game company, has licensed Chaosium's Lovecraft Country material. They have produced two games, ''Lovecraft Country: The Tomb of the Desert God'' and ''Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night'', as well as a comic, ''Lovecraft Country: Return to Arkham'', written by Shannon Appelcline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovecraftcountry.com/comic/ Skotos: Lovecraft Country]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, following Chaosium's expanded licensing program for ''Call of Cthulhu'', [[Keith Herber]] and Tom Lynch established Miskatonic River Press. The publisher's first release, ''New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley'', which marked both Herber's return to ''Call of Cthulhu'' and Lovecraft Country was announced published in 2009.

==Other uses==

The phrase ''Lovecraft Country'' is now used outside of the Cthulhu gaming community. ''Return to Lovecraft Country'' was a collection of short stories set in "the New England of H.P. Lovecraft", published by Triad Entertainments in 1996. The editor, Scott David Aniolowski, has also done editorial work for Chaosium. ''Eternal Lovecraft'', a short-story collection published by Golden Gryphon Press in 1998, has a section called "Lovecraft Country". ''Lovecraft Country'' was the title of a 2016 novel by [[Matt Ruff]].

The phrase occurs in popular discussions of Lovecraft's connection to the region. The ''[[Harvard Law Record]]'' used the phrase in an October 20, 2005 article: 

{{bquote|Many Lovecraft stories take place in "Lovecraft Country"--the fictional North Shore towns of Arkham, Innsmouth, Kingsport, and Dunwich (perhaps fictional equivalents of Ipswich, Salem/Danvers, Marblehead, or Newburyport).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110717135850/http://www.hlrecord.org/2.4462/spirit-of-lovecraft-haunts-cambridge-new-england-1.579111 "Spirit of Lovecraft Haunts Cambridge, New England", Dan Alban, ''The Record'', October 20, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Milan at Night.JPG|thumb|The Milan metropolitan area as seen from the [[International Space Station]] (North roughly on the top side)]]
The '''Milan metropolitan area''', also known as '''Grande Milano''' ("Greater Milan"), is the largest [[metropolitan area]] in [[Italy]] and the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|54th largest]] in the world. The metropolitan area descripted in this article is strictly statistical and, contrary to the administrative [[Metropolitan City of Milan]], a provincial-level municipality, does not imply any kind of administrative unity or function.

== Definition ==
{{Original research section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Milan metropolitan area map.jpg|thumb|Milan metropolitan area within northern Italy, as identified by [[OECD]].]]

Given the absence of an official statistical definition for the metropolitan area of Milan, tracing precise boundaries is a somewhat slippery issue.  However, during the last decade, a number of studies have been carried out on the subject by some authoritative institutions and scholars, notably the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and numerous Italian sources that build a definition based on commuting fluxes and on the concentration of commercial, leisure and public utility services. A broad consensus exists upon a definition that includes the central [[Lombardy|Lombard]] provinces of [[Province of Milan|Milan]], [[Province of Bergamo|Bergamo]], [[Province of Como|Como]], [[Province of Lecco|Lecco]], [[Province of Lodi|Lodi]], [[Province of Monza and Brianza|Monza and Brianza]], [[Province of Pavia|Pavia]], [[Province of Varese|Varese]] and the [[Piedmont]]ese [[Province of Novara]], while some scholars include also the [[Province of Cremona]] and [[Brescia]] in Lombardy and the [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilian]] [[Province of Piacenza]]. The overall population under the narrowest definition is about 8.2 million over an area of about {{convert|13,000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Territorial Reviews: Milan, Italy|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/0406051e.pdf?expires=1507932227&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=B5BA963FD86510E20FCA2F7A657C1811|publisher=[[OECD]]|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campagna et al.|first1=Michele|title=Planning Support Tools: Policy Analysis, Implementation and Evaluation.

'''Municipal road''' or '''municipal way''' is or was a [[Hierarchy of roads|category of roads]] which are owned and/or maintained by municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/municipal+road|title=municipal road definition {{!}} English dictionary for learners {{!}} Reverso|website=dictionary.reverso.net|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, transit sections of higher-class roads through the built-up area is counted as part of the higher-class road, not as a municipal road. Some countries use the term [[local road]] or [[local communication]] in similar sense.

== Situation in various countries ==
* [[Gemeindestraße]] in [[Germany]]. There are distinguished Ortsstraßen (local roads) in built-up area and Gemeindeverbindungsstraßen (GVS, roads of municipal connection) for connection of municipalities or municipal parts. GVSs exist in several bundeslands only, e.g. [[Bavaria]] and  [[Baden-Württemberg]].
* Gemeindestraße in [[Austria]] 
* Gemeindestraße in [[Switzerland]]; this classification express who is the administrator only; it is indepedent on the importance classification (main roads, secondary roads). 
* [[route communale]] in France
* [[strada comunale]] in [[Italy]]
* [[drum comunale]] (DC) in [[Romania]]
* [[droga gminna]] in [[Poland]]; municipal road can belong to one of 5 classes by traffic importance: GP (drogi główne ruchu przyspieszonego; main roads of accelerated traffic), G (drogi główne, main roads), Z (drogi zbiorcze, collection roads), L (drogi lokalne, local roads), D (drogi dojazdowe, access roads). A municipal road cannot belong to categories S (drogi ekspresowe, expressways) nor A (autostrady, freeways). 
* [[obecní silnice]] or [[obecní cesta]] in [[Czech lands]] and [[Slovakia]] (in [[Czechoslovakia]] until 1961), Zakarpattia and other countries of Austria-Hungary; municipalities were constituted in 1850 in Austria-Hungary; road law was created separately for individual countries of the empire (Bohemia, Moravia, Czech Silesia etc.) in 1860s and 1870s. In Czechoslovakia (and consequently in separated Czechia and Slovakia), the term was replaced with the new concept "[[místní komunikace]]" ([[local communication]]) since 1961. 
* Municipal Road information for Victoria [[Australia]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/road-network-and-performance/types-of-roads/victorias-road-network&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NIFS.png|thumb|250px|Main active strands of the North Island Fault System]]
The '''North Island Fault System''' or '''North Island Dextral Fault Belt''' is a set of southwest-northeast trending [[active fault|seismically-active faults]] in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]] that carry most of the dextral (right lateral) [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] component of the oblique convergence of the [[Pacific Plate]] with the [[Australian Plate]]. They include the [[Wairarapa Fault]] and [[Wellington Fault]] to the southwest, the Ruahine and Mohaka Faults in the central section and the Waimana, Waiotahi, Whakatane and Waiohau Faults to the northeast. Most of the fault system consists of dextral strike-slip faults, although towards its northeastern end the trend swings to more S-N trend and the faults become mainly oblique normal in sense as the zone intersects with the Taupo rift zone. This fault zone accommodates up to 10&amp;nbsp;mm/yr of strike-slip displacement.&lt;ref name="Mouslopoulou"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mouslopoulou|first1=V.|last2=Nicol|first2=A.|last3=Little|first3=T.A.|author4=Begg J.A.|editor=Reicherter K., Michetti A.M. &amp; Silva P.G.|title=Palaeoseismology: historical and prehistorical records of earthquake ground effects for seismic hazard assessment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kwd1tbI64oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Palaeoseismology:+Historical+and+Prehistorical+Records+of+Earthquake+Ground+Effects+for+Seismic+Hazard+Assessment&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N1qoTK2yCIjtOdy8pLkM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2010|series=Special Publications|volume=316|year=2009|publisher=Geological Society|location=London|isbn=978-1-86239-276-2|pages=269–292|chapter=Palaeoearthquake surface rupture in a transition zone from strike-slip to oblique-normal slip and its implications to seismic hazard, North Island Fault System, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faults==
The North Island Fault System consists of eight main fault strands and many smaller related faults.

===Mohaka Fault===
The more southeasterly branch of the Wellington Fault is known as the Mohaka fault. The fault splays to the north, onto the Waimana Fault, which itself branches into the Waiotahi and Waioeka Faults, the main segment of the Mohaka Fault eventually passes into the Whakatane Fault.&lt;ref name="Mouslopoulou"/&gt;

===Ruahine Fault===
As the Wellington Fault branches near Woodville, the more northwesterly branch is known as the Ruahine Fault. Results from trenching over this fault suggest an earthquake recurrence interval of 400&amp;ndash;500 years, with typical offsets in the range 3.0&amp;ndash;5.5 m.&lt;ref name="Neall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eqc.govt.nz/research/researchpapers/p_971.aspx|title=The Neotectonics of the Ruahine and Mohaka Faults, between the Manawatu Gorge and Puketitiri and Figures to Accompany Final Prog|last=Neall|first=V.E.|author2=Hanson J.A. |work=Research Paper 971|publisher=Earthquake Commission|accessdate=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its northern end this fault becomes the Waiohau Fault.&lt;ref name="Mouslopoulou"/&gt;

===Waimana Fault===
{{Empty section|date=February 2014}}

===Waiohau Fault===
The Waiohau Fault extends from the end of the Ruahine Fault north towards the Bay of Plenty. It lies roughly parallel with, and to the west of, the Whakatane, Waimana, and Waiotahi Faults, and to the east of the Taupo Rift. At its southern end it is a [[dextral]] [[strike-slip]] fault, becoming a normal [[dip-slip]] fault for the northern part of its length. The valley of the [[Rangitaiki River]] approximately follows the line of the fault. The fault is believed to be responsible for an earthquake in 1866 which was centred near [[Te Mahoe]], east of [[Kawerau]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=aKk4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=waiohau+fault&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wVBp047rka&amp;sig=hU32WDrO5vBPe3ZCUS7qNquvqpg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiarvPBzL3QAhVDHJQKHVy7DGwQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=waiohau%20fault&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.544.6090&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wairarapa Fault===
{{main article|Wairarapa Fault}}
The Wairarapa Fault extends from near the coast just southwest of [[Lake Wairarapa]], running along the lake's northwestern edge. The [[1855 Wairarapa earthquake]] was caused by movement along this fault. The recurrence interval for large earthquakes on this fault is less than 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="NGS Science"/&gt;

===Wellington Fault===
{{main article|Wellington Fault}}
The Wellington Fault is a dextral strike-slip fault that runs from the [[Cook Strait]] on the southern coast of North Island up to near [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]], where the fault branches into the Mohaka and Ruahine Faults. No historical earthquakes have been recorded along this fault although a significant event is estimated to have occurred within the last 1,000 years. The recurrence interval for large earthquakes on this fault is estimated to be less than 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="NGS Science"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.gns.cri.nz/af/index.jsp|title=New Zealand Active Faults Database|last=NGS Science|accessdate=4 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929134052/http://data.gns.cri.nz/af/index.jsp|archivedate=29 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main segments have been identified, the Wellington-Hutt section, the Tararua section and the Pahiatua section.&lt;ref name="Langridge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langridge|first=R.M. |author2=Berryman K.R. |author3=van Dissen R.J. |year=2005|title=Defining the geometric segmentation and Holocene slip rate of the Wellington Fault, New Zealand: the Pahiatua section|journal=New Zealand Journal of Geology &amp; Geophysics|volume=48|pages=591–607 |doi=10.1080/00288306.2005.9515136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Dissen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Dissen|first=R.J.|author2=Berryman, K.R. |year=1996|title=Surface rupture earthquakes over the last ~1000 years in the Wellington region, New Zealand, and implications for ground shaking hazard|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|volume=101|issue=B3|pages=5999–6019|doi=10.1029/95jb02391 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1996/95JB02391.shtml|accessdate=4 October 2010|bibcode=1996JGR...101.5999V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pausanias''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɔː|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|i|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Παυσανίας}} ''Pausanías''; c. AD 110 – c. 180)&lt;ref&gt;Historical and Ethnological Society of Greece, Aristéa Papanicolaou Christensen, ''The Panathenaic Stadium – Its History Over the Centuries'' (2003), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Roman Greece|Greek]] traveler and [[geographer]] of the second century AD, who lived in the time of Roman emperors [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]]. He is famous for his ''Description of Greece'' ({{lang-grc|Ἑλλάδος Περιήγησις}}, ''Hellados Periegesis''),&lt;ref&gt;Also known in [[Latin]] as ''Graecae descriptio''; see [[:pt:Maria Helena da Rocha Pereira|Pereira, Maria Helena Rocha]] (ed.), [https://archive.org/details/pausaniaegraeci00pausgoog ''Graecae descriptio''], B. G. Teubner, 1829.&lt;/ref&gt; a lengthy work that describes [[ancient Greece]] from his first-hand observations. This work provides crucial information for making links between classical literature and [[modern archaeology]]. Andrew Stewart assesses him as:

&lt;blockquote&gt; A careful, pedestrian writer...interested not only in the grandiose or the exquisite but in unusual sights and obscure ritual. He is occasionally careless or makes unwarranted inferences, and his guides or even his own notes sometimes mislead him, yet his honesty is unquestionable, and his value without par.&lt;ref&gt;''One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works'', introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Biography ==
Pausanias was born in 110 AD into a [[Greek people|Greek]] family &lt;ref name="Howard 2012"&gt;{{cite book |title= Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies: The Role of Cross-Border Trade and Travel|last= Howard |first= Michael C |year= 2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn= 9780786490332 |quote= Pausanias was a 2nd century ethnic Greek geographer who wrote a description of Greece that is often described as being the world’s first travel guide.|page=178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was probably a native of [[Lydia]]; he was certainly familiar with the western coast of [[Asia Minor]], but his travels extended far beyond the limits of [[Ionia]]. Before visiting Greece, he had been to [[Antioch]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]], and [[Jerusalem]], and to the banks of the [[River Jordan]]. In [[Egypt]], he had seen the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]. While at the temple of [[Amun|Ammon]], he had been shown the hymn once sent to that shrine by [[Pindar]]. In [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], he appears to have seen the tomb said to be that of [[Orpheus]] in [[Libethra]] (modern [[Leivithra]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.30.7 Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'': Boeotia, 9.30.7]: "Going from [[Dium]] along the road to the mountain, and advancing twenty stades, you come to a pillar on the right surmounted by a stone urn, which according to the natives contains the bones of Orpheus."&lt;/ref&gt; Crossing over to [[Italy]], he had seen something of the cities of [[Campania]] and of the wonders of [[Rome]]. He was one of the first known to write of seeing the ruins of [[Troy]], [[Alexandria Troas]], and Mycenae.

== Work &lt;!--'Description of Greece' redirects here--&gt; ==
Pausanias' ''Description of Greece'' is in ten books, each dedicated to some portion of Greece. He begins his tour in [[Attica]] ({{lang|grc|Ἀττικά}}), where the city of Athens and its demes dominate the discussion. Subsequent books describe [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthia]] ({{lang|grc|Κορινθιακά}}) (second book), [[Sparta|Laconia]] ({{lang|grc|Λακωνικά}}) (third), [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenia]] ({{lang|grc|Μεσσηνιακά}}) (fourth), [[Elis]] ({{lang|grc|Ἠλιακῶν}}) (fifth and sixth), [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἀχαικά}}) (seventh), [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]] ({{lang|grc| Ἀρκαδικά}}) (eighth), [[Boetia#History|Boetia]] ({{lang|grc| Βοιωτικά}}) (ninth), [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]] ({{lang|grc| Φωκικά}}) and [[Ozolian Locris]] ({{lang|grc| Λοκρῶν Ὀζόλων}}) (tenth). The project is more than topographical; it is a cultural geography.  Pausanias digresses from the description of architectural and artistic objects to review the mythological and historical underpinnings of the society that produced them. As a Greek writing under the auspices of the Roman empire, he was in an awkward cultural space, between the glories of the Greek past he was so keen to describe and the realities of a Greece beholden to Rome as a dominating imperial force. His work bears the marks of his attempt to navigate that space and establish an identity for Roman Greece.

He is not a naturalist by any means, although from time to time, he does comment on the physical realities of the Greek landscape. He notices the pine trees on the sandy coast of [[Elis]], the deer and the wild boars in the oak woods of [[Seliana|Phelloe]], and the crows amid the giant oak trees of [[Alalcomenae (Boeotia)|Alalcomenae]]. It is mainly in the last section that Pausanias touches on the products of nature, such as the wild strawberries of [[Mount Helicon|Helicon]], the date palms of [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], and the olive oil of [[Tithorea]], as well as the tortoises of Arcadia and the "white blackbirds" of [[Mount Kyllini|Cyllene]].

Pausanias is most at home in describing the religious art and architecture of Olympia and of [[Delphi]]. Yet, even in the most secluded regions of Greece, he is fascinated by all kinds of depictions of deities, holy relics, and many other sacred and mysterious objects. At [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] he views the shields of those who died at the [[Battle of Leuctra]], the ruins of the house of Pindar, and the statues of [[Hesiod]], [[Arion]], [[Thamyris]], and [[Orpheus]] in the grove of the [[Muse]]s on Helicon, as well as the portraits of [[Corinna]] at [[Tanagra]] and of [[Polybius]] in the cities of [[Arcadia]].

Pausanias has the instincts of an [[antiquary]]. As his modern editor, [[Christian Habicht (historian)|Christian Habicht]], has said,
{{quote|In general, he prefers the old to the new, the sacred to the profane; there is much more about classical than about contemporary Greek art, more about temples, altars and images of the gods, than about public buildings and statues of politicians. Some magnificent and dominating structures, such as the [[Stoa of Attalos|Stoa of King Attalus]] in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Athenian Agora]] (rebuilt by [[Homer Thompson]]) or the Exedra of [[Herodes Atticus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] are not even mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Habicht, "An Ancient Baedeker and His Critics: Pausanias' 'Guide to Greece'" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''129'''.2 (June 1985:220–224) p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike a [[Baedeker|Baedeker guide]], in ''Periegesis'' Pausanias stops for a brief excursus on a point of ancient ritual or to tell an apposite myth, in a genre that would not become popular again until the early nineteenth century. In the topographical part of his work, Pausanias is fond of digressions on the wonders of nature, the signs that herald the approach of an earthquake, the phenomena of the tides, the ice-bound seas of the north, and the noonday sun that at the summer solstice, casts no shadow at Syene ([[Aswan]]). While he never doubts the existence of the deities and heroes, he sometimes criticizes the myths and legends relating to them. His descriptions of monuments of art are plain and unadorned. They bear the impression of reality, and their accuracy is confirmed by the extant remains. He is perfectly frank in his confessions of ignorance. When he quotes a book at second hand he takes pains to say so.

The work left faint traces in the known Greek corpus. "It was not read", Habicht relates; "there is not a single mention of the author, not a single quotation from it, not a whisper before [[Stephanus Byzantius]] in the sixth century, and only two or three references to it throughout the Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;Habicht 1985:220.&lt;/ref&gt; The only manuscripts of Pausanias are three fifteenth-century copies, full of errors and [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], which all appear to depend on a single manuscript that survived to be copied. [[Niccolò Niccoli]] had this archetype in Florence in 1418. At his death in 1437, it went to the library of [[San Marco, Florence]], then it disappeared after 1500.&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey Diller, "The Manuscripts of Pausanias The Manuscripts of Pausanias" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''88''' (1957):169–188.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until twentieth-century archaeologists concluded that Pausanias was a reliable guide to the sites they were excavating,&lt;ref&gt;In this, [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was a maverick and forerunner: a close reading of Pausanias guided him to the royal tombs at [[Mycenae]].&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias was largely dismissed by nineteenth- and early twentieth-century classicists of a purely literary bent: they tended to follow the usually authoritative [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|Wilamowitz]] in regarding him as little more than a purveyor of second-hand accounts, who, it was suggested, had not visited most of the places he described. Habicht (1985) describes an episode in which Wilamowitz was led astray by his misreading of Pausanias in front of an august party of travellers in 1873, and attributes to it Wilamowitz's lifelong antipathy and distrust of Pausanias. Modern archaeological research, however, has tended to vindicate Pausanias.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17354">[[Europe]] is often divided into regions based on geographical, cultural or historical criteria. Many European structures currently exist, some are cultural, economic, or political - examples include the [[Council of Europe]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]] with the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], and the [[European Olympic Committees]] with the [[European Games]]. Several [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental countries]] which border mainland Europe, are often included as belonging to a "wider Europe" including, [[Russia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Armenia]], [[Greenland]], as well as the [[Special member state territories and the European Union]].

==Geographical boundaries==
Groupings by compass directions are the hardest to define in Europe, since there are a few calculations of the midpoint of Europe (among other issues), and the pure geographical criteria of "east" and "west" are often confused with the political meaning these words acquired during the [[Cold War]] Era.

The modern physical geographic regions of Europe, include:

* '''[[Northern Europe]]'''
* '''[[Northwestern Europe]]'''
* '''[[Northeastern Europe]]'''
* '''[[Central Europe]]'''
* '''[[Eastern Europe]]'''
* '''[[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]]'''
* '''[[Western Europe]]'''
* '''[[Southern Europe]]'''
* '''[[Southwestern Europe]]'''

==Historical divisions==
Europe can be divided along many differing historical lines, normally corresponding to those parts that were inside or outside a particular cultural phenomenon, empire or political division. The areas varied at different times, and so it is arguable as to which were part of some common historical entity (e.g., were Germany or Britain part of Roman Europe as they were only partly and relatively briefly part of the Empire—or were the countries of the former communist [[Yugoslavia]] part of the [[Eastern Bloc]], since it was not in the [[Warsaw Pact]]).

* Roman and Non-Roman Europe:  those parts that were inside or outside the [[Roman Empire]].
* [[Greek Europe]] and [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|Latin Europe]]:  those parts that fell into the eastern ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) and western Roman Empires.
* Monotheistic [[Christendom|Christian]] and polytheistic [[Pagan]]  Europe:  those lands that did and did not observe [[Christianity]] in the [[Middle Ages]].
* [[Roman Catholicism in Europe|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Europe]]:  those parts on either side of the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]].
* After [[Reformation]]: countries of [[Western Christianity]] (Catholic and Protestant Churches) and [[Eastern Christianity]] (Eastern Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Oriental Orthodox churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches)
** [[Protestantism in Europe|Protestant]] and [[Catholic Europe]]:  those parts that, in the main, left the Catholic Church during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] contrasted with those that did not.
* [[Communist]] Europe ([[Eastern Bloc]]), [[Capitalist]] Europe ([[Western Bloc]]) - those parts on either side of the [[Iron Curtain]] and third world countries (neutral and non-aligned during the Cold War).

'''Rooftopping''' sometimes called '''roofing''' refers to the unsecured ascent of rooftops, cranes, antennas, smokestacks, etc., usually illegally. Participants have been classified by psychologists as thrill seekers who thrive on high levels of stimulation and complexity, although other theories explaining their motivation exist.&lt;ref name=Garrett&gt;{{Cite web | author=Bradley L.

It is an offshoot of [[urban exploring]], but is not universally condoned among urban explorers due to its high risk taking. Because it is often practiced in the pursuit of viral-ready videos and selfies, it tends to bring attention to urban exploring that can result in heightened security and greater restriction against access to desirable exploration venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/feb/26/rooftopping-do-you-have-to-be-crazy-to-hand-off-a-skyscraper |title=The lure of tall buildings: A guide to the risky but lucrative world of ‘rooftoppers’  |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Jamie Doward |date=26 February 2017 |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian Hydrographic Service''', full current official name '''Department of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-rus|Управление навигации и океанографии Министерства обороны Российской Федерации}}),&lt;ref name=Navy-rus&gt;[http://rusnavy.com/industry/index.htm?ELEMENT_ID=4888 Department of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation - Russian Navy]&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Russia]]'s [[hydrographic office]], with responsibility to facilitate navigation, performing [[hydrographic survey]]s and publishing [[nautical chart]]s.

Since the Russian state is of such a vast size and nature that it includes many different seas, long and indented coastlines and a great number of islands, as well as a complex system of waterways and lakes, [[surveying]] has been an indispensable activity for the Russian Navy since its modernization at the time of Czar [[Peter the Great]] in the 17th century. The hydrographic service has been historically attached to the [[Russian Navy]] and the agents and supervisors of hydrographic works have been largely [[naval officer]]s throughout its history.

Russia is a member of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]].

==History==
[[File:Admiraltejstvo 1716.jpg|thumb|170px|Russian Admiralty (1716)]]
===Background===
{{see also|Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)}}
At the time of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] hydrographic surveys were carried out following personal [[decree]]s of the emperor through the [[General admiral]]. Hydrographic tasks were always performed by Naval officers, who from 1724 onward began to work under instructions from the [[Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)|Admiralty Board]].

By 1746 important matters concerning hydrography were entrusted to Fleet Captain [[Alexey Nagayev]] who compiled the first [[atlas]] of the [[Bering Sea]], as well as of the [[Baltic Sea]] in 1752. Nagayev's charts were very detailed for its time and, despite a few shortcomings, his atlas of the Baltic Sea was republished in 1757, 1788, 1789 and 1795, serving Russian mariners for more than 50 years.

===Foundation and first phase (1777-1885)===
[[File:Russia Naval 1829 hydro.svg|thumb|170px|Flag of the Hydrographer General (1828)]]
[[File:Aleksandr Sergeevich Menshikov 2.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]]]]
In 1777 the Admiralty Board founded the Russian Hydrographic Service, implementing a plan that marked the beginning of systematic drawing of nautical charts.&lt;ref name=Cartograph-rus&gt;С этой чертежной началось централизованное производство морских карт в России, а дата утверждения штата чертежной — 2 (13) ноября 1777 г. — является датой основания ныне существующего Центрального картографического производства Военно-Морского Флота.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799 a committee for the dissemination of marine sciences and the improvement of the drawing of charts was created, and in 1807 the Russian Lighthouse Administration was established so that the lighthouse system in Russian shores, shoals and islands would follow an organized pattern and be provided with regular, state-controlled maintenance. The first director of this section was [[Leontiy Spafaryev]].&lt;ref name=light-balt&gt;[http://www.farosferrol.com/Bibliografia/bibliografia8.pdf Igor Alexeev, ''Lighthouses of the Baltic Sea''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820061330/http://www.farosferrol.com/Bibliografia/bibliografia8.pdf |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827 the special Office of the Hydrographer General was established. In the same year the Corps of Naval Navigators was founded, the chief of which was also a hydrographer. The first and only general of the newly-instituted body was hydrographer Admiral [[Gavril Sarychev|Gavril Andreevich Sarychev]] (in office 1827-31), after whose death the management of the office was transferred to the [[Chief of Naval Staff (Russia)|Chief of Naval Staff]] Prince [[Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov|A. S. Menshikov]]. The first and only director of the hydrographic depot was F. F. Schubert (in office 1827-37).&lt;ref name=Hyd-rus1917&gt;[http://www.imha.ru/1144531015-russkaya-gidrografiya-do-1917-goda.html#.V7LdKvl97IU Russian Hydrography before 1917]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837 the former institutions dealing with hydrography were abolished and all the management of the hydrographic section was transferred to the newly-instituted Russian Hydrographic Department, the directors of which were:

*[[Alexander G. Villamov|A. G. Villamov]] (1837–54)
*Baron [[Ferdinand von Wrangel|F. v. Wrangel]] (1854–55)
*[[Michael Reinecke|M. v. Reinecke]] (1855–59)
*[[Semyon Ilyich Zelenoy|S. I. Zelenoy]] (1859–74)
*[[Grigory Vevel von Krieger|G. A. Vevel von Krieger]] (1874–81)
*[[Theodosius Fedorovich Veselago|T. F. Veselago]] (1881)
*[[Pavel Nikolaevich Nazimov|P. N. Nazimov]] (1892-1898).

====Publications====
The Hydrographic Office engaged in the periodical publication of notes, devoted both to hydrographic information, as well as information on other sectors of naval affairs. The committee, established in 1799, published:
*In 1801 - ''"[[Notice to Mariners]]"'' (1 vol.)
*From 1807 to 1827 - ''"Notes of the State Admiralty Department"'' (13 pieces)
*From 1835 to 1837 - ''"Notes of the Hydrographic Depot"'' (5 parts)
*From 1842 to 1852 - ''"Notes of the Hydrographic Department."'' 
*1854-83 - ''Annual reports of the Director of the Hydrographic Department.''

===The Main Hydrographic Office (1885-1917)===
[[File:Russia Naval 1912 hydro.svg|170px|thumb|Flag of the Main Hydrographic Office (1885)]]
[[File:Nekmangrund.jpg|170px|thumb|[[Lightvessel|Lightship]] ''[[Nekmangrund]]'' (1898) off [[Hiiumaa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://diving.ee/articles/art103.html Lightship "Nekmangrund"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Vice-admiral Gilterbrandt.jpg|130px|thumb|[[Yakov Gilterbrandt]] (1842-1915)]]
In 1885 the Russian Hydrographic Department was overhauled and renamed as 'Main Hydrographic Office' —Главное гидрографическое управление (ГГУ)— of the Admiralty. Its chief was the former director in charge of the [[lighthouses]] and navigation of the Baltic Sea, [[Vice Admiral]] [[Roman Ivanovich Bazhenov|R. Bazhenov]], who was also the chairman of the Maritime Scientific Committee —Морского учёного комитета.

1886 saw the establishment of the meteorological department. In 1891 the fields of drawing, engraving, lithography and printing were integrated into the maritime cartography section and from 1897 this section began successful experiments printing nautical charts using aluminum printing plates. In 1902 a new building with a photographic department, including a  workshop introducing innovative photographic reproduction techniques, was built within the premises of the Main Hydrographic Office.
By 1904 the new techniques had been mastered by the staff and high-quality material began to be printed.&lt;ref name=Hyd-rus&gt;[http://www.imha.ru/knowledge_base/base-16/1144531015-russkaya-gidrografiya-do-1917-goda.html ''150 лет гидрографической службе военно-морского флота.'' Исторический очерк. 1977 г.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The duties of the Hydrographic Department at the time included:
*Planning and carrying out surveys.
*Preparation of [[map]]s, [[atlas]]es, [[sailing directions]] and other guidance materials for safe navigation, as well as making periodical corrections —when needed.
*Erection and proper maintenance of [[lighthouse]]s, [[electric beacon]]s, [[Air-sea rescue|rescue stations]], [[navigational beacon|towers]], [[day beacon]]s, [[buoy]]s, signals, and other warning devices to improve navigation safety.
*Supply of military tools such as maps, [[piloting (navigation)|pilot manuals]], signals manuals and other guides.
*Inspection and evaluation of ships' [[logbook]]s in order to gather relevant navigational, astronomical, magnetic, and other observations.

The jurisdiction of the Main Hydrographic Office included the management of:
*[[Pilotage instructions]] and [[navigational instrument]]s workshops in St. Petersburg and [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]]
*The Russian Maritime Observatory in [[Kronstadt]] and Nikolaev.
*The [[weather station]]s on the shores of the Russian seas.
*The [[Semaphore line|maritime semaphore telegraph]] in Kronstadt.
*The [[signal station]]s in [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]], [[Bogdanovka]], [[Parutino]], [[Adzhigol]] and [[Ochakov]].

The period between 1885 and 1917 was characterized by full-scale construction and modernization of lighthouse equipment, [[compass]] technology and improvements in the printing of nautical charts.
The 1910-1915 [[Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition]], led by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Boris Vilkitsky|Boris A. Vilkitsky]] on [[icebreaker]]s [[Vaygach (icebreaker)|Vaigach]] and [[Taymyr (icebreaker)|Taimyr]] mapped the last blank areas of the northern coast of Eastern [[Siberia]] —which were the last unmapped coastal areas of [[Eurasia]], and gathered as well a vast amount of oceanographic and meteorological data.&lt;ref name=AOHE&gt;[http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Polarforsch1975_1_6.pdf The Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition 1910-1915] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016154350/http://epic.awi.de/Publications/Polarforsch1975_1_6.pdf |date=2010-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heads of the Main Hydrographic Office were:
*[[Konstantin Ivanovich Mikhailov|Konstantin Mikhailov]] (1898-1903)
*[[Yakov Gilterbrandt]] (1903-1907)
*[[Andrey Vilkitsky]] (1907-1913)

===The Soviet period (1917-1992)===

After the initial period of instability that followed the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]] against the Imperial Government, the Hydrographic Office slowly returned to its duties as the situation calmed down and the Soviet takeover was completed. The work and dedication of hydrographers such as [[Konstantin Neupokoev]], ensured that the service returned to normality.&lt;ref name=Siniukov&gt;''Синюков, В. В.'' Александр Васильевич Колчак : Учёный и патриот : в 2 ч. / В. В. Синюков; отв. ред. А. П. Лисицын ; Ин-т истории естествознания и техники им. С. И. Вавилова РАН. — М.: Наука, 2009. — {{ISBN|978-5-02-035761-7}} (ч. 2), С. 34&lt;/ref&gt; 
Czarist names and symbols were quickly removed, the former hydrographic institution being renamed as the 'Main Hydrographic Office of the Russian Republic' —Главное гидрографическое управление Российской Республики.

Between 1918 and 1922 hydrometeorological service units named '''Ubek''' (Убек) were established for the management of navigation safety measures. The Ubek regulated the particular hydrographic zone —in [[Arkhangelsk]] for example it was 'Ubek-North'— as part of the unified local authority directly responsible to the central Soviet government.

In 1924 the Hydrographic Office was renamed the 'Central Hydrographic Department of the [[USSR]]' and a set of new flags and pennants was issued. Barely two years later, in September 1926, the office underwent another name change; the new name was "Hydrographic Department of the Office of Naval Forces of the Workers' and Peasants' [[Red Army]]" (UVMS Hydrographic Department of the Red Army) —Гидрографический отдел Управления Военно-морских сил Рабоче-крестьянской Красной Армии. In 1927 the name was simplified to 'Hydrographic Office UVMS Red Army' —Гидрографическое управление УВМС РККА.

[[Emperor Nicholas II Land]] first partially charted by Boris Vilkitsky in 1913, but still not fully surveyed when it was renamed ''Severnaya Zemlya'' by the [[Presidium]] of the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee of the USSR]] in 1926,&lt;ref name="newslab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newslab.ru/news/222324 |title=Депутаты Законодательного собрания Красноярского края против переименования островов архипелага "Северная Земля" |language=Russian |date=27 May 2007 |website=newslab.ru |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the last blank area on the vast map of the Soviet Union. Vilkitsky's expedition, which in 1913 sighted and surveyed a section of the eastern coastline of what he assumed was a single landmass,&lt;ref name=AOHE/&gt; had to concentrate on the Siberian continental shore in order to prepare the way for the [[Northeast Passage]] and he had no means to make a comprehensive survey further north.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred S. McLaren, ''Unknown Waters: A First-Hand Account of the Historic Under-ice Survey of the Siberian Continental Shelf by USS Queenfish (SSN-651), University of Alabama Press 2008, {{ISBN|978-0817316020}}, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Finally a hydrographic expedition of the Arctic Institute of the USSR led by [[Georgy Ushakov]] and [[Nikolay Urvantsev]] thoroughly surveyed the large Severnaya Zemlya archipelago in 1930–32, making it the last sizable territory on [[Earth]] to be put on the map.&lt;ref name=Barr1975&gt;
{{cite journal|author= Barr, William |year= 1975|title= Severnaya Zemlya: the last major discovery |journal= Geographical Journal|volume= 141|pages= 59–71|issue= 1|doi= 10.2307/1796946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 the Ubek were replaced by hydrographic offices subordinate to the commander of the fleets and [[flotilla]]s. In 1937 the 'Hydrographic Office UVMS Red Army' was renamed the "Hydrographic Office of the Workers' and Peasants' Navy" —Гидрографическое управление Рабоче-крестьянского Военно-морского флота (РК ВМФ). The design of the flags and pennants used by the office also underwent changes.

In 1940 the Hydrographic Office was renamed 'Hydrographic Office of the Navy' —Гидрографическое управление ВМФ. The following year, owing to the dire situation of the [[Great Patriotic War]] (1941-1945), a [[Task Force]] in the Hydrographic Department of the Navy was formed in [[Moscow]] by the [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)|Chief of the General Staff]] in order to deal more effectively with the emergency matters caused by the war in Russian soil and waters.

In postwar times, after the initial period of reconstruction was over, the Soviet Navy began the challenging task of creating an oceanic fleet carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s. The 1960-1970 decade saw the introduction and development of [[ballistic missile submarine]]s as part of the strategical aims of the Soviet fleet. These submarines were designed to be able to navigate in all areas of the oceans, including in the [[Arctic Ocean]] under the [[Arctic ice pack|ice cover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardiner | first = Robert | author2 = Chumbley, Stephen | authorlink = | title = Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1947-1995 | publisher = Conway Maritime Press | year = 1995 | location = London | pages =  | url = | doi = | isbn = 1-55750-132-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of navigation, during this period [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]] and other modernized signal systems were introduced.

The technological leap of that decade would impose a radical change in the navigational, hydrographic and hydrometeorological support of the Navy. During this period the need for innovative and detailed survey and mapping of the Earth's [[geophysics]], including [[gravity field|gravity]] and [[magnetic field]]s, became of the utmost importance for the Hydrographic Service of the Soviet Union. At that time, using its survey vessels, the department spearheaded a comprehensive study of large areas of the [[Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]], as well as of the then little explored [[Southern Ocean]] off the coast of [[Antarctica]]. As a result, a huge volume of data on [[bottom topography]], [[physical field]]s, and hydrophysical characteristics of the water masses, among other pioneering [[oceanographic]] information of the oceans, were collected.&lt;ref name=ru-hydro/&gt;

In 1972, owing to [[Cold War]] dictated priorities, the Hydrographic Office of the Navy was overhauled and transformed into the 'General Directorate of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR' —Главное управление навигации и океанографии Министерства обороны СССР (ГУНиО МО).
The 1970-1980 decade was marked by an increased international prominence of the 'General Directorate of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defense'. Since then the Hydrographic Service of the USSR officially represented the interests of the Soviet Union —in the same manner that the organization that replaced it in later years would do for the Russian Federation— in the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] and the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]], as well as the interests of the Ministry of Defence in the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] of [[UNESCO]].

The heads of the Hydrographic Service of the USSR&lt;ref name=Hist-hyd-rus&gt;''История Гидрографической службы Российского флота.'' Т.4. — Спб.: Издание ГУНиО МО РФ, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; were:

===The Russian Federation (from 1992 onward)===
[[File:Russia, Flag of hydrogrphic vessels of the Navy 1992.svg|170px|thumb|Flag of hydrographic ships and lightships (1992-2001)]]
[[File:Комарицын АА.jpg|170px|thumb|Adm [[Anatoly Komaritsyn]].]]

In the wake of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] the 'General Directorate of Navigation and Oceanography of Defense of the USSR' would be placed under the [[Russian Federation]], the legal successor of the USSR. In 1992 the service was renamed as the 'Main Directorate of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation' —Главное управление навигации и океанографии Министерства Обороны Российской Федерации (ГУНиО Минобороны России).&lt;ref name=ru-hydro/&gt; Depending from their location, some of the vessels of the Soviet Hydrographic Service managed to be released and join the navies of the newly-formed republics after the breakup of the USSR. These ships were usually renamed and overhauled or transformed before being put into use, for example the GS-13 small hydrographic vessel that had been launched in 1986 in [[Soviet Lithuania]] became the [[Pereyaslav (U512)]] when it was made part of the [[Ukrainian Navy]] in November 1995.

Although the basic designs were left unchanged, prominent Communist-era symbols —such as the [[hammer and sickle]] and the [[red star]], were removed from the flags of the Russian Hydrographic Service and the blue and white [[Russian Navy Ensign]] was restored. In 2001 a new regulation introduced slight alterations in the symbols that had been adopted in 1992 following the fall of the USSR.

In 2006 the name of the Russian Hydrographic Service would be changed to 'Department of Navigation and Oceanography of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation' —Управление навигации и океанографии Министерства Обороны Российской Федерации (УНиО Минобороны России), its current official name. Russian military presence in Arctic waters resumed in the summer of 2013 when Hydrographic Service vessels belonging to the [[Northern Fleet]] sailed to [[Rudolf Island]] in [[Franz Josef Land]]. The area had been neglected by the armed forces for a long time in the years that followed the fall of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/news/russian-arctic-navy-restitution-863/ RT - Russian military resumes permanent Arctic presence (14 September 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The heads of the Hydrographic Service of the Russian Federation in recent times have been:
*Yuri Zheglov (1988-1994)
*[[Anatoly Komaritsyn]] (1994-2006)
*[[Sergey Viktorovich Kozlov|Sergey Kozlov]] (2006-2010)
*[[Alexander Shemetov]] (2010-2013)
*[[Sergey Travin]] (2013-)

==Vessels==
The vessels operating for the Russian Hydrographic Service have been historically of two orders or categories. To the first category belong those vessels that were built specifically as survey ships, of which there are different classes, and to the second, other kind of vessels of the Russian Navy that, although not especially built for the purpose, have eventually engaged in survey operations. The latter usually undertook surveys for specific periods of time during their naval service, such as the a four-masted tall ship [[Kruzenshtern (ship)|Kruzenshtern]], which performed hydrographic surveys between 1961 and 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitiaz.ru/congress/en/thesis/64.html L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1107">'''Rõmuuta''' is a fictional place from [[Robert Vaidlo]]'s influential children's book series.  While the books' protagonists are from the drawn city of [[Kukeleegua]], Rõmuuta is primarily inhabited by toys and ruled by [[marzipan]] figures in tinfoil.

Officially an island parandise with mandatory joy and free sugar-laden food for everybody, Rõmuuta practices a regime of oppression on both its inhabitants and visitors, and takes special steps to prevent visitors from leaving.  For example, the landing quays of the island are made of sugar so, once the visitor arrival celebrations end, they will melt in the seawater &amp;mdash; leaving boats tied to the quay to drift freely.  Accordingly, Rõmuuta has been described as a subtle allegory for [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eesti Ekspress]]: [http://paber.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/E0537095A37DC551C2257435003453F1 25+5] by [[Kalev Kesküla]] and [[Veiko Märka]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Siton Undae is part of a cluster of sand-seas (undae), which along with [[Hyperboreae Undae|Hyperboreae]], and [[Abalos Undae]], overlay the lowlands of [[Vastitas Borealis]].&lt;ref name="Icarus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kenneth L.

Other dune fields sharing the same formation history include [[Olympia Undae|Olympia]] and [[Aspledon Undae]].&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt;

Siton Undae is the southernmost of the densest northern circumpolar dune fields and its presence indicates effective sand transport and accumulation from sand sources to the north and west. Siton Undae, along with [[Abalos Undae|Abalos]], and Hyperboreae Undae, is also a tributary to less dense dune fields that continue all the way to the Martian [[prime meridian]].&lt;ref name="Tanaka"/&gt;

==Dune characteristics==
[[File:PIA20454 Siton Undae.jpg |thumb|300px|Siton Undae]]
Spectral analysis of the dunes of the circumpolar [[erg]]s, including Siton Undae, using the OMEGA instrument on board the European [[Mars Express]] orbiter, indicates that 80 to 90 percent of these sands are composed of [[volcanic glass]] produced by eruptions of volcanoes situated in Martian glaciers. These ratios of glass and crystalline material are similar to those obtained in [[Iceland]] from eruptions of volcanoes below the ice.&lt;ref name="de Vet"&gt;{{cite web|author1=de Vet, S. J.|title=When the glacier left the volcano: Behaviour and fate of glaciovolcanic glass in different planetary environments|url=https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/1521397/122651_thesis.pdf|website=Thesis|publisher=University of Amsterdam|date=2013|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also theorised that significant amounts of granular glass may have been transferred to Vastitas Borealis, and Siton Undae, by catastrophic floods originating from [[Chryse Planitia]], [[Valles Marineris]], [[Juventae Chasma]], and the southern [[Acidalia Planitia|Acidalia]] region of Mars.&lt;ref name="de Vet"/&gt;

The dunes of Siton Undae contain amorphous [[silica]]-coated glass-rich sand. The lack of evidence for the presence of volcanoes in the region of Planum Boreum, as well as the absence of evidence of any large-scale melt deposits due to crater impact, suggests that these silica-coated deposits may have formed by alteration of the basaltic sands through acidic action. Further, it is theorised that acidic alteration of glassy deposits may have been a common conversion mechanism on Mars, especially at high latitudes.&lt;ref name="Horgan"/&gt;

[[File:Circle Line Hijack.jpg|thumb|A reveler urges silence on one of the Space Hijacker's [[Circle line party|Circle line parties]] on the [[London Underground]] on 14 March 2003. The tactic for keeping the party unnoticed by the authorities was to keep quiet while the train was in the stations. The first Space Hijackers Circle Line Party took place on 10 March 1999.]]
The '''Space Hijackers''' is a group originating in the [[United Kingdom]] that defines itself as "an international band of [[anarchism|anarchitects]] who battle to save our streets, towns and cities from the evils of [[urban planner]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]] and other hoodlums". ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine has described the group as "an inventive and subversive group of London ‘Anarchitects’ who specialise in reclaiming public spaces – usually without permission."&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/features/1975/12.html |title=London's secret scenes |accessdate=2007-10-11 |pages=12 |work=Features |publisher=Time Out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's activities have included "guerrilla benching"&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Patrick. "Guerilla gardeners stage a sit-down protest", ''[[Evening Standard]]'', 2007-04-04. Accessed 2008-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt; — restoring benches that had been recently removed and bolting them to the ground — organising a midnight game of [[cricket (sport)|cricket]] in the centre of the [[City of London]] financial district, and satirising the glossy architects' drawings that are displayed on the perimeter of luxury apartments by depicting children’s playgrounds and other projects they believe to be actually desirable.&lt;ref name="timeout"/&gt; Many of these activities aim to bring to people's attention the role which corporations play in society in a different light.&lt;ref name="newstatesman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200206170013 |title=How to beat the adman at his own game |accessdate=2007-10-11 |last=Hari |first=Johann |authorlink=Johann Hari |date=2002-06-22 |work=World Affairs |publisher=''[[New Statesman]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Space Hijackers exist mainly to change the public's perception of spaces it regularly uses, mainly by staging unexpected events. Their explicit objective is "to effect and change the physical space of architecture", and, eschewing violent protest and other forms of transparent [[direct action]], their methods aim "to invade and re-brand corporate space".&lt;ref name="anarchitexts"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richardson | first = Joanne | title = Anarchitexts | publisher = Autonomedia | location = Brooklyn | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-57027-142-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    They believe that the use of physical space is becoming more and more politicised, and thus in order to break apart from that politicisation, they stage events that are typically 'unusual' for that particular space, 'hijacking' it and hoping to change people's perception of the use of that space forever. They believe that increasing politicisation usually leads to increased subordination and discrimination and other forms of domination and control and so Space Hijackers claim to seek to break down and deconstruct society's notions of space. They seek to effect this by attempting to undermine the authority of the owner's "[[hermeneutics|text]]", confusing and re-contextualising it and thereby making apparent the possibility of an alternative future.&lt;ref name="anarchitexts"/&gt; Protests tend to be non-violent and Space Hijacker projects usually involved a good sense of fun.&lt;ref name="bizarre"/&gt; Protest strategy includes involving passers-by.

The Space Hijackers have many contacts with other groups, and involve themselves with all sorts, including but not limited to [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]], [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]], [[Rhythms of Resistance]] samba band, free media collective [http://www.iconscious.co.uk/ iconscious], [[Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping]] and [[LHC|evoLhypergrapHyCx]]. The Hijackers pulled several of these groups together in Anarchitecture Week 2005, a week of anti-building related activities in response to, and hosted at the same time as Architecture Week.

==Projects==

Formed in 1999, their first major action was the [[Circle Line Party]] - a party on [[London Underground]]'s [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle Line]] which attracted around 150 people armed with [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]]s, disco lights and bars all disguised as luggage.&lt;ref name="bizarre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aitch |first=Iain |date=August 2001 |title=Mind The Reality Gap |journal=[[Bizarre (magazine)|Bizarre]] |issue=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4237">A '''Special Protection Area''' ('''SPA''') is a designation under the [[European Union]] [[Birds Directive|Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds]]. Under the Directive, Member States of the [[European Union]] (EU) have a duty to safeguard the [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] of [[Bird migration|migratory birds]] and certain particularly threatened birds. Together with [[Special Area of Conservation|Special Areas of Conservation]] (SACs), the SPAs form a network of protected sites across the EU, called [[Natura 2000]]. Each SPA has an EU code – for example the North Norfolk Coast SPA has the code ''UK9009031''.&lt;ref name=EUBirdDir&gt;{{cite web | title = The Birds Directive | work = Environment | publisher = [[European Union]] | url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/birdsdirective/index_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
As at 21 September 2006, there were 252 classified SPAs and 12 proposed SPAs in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The Conservation (Natural Habitats etc.) Regulations 1994 implement the terms of the Directive in Scotland, England and Wales. In [[Great Britain]], SPAs (and SACs) designated on land or in the [[intertidal]] area are normally also notified as [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs), and in [[Northern Ireland]] as Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs). For example, the [[Broadland SPA]] in eastern England is a conglomeration of some 28 SSSIs. SPAs may extend below [[Tide|low tide]] into the sea, and for these areas SSSI notification is not possible. In Scotland, some SPAs have been classified without any underpinning designation by SSSI.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- Are these terrestrial or marine? --&gt;

==In Poland==
{{Further|Special Protection Areas in Poland}}
''Special Protection Areas'' for [[Bird migration|bird]]s in [[Poland]] are called OSOPs ({{lang-pl|Obszar Specjalnej Ochrony Ptaków}}). As of 2005, there were 72 OSOP Areas designated as such.

==In Portugal==
The [[Castro Verde SPA]] extends into six municipalities of [[Baixo Alentejo Subregion]]: [[Aljustrel Municipality]], [[Almodôvar Municipality]], [[Beja Municipality]], [[Castro Verde Municipality]], [[Mértola Municipality]] and [[Ourique Municipality]], a total area of 79,007 hectares (790&amp;nbsp;km &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

==In Spain==
The Spanish term is ''ZEPA''.
There were 644 Spanish sites as at 2016.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Czech Republic ==
The Czech Republic use the term ''Ptačí oblast'' (PO, bird area) for SPAs. There were declared 41 bird areas by the government directives between 2004 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzp.cz/cz/narizeni_vlady Ptačí oblasti – nařízení vlády]&lt;/ref&gt; They cover 9% of the state area.

[[File:PortHacking-Sydney-Ria.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A submergent landform: the drowned river valley ([[ria]]) of [[Georges River]] in the greater [[Sydney]] area, Australia]]

'''Submergent coastlines''' are stretches along the coast that have been inundated by the sea by a relative rise in sea levels from either [[isostacy]] or [[eustacy]].

Submergent coastline are the opposite of [[emergent coastline]]s, which have experienced a relative fall in sea levels.

Features of a submergent coastline are drowned river valleys or [[ria]]s and drowned glaciated valleys or [[fjord]]s.

[[Estuaries]] are often the drowned mouths of rivers.

The [[Western Coastal Plains]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] are examples of submergent coastline. The ancient city of [[Dvārakā]], which is mentioned in the great epic [[Mahabharata]], is now under water. The coastline also forms the estuaries of the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and the [[Tapti River|Tapti]] Rivers.

This is a list of dialing codes by town in [[Montenegro]].

==History==

Until Montenegro gained independence from [[Serbia and Montenegro]], the nation was accessed through the [[List of country calling codes|international dialing code]] +381. The new dialing code +382 was introduced after independence and the two codes were used in parallel until February 2007, when +382 nominally became the only acceptable code. As of 1 October 2007, +381 is used only for [[Serbia]] and +382 is the only acceptable code for Montenegro.

==Dialing codes==
===Fixed telephony===
Area codes have two digits after the initial '0' trunk prefix, and local numbers have six digits. The trunk prefix is omitted when calling from abroad.

The following code prefixes are used for network groups.&lt;ref name="atm"&gt;[http://www.ekip.me/numeracija/dodijeljena.php Montenegro Agency for Electronic Communications and Postal Services – numbering scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

The old codes were used in parallel with the new codes until 1 October 2008:{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

An '''[[urban area]] in [[Finland]]''' is defined as an inhabited area of at least 200 people and a maximum distance of {{conv|200|m}} between buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.fi/ajk/tiedotteet/v2008/tiedote_001_2008-01-15.html|title=Taajamissa asuu 84 prosenttia väestöstä|website=[[Statistics Finland]]|date=15 January 2008|access-date=20 February 2017|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Facta (encyclopedia)]] part 16, page 203, ''finnish''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] term for this is a '''''taajama''''' ({{lang-sv|tätort}}). Because of the strict definition of a ''taajama'', these areas exist both inside and outside of city and municipal borders.

The largest ''taajama'' in Finland is the [[Helsingin keskustaajama]] ("[[Helsinki]] central urban area") with approximately 1,200,000 inhibitants in 2014. It extends across Helsinki as well as 10 other municipalities in the [[Greater Helsinki]] area. The second largest is the [[Tampereen keskustaajama]] with almost 320,000 inhibitants in 2012.

The presence of ''taajama'' areas is used to regulate traffic, with a default of {{conv|50|km/h}} [[speed limit]] inside a ''taajama'' and {{conv|80|km/h}} outside. Each major road leading in or out of a ''taajama'' is marked with a road sign.

The [[Territories of the United States|U.S. unincorporated territory]] of [[American Samoa]] first required its residents to register their [[motor vehicle]]s and display [[Vehicle registration plate|license plate]]s in 1924.

In 1956, the United States, Canada and Mexico came to an agreement with the [[American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators]], the [[Automobile Manufacturers Association]] and the [[National Safety Council]] that standardized the size for license plates for vehicles (except those for [[motorcycle]]s) at {{convert|6|in|cm}} in height by {{convert|12|in|cm}} in width, with standardized mounting holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Garrish |first=Christopher |date=October 2016 |title=Reconsidering the Standard Plate Size |magazine=Plates |publisher=[[Automobile License Plate Collectors Association]] |volume=62 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Samoa adopted these standards in 1977.
