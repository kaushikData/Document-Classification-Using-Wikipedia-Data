'''Alaba-Kʼabeena''' (Alaaba, Alaba, Allaaba, Halaba), also known as '''Wanbasana''', is a [[Highland East Cushitic language]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]] by the [[Halaba people]] in the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]] southwest of [[Lake Shala]], specifically in [[Alaba special woreda|Alaba special district]] and the [[Kebena]] district of Gurage Zone. The literacy rate of native speakers in their language is below 1%, while their literacy rate in second languages is 8.6%; Alaba-Kʼabeena is taught in primary schools. It has an 81% lexical similarity with [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; However, Fleming (1976) classifies Kʼabeena (also transliterated "Qebena" or "Kebena") as a dialect of Kambaata, and Blench (2006) classifies both as dialects of Kambaata. The 2007 census in Ethiopia lists Alaba and Qebena as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 2007 Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114004942/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 |date=2010-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fatimah Rifaat''' (June 5, 1930 – January 1996), better known by her pen name '''Alifa Rifaat''' ({{lang-ar|أليفة رفعت}}), was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] author whose controversial short stories are renowned for their depictions of the dynamics of female sexuality, relationships, and loss in rural Egyptian culture. While taking on such controversial subjects, Fatimah Rifaat’s protagonists remained religiously faithful with passive feelings towards their fate. Her stories did not attempt to undermine the patriarchal system; rather they were used to depict the problems inherent in a patriarchal society when men do not adhere to their religious teachings that advocate for the kind treatment of women. Fatimah Rifaat used the psydonymn Alifa to prevent embarrassment on the part of her family due to the themes of her stories and her writing career.

==Life== 
Fatma Abdullah Rifaat was born on June 5, 1930 in [[Cairo]], Egypt. Her father was an architect and her mother was a housewife. Her family boasted that their roots are said to extend back to [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a companion and advisor to the prophet [[Muhammad]]. She was raised in provincial Egypt and spent most of her life there. Subsequently, rural Egypt became the setting for most of her stories. Her active interest in writing began at age nine when she wrote a poem expressing the despair in her village.  For this she was met with punishment by her family due to the poem’s subject matter.  Fatimah attended Misr al-Jadidah Primary school and The Cultural Center for Women for her intermediate education.  She also attended the British Institute in Cairo from 1946 to 1949 where she studied English.  When Alifa Rifaat expressed interest in continuing her education by enrolling in the College of Fine Arts in Egypt her father instead arranged for her to marry her cousin, a police officer.

For the first few years of their marriage her husband allowed her to write and publish stories under her pseudonym despite the common idea of writing being a purely masculine field in Egyptian culture.  She published her stories from 1955 until 1960 when she chose to stop after facing pressure from her husband to end her writing career.  During this nearly 14-year period of literary silence Alifa Rifaat pursued the study of [[literature]], [[astronomy]], and [[history]].  Despite her attempts at preoccupation through these means Alifa Rifaat remained frustrated at her inability to express herself and the societal issues she faced as a woman through literary means.

In 1973, after facing a serious illness, Alifa’s husband allowed her once more to write and publish her work. She continued on to publish a collection of short stories and two novels beginning with the short story "My World of the Unknown," for which she gained initial popularity.

Alifa Rifaat’s husband died in 1979.  Although she traveled across provincial Egypt in accordance to her husband’s transfers for work she never left Egypt until after his death.  She continued on to make the [hajj], the sacred pilgrimage to Mecca, in 1981 and traveled to multiple European and Arab states including England, [[Turkey]], Germany, [[Morocco]], and Austria.

Throughout her life Fatimah Rifaat became a member of the Federation of Egyptian Writers, the Short-Story Club, and the Dar al-Udaba (Egypt). She also attended the First International Women's Book Fair (London, England) in 1984 where she spoke about the rights of women in Islam and the topic of polygamy.
In 1984 Fatimah Rifaat received the Excellency Award from the Modern Literature Assembly.

Fatimah Rifaat Died at the age of 65 in January 1996.  She left behind three sons and a body of over 100 works that have been translated into multiple languages and have been produced for television.  Some of her works have also been read on BBC.

==Literary themes and translations==
Alifa Rifaat wrote in Arabic throughout her literary career.  Her style, though focusing more on romance in the beginning of her career, later shifted to social critique after she met translator Denys John-Davies.  Denys also persuaded her to write in a more colloquial style of Arabic, which although being a more accessible form of writing to the Egyptian population, was also during this period a less desired form of writing than the formal style. Her novels and short stories have been translated into multiple languages including English, German, Dutch, and Swedish.  The most popular English translation of her work is of her collection of short stories, Distant View of a Minaret and Other Short Stories, which is translated by [[Denys Johnson-Davies]].

Fatimah Rifaat, unlike the prominent Egyptian Feminist [[Nawal El Saadawi]], focused her writing on women in traditional Islamic roles.  In her autobiography Fatimah describes her father’s lack of affection towards her as a possible root of her exploration of the needs and desires of men in terms of women.  She continues on to relate that through her life she found that "all men seek is pleasure.  For that reason I cry out for complete and complementary love in all my writings." Fatimah also expresses in her autobiography the need for men and women to only participate in intercourse when they are in a serene state, so that orgasm can be achieved, which she believes acts to strengthen faith in God.

Fatimah Rifaat’s writing centers upon the silent plight of women in a patriarchal Muslim society.  Her stories mainly take place in provincial Egypt.  These stories handle themes such as sex, death, marriage, [[masturbation]], [[clitoridectomy]], love, teenage pregnancy, [[widowhood]], and loss along with other controversial topics.  During this time period a woman was considered a purely sexual being, and the allowance of freedom of her sexuality was feared to result in fitna, or societal chaos. Although Alifa Rifaat strove to express through writing the [[sexual repression]] of women, her stories and her life were conducted in an orthodox Muslim manner and she did not advocate the rise of women against patriarchy.  Most of Rifaat’s female protagonists take a resigned or begrudgingly accepting stance towards the hardships they face in life. For Fatimah Rifaat, patriarchy is merely a fact of life and acceptable under Quranic terms, however it is the opposite and in some instances even the same gender’s lack of observance towards religious teachings that acts as the catalyst to many of the protagonists’ problems.  In her stories many of the sexual encounters take place during the characters' marriage and there is no instance of extra-marital male-female relationships as this would be considered purely sinful under the practice of [[Islam]].

Some of Fatimah Rifaat’s most popular stories include "Distant View of a Minaret,"  "Bahiyya’s Eyes," and "My World of the Unknown."

== ''Distant View of a Minaret'' ==
''Distant View of a Minaret'' opens with a husband and wife performing the act of intercourse.  The story is told from the wife’s point of view and it is quickly revealed that during this interaction she is both uninterested and feels estranged from her husband.  She recalls how in the past she attempted to express her desire for sexual satisfaction to her husband which was met in return with denial and anger.  At some point during the act she becomes aware of the call to prayer.  Afterwards she performs necessary ablutions and her prayers, a ritual with which she feels more in touch with than with her own relationship with her husband.  She then peers out the window to look at a minaret in Cairo, recounting how there used to be a view of multiple minarets before new buildings blocked them out.  The husband then suffers from a heart attack while still in bed and dies.  In the end the protagonist is dully surprised at how calm she has remained during and after her husband’s death.
This story conveys the passive female sexual role as pushed by selfish male domination of the sexual relationship in marriage.  The lone minaret likely represents the solitude that the female protagonist experiences having resigned to this role.

== ''Bahiyya’s Eyes'' ==
''Bahiyya’s Eyes'' is told from the perspective of the aged Bahiyya speaking to her daughter after visiting a doctor about her loss of sight.  She tells her daughter that although the doctor’s diagnosis attributes her loss of sight to natural causes and tells her she can be treated with medication she knows that it is instead due to all of the tears she has cried because of her life as a woman.  Bahiyya then recounts her childhood, her clitoridectomy by the women of her village, her widowhood and the hardships of raising children as a single mother.
This story tackles the issue of suppression of female sexuality through recounting the events of Bahiyya’s childhood.  She continues on to lament the position of women in society and the upholding of this low status by members of both genders. Bahiyya is also a name for Egypt.

== ''My World of the Unknown'' ==
''My World of the Unknown'' centers on a woman who enters into a sexual awakening with the aid of a jinni in the form of a snake.  When the woman and her husband move into a house the wife discovers a female jinni in the form of a snake who teaches her the height of sexual pleasure.  The woman remains with the snake despite her confusion until her husband kills a snake in the yard, violating the code of the jinni, at which point the female jinni leaves.

This story deals with the issue of feminine pleasure.  Although the wife does have an affair with the jinni, since the creature is female it is not considered adultery.

==List of collective works==

He wrote a wide range of material: poems (both for children and adults), mystery novels (four of them under the pseudonym Bernhard Borge), essays, and articles. He translated works by [[Shakespeare]], [[Molière]], [[Goethe]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]]. Bjerke was known as a prominent proponent of the [[Riksmål]] language during the [[Norwegian language struggle]], and of [[anthroposophy]], especially in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=André Bjerke |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Jan E. |last=Hansen |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=https://nbl.snl.no/André_Bjerke | language=Norwegian |accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Bjerke was born at Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His parents were the author [[Ejlert Bjerke]] and Karin  (Svensson) Bjerke.  He was the cousin of author [[Jens Bjørneboe]] (1920-1976). His debut was in 1940 with a collection of poems, ''Syngende Jord''.

== Mystery novels and short stories ==

His mystery novels were influenced by his interest in psychoanalysis. His first mystery novel, ''Nattmennesket'' was published in 1941. In this novel he introduced  the psycho analyst Kai Bugge who claims that a psychologist is more able to solve a real crime than a police officer. After a particularly hideous murder, Bugge and  police officer Hammer, join forces to solve the impossible mystery. Where Hammer looks for material clues and interviews the suspects about things like motive and alibis, Bugge makes an analytical approach.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sceneweb.no/nb/artist/21383/Andr%C3%A9_Bjerke-1918-1-30|title= Jarl André Bjerke |publisher = Sceneweb|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''De dødes tjern'' from 1942  was  made into a film in 1958, directed by [[Kåre Bergstrøm]] (1911–1976). This novel is also featured by Kai Bugge in opposition to literary critic, Gabriel Mørk and  policeman, Harald Gran. The three accompanied by author Bernhard Borge,  his wife and Gran's fiancee visit the scene of a suicide.  The deceased  had left a diary in which he revealed his growing obsession by the pond, which ends with a confession that he has no choice but to commit suicide by drowning himself.  During the investigation it turns out that visitors are not immune to the forces that abode in the pond. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://snl.no/K%C3%A5re_Bergstr%C3%B8m|title=Kåre Bergstrøm|publisher = Store norske leksikon|author= Lillian Bikset|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, he published ''Døde menn går i land''. This is the only one of his full novels that does not star Kai Bugge, but the conflict between a traditional solver of mysteries and those who dabbles in paranormal phenomena is a central motif in the novel. Arne Krag-Andersen has bought a famously haunted house on the southern coast of Norway. There is a curse on the manor: Any one who tries to change anything whatsoever with the house or its contents, will die a violent death.  American minister Pahle is deeply fascinated by satanism and claims that a satanic cult was connected to the house. A deserted Estonian ship found outside the shore adds to the atmosphere.

|publisher =schwedenkrimi  |author=Jürgen Ruckh|date=  October 2007|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, ''Skjult Mønster''  was published. Kai Bugge re-enters the scene, but even if he solves the strange mystery and sheds light on the hidden pattern, he plays no central role. Irene Cramer is scared to death, and it seems clearly that her fright is not only imagined. She moves in with four bachelors in an attempt to be protected, but even their chivalrous behavior doesn't give her the security she craves. The reader is led through a veritable maze with a pattern that seems impossible until the hidden pattern is revealed by Kai Bugge.

The short story collection ''Tryllestaven'' from 1961 does not really fit the description "mysteries". A few of them are, but most of them concerns other parts of life. You meet a young boy and his dreams, a girl solving the ultimate question for a scientist, a very distorted traditional Norwegian fairy tale, an underdog who finds his magic wand in shape of a walking cane, the challenge of writing soberly while sober and other stories. 

In 1963 André Bjerke published ''Enhjørningen''  under his own name. ''Enhjørningen'' consists of three novellas and a short story bound together by the challenge between psychology and the unicorn – representing the supernatural forces in existence. Dr. Kahrs denies the existence of any unicorn, and his three bridge-playing friends, author Nordberg,  ad-man Bøhmer and  journalist Strand, try to convince him by telling of their meeting with the unicorn. 

Bjerke also published the short story collection, ''Hobby-detektiven''  where the very unusual police officer, Klaus Vangli is the hero. Vangli has a very untraditional approach to the different mysteries he sets out to solve. He claims that his enormous range of hobbies gives him the necessary skills and knowledge to solve murders, thefts, fraud and a rather petty theft by a small child. His hobbies covers chess, astronomy, optics, philately, track and field, football betting and other interests that has seems to have nothing in common. 

Bjerke also published two collections of mystery short stories in 1970, titled ''Onkel Oscar starter opp'' and ''Onkel Oscar kjører videre''. Oscar is a cab driver in contemporary Oslo who is mixed up in different crimes and solves them by his ability  his acumen. The stories, co-written by  TV host, [[Harald Tusberg]], were adaptations from the manuscripts for the TV series about uncle Oscar.

[[File:Page from Yiddish-Hebrew-Latin-German dictionary by Elijah Levita.jpg|thumb|upright|A Yiddish-Hebrew-Latin-German dictionary by Elijah Levita, 1544]]
In the early part of the sixteenth century, there were already attempts to translate the Bible into Yiddish, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] biblical dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ze’enah U-Re’enah: A Critical Translation into English|last=Faierstein|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2017|isbn=9783110459500|location=Berlin|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most authoritative was the [[Bible]] that [[Jekuthiel Blitz]] translated in 1678.

== Translations ==
There are numerous Biblical translations in Yiddish because it constituted the very beginning of its literature along with other the religious texts such as the [[Talmud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Unusual Relationship: Evangelical Christians and Jews|last=Ariel|first=Yaakov|publisher=New York University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780814770689|location=New York|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars explained that this can be attributed to the fact that the Bible is a popular book among the Jewish communities in Germany and surrounding European countries and it was also a reference for the early education of young Jews there.&lt;ref&gt;Faierstein, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were different translation style such as the so-called [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] literary tradition, more popularly known as ''taytsh-khumesh'', which translated the Bible literally. Here, the words in the Hebrew original were translated into their Yiddish counterparts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Goy Who Speaks Yiddish: Christians and the Jewish Language in Early Modern Germany|last=Elyada|first=Aya|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780804781930|location=Stanford|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this method was widely criticized, mainly for its strict adherence to the literal meaning of the text, it proved useful particularly for theologians and Hebraists who needed sources in their effort to understand of the literal sense of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Elyada, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jekuthiel Blitz, who was a rabbi from Wittmund, Germany, published his work with the backing financial backers such as [[Aharon HaLevi|Aharon Halevi]], who obtained ''haskomes'' for the undertaking from the Council of the Four Lands, the central governing body of Polish Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of German Jewish Bible Translation|last=Gillman|first=Abigail|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2018|isbn=9780226477725|location=Chicago|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A notable milestone in the historical development of the Yiddish Bible involved [[Yehoash (Blumgarten)|Solomon Bloomgarden]]'s initiative. His translation is considered to be the most comprehensive and was published under his pen name Yehosesh.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is regarded as both literary and scholarly, influenced the work of Yiddish scholars in the nineteenth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">'''Camille Le Mercier d'Erm''' (1888 in [[Rennes]] - 1978 in [[Dinard]]) was a French poet, historian and [[Breton nationalist]]. He later adopted the neo-Bardic name '''Kammermor'''. He is also known as '''Kamil Ar Merser 'Erm''', the [[Breton language]] form of his name. His work as a poet and historian is marked by nationalist claims and calls to rebellion against the French state on the model of [[Irish nationalism]].

He was the grandson of a [[Chouan]] officer. He was based in Paris when in 1909 he published his first collections of poetry. The same year, in the ''Revue de l’Ouest'', he wrote "Traditionalism and separatism", an article advocating separatist politics in defence of cultural tradition. His proposals caused a sensation.&lt;ref name = "ron"&gt;Ronald Delaney, ''Camille Le Mercier d'Erm, Poète, Écrivain Breton'' Editions Jouve (1938).&lt;/ref&gt; He was the principal founder of the [[Breton Nationalist Party]] in 1911, and was arrested when the party launched a protest in the same year at the official opening of a monument to the unity of Brittany and France. Le Mercier d'Erm also founded the activist journal ''Breiz Dishual'' (Free Brittany).

The party and journal folded in 1914 on the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Immediately after the war, Le Mercier d'Erm helped to found a replacement journal, [[Breiz Atao]] (Brittany Forever), which was created in 1919. He also continued to play a leading role among young Breton nationalist activists between the wars. He launched the newspaper ''La Bretagne libertaire'' in 1921, with the article "La Nation bretonne et l’Internationale" (The Breton nation and the [[Internationale]]).&lt;ref name = "ron"/&gt;  In 1941 on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Breton Nationalist Party, the newly formed [[Breton National Party]] (a different organisation) organised a heartfelt tribute to Le Mercier d'Erm, as a pioneer of Breton nationalism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">The '''Ilchamus''' (sometimes spelled Camus or Iltiamus, also known as Njemps), are a Maa-speaking people living south and southeast of [[Lake Baringo]], [[Kenya]]. They number about 35,000 and are closely related to the [[Samburu people|Samburu]] living more to the north-east in the [[Rift Valley Province]] They are said to be the smallest ethnic group in Kenya. Their language is one of the [[Eastern Nilotic languages|Eastern Nilotic]] [[Maa languages]], closely related to the [[Samburu language]] (between 89% and 94% lexical similarity), to the point of it being considered a Samburu dialect by some. Together, Samburu and Ilchamus form the northern division of the Maa languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Non-Bantu languages of Kenya.

In their oral traditions, the Ilchamus economy underwent a succession of elaborations: from foraging and fishing to a sophisticated system of irrigation, and then this was mixed with pastoralism under the influence of Samburu immigrants and neighbouring Maasai. These changes involved a series of embellishments in their culture and social organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pastoral Continuum: the Marginalization of Tradition in East Africa|last=Spencer|first=Paul|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=129-203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this evolving system did not survive the challenges of the capitalist economy in post-colonial Kenya, leading to a more polarized society with diminishing prospects for the majority of Camus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Elusive Granary: Herder, Farmer and State in Northern Kenya.|last=Little|first=Peter D.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centre-right politics''' or '''center-right politics''' ([[American English]]), also referred to as '''moderate-right politics''', are politics that lean to the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of the [[Left–right politics|left–right political spectrum]], but are closer to the [[Centrism|centre]] than other right-wing politics. From the 1780s to the 1880s, there was a shift in the [[Western world]] of [[social class]] structure and the economy, moving away from the [[nobility]] and [[mercantilism]], as well as moving towards the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kahan | first = Alan S.| contribution = The unexpected honeymoon of mind and money, 1730-1830 | editor-last = Kahan | editor-first = Alan S. | title = Mind vs. money: the war between intellectuals and capitalism | page = 88 | publisher = [[Transaction Publishers]] | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781412810630 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Shenon | first1 = Philip | last2 = Greenhouse | first2 = Linda | author-link2 = Linda Greenhouse | title = Washington talk: Briefing; the King and the Joker | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/us/washington-talk-briefing-the-king-and-the-joker.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 17 August 1988 | quote = This is the [[Title of Nobility Clause|''title of nobility'' clause]], which provides: 'No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wood | first = Diane | author-link = Diane Wood  | title = Our 18th century constitution in the 21st century world | journal = [[New York University Law Review]], Madison Lecture | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 1079–1107 | publisher = [[New York University School of Law]] | date = October 2005 | url = http://www.nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-80-number-4/our-18th-century-constitution-21st-century-world | quote = Debate [over the Constitution's] meaning is inevitable whenever something as specific as the...

==History==
===French Revolution to World War II===
The prominent inspiration for the centre-right (especially in Britain) was the [[traditionalist conservatism]] of [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Eatwell | first = Roger | author-link = Roger Eatwell | contribution = The nature of the Right: the right as a variety of styles of thought | editor-last1 = Eatwell | editor-first1 = Roger | editor-last2 = O'Sullivan | editor-first2 = Noël | editor-link = Roger Eatwell | title = The nature of the right: American and European politics and political thought since 1789 | page = 66 | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston | year = 1990 | series = Themes in right-wing ideology and politics series | isbn = 9780861879342 | quote = Burke has been seen as the father of modern British conservatism, which serves as the best example of the moderate right tradition. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke's traditionalist conservatism was more moderate than the [[continental conservatism]] developed by [[Joseph De Maistre]] in [[France]], that upon experiencing the [[French Revolution]] completely denounced the status quo that existed immediately prior to the revolution (unlike Burke) and de Maistre sought a [[reactionary]] counter-revolution that would dismantle all modern society and return it to a strictly religious-based society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Adams | first1 = Bert | last2 = Sydie | first2 = R.A. | contribution = Section I The origins of sociological theory: the philosophical precursors of sociology | editor-last1 = Adams | editor-first1 = Bert | editor-last2 = Sydie | editor-first2 = R.A. | title = Sociological theory | pages = 25–26 | publisher = Pine Forge Press | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780761985570 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Burke condemned the French Revolution, he had supported the [[American Revolution]] that he viewed as being a conservative revolution.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{citation | last = Bridge | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Bridge | contribution = Burke and the conservative tradition | editor-last1 = Close | editor-first1 = David H. | editor-last2 = Bridge | editor-first2 = Carl | editor-link2 = Carl Bridge | title = Revolution: a history of the idea | page = 81 | publisher = [[Croom Helm Ltd.]] | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780709934202 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke claimed that the Americans revolted for the same reason as the English had during the [[Glorious Revolution]], in both cases a monarch had overstepped the boundaries of his duties.&lt;ref name="David" /&gt; Burke claimed that the American Revolution was justified because King George III had overstepped his customary rights by imposing taxes on the American colonists without their consent.&lt;ref name="David" /&gt; Burke opposed the French Revolution because he opposed its anti-traditionalism and its use of abstract ideas, such as the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and its [[egalitarianism|universal egalitarianism]] that Burke rebuked by claiming that it effectively endorsed "hairdressers" being able to be politicians.&lt;ref name="David" /&gt;

In Britain, the traditionalist conservative movement was represented in the British Conservative Party.&lt;ref name="IanAdams" /&gt; Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]] sought to address social problems affecting the working class due to lack of assistance from the laissez-faire economy and formed his [[one nation conservatism]] that claimed that lack of assistance for the lower classes had divided British society into two nations – the rich and the poor as the result of unrestrained private enterprise, he claimed that he sought to break down.&lt;ref name="IanAdams_a"&gt;{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = 59 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli said that he supported a united British nation while presenting the other parties representing the upper-class or the lower-class.&lt;ref name="IanAdams" /&gt; Disraeli was hostile to [[free trade]] and preferred aristocratic [[paternalism]] as well as promoting [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name="IanAdams" /&gt; However, with the revival in Britain of the socialist movement with the rise of the Labour Party and the demise of the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party shifted to become a supporter of capitalism and an opponent of [[socialism]], while advocacy of capitalism was promoted within the principles of traditionalist conservatism.&lt;ref name="IanAdams" /&gt;

Another centre-right movement that arose in France in response to the French Revolution was the beginning of the [[Christian democracy]] movement, where moderate conservative Catholics accepted the democratic elements of the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="IanAdams_a" /&gt; The first Christian democratic party was founded in Italy in 1919 by [[Luigi Sturzo]], but it was suppressed by the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] regime and was forced into exile in France.&lt;ref name="IanAdams_a" /&gt; In France, Sturzo founded an international movement that supported the creation of a European [[common market]] and European integration to prevent war, amongst those who attended the group included future German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Robert Schuman]].&lt;ref name="IanAdams_a" /&gt;

===Post-World War II===
In Europe after [[World War II]], centre-right Christian democratic parties arose as powerful political movements while the authoritarian reactionary Catholic traditionalist movements in Europe diminished in strength.&lt;ref name="IanAdams_a" /&gt; Christian democratic movements became major movements in [[Austria]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="IanAdams_a" /&gt;

[[Neoliberalism]] arose as an economic theory by [[Milton Friedman]] that condemned government [[Economic interventionism|interventionism in the economy]] that it associated with socialism and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = 206 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoliberals rejected [[Keynesian economics]] that they claimed advocate too much emphasis on relieving [[unemployment]] in response to their observance of the [[Great Depression]], identifying the real problem as being with [[inflation]] and advocate the policy of [[monetarism]] to deal with inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = 207 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoliberal economics was endorsed by Conservative British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] who adapted it as part of a [[Free market|free-market]] conservatism closer to the developments in [[American conservatism]], while traditionalist conservatism became less influential within the British Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Ian | title = Political ideology today | page = 58 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2001 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780719060205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] still has a large traditional conservative base, particularly the conservative [[Cornerstone Group]]. Thatcher publicly supported centre-right politics and supported its spread in [[Eastern Europe]] after the end of the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] regimes in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Evans | first = Eric J. | author-link = Eric J.

In the United States, President [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981–1989) adopted many policies stemming from [[Milton Friedman]]'s economic theories, including principles from the [[Chicago school of economics]] and [[monetarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cornwell | first = Rupert | author-link = Rupert Cornwell | title = Milton Friedman, free-market economist who inspired Reagan and Thatcher, dies aged 94 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milton-friedman-freemarket-economist-who-inspired-reagan-and-thatcher-dies-aged-94-424665.html | work = [[The Independent]] | publisher = Independent Print Ltd | location = Washington | date = 17 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While social conservatives and the rise of the [[Christian Right]] contributed greatly to forming the [[Reagan Coalition]], the President also had the support of right-wing economic neoliberals. Using Friedman's neoliberal theories, the Reagan administration cut the marginal income tax from 70% to 28%, reduced inflation from 13.5% in [[Jimmy Carter]]'s final year (1980) to 1.9% in 1986 and reduced civilian unemployment from 10.8% to 5.3% of the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The second American revolution: Reagonomics | url = http://www.reaganfoundation.org/economic-policy.aspx | website = reaganfoundation.org | publisher = [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be referred to as a ''drive pipe'' because it is often ''driven'' into the ground with a [[pile driver]].

'''Conductor pipe''' is typically set, on petroleum wells, before any drilling operations are performed. It is usually set with special pile-driving or spudder rigs, though the [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] is sometimes used to save time and money.

In the [[offshore drilling]] industry, the conductor pipe is set in the seabed, and is a key structural foundation for the subsea [[wellhead]]. When drilling an offshore well, a [[marine riser]] is connected to the well, and this is subjected to large environmental forces such as current and waves which are transferred to the conductor. The forces can be large and also cyclical which can potentially cause fatigue damage to the conductor, especially in harsh environmental conditions. A Conductor tensioner unit (CTU) can be used in shallow water on [[jackup rig]] to withstand such damaging forces.

The '''editorial board''' is a group of experts, usually at a [[publication]], who dictate the tone and direction the publication's [[editorial]] policy will take.

== Mass media ==
At a newspaper, the editorial board usually consists of the editorial page editor, and [[editorial writer]]s. Some newspapers include other personnel as well. Editorial boards for magazines may include experts in the subject area that the magazine focuses on, and larger magazines may have several editorial boards grouped by subject. An executive editorial board may oversee these subject boards, and usually includes the executive editor and representatives from the subject focus boards.

Editorial boards meet on a regular basis to discuss the latest news and opinion trends and discuss what the newspaper should say on a range of issues. They will then decide who will write what editorials and for what day. When such an editorial appears in a newspaper, it is considered the institutional opinion of that newspaper. At some newspapers, the editorial board will also review [[wire service]] and [[print syndication|syndicated]] columns for inclusion on the editorial page or op-ed page. Some newspapers, particularly small ones, do not have an editorial board, choosing instead to rely on the judgment of a single editorial page editor.

Book and magazine publishers will often use their editorial boards to review or select manuscripts or articles, and sometimes to check facts. Book publishers may also make use of editorial boards, using subject experts to select [[manuscript]]s.

The editorial board meeting ran by [[Phyllis E. Grann]] at [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam]] was called the "Thursday Morning Breakfast Meeting." The meeting was described in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' as, "8:30 event had a war-room atmosphere, with representatives of every department--editorial, publicity, sales and marketing--reporting in to Grann, who made decisions like a Mike Milken-style bond trader, constantly evaluation and re-evaluating her positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/5618/index2.html|title=Now for the Grann Finale|last=Maneker|first=Marion|date=January 1, 2002|website=New York Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Academic journals ==
Almost all [[academic journal]]s have an editorial board consisting of selected, unpaid experts in the academic field covered by a journal. This is almost always an honorary position, although board members sometimes provide [[peer review]] of submissions. A member may be asked to review several manuscripts per year and may edit a [[special issue]]. The members may also be consulted regarding new regulations at the journal. They are expected to promote the journal among their peers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/editors  Information for Editors], [[MDPI]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elsevier.com/editors/editorial-boards Editorial Boards], [[Elsevier]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political campaigns ==
The editorial board controls the [[Testimonial|endorsement]] process for the [[newspaper]] during campaigns. Candidates will come before the editorial board for a group [[interview]] which can last for several hours, depending on the office. During the [[meeting]], the board asks the candidate a range of questions on various issues and uses the meeting as a way to judge which candidate to endorse.

Candidates may routinely meet with editorial board early in their [[political campaign|campaigns]] in order to provide their opinions to the newspaper's [[Decision-making|decision makers]]. This is a way to steer media coverage their way and to influence the final endorsement.

'''Emin Arslan''' (13 July 1868 – 9 January 1943) was a Lebanese author, journalist, editor and consul. He was the Consul General of the Ottoman Empire in [[Bordeaux]], Brussels, Paris and [[Buenos Aires]]. He authored books and articles in Arabic, Spanish and French.

He initially supported the ideas of the [[Young Turks]], who favoured a reform so as to restore the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and the parliament and grant rights to all the individuals and nations of the Empire. In 1914, while at office as Ottoman Consul General in Buenos Aires, he broke with the Young Turks government due to its alliance with the [[German Empire]] and its entrance in [[World War I]], which Arslan harshly criticized.

He denounced the [[Armenian Genocide|extermination of Armenians]] from the review he founded and edited, '''La Nota''', in August 1915. During his stay in Europe he had also condemned the [[Hamidian massacres]] from the French press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tornielli|first1=Pablo|title=El cónsul otomano en Buenos Aires y el genocidio armenio|journal=Todo es Historia|date=July 2015|issue=576|pages=26–27|url=http://www.todoeshistoria.com.ar/ediciones.php?edicion=576|accessdate=16 March 2017|issn=0040-8611|trans-title=The Ottoman consul in Buenos Aires and the Armenian genocide|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war Arslan initially supported a provisional [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]]. As the Mandate prolonged he denounced it as a corrupt and despotic colonization and adhered to the idea of the independence of former Ottoman Syria as a single sovereign state.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Emin Arslan was born in [[Choueifat]], [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], Ottoman Empire. He belonged to a distinguished [[Druze]] family whose members hold traditionally the title of [[Emir]]s until today.

Emin was son of Zahiyya Shihāb and Mağīd Arslān, son of Milḥam, son of Ḥaidar, son of 'Abbās, son of Fakhreddīn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ziriklī, al|first1=Ḫair ad-Dīn|title=قاموس تراجم لأشهر الرجال والنساء من العرب والمستعربين والمستشرقين|date=2002|publisher=دار العالم للملايين|location=Beirut|edition=15|page=19|trans-title=The Sages.

The latter helped found [[Greater Lebanon]] in 1920 and fathered [[Majid Arslan|Mağīd Arslān II (1908–1983)]], a Lebanon's independence hero, member of the Lebanese Parliament and government minister. Current traditional chief of the Arslān family, [[Talal Arslan]], is therefore a great niece of Emin Arslan.

Emin did not marry and had no children; he was succeeded by his nieces Rafīq Sa'īd Arslān, Malik Sa'īd Arslān, Zahiyya Tawfīq Arslān, Majīd Tawfīq Arslān (i.e. Mağīd Arslān II) and Nuhād Tawfīq Arslān.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arslan, Emin s/ Sucesión – Legajo 32698 – (judicial file)|publisher=Archivo General del Poder Judicial de la Nación, Juzgado Civil 9|location=Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career in Mount Lebanon==
[[File:Mutasarrifiyya_de_monte_libano_1893.png|right|thumb|300x300px|Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, 1893. Arrows mark [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], [[Beirut]] and Arslan's birthplace, [[Choueifat]].]]
In 1892&amp;nbsp;he was designated ''mudīr''&amp;nbsp;('director') of the Far West Directorate (''Nāḥyat al-Ġarb al-Aqṣā''), in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. He resigned in 1893 after a conflict with the [[Mutasarrıf|''mutaṣarrif'']] Na'ūm Pāšā (Naum Pasha). Arslan joined the Freemasonry on 24 August 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Franc-Maçonnerie au Liban|url=http://www.grandorientarabe.org/index.php?p=1_119_La-Franc-Ma-onnerie-au-Liban|website=Grand Orient Arabe Œcuménique (G.O.A.O.)

==Exile in France==
In 1893, he resigned as ''mudīr'' {{clarify|date=August 2017}} and joined his friend [[w:ar:سليم سركيس|Salim Sarkis]] in exile. They stopped briefly in Egypt and then went to Paris where, along with other Arab expatriates founded the "Turkish Syrian Committee."&lt;ref name="Kayalı"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kayalı|first1=Hasan|title=Arabs and Young Turks: Ottomanism, Arabism, and Islamism in the Ottoman Empire, 1908–1918|date=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520917576|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NX2fICZGh80C|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They contacted [[Ahmed Rıza]], a major supporter of the Young Turks movement and editor of [[w:tr:Meşveret (gazete)|''Meşveret'']], a Turkish written political newspaper. The main activity of the exiles was to spread criticism against the Ottoman regime through the general European press and from some party organs. They demanded restoration of the 1876 Ottoman constitution, reestablishment of the parliament and equal rights for individuals and communities.

=== "Kashf an-Niqāb" newspaper ===
''Kashf an-Niqāb'' (كشف النقاب), i.e. "unveiling", was an Arabic written newspaper edited in Paris by Emin Arslan and his friend, writer and journalist [[w:ar:سليم سركيس|Salim Sarkis]], from 9 August 1894 until 25 July 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daya|first1=Jean|title=أعداد أولى لدوريات مجهولة .

According to Sarkis, the Ottoman embassy pressured the French authorities into censoring the magazine and order the concierge to disclose names of visitors.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sarkis|first1=Salim|title=France and the Sultan.

==="Turkiyā al-Fatāt" newspaper===
''"Turkiyā al-Fatāt'' (تركيا الفتاة) – ''La Jeune Turquie"'', i.e. "Young Turkey", was a bilingual biweekly edited in Paris in Arabic and French from December 1895 through middle 1897 by Emin Arslan and Ḫalīl Ġānim (خليل غانم) on behalf of the "Turkish Syrian Committee,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mardin|first1=Şerif Arif|authorlink1=Şerif Mardin|title=Libertarian Movements in the Ottoman Empire 1878–1895|journal=Middle East Journal|date=1962|volume=16, n. 2|issue=Spring, 1962|page=176|jstor=4323469|language=English|issn=0026-3141}}&lt;/ref&gt; self described as "journal of political propaganda." It criticized sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]'s government.

Co-editor Khalil Ghanem (Beirut 1847 – Paris 1903) had taken part in the previous reformist movement known as the [[Young Ottomans]]. Member of the first Ottoman parliament in 1877, the French Embassy in Istanbul granted him political asylum after his mentor [[Midhat Pasha]] was deposed.&lt;ref name="Kayalı" /&gt; Before meeting Arslan he had founded and edited al-Bassir (al-Bașīr البصير) weekly (Paris, 1881–1882).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ayalon|first1=Ami|title=Language and Change in the Arab Middle East: The Evolution of Modern Political Discourse|date=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195041408|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCznCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 March 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanem wrote also for the [[Journal des débats]] and was named chevalier of the French [[Legion of Honour]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nouvelles diverses|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k460950r/f2.item.r=khalil'%20target='_blank'|accessdate=22 March 2017|work=Journal des débats|date=12 October 1879|location=Paris|page=2|language=French|quote=''Par décret du 27 septembre et sur la proposition du ministre des affaires étrangères, le Président de la république a nommé notre collaborateur Khalil Ghanem chevalier de l'Ordre de la Légion-d'Honneur.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Paris press===
On 1896 Arslan wrote four articles that were published on [[La Revue Blanche]], titled "Les Affaires de Crète", "Les Affaires d'Orient", "Les Troubles de Syrie" and "Les Arménians à Constantinople".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Revue Blanche, v.

==="Truce" with the Sultan's envoy===
The Ottoman leadership tried to neutralize the exiles' propaganda in Europe. Despite not being too numerous, the exiles managed to get attention in the press. As one of them wrote: "(...) &lt;nowiki&gt;[the sultan]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''knows that if we are allowed a free hand in Paris our members and papers can do him more harm than ten French men-of-war''."&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

On 29 January 1897, one of their communiques was published by the Official Bulletin of the Kingdom of Italy. It was addressed to "the six powers signatories of the Treatises of Paris and Berlin" and it was signed by "Murād Bey, general deputy of the Young Turkey; Ḫalīl Ġānim, former representative of Syria before the Turkish parliament; Ahmed Rıza Bey; the Emir Emin Arslan; H. Anthony Salmoné", et al., on behalf of the "party of the general reformation in Turkey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bey|first1=Murad|last2=Ganem|first2=Halil|last3=Rıza|first3=Ahmed|last4=Arslan|first4=Emin|last5=Salmoné|first5=H.

The Ottoman government sent to Paris Ahmed Cemâluddîn with the mission of contacting the opposition and offer a general pardon for political prisoners, restoring the exiles in their former positions and reestablishing the constitution, in exchange for ending their propaganda campaign.&lt;ref name="Recuerdos"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arslan|first1=Emin|title=Recuerdos de Oriente|date=1918|publisher=Talleres Gráficos La Lectura|location=Buenos Aires|pages=117, 211–212|edition=second|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arslan states in his memories that initially he rejected the agreement despite having direct relatives who would be released with the amnesty. Then he proposed suspending the agreement until Istanbul showed progress in abiding by it, which was rejected by Cemâluddîn. He finally agreed and was designated Consul General in Bordeaux.&lt;ref name="Recuerdos" /&gt;

The sultan fulfilled his promises except for restoring the constitution and reopening the parliament, which would only happen in 1908 with the Young Turks Revolution.

== Consul General in Brussels ==
Since the 1897 "truce" Emin Arslan was designated Consul General of the Ottoman Empire in Bordeaux and almost immediately transferred to Brussels, where he stayed at office until 1908.

In Belgium Arslan befriended Roland de Marès (1874–1955), director of ''L'indépendance belge'' newspaper, and jurist [[Ernest Nys]].

Despite joining the Ottoman consular service Arslan kept publishing articles, sometime with heavy criticism against the government. As a 1900 article in [[The Nation]] quoted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''A new advocate for reform in Turkey has risen in Emin Arslan Effendi, the Consul General in Brussels. Last year he sent to Abdul Hamid a detailed report of the sufferings of the peasants in certain of the richest provinces in the empire. He pointed out that, unable to bear the heavy burden of taxation and the arbitrary methods of the farmers of revenue, they were cutting down their trees, tearing up their vines, leaving their lands uncultivated, and even emigrating in vast numbers beyond the seas. America alone, be said, contained more than 100,000 Syrian emigrants, a third of whom were Mohammedans. "Never in the history of Islam has such a thing occurred." In this year’s report he dwells upon the great numbers of high officials and their enormous salaries. There are in the army, for instance, forty-four marshals, and forty-six viziers with the rank of marshal, and there are eighty members of the Council of State''—''as many as in France and Germany put together. Mukhtar Pasha's salary is four times as large as Lord Cromer's, and the Grand Vizier receives twice as much as Lord Salisbury. But "as the majority of these high officials receive from the Treasury double and sometimes treble their salaries, the financial embarrassment of the empire is but natural''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notes|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/pst.000068744175?urlappend=%3Bseq=390|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=The Nation|issue=1820|date=17 May 1900|location=New York|page=378|language=English|volume=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A novel that Arslan wrote in Spanish years after, "End of a romance" ("Final de un idilio") is staged in Brussels short before WWI. Its main characters are Van Doren, an army officer and aristocrat, and Riette, a French Alsacian girl. It was first edited in Buenos Aires in 1917.&lt;ref name="Final de un idilio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arslan|first1=Emin|title=Final de un idilio|date=1917|publisher=Rodríguez Giles|location=Buenos Aires|edition=first|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GbnTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 March 2017|language=Spanish|trans-title=End of a Romance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel to Istanbul and the Young Turks Revolution==
[[File:1908-mesrutiyet.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Postal card praising the restoration of the constitution, 24 July 1908, written in Greek and Ottoman Turkish, depicting "Enver Bey" (then known as [[Enver Pasha|Enver Pashá]]).]]
Arslan resigned as Ottoman Consul General in Brussels on 1908&amp;nbsp;and travelled to [[Istanbul]]. A month before, the Young Turks Revolution had taken over the power although without deposing Sultan Abdul Hamid II.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

During the [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909]], a first cousin of Arslan's, [[Latakia]]'s representative to the Congress&amp;nbsp;Muḥammad Muṣṭafā Arslān, was shot and killed close to the Parliament. Emin Arslan had to take care of his remnants and arrange their transport to Beyrouth. The French newspaper&amp;nbsp;[[Gil Blas]]&amp;nbsp;published on 15 April 1909, that "the Emir Arslan, representative for Latakia" had been killed. Some European friends of Emin Arslan thought he was the victim.&lt;ref name="Recuerdos"/&gt;

==Consul General in Paris==
Emin Arslan was designated Consul General in Paris in 1909. Paris' [[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]] informed in September 1909, that "''the Turkish government resolved to upgrade its Paris consulate to a general consulate''" and that Emir Emin Arslan, former Consul General in Brussels, had been designated as Consul General in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emir Emin Arslan, ancien consul général à Bruxelles, est nommé consul général à Paris|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k239864n/f2.item.r=arslan.zoom|accessdate=17 March 2017|work=Le Temps|issue=17612|publisher=BnF Gallica|date=16 September 1909|location=Paris|language=French|page=3|trans-title=Emir Emin Arslan, former Consul General in Brussels, is designed Consul General in Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biographic writings Arslan states that he looked for an alternative destination, without elaborating on the reasons. By then, ambassador to France was Na'ūm Pāšā, former ''mutaṣarrif'' of Mount Lebanon during Arslan's tenure as ''mudīr'' in 1893. Apparently Arslan did not have good relations with Na'ūm; 17 years before, a conflict with him had caused his resignation as mudīr and his exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=نويهض|first1=عجاج|last2=نويهض|first2=خلدون|title=الأمير أمين أرسلان؛ ناشر ثقافة العرب في الأرجنتين|date=2010|publisher=دار الإستقلال للدراسات والنشر|location=Beirut|isbn=9789953570006|edition=first|url=http://www.neelwafurat.com/itempage.aspx?id=lbb228990-207383&amp;search=books|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=Arabic|page=64|trans-title=Emir Emin Arslan: Diffuser of the Arab Culture in Argentine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Arslan found out about the newly established consular relations between the Ottoman Empire and the Argentine Republic, he asked to be transferred to Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Recuerdos"/&gt;

==In Buenos Aires==

===Consul General of the Ottoman Empire===
On 11 June 1910, the Ottoman Empire and the Argentine Republic signed an agreement on consular relations and exchanged consuls before the treatise was approved by both the parliaments (the Argentine congress sanctioned law 8184 approving the treatise only on 2 September 1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law 8184 – Approval of a Treatise of Consular Relations between the Argentine Republic and the Ottoman Empire|url=http://www.saij.gob.ar/8184-nacional-aprobacion-convenio-para-establecer-relaciones-consulares-turquia-lnt0002382-1911-09-02/123456789-0abc-defg-g28-32000tcanyel|website=Sistema Argentino de Información Jurídica (SAIJ)|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (Argentina)|Ministry of Justice]]|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emir Emin Arslan was to be the first and only consul of the Ottoman Empire in Argentina, because in 1914 the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] removed Arslan and the German Consulate assumed the representation of Ottoman interests in Argentina. Arslan arrived in Buenos Aires on 29 October 1910, on board of the steamboat ''Chili'', belonging to French firm [[Messageries Maritimes]], "to an exuberant welcome by a crowd of 4000 Ottoman subjects."&lt;ref name="Hyland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyland|first1=Stephen|title='Arisen from Deep Slumber': Transnational Politics and Competing Nationalisms among Syrian Immigrants in Argentina, 1900–1922|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|date=August 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=547–574|doi=10.1017/S0022216X11000770|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-latin-american-studies/article/div-classtitlearisen-from-deep-slumber-transnational-politics-and-competing-nationalisms-among-syrian-immigrants-in-argentina-19001922div/D024D7C31CD142341973F0F9B18AB15B#|accessdate=21 March 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|quote=''After the crowd had waited for more than three hours, Arslan's ship, flying the Ottoman flag at full mast, docked, and bands from the Young Ottoman Society and the Israelite Society performed the Argentine national anthem, the Ottoman hymn and the Marseillaise. Consul Arslan offered words of thanks to the throng of compatriots and to Argentina for its generosity. The reception committee then ushered Arslan into a waiting car and set off for the [[Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires|Plaza Hotel]], the fanciest hotel in the capital. The excitement grew when Argentine spectators from the balconies overlooking the famed [[Florida Street|Calle Florida]] began saluting the 'colectividad otomana', or Ottoman community, as the marchers below praised Argentina. Once at the hotel, Arslan appeared on a balcony overlooking the assembled Ottoman subjects and the Plaza San Martín and offered his thanks to the organising committee.''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before arriving in Buenos Aires, the 'Chili' made a stop at [[Rio de Janeiro]], where Argentine newspapers of the last weeks were available. Other passengers informed Arslan that during a debate in the [[Argentine Senate]], Senator Manuel Láinez had critiziced the Syro-Ottoman immigration deeming it "not useful" because it was purportedly composed of peddlers rather than agricultural workers.

Ottoman immigration had been defended by [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]] Senator [[Joaquín V. González]]. The Senate session was on 12 September 1910, few days before Arslan's arrival to Buenos Aires, on 29 October 1910. Since Arslan was aware of that kind of criticism, right from his first press interviews he announced that he was going to favor the dedication of his fellows to agriculture. Short after his arrival he visited Senator González to thank him for his defense of the Syro-Ottoman community. Since they were both fluent in French they could communicate without a translator. They became close friends until González's demise in December 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tornielli|first1=Pablo|title=El primer cónsul otomano en la Argentina|journal=Todo es Historia|date=March 2015|volume=47|issue=572|pages=6–19|url=http://todoeshistoria.com.ar/ediciones.php?edicion=572|accessdate=17 March 2017|location=Buenos Aires|language=Spanish|issn=0040-8611|trans-title=The first Ottoman consul in Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Arslan had arrived in Argentina without any knowledge of Spanish, short after his arrival he published his first articles in Spanish at [[Caras y Caretas (Argentina)|Caras y Caretas]] magazine and started writing a novel: "End of a romance" ("Final de un idilio"). In the long "dedication to [[Julio Argentino Roca|general Roca]]" that opens the novel, Arslan states that he wrote part of the book in "''La Larga''" Roca's ranch, (''Estancia La Larga''). The former president died in 1914 before a scheduled second visit of Arslan's to ''La Larga''. The novel's first edition was published in 1917.&lt;ref name="Final de un idilio" /&gt;

While at office as Consul General in Buenos Aires, Arslan wrote for the ''Revista Argentina de Ciencias Políticas'' (''Argentine Review of Political Science''), directed by Rodolfo Rivarola, the following articles: "''La joven Turquía y Europa''" (''Young Turkey and Europe'', t. II, pp.&amp;nbsp;200–215, 1911), "''La Tripolitania''" (''The Tripolitania'', t. III, pp.&amp;nbsp;177–87, 379–90, 1911) and "''Historia diplomática de la Europa Balcánica''" (''Diplomatic History of Balcanic Europe'', t. VI, pp.&amp;nbsp;635–66, 1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Estudio e Índice General 1910–1920|journal=Revista Argentina de Ciencias Políticas|url=http://www.ancmyp.org.ar/user/files/07%20-%20Auza_07.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2017|publisher=Academia Nacional de Ciencias Morales y Políticas|location=Buenos Aires|language=Spanish|issn=0325-4763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation as Consul General in Buenos Aires and death sentence in absentia===
Arslan opposed the entry of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and his relation with the Ottoman Foreign Ministry was damaged. He resigned in late 1914. The Ottoman Empire then entrusted its consular relations with Argentina to the German Consul General in Buenos Aires, Rodolfo Bobrik, who demanded Arslan to surrender the consulate and its documentation. Arslan replied that he had not received an official communication from Istanbul ordering him to hand down consular documentation to a foreign official.&amp;nbsp;The German Consul General filed a case before [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Argentine's Supreme Court]]. The Court upheld the claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.iai.spk-berlin.de/viewer/content/?action=pdf&amp;metsFile=790812487.xml&amp;targetFileName=El_asunto_del_consulado_otomano_ante_la_suprema_corte.pdf&amp;divID=LOG_0007 El asunto del consulado otomano ante la Suprema Corte.

In an article published on June 1916 on ''La Nota'' magazine, Arslan wrote about the death sentence ''in absentia''&amp;nbsp;passed against him after he was declared "''firārī''", i.e. ''fugitive''. The review's staff organized a banquet in his honor at a restaurant called "''Ferrari''" after his owner's surname, and published the news under the title "''A death sentence celebrated with a banquet''."&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;''La Nota'', Buenos Aires, 10 June 1916, "Reflexiones de un condenado a muerte", nº 44, pp. 862–863 y "Una condena festejada con un banquete".&lt;/ref&gt;

Arslan founded and directed weekly ''La Nota'', whose first issue was published on 14 August 1915. During 1916 [[Carlos Alberto Leumann]] was its&amp;nbsp;editor-in-chief. A total of 312 issues were edited until discontinuation in 1921.&lt;ref name="Antología"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delgado|first1=Verónica|title=Revista La Nota: antologÌa 1915–1917|date=2010|publisher=Universidad Nacional de la Plata|location=La Plata|isbn=9789503406793|edition=first|url=http://bibliotecaorbistertius.fahce.unlp.edu.ar/03.Delgado|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argentine citizenship ===
[[File:Great_Syrian_Revolution_Book.jpg|left|thumb|''The Syrian Revolution against the French Mandate''&amp;nbsp;(Buenos Aires, 1926).]]
In 1921, during the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, Arslan acquired the Argentine citizenship and made public his reasons: 
: (...) ''I had already taken the resolution of quitting politics and establishing in Argentina seven years ago''. ''The reason is quite simple and I expressed it to the Grand Visir in my aforementioned memorandum: either if Germany triumphed or was defeated we would be defeated. Because our victory would turn us into their subalterns and their defeat would allow the dismantlement of our unity and turn our country into a group of colonies. And I, rather than being the subject of a colony, preferred to be a citizen in a respected State, particularly if it had such an illustrious status as the Argentine State.''&lt;ref name="Hombre de tres mundos"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tornielli|first1=Pablo|title=Hombre de tres mundos.

Franco, 1894–1947). 47 issues were published from May 1925 to May 1926, including texts from [[Leopoldo Lugones]], [[Alberto Williams]], [[Eugeni d'Ors|Eugenio d'Ors]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Eduardo Acevedo Díaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gasió|first1=Guillermo|last2=García Cedro|first2=Gabriela|title=Que sean libros en blanco|date=2011|publisher=Teseo|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=9789871354863|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbePTDjPV14C&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;ots=GIWTGVNvni&amp;dq=arslan%20%22el%20lapiz%20azul%22&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q=arslan&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Lápiz Azul|url=http://catalogo.cedinci.org/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=52248|website=Catálogo de Revistas Culturales Argentinas|publisher=CeDInCI|accessdate=17 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317200252/http://catalogo.cedinci.org/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=52248|location=Buenos Aires|language=Spanish|archive-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and direction of Al-Istiklal===
In June 1926, Arslan founded ''Al-Istiklal'' (الإستقلال),&amp;nbsp;''The Independence.''&amp;nbsp;The magazine was in Arabic but part of its commercial ads were in Spanish. It came into being ''as a political and intellectual response to the upheaval caused by the Great Syrian Revolt'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logroño Narbona|first1=María del Mar|title=The 'Woman Question' in the Aftermath of the Great Syrian Revolt: A Transnational Dialogue from the Arab-Argentine Immigrant Press|journal=Al-Raida|date=2007|volume=XXIV|issue=116|pages=1–5|url=http://alraidajournal.com/index.php/ALRJ/article/viewFile/202/201|accessdate=17 March 2017|publisher=Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World, Lebanese American University|location=Beirut|language=English|issn=0259-9953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''was one of the main Arabic anti-French organs from Argentina/Brazil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21686">'''German studies''' is the field of [[humanities]] that researches, documents, and disseminates [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[German history]], and [[German politics]] in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are {{lang|de|Germanistik}}, {{lang|de|Deutsche Philologie}}, and {{lang|de|Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft und Literaturwissenschaft}}. In English the terms '''Germanistics''' or '''Germanics''' are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as ''German studies'', ''German language and literature'', or ''German philology''.

Modern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines:  German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.

==German linguistics==

German linguistics is traditionally called [[philology]] in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists{{vague|date=September 2012}}. It is roughly divided as follows:
* [[Old High German]] (''Althochdeutsch'') 8th – 11th centuries
* [[Middle High German]] (''Mittelhochdeutsch'') 11th – 14th centuries
* [[Early New High German]] (''Frühneuhochdeutsch'') 14th – 17th centuries
* [[Modern German]] ([[Standard German]], [[German dialectology]]) 18th – 21st centuries

In addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).

==German literature studies==

The study [[German literature]] is divided into two parts: {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft'' deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by ''Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft''. The field systematically examines German literature in terms of [[genre]], [[wikt:form|form]], [[Content (media and publishing)|content]], and [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch.  Important areas include [[edition philology]], [[history of literature]], and [[textual interpretation]].  The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-14-051363-9}}) is printed in English but contains many [[German-language]] literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of [[literary criticism]]; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by [[English-language]] critics and scholars.

== German teacher education ==
At least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the left navigation at the web page of one of the [[Cologne University]] German studies institutes at http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linguistics]] of [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Sprachwissenschaft}}'')
* German language and literature of up to about 1750 (''{{lang|de|Ältere Sprache und Literatur}}'')
* German language and literature since approximately 1750 (''{{lang|de|Neuere Literaturwissenschaft}}'')
* Specifics of the [[didactics]] of teaching German (''{{lang|de|Fachdidaktik}}'')
Several universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called "''{{lang|de|Deutsch (Lehramt)}}''". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the [[federal states of Germany]] cultural authorities, called the ''{{lang|de|[[Staatsexamen]]}}'' ("state exam").

==German media studies==
In recent years{{when|date=September 2012}}, German{{who|date=September 2012}} has looked for links with the fields of [[communication]]s, [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]].  In addition, the sub-branch of [[film studies]] has established itself.

==History==

As an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to [[Tacitus]]' ''Germania''. The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval [[Bible]] translations, were all undertaken during the [[German Renaissance]] of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies.  As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by  [[Georg Friedrich Benecke]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Karl Lachmann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9686">The Getty '''Thesaurus of Geographic Names''' (abbreviated TGN or [[GTGN]]) is a product of the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] included in the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]]. The TGN includes names and associated information about places. Places in TGN include administrative political entities (e.g., cities, nations) and physical features (e.g., mountains, rivers). Current and historical places are included. Other information related to history, population, culture, art and architecture is included. 

The resource is available to [[museums]], [[Art|art libraries]], [[archive]]s, visual resource collection catalogers, [[bibliography|bibliographic projects]] through private license or available to members of the general public for free on the Getty Vocabulary website (see external links).

The Getty vocabulary databases ([[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT), [[Union List of Artist Names]] (ULAN), and '''TGN''') are produced and maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program. They are compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction. They contain terms, names, and other information about people, places, things, and concepts relating to art, architecture, and material culture.

The Getty vocabularies can be used in three ways: at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials; as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; and as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/|title=Getty Vocabularies (Getty Research Institute)|website=www.getty.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Work on the TGN began in 1987, when the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology, at that time called the Vocabulary Coordination Group. The AAT was already being managed by the Getty at that time, and the Getty attempted to respond to requests from the creators of art information for additional controlled vocabularies for artists' names (ULAN) and geographic names (TGN). The development of TGN was informed by an international study completed by the Thesaurus Artis Universalis (TAU), a working group of the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art (CIHA), and by the consensus reached at a colloquium held in 1991, attended by the spectrum of potential users of geographic vocabulary in cataloging and scholarship of art and architectural history and archaeology. The initial core of the TGN was compiled from thousands of geographic names in use by various Getty cataloging and indexing projects, enlarged by information from U. S. government databases, and further enhanced by the manual entry of information from published hard-copy sources. The TGN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program.

The basic principles under which the TGN is constructed and maintained were established by the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and also employed for the [[Union List of Artist Names]] (ULAN): Its scope includes terminology needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is constructed using national and international standards for thesaurus construction; it comprises a hierarchy with tree structures corresponding to the current and historical worlds; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community.

TGN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and subsequently Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute). TGN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. Technical support for the TGN was provided by the Getty. TGN was first published in 1997 in machine-readable files. Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the TGN, hard-copy publication was deemed to be impractical. It is currently published in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for the TGN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the TGN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the TGN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/tgn/about.html/|title=Getty Vocabularies (Getty Research Institute)|website=www.getty.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TGN is available as [[Linked Open Data]]&lt;ref&gt;http://vocab.getty.edu&lt;/ref&gt; since August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/getty-thesaurus-of-geographic-names-released-as-linked-open-data/|title=Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names Released as Linked Open Data|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
TGN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 1,106,000 names and other information about places. Names for a place may include names in the vernacular language, English, other languages, historical names, names and in natural order and inverted order. Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name.

TGN is a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. Note that TGN is not a GIS (Geographic Information System). While many records in TGN include coordinates, these coordinates are approximate and are intended for reference only.

The focus of each TGN record is a place. There are around 912,000 places in the TGN. In the database, each place record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to the record for the place are names, the place's parent or position in the hierarchy, other relationships, geographic coordinates, notes, sources for the data, and place types, which are terms describing the role of the place (e.g., inhabited place and state capital). The temporal coverage of the TGN ranges from prehistory to the present and the scope is global.

==Design==
The TGN is a [[faceted classification]] system as well as a poly-hierarchical one.  There are two facets: World and Extraterrestrial. Within the World facet are Physical Features and Political Entities. One can view administrative places from as broad as continents and regions to as specific as neighborhoods, boroughs, towns, and cities. Within the Physical Features facets are mountain ranges, oceans, seas, rivers, waterfalls, island groups, and deserts.

The record for each concept includes its place in the hierarchy (with a link to its parent), as well as links to related terms, related concepts, sources for the data, and notes.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Hodge conjecture''' is a major unsolved problem in the field of [[algebraic geometry]] that relates the [[algebraic topology]] of a [[non-singular]] [[complex number|complex]] [[algebraic variety]] to its subvarieties. More specifically, the conjecture states that certain [[de Rham cohomology]] classes are algebraic, that is, they are sums of [[Poincaré duality|Poincaré duals]] of the [[homology class]]es of subvarieties. It was formulated by the Scottish mathematician [[William Vallance Douglas Hodge]] as a result of a work in between 1930 and 1940 to enrich the description of de Rham cohomology to include extra structure that is present in the case of complex algebraic varieties. It received little attention before Hodge presented it in an address during the 1950 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], held in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The Hodge conjecture is one of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]'s [[Millennium Prize Problems]], with a prize of $1,000,000 for whoever can prove or disprove the Hodge conjecture.

== Motivation ==
Let ''X'' be a [[compact space|compact]] [[complex manifold]] of complex dimension ''n''. Then ''X'' is an [[orientable]] [[smooth manifold]] of real dimension 2''n'', so its [[cohomology]] groups lie in degrees zero through 2''n''.  Assume ''X'' is a [[Kähler manifold]], so that there is a decomposition on its cohomology with complex [[coefficients]]

:&lt;math&gt;H^k(X, \mathbf{C}) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(X),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H''{{i sup|''p'',''q''}}(''X'') is the subgroup of cohomology classes which are represented by [[harmonic form]]s of type (''p'', ''q''). That is, these are the cohomology classes represented by [[differential form]]s which, in some choice of local coordinates ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', can be written as a [[harmonic function]] times
:&lt;math&gt;dz_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dz_{i_p} \wedge d\bar z_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d\bar z_{j_q}.&lt;/math&gt;
(See [[Hodge theory]] for more details.)  Taking wedge products of these harmonic representatives corresponds to the [[cup product]] in cohomology, so the cup product is compatible with the Hodge decomposition:

:&lt;math&gt;\cup : H^{p,q}(X) \times H^{p',q'}(X) \rightarrow H^{p+p',q+q'}(X).&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''X'' is a compact oriented manifold, ''X'' has a [[fundamental class]].

Let ''Z'' be a complex submanifold of ''X'' of dimension ''k'', and let ''i'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' be the inclusion map.  Choose a differential form α of type (''p'', ''q'').  We can integrate α over ''Z'':

:&lt;math&gt;\int_Z i^*\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

To evaluate this integral, choose a point of ''Z'' and call it 0.  Around 0, we can choose local coordinates ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' on ''X'' such that ''Z'' is just ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.  If ''p'' &gt; ''k'', then α must contain some ''dz&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' pulls back to zero on ''Z''.  The same is true if ''q'' &gt; ''k''.  Consequently, this integral is zero if (''p'', ''q'') ≠ (''k'', ''k'').

More abstractly, the integral can be written as the [[cap product]] of the homology class of ''Z'' and the cohomology class represented by α.  By Poincaré duality, the homology class of ''Z'' is dual to a cohomology class which we will call [''Z''], and the cap product can be computed by taking the cup product of [''Z''] and α and capping with the fundamental class of ''X''.  Because [''Z''] is a cohomology class, it has a Hodge decomposition.  By the computation we did above, if we cup this class with any class of type (''p'', ''q'') ≠ (''k'', ''k''), then we get zero.  Because ''H''{{i sup|2''n''}}(''X'', '''C''') = ''H''{{i sup|''n'',''n''}}(''X''), we conclude that [''Z''] must lie in ''H''{{i sup|''n''&amp;minus;''k'',''n''&amp;minus;''k''}}(''X'', '''C''').  Loosely speaking, the Hodge conjecture asks:

:Which cohomology classes in ''H''{{i sup|''k'',''k''}}(''X'') come from complex subvarieties ''Z''?

== Statement of the Hodge conjecture ==
Let:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hdg}^k(X) = H^{2k}(X, \mathbf{Q}) \cap H^{k,k}(X).&lt;/math&gt;

We call this the group of ''Hodge classes'' of degree 2''k'' on ''X''.

The modern statement of the Hodge conjecture is:

::'''Hodge conjecture.'''  Let ''X'' be a non-singular complex projective manifold.  Then every Hodge class on ''X'' is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the cohomology classes of complex subvarieties of ''X''.

A projective complex manifold is a complex manifold which can be embedded in [[complex projective space]].  Because projective space carries a Kähler metric, the [[Fubini–Study metric]], such a manifold is always a Kähler manifold.  By [[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry#Chow.27s theorem|Chow's theorem]], a projective complex manifold is also a smooth projective algebraic variety, that is, it is the zero set of a collection of homogeneous polynomials.

=== Reformulation in terms of algebraic cycles ===
Another way of phrasing the Hodge conjecture involves the idea of an algebraic cycle.  An ''[[algebraic cycle]]'' on ''X'' is a formal combination of subvarieties of ''X''; that is, it is something of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_i c_iZ_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients are usually taken to be integral or rational.  We define the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle to be the sum of the cohomology classes of its components. This is an example of the cycle class map of de Rham cohomology, see [[Weil cohomology]].  For example, the cohomology class of the above cycle would be:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i c_i[Z_i].&lt;/math&gt;

Such a cohomology class is called ''algebraic''.  With this notation, the Hodge conjecture becomes:

::Let ''X'' be a projective complex manifold.  Then every Hodge class on ''X'' is algebraic.

The assumption in the Hodge conjecture that ''X'' be algebraic (projective complex manifold) cannot be weakened. In 1977 Zucker showed that it is possible to construct a counterexample to the Hodge conjecture as complex tori with analytic rational cohomology of type (''p'',''p''), which is not projective algebraic. (see appendix B of {{Harvtxt|Zucker|1977}})

== Known cases of the Hodge conjecture ==

=== Low dimension and codimension ===
The first result on the Hodge conjecture is due to {{Harvtxt|Lefschetz|1924}}.  In fact, it predates the conjecture and provided some of Hodge's motivation.

::'''Theorem''' ([[Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes]])  Any element of ''H''{{i sup|2}}(''X'', '''Z''') ∩ ''H''{{i sup|1,1}}(''X'') is the cohomology class of a [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] on ''X''.  In particular, the Hodge conjecture is true for ''H''{{i sup|2}}.

A very quick proof can be given using [[sheaf cohomology]] and the [[exponential exact sequence]].  (The cohomology class of a divisor turns out to equal to its first [[Chern class]].)  Lefschetz's original proof proceeded by [[normal function (geometry)|normal function]]s, which were introduced by [[Henri Poincaré]].  However, [[Griffiths transversality theorem]] shows that this approach cannot prove the Hodge conjecture for higher codimensional subvarieties.

By the [[Hard Lefschetz theorem]], one can prove:

::'''Theorem.'''  If the Hodge conjecture holds for Hodge classes of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;p &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;, then the Hodge conjecture holds for Hodge classes of degree &lt;math&gt;2n-p&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining the above two theorems implies that Hodge conjecture is true for Hodge classes of degree &lt;math&gt;2n-p&lt;/math&gt;.  This proves the Hodge conjecture when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has dimension at most three.

The Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes also implies that if all Hodge classes are generated by the Hodge classes of divisors, then the Hodge conjecture is true:

::'''Corollary.'''  If the algebra
:: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hdg}^*(X) = \bigoplus_k \operatorname{Hdg}^k(X)&lt;/math&gt;
: is generated by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hdg}^1(X)&lt;/math&gt;, then the Hodge conjecture holds for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Hypersurfaces ===
By the strong and weak [[Lefschetz theorem]], the only non-trivial part of the Hodge conjecture for [[hypersurface]]s is the degree ''m'' part (i.e., the middle cohomology) of a 2''m''-dimensional hypersurface &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbf P^{2m+1}&lt;/math&gt;. If the degree ''d'' is 2, i.e., ''X'' is a [[quadric]], the Hodge conjecture holds for all ''m''. For ''m'' = 2, i.e., [[fourfold]]s, the Hodge conjecture is known for &lt;math&gt;d \le 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;James Lewis: ''A Survey of the Hodge Conjecture'', 1991, Example 7.21&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abelian varieties ===
For most [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]], the algebra Hdg*(''X'') is generated in degree one, so the Hodge conjecture holds.  In particular, the Hodge conjecture holds for sufficiently general abelian varieties, for products of elliptic curves, and for simple abelian varieties of prime dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cycles on Abelian Varieties|jstor = 2033404|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 1958-02-01|pages = 88–98|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2033404|first = Arthur|last = Mattuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Algebraic Cycles and Poles of Zeta Functions|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244452499_Algebraic_Cycles_and_Poles_of_Zeta_Functions|website = ResearchGate|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CYCLES ON SIMPLE ABELIAN VARIETIES OF PRIME DIMENSION OVER NUMBER FIELDS - IOPscience|url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/IM1988v031n03ABEH001088/meta;jsessionid=D3482F569E5AD7B4B6ED54DEE4605AE6.ip-10-40-2-121|date = 1988-01-01|doi = 10.1070/im1988v031n03abeh001088 |first = Sergei G|last = Tankeev|bibcode = 1988IzMat..31..527T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, {{Harvtxt|Mumford|1969}} constructed an example of an abelian variety where Hdg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is not generated by products of divisor classes.  {{Harvtxt|Weil|1977}} generalized this example by showing that whenever the variety has [[complex multiplication]] by an [[imaginary quadratic field]], then Hdg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') is not generated by products of divisor classes.  {{Harvtxt|Moonen|Zarhin|1999}} proved that in dimension less than 5, either Hdg*(''X'') is generated in degree one, or the variety has complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field.  In the latter case, the Hodge conjecture is only known in special cases.

== Generalizations ==

=== The integral Hodge conjecture ===
Hodge's original conjecture was:

::'''Integral Hodge conjecture.'''  Let ''X'' be a projective complex manifold.  Then every cohomology class in ''H''{{i sup|2''k''}}(''X'', '''Z''') ∩ ''H''{{i sup|''k'',''k''}}(''X'') is the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle with integral coefficients on ''X''.

This is now known to be false.  The first counterexample was constructed by {{Harvtxt|Atiyah|Hirzebruch|1961}}.  Using [[K-theory]], they constructed an example of a torsion cohomology class, that is, a cohomology class α such that for some positive integer ''n'', ''n''α = 0, which is not the class of an algebraic cycle.  Such a class is necessarily a Hodge class.  {{Harvtxt|Totaro|1997}} reinterpreted their result in the framework of [[cobordism]] and found many examples of such classes.

The simplest adjustment of the integral Hodge conjecture is:

::'''Integral Hodge conjecture modulo torsion.'''  Let ''X'' be a projective complex manifold.  Then every cohomology class in ''H''{{i sup|2''k''}}(''X'', '''Z''') ∩ ''H''{{i sup|''k'',''k''}}(''X'') is the sum of a torsion class and the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle with integral coefficients on ''X''.

Equivalently, after dividing ''H''{{i sup|2''k''}}(''X'', '''Z''') ∩ ''H''{{i sup|''k'',''k''}}(''X'') by torsion classes, every class is the image of the cohomology class of an integral algebraic cycle.  This is also false.  {{Harvtxt|Kollár|1992}} found an example of a Hodge class α which is not algebraic, but which has an integral multiple which is algebraic.

{{harvtxt|Rosenschon|Srinivas|2016}} have shown that in order to obtain a correct integral Hodge conjecture, one needs to replace Chow groups, which can also be expressed as [[motivic cohomology]] groups, by a variant known as ''étale'' (or ''Lichtenbaum'') ''motivic cohomology''. They show that the rational Hodge conjecture is equivalent to an integral Hodge conjecture for this modified motivic cohomology.

=== The Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties ===
A natural generalization of the Hodge conjecture would ask:

::'''Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties, naive version.'''  Let ''X'' be a complex Kähler manifold.  Then every Hodge class on ''X'' is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the cohomology classes of complex subvarieties of ''X''.

This is too optimistic, because there are not enough subvarieties to make this work.  A possible substitute is to ask instead one of the two following questions:

::'''Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties, vector bundle version.'''  Let ''X'' be a complex Kähler manifold.  Then every Hodge class on ''X'' is a linear combination with rational coefficients of Chern classes of vector bundles on ''X''.
::'''Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties, coherent sheaf version.'''  Let ''X'' be a complex Kähler manifold.  Then every Hodge class on ''X'' is a linear combination with rational coefficients of Chern classes of coherent sheaves on ''X''.

{{Harvtxt|Voisin|2002}} proved that the Chern classes of coherent sheaves give strictly more Hodge classes than the Chern classes of vector bundles and that the Chern classes of coherent sheaves are insufficient to generate all the Hodge classes.  Consequently, the only known formulations of the Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties are false.

=== The generalized Hodge conjecture ===
Hodge made an additional, stronger conjecture than the integral Hodge conjecture.  Say that a cohomology class on ''X'' is of ''co-level c'' (coniveau c) if it is the pushforward of a cohomology class on a ''c''-codimensional subvariety of ''X''.  The cohomology classes of co-level at least ''c'' filter the cohomology of ''X'', and it is easy to see that the ''c''th step of the filtration ''N''{{i sup|''c''}}''H''{{i sup|''k''}}(''X'', '''Z''') satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;N^cH^k(X, \mathbf{Z}) \subseteq H^k(X, \mathbf{Z}) \cap (H^{k-c,c}(X) \oplus\cdots\oplus H^{c,k-c}(X)).&lt;/math&gt;

Hodge's original statement was:
::'''Generalized Hodge conjecture, Hodge's version.'''  &lt;math&gt;N^cH^k(X, \mathbf{Z}) = H^k(X, \mathbf{Z}) \cap (H^{k-c,c}(X) \oplus\cdots\oplus H^{c,k-c}(X)).&lt;/math&gt;
{{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1969}} observed that this cannot be true, even with rational coefficients, because the right-hand side is not always a Hodge structure.  His corrected form of the Hodge conjecture is:
::'''Generalized Hodge conjecture.'''  ''N''{{i sup|''c''}}''H''{{i sup|''k''}}(''X'', '''Q''') is the largest sub-Hodge structure of ''H''{{i sup|''k''}}(''X'', '''Z''') contained in &lt;math&gt;H^{k-c,c}(X) \oplus\cdots\oplus H^{c,k-c}(X).&lt;/math&gt;
This version is open.

== Algebraicity of Hodge loci ==
The strongest evidence in favor of the Hodge conjecture is the algebraicity result of {{Harvtxt|Cattani|Deligne|Kaplan|1995}}.  Suppose that we vary the complex structure of ''X'' over a simply connected base.  Then the topological cohomology of ''X'' does not change, but the Hodge decomposition does change.  It is known that if the Hodge conjecture is true, then the locus of all points on the base where the cohomology of a fiber is a Hodge class is in fact an algebraic subset, that is, it is cut out by polynomial equations.  Cattani, Deligne &amp; Kaplan (1995) proved that this is always true, without assuming the Hodge conjecture.

The [[Inuit language]], like other [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]], exhibits a [[regular inflection|regular]] [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and heavily suffixing morphology. The language is rich in suffixes, up to 700 per dialect{{cite source|date=December 2015}}, making words very long and potentially unique. For example, in [[Nunavut]] [[Inuktitut]]:

:'''ᑐᓵᑦᓯᐊᕈᓐᓇᖖᒋᑦᑐᐊᓘᔪᖓ'''
:'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|tusaatsiarunnanngittualuujunga}}'''
:''I can't hear very well.''

This long word is composed of a root word '''tusaa-''' – ''to hear'' – followed by seven suffixes (a vowel-beginning suffix always erases the final consonant of the preceding consonant-ending suffix):
* ''-tsiaq-'': "well"
* ''-junnaq-'' (or ''-gunnaq-''): "be able to"
* ''-nngit-'': negation
* ''-tu(q)'': indicative third-person singular (in fact a nominal form)
* ''-alu(k)-'': augmentative ("very")
* ''-u-'': "be" 
* ''-junga'': indicative first-person singular (itself composed of the indicative morpheme ''-ju-'' and the first person mark ''-nga'')

Note the consonant sandhi (see ''[[Inuit phonology]]''): The /q/ from '''-tsiaq-''' followed by the /j/ from '''-junnaq-''' becomes ‹r› {{IPA-iku|ʁ|}}, a single consonant taking its point of articulation from /q/ and its manner of articulation from /j/. The /q/ from '''-junnaq-''' is assimilated into the /ŋŋ/ of '''-nngit-''', because Inuktitut forbids triple length consonants, and because the morphophonological rules attached to '''-nngit-''' require it to delete any consonant that comes before it.

This sort of word construction is pervasive in Inuit language and makes it very unlike English. In one large [[Inuktitut]] corpus – the ''[[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut|Nunavut Hansard]]'' – 92% of all words appear only once, in contrast to a small percentage in most English corpora of similar size. This makes the application of [[Zipf's law]] quite difficult.{{cite source|date=December 2015}}

Furthermore, the notion of a [[part of speech]] can be somewhat complicated in Inuit language. Fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns. The word '''ilisaijuq''' can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb – "he studies" – but can also be interpreted as a noun: "student".

Because of the language's rich and complicated morphology, this article can present only a limited and unsystematic sample of its features. It is based largely on the Inuktitut dialects of north Baffin Island and central Nunavut. The morphology and syntax of Inuit language varies to some degree between dialects, but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to [[Yupik languages|Yupik]] as well.

==Nouns==
{{Empty section|date=January 2012}}

==Verbs in main clauses==
Inuktitut verbs fall into two major categories with different morphological properties: ''non-specific verbs'' and ''specific verbs''. Many verbs belong in both categories, and can take either set of endings depending on the type of information about the verb's arguments that speakers intend to communicate. Others are restricted to one category or require a morphological change in order to move between categories.

Every fully inflected Inuktitut verb can act alone as a proposition. No other words are required to form a syntactically correct sentence.

This section will only cover two of the most common sets of endings for these two verb classes and a small selection of verbal modifiers. Inuktitut has a large and diverse set of verbal inflections, of which this article can only cover a small portion designed to give some sense of how the Inuktitut language works.

===Non-specific verbs===
Non-specific verbs are verbs that either are ''intransitive'' (they have no direct object), or have an ''indefinite noun'' as their object. In English, an indefinite noun is marked by the lack of the article ''the'' or, if the noun is singular (and countable) the article ''a(n)''. In Inuktitut, when it is the object of a verb, it is distinguished by the use of a non-specific verb and particular suffix described below. A definite noun, in contrast, requires the use of a ''specific verb'' when it is the object of a verb.

====Non-specific indicative conjugation====
As a general rule, a correctly formed Inuktitut verb must start with a root and end with a suffix that indicates the grammatical person of its subject:

:ᖁᕕᐊᓱᒃᑐᖓ&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Quviasuktunga}}.'''
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᖁᕕᐊᓱᒃ
| +
| ᑐᖓ
|-
| '''quviasuk-'''
| +
| '''-tunga'''
|-
| ''to be happy''
| +
| ''1st person singular ("I")''
|}
:''I am happy''

:ᐊᓂᔪᖅ&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Anijuq}}.'''
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᐊᓂ
| +
| ᔪᖅ
|-
| '''ani-'''
| +
| '''-juq'''
|-
| ''to go out''
| +
| ''3rd person singular''
|}
:''he/she/it has just now gone out.''

The [[indicative]] is the simplest form of the verb in Inuktitut, and for state verbs - verbs indicating a condition or a situation - this form indicates the present tense: The condition or situation is presently the case. For action verbs, it indicates that the action has recently been completed, mixing tense and aspect. Inuktitut verbs are divided into state verbs and action verbs. However, the distinction may not match how non-Inuktitut speakers would categorise verbs. For example, the verb root '''pisuk-''', meaning "to be walking" - is a state verb in Inuktitut.

:'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|pisuktunga}}''' - I am walking. (right now)

When the verb root ends in a consonant, the suffixes that indicate the grammatical person all begin with '''t'''. For example, '''pisuk-''' - ''to be walking'' - is conjugated as follows:

Verb roots that end in a vowel have suffixes that start with a '''j'''. For example, '''ani-''' - ''to go out'':

====Alternative form====
There is an alternative form of the above conjugation which is used in different ways and to different degrees depending on dialect. Instead of starting with '''t''' after a consonant and '''j''' after a vowel, this form starts with '''p''' after a consonant and '''v''' after a vowel. The exact difference varies from dialect to dialect. In western dialects, including Inuinnaqtun and Inupiatun, only the '''t'''/'''j''' forms are ever used for statements and the '''p'''/'''v''' form is rarely if ever heard. In Greenland, only the '''p'''/'''v''' form is used. In the central and eastern Canadian dialects, both forms are used.

====Interrogatives====
There are additional '''p'''/'''v''' forms used in Nunavut to indicate interrogative statements - asking questions - although they may indicate other subtle distinctions of aspect. When they are used to ask questions, the last vowel may be doubled to indirectly indicate rising pitch. So, the question ''"Are we there yet?"'' can be written as ''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Tikippita}}?'' ('''tikip-''' - to arrive, and for '''-pita''' see the table below) but may also be written as ''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Tikippitaa}}?''

This way, one can very compactly pose and answer simple yes/no questions:

{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᖁᕕᐊᓱᒃᐱᑦ?&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Quviasukpit}}?'''&lt;br/&gt;ᖁᕕᐊᓱᒃᐲᑦ?&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Quviasukpiit}}?'''
| ''Are you happy?''
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᓕ, ᖁᕕᐊᓱᒃᑐᖓ.&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Ii, quviasuktunga}}.'''
| ''Yes, I'm happy.''
|}

====Subjects====
The subject of a non-specific verb has no special morphological mark:

{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" |  ᐲᑕ ᐊᓂᔪᖅ.&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Piita anijuq}}.'''
| ''Peter just went out.''
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᓗᐃ ᖁᕕᐊᓱᒃᑐᖅ.&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Lui quviasuktuq}}.'''
| ''Louis is happy.''
|}

====Objects====
The object of a non-specific verb must end in a suffix that indicates its syntactic role:
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᐲᑕᒥᒃ ᑕᑯᕕᑦ?&lt;br/&gt;'''{{lang|iu|italics=no|Piitamik takuvit}}?'''
| style="padding-right:2em" | ''Do you see Peter?''
|}
The object of a non-specific verb takes one of the suffixes below, depending on its number:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:1em"
|-
! colspan=3 | Indefinite suffixes
|-
| Singular
! ᒥᒃ&lt;br/&gt;-mik
| /m/ nasalises a preceding consonant
|-
| Dual
! ᕐᓂᒃ&lt;br/&gt;-rnik
| deletes any preceding consonant and doubles the length of the preceding vowel
|-
| Plural
! ᓂᒃ&lt;br/&gt;-nik
| /n/ nasalises a preceding consonant
|}

An example using the verb '''taku-''' - ''to see'' - and '''inuviniq''' - ''dead person'':

{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| Singular:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐃᓄᕕᓂ&lt;u&gt;ᕐᒥᒃ&lt;/u&gt; ᑕᑯᔪᖓ.&lt;br/&gt;'''Inuvini&lt;u&gt;rmik&lt;/u&gt; takujunga.'''
| ''I see a dead person.''
|-
| Dual:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐃᓄᕕ&lt;u&gt;ᓃᕐᓂᒃ&lt;/u&gt; ᑕᑯᔪᖓ.&lt;br/&gt;'''Inuvin&lt;u&gt;iirnik&lt;/u&gt; takujunga.'''
| ''I see two dead people.''
|-
| Plural:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐃᓄᕕᓂ&lt;u&gt;ᕐᓂᒃ&lt;/u&gt; ᑕᑯᔪᖓ.&lt;br/&gt;'''Inuvini&lt;u&gt;rnik&lt;/u&gt; takujunga.'''
| ''I see dead people.''
|}

To say ''"I see &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; dead person"'' or ''"I see &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; dead people"'' requires a ''specific verb'', which is described in the section below.

==Specific verbs==
Specific verbs - verbs whose objects are definite as opposed to indefinite - take suffixes that indicate the grammatical person of both the subject and the object, but not their grammatical number.

===Specific indicative conjugation===
Specific verb suffixes used after '''vowels''':
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto"
|-
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 |
! colspan=3 | &lt;u&gt;Subject&lt;/u&gt;
|-
! First person

|-
! Third person
| ᔭᕋ&lt;br/&gt;-jara
| ᔦᑦ&lt;br/&gt;-jait
| ᔭᖓ&lt;br/&gt;-janga
|}

Specific verb suffixes used after '''consonants''':
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto"
|-
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 |
! colspan=3 | &lt;u&gt;Subject&lt;/u&gt;
|-
! First person

|-
! Third person
| ᑕᕋ&lt;br/&gt;-tara
| ᑌᑦ&lt;br/&gt;-tait
| ᑕᖓ&lt;br/&gt;-tanga
|}

Note that the suffixes in this table cannot be used for reflexive verbs. That will be discussed separately.

===Alternative form===
As with non-specific verbs, specific verbs have an alternate '''v'''/'''p''' form used to the exclusion of '''j'''/'''t''' forms in Greenland, to some extent interchangeably in Nunavut, and not at all in the west:

| ᐯᑦ&lt;br/&gt;-pait
| ᐸᖓ&lt;br/&gt;-panga
|}

===Interrogatives===
The specific interrogative is also sometimes used to indicate conditional forms or other aspects. It overlaps heavily with the '''v'''/'''p''' alternative form described above:

After '''vowels''':
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto"
|-
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 |
! colspan=3 | &lt;u&gt;Subject&lt;/u&gt;
|-
! First person
! Second person
! Third person
|-

|-
! Second person
| ᕕᒋᑦ&lt;br/&gt;-vagit
|
| ᕚᑎᑦ&lt;br/&gt;-vaatit
|-
! Third person
| ᕕᒍ / ᕙᕋ&lt;br/&gt;-vigu/-vara
| ᕕᐅᒃ&lt;br/&gt;-viuk
| ᕙᐅᒃ&lt;br/&gt;-vauk
|}

After '''consonants''':
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto"
|-
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 |
! colspan=3 | &lt;u&gt;Subject&lt;/u&gt;
|-
! First person
! Second person
! Third person
|-
! rowspan=3 | &lt;u&gt;Object&lt;/u&gt;
! First person
|
| ᐱᖓ&lt;br/&gt;-pinga
| ᐹᙵ&lt;br/&gt;-paanga
|-
! Second person
| ᐸᒋᑦ&lt;br/&gt;-pagit
|
| ᐹᑎᑦ&lt;br/&gt;-paatit
|-
! Third person
| ᐱᒍ / ᐸᕋ&lt;br/&gt;-pigu/-para
| ᐱᐅᒃ&lt;br/&gt;-piuk
| ᐸᐅᒃ&lt;br/&gt;-pauk
|}

===Subjects===
The subject of a specific verb requires a specific suffix to indicate its syntactic role:

{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
|style="margin-right:2em" | ᐲᑕᐅᑉ ᑕᑯᔮᑎᑦ&lt;br/&gt;'''Piitaup takujaatit'''
|''Peter sees you''
|}
The subject of a specific verb takes the following suffixes, depending on its grammatical number:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| Singular
! -up
| /u/ disappears when it is preceded by a double vowel
|-
| Dual
! -k
| doubles the preceding vowel, if it is not already double
|-
| Plural
! -it
| /i/ disappears when it is preceded by a double vowel
|}

All of the suffixes above delete any consonant that immediately precedes them. For example, '''qajaq''' becomes '''qajaup''' in the singular, '''qajaak''' in the dual, and '''qajait''' in the plural when it is the subject of a specific verb.

So, as an example:
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐸᓖᓯᐅᑉ ᑕᑯᔮᑎᑦ&lt;br/&gt;'''Paliisiup takujaatit'''
| ''A policeman sees you.''
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐸᓖᓰᒃ ᑕᑯᔮᑎᑦ&lt;br/&gt;'''Paliisiik takujaatit'''
| ''Two policemen see you.''
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐸᓖᓰᑦ ᑕᑯᔮᑎᑦ&lt;br/&gt;'''Paliisiit takujaatit'''
| ''Some policemen (more than two) see you.''
|}

===Objects===
The object of a specific verb needs no particular suffix at all. Thus, we can contrast '''Inuviniq takujara''' - ''I see &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; dead person'' - with the [[Inuktitut language#Objects|table for ''non-specific verbs'']] above. Continuing the example from above:
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐲᑕᐅᑉ ᐸᓖᓯ ᑕᑯᐸᐅᒃ?&lt;br/&gt;'''Piitaup paliisi takupauk?'''
| ''Does Peter see &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; policeman?''
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐋᒃᑲ, ᐸᓖᓯᓂᒃ ᐲᑕ ᑕᑯᔪᖅ.&lt;br/&gt;'''Aakka, paliisinik Piita takujuq.'''
| ''No, Peter sees &lt;u&gt;some&lt;/u&gt; policemen.''
|}

==Changing verb classes==
Some verbs are automatically both specific and non-specific verbs, depending only on which suffixes they receive. The verb '''taku-''' - ''to see'' - is one example. However, other verbs require an additional suffix to shift classes.

Many action verbs that specifically involve an actor performing an action on another are ''specific verbs'' that take the suffix '''-si-''' in order to become ''non-specific verbs'':
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" |&lt;u&gt;Specific&lt;/u&gt;:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᖁᑭᖅᑕᕋ ᕿᒻᒥᖅ&lt;br/&gt;'''Qukiqtara qimmiq'''
| ''I just shot &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; dog.''
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" |&lt;u&gt;Non-specific&lt;/u&gt;:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᖁᑭᖅ&lt;u&gt;ᓯ&lt;/u&gt;ᔪᖓ ᕿᒻᒥᕐᒥᒃ&lt;br/&gt;'''Qukiq&lt;u&gt;si&lt;/u&gt;junga qimmirmik'''
| ''I just shot &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt; dog.''
|}

Many verbs of emotion alternate between the suffixes '''-suk-''' and '''-gi-''' to change whether or not they are specific:
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" |&lt;u&gt; Non-specific&lt;/u&gt;:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐃᓕᕋ&lt;u&gt;ᓱᒃ&lt;/u&gt;ᑐᖓ ᐃᓕᓭᔨᒥᒃ&lt;br/&gt;'''Ilira&lt;u&gt;suk&lt;/u&gt;tunga ilisaijimik'''
| ''I'm intimidated by &lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt; teacher''
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" | &lt;u&gt;Specific&lt;/u&gt;:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᐃᓕᕋ&lt;u&gt;ᒋ&lt;/u&gt;ᔭᕋ ᐃᓕᓭᔨ&lt;br/&gt;'''Ilira&lt;u&gt;gi&lt;/u&gt;jara ilisaiji'''
| ''I'm intimidated by &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; teacher''
|}

This is important when attributing an emotion to a person without designating the cause. To do so, Inuktitut always uses the ''non-specific'' form:

{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| style="padding-right:2em" |  ᑯᑉᐱᐊᓱᒃᑐᖓ&lt;br/&gt;'''Kuppiasuktunga'''
| ''I'm afraid''
|}
==Reflexive verbs==
A [[reflexive verb]] is a verb which must have both an object and a subject, but where, in some context, both the object and the subject are identical. In Inuktitut, this situation is expressed by using a ''specific verb'' but by affixing a ''non-specific'' ending to it.
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| &lt;u&gt;Specific&lt;/u&gt;:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᓇᓄᖅ ᖁᑭᖅᑕᕋ&lt;br/&gt;'''Nanuq qukiqtara'''
| ''I just shot the polar bear''
|-
| &lt;u&gt;Non-specific&lt;/u&gt;:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᓇᓄᕐᒥᒃ ᖁᑭᖅᓯᔪᖓ&lt;br/&gt;'''Nanurmik qukiqsijunga'''
| ''I just shot a polar bear''
|-
| &lt;u&gt;Reflexive&lt;/u&gt;:
| style="padding-right:2em" | ᖁᑭᖅᑐᖓ&lt;br/&gt;'''Qukiqtunga'''
| ''I just shot myself''
|}

==Verbs in secondary clauses==
A verb that has been fully inflected as described above is a complete proposition able to stand on its own. However, when clauses are linked in Inuktitut, a number of other morphosyntactic phenomena come into play.

First, many secondary structures use other classes of verb suffixes that those used in main clauses. This article cannot cover the whole of Inuktitut morphology, especially since each class of inflexion has its own set of non-specific and specific endings and they vary significantly from dialect to dialect. The examples below are based on the [[North Baffin]] dialect.

==Fourth person inflection==
In secondary clauses, third person inflexions must make a distinction between instances where the two clauses have the same subject and those where the subject is different. In English, the sentence ''"He is leaving because he is tired"'' is ambiguous unless you know whether or not the two ''"he"'''s refer to different people. In Inuktitut, in contrast, this situation is clearly marked:

:ᐊᐅᓪᓚᖅᑐᖅ ᑕᖃᒐᒪ&lt;br/&gt;'''Aullaqtuq taqagama.'''
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᐊᐅᓪᓚᖅ

| &amp;nbsp;
| ᑕᖃ

| ᒐᒪ
|-
|-
| '''aullaq-'''

| '''-tuq'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| '''taqa-'''

| '''-gama'''
|-
| ''to leave''
| +
| ''3rd pers. sg. non-specific''
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''to be tired''
| +
| ''&lt;u&gt;3rd pers.&lt;/u&gt; sg. non-specific causative''
|}
:''He&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is leaving because he&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is tired''

:ᐊᐅᓪᓚᖅᑐᖅ ᑕᖃᖕᒪᑦ&lt;br/&gt;'''Aullaqtuq taqangmat.'''
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᐊᐅᓪᓚᖅ
| +
| ᑐᖅ
| &amp;nbsp;
| ᑕᖃ
| +
| ᖕᒪᑦ
|-
| '''aullaq-'''
| +
| '''-tuq'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| '''taqa-'''
| +
| '''-ngmat'''
|-
| ''to leave''
| +
| ''3rd pers. sg. non-specific''
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''to be tired''
| +
| ''&lt;u&gt;4th pers.&lt;/u&gt; sg. non-specific causative''
|}
:''He&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is leaving because he&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is tired''

The set of suffixes used to indicate the other third person is sometimes called the '''third person different''', but is also often called the '''fourth person'''. This additional [[grammatical person]] is a pervasive feature of Inuktitut.

==Causative==
The [[causative]] is used to link propositions that follow logically. It is much more broadly used in Inuktitut than similar structures are in English. The causative is one of the most important ways of connecting two clauses in Inuktitut:

:ᖃᓐᓂᕐᒪᑦ ᙯᙱᑦᑐᖓ&lt;br/&gt;'''Qannirmat qainngittunga'''
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᖃᓐᓂᖅ
| +
| ᒪᑦ
| &amp;nbsp;
| ᙯ
| +
| ᙱᑦ
| +
| ᑐᖓ
|-
| '''qanniq-'''
| +
| '''-mat'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| '''qai-'''
| +
| '''-nngit-'''
| +
| '''-tunga'''
|-
| ''to snow''
| +
| ''4th pers. non-specific causative''
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''to come''
| +
| ''not''
| +
| ''1st pers. sg. non-specific''
|}
:''Because it is snowing, I am not coming.''

==Conditional &amp; subjunctive==
This structure has a meaning closer to an ''"if... then..."''' sentence in English than the kind of structure usually referred to as ''"conditional"''. It generally involves using an additional marker of the [[future tense]] or the [[conditional mood]] in the main clause:

:ᙯᒍᕕᑦ ᓂᕆᓂᐊᖅᐱᑦ?&lt;br/&gt;'''Qaiguvit niriniaqpit?'''
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᙯ
| +
| ᒍᕕᑦ

| ᓂᕆ
| +
| ᓂᐊᖅ
| +
| ᐱᑦ
|-
| '''qai-'''
| +
| '''-guvit'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| '''niri-'''
| +
| '''-niaq-'''
| +
| '''-pit'''
|-
| ''to come''
| +
| ''2nd pers. sg. non-specific conditional''
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''to eat''
| +
| ''future tense''
| +
| ''2nd pers. sg. non-specific interrogative''
|}
:''If you come, will you eat?''

|-
| '''qanniq-'''
| +
| '''-pat'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| '''ani-'''
| +
| '''-najaq-'''
| +
| '''-nngit-'''
| +
| '''-tunga'''
|-
| ''to snow''
| +
| ''4th pers. sg. non-specific conditional''
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''to go out''
| +
| ''conditional mood''
| +
| ''not''
| +
| ''1st pers. sg. non-specific''
|}
:''If it were snowing, I wouldn't go out.''

==Frequentative==
The [[frequentative]] endings indicate that two propositions routinely occur together. In English, this is expressed with words like ''usually'', ''often'', ''generally'' and ''whenever''. It generally involves using an additional marker in the main clause to indicate frequency:

:ᑳᒃᑳᖓᒥ ᓂᕆᖃᑦᑕᖅᑐᖅ&lt;br/&gt;'''Kaakkaangami niriqattaqtuq'''
{| style="margin-left:1em"
|-
| ᑳᒃ

| ᑳᖓᒥ
| &amp;nbsp;
| ᓂᕆ
| +
| ᖃᑦᑕᖅ
| +
| ᑐᖅ
|-
| '''kaak-'''
| +
| '''-kaangami'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| '''niri-'''
| +
| '''-qattaq-'''
| +
| '''-tuq'''
|-
| ''to be hungry''
| +
| ''3rd pers. sg. non-specific frequentative''
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''to eat''
| +
| ''usually''
| +
| ''3rd pers. sg. non-specific''
|}
:''When he's hungry, he eats.''

==Dubitative==
The [[Dubitative mood (Eskimo)|dubitative]] suffixes express uncertainty or disbelief about a proposition:{{cn|date=May 2016}}

==Verb modifiers==
In addition to root verb morphemes and inflexions to indicate the number and person of the arguments, Inuktitut has a large inventory of morphemes that modify the verb and may be placed between the root morpheme and inflexions, or at the end of the inflected verb. In pedagogic and linguistic literature on Inuktitut, these infix morphemes are often called '''verb chunks'''. These modifiers indicate tense, aspect, manner and a variety of functions that in English require auxiliary verbs, adverbs, or other structures.

This section can only list a small selection of the many verb chunks, in order to give a sense for how the system works:

===Modifiers of manner===

:ᙱᑦ&lt;br/&gt;'''-nngit-''' - ''negates the verb''

==Modifiers of tense==

While [[Indo-European languages]] tend to make tense distinctions in terms of before or after some reference event, Inuktitut makes a number of somewhat fuzzy distinctions depending on how far into the past or the future the event took place. In English, this distinction requires additional words to place the event in time, but in Inuktitut the tense marker itself carries much of that information.

:ᓛᖅ&lt;br/&gt;'''-laaq-''' - ''future, tomorrow or later''

:ᓕᖅ&lt;br/&gt;'''-liq-''' - ''in process, right now''

==Ergativity in Inuktitut==
Inuktitut marks the subject of a non-specific verb and the object of a specific verb in the same way - the absence of a specific morphological marker - and marks the subject of a specific verb and the object of a non-specific verb with particular morphological elements. This kind of morphosyntactic structure is often called an '''[[Ergative-absolutive language|ergative structure]]'''. However, ergativity in its most clearly defined instances is primarily about transitive and intransitive verbs. This dichotomy is not identical to the specific/non-specific verb distinction in Inuktitut, since Inuktitut usage is also concerned with the definiteness of the objects of verb,

Consequently, the application of the notion of ergativity to Inuktitut, and to many other languages, is somewhat controversial. Regardless, by analogy with more conventionally ergative languages, the '''-up''', '''-k''', '''-it''' endings described [[#Subjects 2|above]] are often called ''ergative suffixes'' which are taken to be indicative of the ''ergative case'', while the '''-mik''', '''-rnik''', '''-nik''' endings (see [[#Objects|Non-specific verbs - Objects]]) are called ''[[Accusative case|accusative]]''. This usage is often seen in linguistics literature describing Inuktitut, and sometimes in pedagogic literature and dictionaries, but remains a quite foreign vocabulary to most Inuit.

'''Inuktun''' ({{lang-en|Polar Eskimo}}, {{lang-kl|avanersuarmiutut}}, {{lang-da|nordgrønlandsk, polareskimoisk, thulesproget}}) is the language of approximately 1,000 indigenous [[Inughuit]], inhabiting the world's northernmost settlements in [[Qaanaaq]] and the surrounding villages in northwestern [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;Erik Holtved. Remarks on the Polar Eskimo Dialect. International Journal of American Linguistics. Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jan., 1952), pp. 20-24&lt;/ref&gt;

All speakers of Inuktun also speak [[Kalaallisut|Standard Greenlandic]] and many also speak [[Danish language|Danish]] and a few also [[English language|English]]. Apart from the town of Qaanaaq, Inuktun is also spoken in the villages of Muriuhaq, [[Siorapaluk|Hiurapaluk]], Qikiqtat, Qikiqtarhuaq, [[Savissivik|Havighivik]] (names given in Inuktun).

The language was first described by the explorers [[Knud Rasmussen]] and [[Peter Freuchen]] who travelled through northern Greenland in the early twentieth century and established a trading post at [[Pituffik|Dundas]]&lt;!-- Dundas, Greenland redirects there--&gt; in 1910. Inuktun does not have its own [[orthography]] and is not taught in schools. However, most of the inhabitants of Qaanaaq and the surrounding villages use Inuktun in their everyday communication.

The language is an [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut language]] and [[dialectology|dialectologically]] it is in between the Greenlandic [[Greenlandic language|Kalaallisut]] and the Canadian [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuvialuktun]] or [[Inuinnaqtun]]. The Polar Inuit were the last to cross from [[Canada]] into [[Greenland]] and they may have arrived as late as in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue 1991. page 1&lt;/ref&gt; The language differs from Kalaallisut by substituting Kalaallisut /s/ with an h-sound often pronounced like a [[palatal fricative]] as in [[German language|German]] ''ich''. Inuktun also allows more consonant combinations than Kalaallisut and has some minor grammatical and lexical differences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6236">An '''Iris printer''' is a large-format color [[inkjet printer]] introduced in 1985 by Iris Graphics, originally of [[Stoneham, Massachusetts]] and currently manufactured by the Graphic Communications Group of [[Eastman Kodak]], designed for [[prepress proofing]]. It is also used in the fine art reproduction market as a final output [[digital printing]] press, as in [[Giclée]].

Prints produced by an Iris printer are commonly called '''Iris prints''', '''Iris proofs''' or simply '''Irises'''.

== History ==

The Iris printer was developed by Iris Graphics, Inc. originally of [[Stoneham, Massachusetts]]. Iris was founded in 1984 by two former employees of [[Applicon]], Inc., Dieter Jochimsen and Craig Surprise, who had worked with Professor Helmuth Hertz of Lund University in Sweden from whom Applicon had licensed the continuous-flow inkjet technology used in an Applicon-manufactured large-format printer.  Jochimsen and Surprise were joined in founding Iris by John Oberteuffer and Richard Santos after being introduced by the U.S. licensing agent for Professor Hertz' inkjet patents, [[Arthur D. Little]] of Lexington, MA. The Iris model 2044 large-format printer, capable of printing on paper up to 34" x 44" (864 x 1118 mm), was first shipped in 1985. A smaller model 3024, supporting automatic handling of 11" x 17" (279 x 432 mm) paper, was introduced at the September 1987 "Lasers in Graphics" show in [[Miami]]. The company was acquired by [[Scitex Vision|Scitex]] in 1990, which was then purchased by [[Creo (company)|Creo Products Inc.]] in 2000. In 2005, Creo was purchased by Kodak. The Iris product line evolved into the [[Veris printer]] line

== Design ==

The Iris printer is an inkjet printer designed to interface with digital [[prepress]] systems to produce a hard copy that shows what the exact image will look like before the job goes to press. Such prepress output devices are used to check the image and for critical color match on industrial printing jobs such as commercial product packaging and magazine layout. Their output is also used to check color after [[mass production]] begins. Iris printers use a continuous flow ink system to produce continuous-tone dot free output. The paper used in the machine is mounted on a drum rotating at 150&amp;nbsp;inches per second.&lt;ref name="Luong"/&gt; Unlike most ink jet printers which fire drops only when needed, the IRIS printer's four 1-micrometer glass jets operate continuously under high pressure, vibrated by a [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] crystal to produce drops at a 1&amp;nbsp;MHz rate.  The droplets are given an electric charge so that the ones that are not needed to form the image are deflected electrostatically into a waste system.&lt;ref name="Luong" /&gt;

== Use in fine art reproductions==

Iris printers have also been used since the late 1980s as final output digital printing devices in the production of fine art reproductions on various media, including paper, canvas, silk, linen and other textiles. There were many printers, photographers, artists, and engineers who saw the merit in using this industrial proof printer as a way to produce high-resolution color accurate reproductions. Color engineer [[David Coons]] used the 3024 at the [[Walt Disney Company]] to print images from Disney’s new computer 3D animation system. He also wrote software to print works created on [[desktop computer]]s such as [[Sally Larsen]] 1989 ''Transformer'' series, and a 1990 photo exhibition for [[Graham Nash]] of [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]]. Nash was so impressed with the quality of the Iris prints, he purchased his own Iris Graphics 3047 ink-jet printer for $126,000 to print further editions of his work and eventually set up  [[Graham Nash#Nash Editions|Nash Editions]], a digital reproduction company based on the Iris printer.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; There were many problems with adapting the Iris printer to fine art printing including modifying the machines to take heavy paper stock and dealing with the poorly fade-resistant ([[Fugitive pigments|fugitive]]) nature of the inks.&lt;ref name="Holbert"/&gt;

Because of the Iris printer's connection to digital, ink-jet industrial and home/office printing, one of the print makers at Nash Editions, Jack Duganne, thought such terms might have bad connotations in the art world. He came up with a [[neologism]] for the process, the coined name "[[giclée]]".  Similarly, Nash and [[Mac Holbert]], manager of Nash Editions, came up with the name "digigraph" for this type of print.

In the 2010s the Iris printer was for the most part superseded in the fine art printing business by Epson and other large-format printers that are much cheaper than the Iris and use inks designed to be archival.&lt;ref name="Luong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giclee"/&gt;

'''Jackeen''' is a [[pejorative]] term for someone from [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines it as a "contemptuous designation for a self-assertive worthless fellow", citing the earliest documented use from the year 1840.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=jackeen |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition=2nd |editor-last1=Simpson |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=Weiner |editor-first2=Edmund |date=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Jackeen is believed to be derived from either [[Jack (given name)|Jack]], a common [[English people|English]] nickname for the names [[John (given name)|John]]{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;!-- is "Jack" not from "King James"? --&gt; and [[James_(name)|James]], or in reference to the [[Union Jack]], the flag of the [[United Kingdom]]. Following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] beginning in 1169, Dublin became the centre of the [[The Pale|Pale]], the part of Ireland directly under the control of the English government in the late [[Middle Ages]]. By the 19th century, Dublin had served as the centre for English rule in Ireland for centuries, and Dubliners were stereotyped as being heavily [[Anglicized]] and considered the most English of all the [[Irish people|Irish]]. Jack is combined with the [[Irish language|Irish]] [[diminutive suffix]] "-een" (represented as ''-ín'' in Irish) meaning little, commonly found in Irish female names such as Roisín ("little Rose") and Maureen (''Mairín'', "little Mary"), implying that Dubliners are "little Englishmen".&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

Today, Jackeen is sometimes used to describe [[Dublin GAA]] players and supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Kawi''' (from [[Sanskrit]]: कवि "kavi" lit. "poet") is a literary and prose language on the islands of [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Bali]], and [[Lombok]]. Kawi is a standardised form of [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]], a language with a sizable vocabulary of [[Sanskrit]] [[loanword]]s. Kawi is also the direct ancestor language of modern [[Javanese language|Javanese]].  The name "kawi" is derived from the root ''ku'', which in Sanskrit means “poet”, and, in derived forms, a “wise, educated man”. The syllabic meter of Kawi poetry is ''sekar kawi'', which means “flowers of the language”, sekar itself deriving from the Sanskrit "sekhara" (“garland”).{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  All Javanese languages are hierarchical and stratified, with strict social conventions for appropriate language subsets to be used for one's superiors or social and cultural functions. Kawi is commonly considered the pinnacle language.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}

==Writing system==
Kawi uses a unique [[writing system|script]] for writing commonly called [[Javanese script|hanacaraka]]; the more correct term is ''"Dentawiyanjana"''.  It is a syllabic alphabet consisting of 20 letters and ten numbers and a number of vowel and consonant modifiers. The script of the island of Bali, heavily influenced by neighboring [[Java]], has a unique sub-form called [[Balinese script|Tulisan Bali]]. Prince Aji Caka (an Indian migrant) is credited with establishing the first known kingdom of Java, called Java Dvipa (Swarna Dvipa) and also introducing the Kawi language was and the twenty letters of the syllabic hanacaraka script.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apu.ac.jp/~gunarto/lang/mileston.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Javanese also credit the language to [[Aji Saka]], a legendary hero of Medang Kamulan Kingdom. The earliest known inscription of Kawi is found at [[Gunung Wukir Temple]] in [[Magelang]], [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]].

==Usage==
Kawi is not truly extinct as a spoken language.  It is commonly used in [[wayang golek]], [[wayang wong]] and [[wayang kulit]], in addition to high activities such as a Javanese [[wedding]], especially for the stylised meeting ritual of bride's parents with groom's parents in the ceremonies of [[Peningsetan]] and [[Panggih]]. Archaically or for certain nobles very strongly attached to tradition, it is used for the [[Midodareni]], [[Siraman]] and [[Sungkeman]] ceremonies of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] wedding.

The island of [[Lombok]] has adopted Kawi as its regional language, reflecting the very strong influence of neighbouring [[East Java]]. Today, it is taught in primary school education as part of the compulsory secondary language unit of National curriculum. Traditionally, Kawi is written on [[Palm-leaf manuscript#Javanese and Balinese|lontar]] prepared palm leaves.

Kawi remains in occasional use as an archaic prose and literary language, in a similar fashion to [[Shakespeare]]-era [[English language|English]], which has such aesthetically and arguably more cultivated words as [[Thou|thy]], [[thee]], [https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/hast hast] and so forth.

==Literature==
There are many important literary works written in Kawi, most notably [[Empu Tantular]]'s epic poem, ''"Kakawin Sutasoma"'' (E.M. Uhlenbeck, 1964: "A Critical Survey of Studies on the Languages of Java and Madura", The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff), from which is taken the National motto of Indonesia: ''"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika"''. Although often glibly translated as "Unity in Diversity", it is more correctly rendered as "[although] scattered, remaining [as] one"&amp;mdash; referring to the scattered islands of the archipelago nation, not as an expression of multicultural solidarity as may be perceived in modern times.

A more modern work is the poem ''"Susila Budhi Dharma"'', by [[Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo]], the founder of [[Subud]].  In this work, he provides a framework for understanding the experience of the [[latihan]] kejiwaan.

Famous poems, epics and other literature include:
* [[Kakawin Tertua Jawa]], 856
* [[Kakawin Ramayana]] ~ 870
* [[Kakawin Arjunawiwaha]], [[mpu]] [[Kanwa]], ~ 1030
* [[Kakawin Kresnayana]]

===Prominent authors===
The following are notable authors of Kawi:
* [[Candakarana]]
* [[Sang Hyang Kamahayanikan]]
* [[Kunjarakarna]]

==Scholars==
The first scholar to address Kawi in a serious academic manner was [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], who considered it the father of all Malay-Polynesian languages. Furthermore, he deprecated misconceptions about Kawi being wholly influenced by Sanskrit, finding that Kawi did not use [[verb]] [[inflexion]], thus differing from Sanskrit's highly developed inflectional system. Kawi might have came from a very ancient settlement in the pacific side of Asia.  In Kawi language, the meaning of a sentence must be grasped through word order and context. Humboldt further noted that Kawi utilizes [[Grammatical tense|tense]] distinctions, with past, present, and future, and differentiated moods via the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] and [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].

Numerous scholars have studied the language, including the Dutch expatriate Indonesian Prof. Dr. Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder S.J., who contributed an enormous quantity of original texts and serious scholarly study to the language, and his pupil and associate, Father Dr. [[Ignatius Kuntara Wiryamartana]]. Other eminent Indonesian scholars of the language include Poedjawijatna, Sumarti Suprayitna, Poerbatjaraka and Tardjan Hadiwidjaja.

[[File:A Language Icon.jpg|thumb|148x148px]]
The '''language icon''' is a specific icon designed for people to select a specific language to use when they face multi-lingual, multi-national websites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languageicon.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__
== History ==
The Language icon was designed by Onur Mustak Cobanli and his team in 2008 when they planned to build a [[multi-lingual]], [[international|multi-national]] website. After the first language icons were rejected, the design contest was organized by [[A’ Design Award &amp; Competition]].&lt;ref&gt;https://competition.adesignaward.com/competitions/custom/Language-Icon-Graphic-Design-Competition.html&lt;/ref&gt; Farhat Datta designed the winning entry, “Turnstile Language Icon.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languageicon.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.designforu.org/article.php?ID=454&lt;/ref&gt;

* Color-Friendly: You can change the colors as you like, keep the form intact please; scale proportionally. You can reverse the color or grayscale it if required.

== Font Awesome ==

The language icon was adopted into the widely-used "[[Font Awesome]]" icon package in Font Awesome version 4.  Font Awesome version 5 abandoned the language icon, replacing it with a completely different symbol for language selection.&lt;ref&gt;https://fontawesome.com/icons/language?style=solid&lt;/ref&gt;

In his seminal work ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (1965), [[Noam Chomsky]] introduces a  hierarchy of '''levels of adequacy''' for evaluating grammars (theories of specific languages) and [[metatheory|metagrammars]] (theories of grammars).

These levels constitute a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of theories (a grammar of a natural language being an example of such a theory) according to potency.  This taxonomy might be extended to scientific theories in general, and from there even stretched into the realm of the [[aesthetics]] of art.&lt;ref&gt;An example of application of the levels to [[aesthetics]] may be found in the discussion at [http://www.interdisciplines.org/artcognition/papers/15/printable/discussions],
accessed 2006-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  This present article's use of the phrase as a ''[[terminus technicus]]'' should not be confused with its everyday language uses.

==Motivation==
The "potency" criterion alluded to in the preceding section is somewhat ill-defined, but may  include "exhaustiveness", "effectiveness', and an affective component as well.  (Arguably, the taxonomy is also motivated by considerations of "[[elegance]]".  This should not be confused with the application of the taxonomy in the field of [[aesthetics]]).  As a [[metatheory]], or "theory of theories", it becomes a concept of [[epistemology]] in the [[philosophy of science]], rather than a mere tool or [[methodology]] of [[Linguistics|scientific linguistics]].  As Chomsky put it in an earlier work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of linguistic structure must be distinguished clearly from a manual of helpful procedures for the discovery of grammars.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, 1957, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The levels==
#'''Observational adequacy'''
#*The theory achieves an exhaustive and discrete enumeration of the data points.
#*There is a pigeonhole for each observation.
#'''Descriptive adequacy'''
#*The theory formally specifies rules accounting for all observed arrangements of the data.
#*The rules produce all and only the well-formed constructs (relations) of the protocol space.
#:&lt;blockquote&gt;...the grammar gives a correct account of the linguistic intuition of the native speaker, and specifies the observed data (in particular) in terms of significant generalizations that express underlying regularities in the language.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky 1964, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
#'''Explanatory adequacy'''
#*The theory provides a principled choice between competing descriptions.
#*It deals with the uttermost underlying structure.
#*It has predictive power.
#:&lt;blockquote&gt;A linguistic theory that aims for explanatory adequacy is concerned with the internal structure of the device [i.e. grammar]; that is, it aims to provide a principled basis, independent of any particular language, for the selection of the descriptively adequate grammar of each language.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky 1964, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theories which do not achieve the third level of adequacy are said to "account for the observations", rather than to "explain the observations."

The second and third levels include the assumption of [[Occam's Razor|Ockhamist]] parsimony.  This is related to the ''[[Transformational grammar#Minimalism|Minimalist]]'' requirement,&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; which is elaborated as a [[corollary]] of the levels, but which is actually employed as an [[axiom]].

==Precursors in the philosophy of science==
It is suggested that the system of levels proposed by Chomsky in ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax'' has its antecedents in the works of [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], and others.  Certainly the criterion of adequacy found in [[rationalism]], specifically, rational [[empiricism]], bear some resemblance to Chomsky's formulation.

Since one of the key issues which Chomsky treats in ''Aspects'' is a supposition of a congenital endowment of the language faculty in humans, the topic ramifies into questions of [[Innate idea|innateness]] and ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge, since it is by reference to those questions that the third level of adequacy is to be sought.

==Note==
This concept should not to be confused with the "[[causal adequacy principle]]," which refers to Descartes' version of the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of God in his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.

A '''prestige dialect''' is the [[dialect]] that is considered most [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestigious]] by the members of that [[speech community]]. In nearly all cases, the prestige dialect is also the dialect spoken by the most prestigious members of that community, often the people who have political, economic, or social power.

{{dynamic list}}
{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==A==
*'''[[Arabic]]''' – In the [[Arab League]] countries, [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is considered the H-language, or high-prestige language. In contrast to most prestige dialects, it is not used in day-to-day conversation, but rather as a language of the political/social [[Mass media|media]] programs and as a written language.  It is not commonly used in everyday conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=ArticleA_C&amp;pagename=Zone-Arabic-ArtCulture/ACALayout&amp;cid=1182774570930 islamonline.net]: "‘Germanus’ [...] looked forward to Cairo, to be entertained by listening the (Classical) Arabic language [...] He was shocked [...] for who were laughing at him for his speaking in (Classical) Arabic and they answered him back with vernacular vocabulary..."&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]''' – Among modern [[Assyrian people]], ''[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic#Iraqi Koine|Iraq Koine]]'' is widely considered to be a prestige form of speech, where it is the standard variety in the Assyrian social and political media, and the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian church]].&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Zomaya S. (1994). ''Basic sentence structure in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, VIII/1:83-107&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iraqi Koine'' is a "[[accent reduction|watered down]]", [[koine language|merger]] dialect of the rather coarse [[List of Assyrian tribes|Assyrian tribal varieties]] of the mountains and the classically prestigious ''[[Urmia]]n'' dialect (spoken by [[Iranian Assyrians]]), but would lack the harshness of the rural dialects and the superfluous [[Farsi language|Farsi]] influence of the Urmian dialect.&lt;ref name="Maclean 1895"&gt;[[Arthur John Maclean|Maclean, Arthur John]] (1895). ''Grammar of the dialects of vernacular Syriac: as spoken by the Eastern Syrians of Kurdistan, north-west Persia, and the Plain of Mosul: with notices of the vernacular of the Jews of Azerbaijan and of Zakhu near Mosul''. Cambridge University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th and early 20th century, or at least up to the 1980s, the ''Urmian'' dialect was a standard literary dialect of Assyrian, chosen by an American Presbyterian missioner [[Justin Perkins]] in 1836. In the late 20th century, Assyrians gradually started to mix with each other and spoke ''Iraqi Koine'', as [[Iraq]] had an influx of Assyrians from different villages settling there.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997). ''Functional and other exotic sentences in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, XI/2:44-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==C==
* '''[[Chinese language|Chinese]]''':
** '''[[Mandarin language|Mandarin]]''' – Specifically the [[Standard Mandarin]] variant based on the [[Beijing dialect]] as spoken by the commoners of the early to mid 20th century. There are differences in the way this standard is defined between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Taiwan]]. In Taiwan, for instance, the Standard Mandarin was not based on the commoner's usage of the Beijing dialect but the variety of this dialect as used by the educated class at the time.
** '''[[Cantonese]]''' – Considered the prestige variety of [[Yue Chinese]] variants, based on the dialect of [[Guangzhou City]] and the surrounding areas, including [[Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]]), [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=215}}
** '''[[Shanghainese]]''' –  Considered the prestige variety of [[Wu Chinese]] variants, based on the dialect of [[Shanghai City]] and the surrounding districts, having replaced [[Suzhounese]] in this role in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World'', p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''[[Southern Min]] ''' ([[Hokkien]]-[[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]) – also known as the Quan-Zhang variety of Southern Min, is the mainstream form of [[Southern Min]]. Like Mandarin, there are also differences in the way this standard is defined between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Taiwan]]. The '''Modern Standard Southern Min''' dialects are based on the Standard [[Amoy dialect]] accent spoken in the [[Amoy|city of Amoy]] (Xiamen) in Southern Fujian in Mainland China and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] which is based on the Taiwanese prestige accent respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ethnologue.com/language/nan&lt;/ref&gt;

==D==
*'''[[Dutch language|Dutch]]''' – [[Standard Dutch]] is considered most prestigious when no clear traces of a speaker's dialect can be recognised.&lt;ref&gt;M. van der Wal, Geschiedenis van het Nederlands, 1992. {{ISBN|90-274-1839-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==E==
*'''[[English language|English]]''' – In the UK, the prestige dialect is often considered to be [[Received Pronunciation]] whereas [[Variation in Australian English#Broad.2C general and cultivated Australian|General Australian English]] and [[South African English|Cultivated South African English]] have traditionally been the prestige dialect in those countries. The [[United States]] is said to have no single prestige dialect;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilson | first=Kenneth G | year=1993 | title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English | location=New York | publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, American dictionaries, broadcast journalists, and stage, cinema, and television actors favor [[General American]] as the standard form of American speech. Before 1945, [[Mid-Atlantic English]] enjoyed a high level of prestige. In modern India, [[Indian English]], a slightly Indianized version of English having some influence of Indian local languages is generally used in practice.

==F==
*'''[[French language|French]]''' 
**'''France''' – [[Standard French]] is based on the dialect of Paris.
**'''United States''' – [[Colonial French]] (also Plantation Society French) is considered the prestige dialect of [[Louisiana French]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caneriver.tulane.edu/LanguagesLabels.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085445/http://caneriver.tulane.edu/LanguagesLabels.html |archivedate=2007-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is deemed virtually [[Language death|extinct]] due to gradual assimilation with standard [[Cajun French]].

==H==
*'''[[Hindi]]''' – [[Modern Standard Hindi]]–a heavily [[Sanskrit]]ised version of [[Khariboli]]–is the prestige dialect.&lt;ref name="Chall1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo P. Chall|title=Sociological abstracts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIrZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 June 2012|year=1961|publisher=Sociological Abstracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==M==
*'''[[Marathi language|Marathi]]''' – The dialect of [[Pune]] is considered to be the standard and prestige dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Marathi-language|accessdate=9 August 2017|year=1998|publisher=Encylcopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==P==
* '''[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]''' – The [[Majhi dialect]] spoken around [[Amritsar]] is the standardized and most prestigious Punjabi dialect in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnpunjabi.org/intro1.asp Punjabi University, Patiala.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite LSI|9|1|p=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==T==
*'''[[Tamil language|Tamil]]''' –  Tamil exhibits different standard forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language (sankattamiḻ), a modern literary and formal style (centamiḻ), and a modern colloquial form (koṭuntamiḻ). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffman, Harold (1997).

London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd. pp. 205 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Telugu language|Telugu]]''' – The standard form is based on the dialect and accent as spoken in Krishna District. In Hyderabad, the Telugu is heavily influenced by [[Urdu]]&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Languages: The Definitive Reference to More Than 400 Languages By Andrew Dalby, Columbia University Press, page no. 301, {{ISBN|0-231-11569-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malibu languages''' are a poorly attested group of extinct languages once spoken along the [[Magdalena River]] in Colombia.  Material exists only for two of the numerous languages mentioned in the literature: Malibú and Mocana.

==Classification==
The Malibu languages have previously been grouped into a single family with the [[Chimila language]].&lt;ref name="Loukotka"&gt;{{cite book

==Family division==
Rivet initially listed three Malibu tribes, each with its own language:&lt;ref name = "Rivet"&gt;{{cite journal

*'''Malibú''',&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|mali1242|Malibu}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken near the [[Magdalena River]] from [[Tamalameque]] to [[Tenerife, Magdalena|Tenerife]]
*'''Mocaná''', spoken by the [[Mokaná]] people in the region east of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]
*'''Pacabuey''', also known as '''Sompallón''' or '''Laguna Malibu''', spoken near the Zapatoza lagoon

To this list, Loukotka adds six more languages (excluding Chimila):&lt;ref name="Loukotka"/&gt;
*'''Papale''', spoken on the [[Fundación River]]
*'''Coanoa''' or '''Guanoa''', spoken on the [[Cesar River]]
*'''Zamirua''', spoken on the [[Ariguaní River]]
*'''Cospique''', spoken somewhere in the [[Department of Magdalena]]
*'''Mompox''', spoken near the city of [[Santa Cruz de Mompox]]
*'''Calamari''', spoken along the coast south of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] to [[Coveñas]]

==Vocabulary==
Rivet gives a brief list of words from Malibú and Mocana, but does not distinguish the two languages.&lt;ref name="Rivet"/&gt;  A selection of these is provided below:

*''tahana'' – [[Manchineel tree|manzanilla tree]]
*''malibu'' – chief
*''man'' – small boat
*''ytaylaco''/''yteylaco''/''yntelas''/''ytaylas'' – devil, deity
*''entaha''/''enbutac'' – [[cassava]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3311">'''Mathematical maturity''' is an [[Mathematical jargon|informal term]] used by [[mathematician]]s to refer to a mixture of mathematical experience and insight that cannot be directly taught. Instead, it comes from repeated exposure to mathematical concepts. It is a gauge of mathematics student's [[erudition]] in [[mathematical structure]]s and methods.
The topic is occasionally also addressed in literature in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Arthur Steen]] (1983) "Developing Mathematical Maturity" pages 99 to 110 in ''The Future of College Mathematics: Proceedings of a Conference/Workshop on the First Two Years of College Mathematics'', Anthony Ralston editor,  Springer {{isbn|1-4612-5510-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Mathematical maturity has been defined in several different ways by various authors.

One definition has been given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larry.denenberg.com/math22/LectureA.pdf Math 22 Lecture A], Larry Denenberg&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|... fearlessness in the face of symbols: the ability to read and understand notation, to introduce clear and useful notation when appropriate (and not otherwise!), and a general facility of expression in the terse—but crisp and exact—language that mathematicians use to communicate ideas.}}

A broader list of characteristics of mathematical maturity has been given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/course/lbs/119/simpson/goals_content.html LBS 119 Calculus II Course Goals], Lyman Briggs School of Science&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
*the capacity to generalize from a specific example to broad concept 
*the capacity to handle increasingly abstract ideas 
*the ability to communicate mathematically by learning standard notation and acceptable style 
*a significant shift from learning by memorization to learning through understanding 
*the capacity to separate the key ideas from the less significant 
*the ability to link a geometrical representation with an analytic representation 
*the ability to translate verbal problems into mathematical problems 
*the ability to recognize a valid proof and detect 'sloppy' thinking 
*the ability to recognize mathematical patterns 
*the ability to move back and forth between  the geometrical (graph) and the analytical (equation)
*improving mathematical intuition by abandoning  naive assumptions and developing a more critical attitude}}

Finally, mathematical maturity has also been defined as an ability to do the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://course1.winona.edu/KSuman/Dictionary/Fill%20Ins/Mathematical%20Maturity.htm A Set of Mathematical Equivoques], Ken Suman, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Winona State University&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matilda Koen-Sarano''' (in {{lang-he-n|מתילדה כהן-סראנו}}), is an Israeli writer,  born in [[Milan]], Italy in 1939 to [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Turkish Jewish]] parents is one of the most widely known writers in the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino language]].

==Biography==
Koen-Sarano was born in [[Milan]] in 1939 to a Sephardic family from Turkey. Her grandfather, Moshe, was born in [[Bergama]] in 1874. Her parents, Alfredo Sarano and Diana Hadjes, were both born in [[Aydin]]. Her father lived in [[Rhodes]] until 1925, while her mother in [[Izmir]] until 1938, marrying in [[Milan]] in 1938. During [[World War II]], the family hid in the Italian mountains from the Nazi persecutions. Her father became the Secretary of the Jewish Community of Milan from 1945 until 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/sarano.html Friend of the Foundation: Matilda Koen-Sarano]&lt;/ref&gt; She married Aaron Koen and made [[aliya]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosefarad.com/la-guisendera-de-matilda-koen-sarano-en-judeoespanol-desde-el-cidicsef-de-buenos-aires/ “La guisendera” de Matilda Koen Sarano, en judeoespañol, desde el CIDICSEF de Buenos Aires]. [[Radio Sefarad]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Matilda studied in the Jewish Community School of Milan, and also studied languages at the [[Bocconi University]] in Milan and also [[Italian literature]] and Judaeo-Spanish literature and Judaeo-Spanish folklore at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

She made [[aliyah]] in 1960. In the summer of 1979, she participated in the seminar for [[Judaeo-Spanish language|Ladino language]] radio producers held at [[Kol Israel]]. This sparked in her the desire to write in this language and of putting the spotlight on everything she lived by the end of her childhood. In order to achieve this, she started interviewing several people from the [[Sephardi]]c world to record and keep hundreds of folk tales and traditional stories. Besides, this activity she made her return to the university as a scholar. Then she published her first book of Sephardic folk tales, named '''Kuentos del Folklor de la Famiya Djudeo-Espanyola''' (Folk Tales of the Judaeo-Spanish Family) in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grijalvo.com/Matilda_Koen_Sarano/b_Matilda_curriculum_espanol.htm Resume of Matilda Koen-Sarano (in Spanish)]. Editorial Grijalvo&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jerusalem]].

In April 2009 she published her most recent book, “Kon bayles i kantes, Sefaradis de dor en dor” (With Dances and Songs, Sephardim from Generation to Generation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salom.com.tr/news/detail/11744-El-ultimo-livro-de-Matilda-Koen-Sarano-Kon-bayles-i-kantes.aspx El ultimo livro de Matilda Koen-Sarano “Kon bayles i kantes”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719072209/http://www.salom.com.tr/news/detail/11744-El-ultimo-livro-de-Matilda-Koen-Sarano-Kon-bayles-i-kantes.aspx |date=19 July 2011 }}.Şalom Gazetesi, Turkish Jewish Journal in Ladino&lt;/ref&gt;

Koen-Sarano has taught [[Judeo-Spanish language|Ladino]] at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] since 1996 and a course for Ladino Teachers, organized by The [[Autoridad Nasionala del Ladino|National Authority for Ladino and its Culture]], in [[Jerusalem]] since 1998. Also, she writes the Judeo-Spanish News at [[Kol Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sephardicstudies.org/sarano.html Friend of the Foundation: Matilda Koen-Sarano]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefaradinfo.org/Home/livres/notes-de-lecture/l-anthologie-de-comedies-judeo-espagnoles-de-matilda-koen-sarano L’anthologie de comédies judéo-espagnoles de Matilda Koen-Sarano]. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Mooring (oceanography)}}

[[File:Mooring.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A dockworker places a mooring line on a [[bollard]].]]
A '''mooring''' refers to any permanent structure to which a vessel may be secured. Examples include [[quay]]s, [[wharf]]s, [[Jetty|jetties]], [[pier]]s, anchor [[buoy]]s, and mooring buoys. A ship is secured to a mooring to forestall free movement of the ship on the water. An ''anchor mooring'' fixes a vessel's position relative to a point on the bottom of a waterway without connecting the vessel to shore. As a verb, ''mooring'' refers to the act of attaching a vessel to a mooring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maloney|first=Elbert S.|title=Chapman Piloting, Seamanship &amp; Small Boat Handling|year=1996|publisher=Hearst Marine Books|isbn=978-0-688-14892-8|edition=62|author2=Charles Frederic Chapman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term likely stems from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] verb ''meren'' (to ''moor''), used in English since the end of the 15th&amp;nbsp;century.

[[File:POL STS Chopin 12.jpg|thumb|220px|Mooring line of Polish ship ''[[Fryderyk Chopin (ship)|Fryderyk Chopin]]''.]]
These moorings are used instead of temporary anchors because they have considerably more holding power, cause less damage to the marine environment, and are convenient. Where there is a row of moorings they are termed a '''tier'''{{anchor|tier}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED2|tier|volume=XVIII|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also occasionally used to hold floating docks in place. There are several kinds of moorings:

Swing moorings also known as simple or single-point moorings, are the simplest and most common kind of mooring. A swing mooring consists of a single anchor at the bottom of a waterway with a rode (a rope, cable, or chain) running to a float on the surface. The float allows a vessel to find the rode and connect to the anchor. These anchors are known as swing moorings because a vessel attached to this kind of mooring swings in a circle when the direction of wind or tide changes.

For a small boat (e.g. 22' / 6.7 m sailing yacht), this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12&amp;nbsp;mm or 14&amp;nbsp;mm rising chain attached to the "anchor", and a bridle made from 20&amp;nbsp;mm nylon rope, steel cable, or a 16&amp;nbsp;mm combination steel wire material.  The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material.  Old rail wagon wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose.  In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may be placed in a grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings.  Ropes (particularly for marker buoys and messenger lines) should be "non floating" to reduce likelihood of a boat's prop being fouled by one.

=== Pile moorings ===
Pile moorings are poles driven into the bottom of the waterway with their tops above the water. Vessels then tie mooring lines to two or four piles to fix their position between those piles. Pile moorings are common in [[New Zealand]] but rare elsewhere.

While many mooring buoys are privately owned, some are available for public use. For example, on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] off the [[Australia]]n coast, a vast number of public moorings are set out in popular areas where boats can moor. This is to avoid the massive damage that would be caused by many vessels [[anchor]]ing.

There are four basic types of permanent anchors used in moorings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Moorings|url=http://www.the-lake-life.com/about-moorings/|publisher=The Lake Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dor-Mor pyramid mooring anchors.JPG|thumb|Dor-Mor pyramid-shaped anchors used in mooring]]

*'''Dead weights''' are the simplest type of anchor. They are generally made as a large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. The advantages are that they are simple and cheap. A dead weight mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages are that they are heavy, bulky, and awkward.
*'''Mushroom anchors''' are the most common anchors and work best for softer seabeds such as mud, [[sand]], or [[silt]]. They are shaped like an upside-down mushroom which can be easily buried in mud or silt. The advantage is that it has up to ten times the holding-power-to-weight ratio compared to a dead weight mooring; disadvantages include high cost, limited success on rocky or pebbly substrates, and the long time it takes to reach full holding capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamestown Distributors|title=Mooring Basics – How to Install a Permanent Mooring|url=http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/document.do?docId=1107&amp;title=Mooring+Basics+-+How+to+Install+a+Permanent+Mooring|work=How Tos}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Pyramid anchors''' are pyramid-shaped anchors, also known as Dor-Mor anchors. They work in the upside-down position with the apex pointing down at the bottom such that when they are deployed, the weight of wider base pushes the pyramid down digging into the floor. As the anchors are encountered with lateral pulls, the side edges or corners of the pyramids will dig deeper under the floor, making them more stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=Beth A.|title=Everyday Moorings|journal=Seaworthy|date=January 2014|issue=January 2014|url=http://www.boatus.com/seaworthy/magazine/2014/january/everyday-moorings.asp|accessdate=24 August 2014|publisher=BoatUS Marine Insurance Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=5640920 |gdate=1997-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Screw-in moorings''' are a modern method. The anchor in a screw-in mooring is a shaft with wide blades spiraling around it so that it can be screwed into the substrate. The advantages include high holding-power-to-weight ratio and small size (and thus relative cheapness). The disadvantage is that a diver is usually needed to install, inspect, and maintain these moorings.
*'''Multiple anchor mooring systems''' use two or more (often three) light weight temporary-style [[anchor]]s set in an equilateral arrangement and all chained to a common center from which a conventional rode extends to a mooring buoy. The advantages are minimized mass, ease of deployment, high holding-power-to-weight ratio, and availability of temporary-style anchors.

== Mooring to a shore fixture ==
[[File:Star Ferry crew using billhook to catch rope at Central ferry pier, Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|right|Crew of Hong Kong's [[Star Ferry]] using a billhook to catch a hemp mooring rope|alt=A man at the front of a large boat throws a rope to another man on a nearby pier wearing a blue sailor uniform who is holding a long pole with a hook at the rear to catch it]]
A vessel can be made fast to any variety of shore fixtures from trees and rocks to specially constructed areas such as [[pier]]s and [[quays]].  The word pier is used in the following explanation in a generic sense.

Mooring is often accomplished using thick ropes called ''mooring lines'' or ''[[hawser]]s''.  The lines are fixed to deck fittings on the vessel at one end and to fittings such as bollards, rings, and cleats on the other end.

Mooring requires cooperation between people on a pier and on a vessel. Heavy mooring lines are often passed from larger vessels to people on a mooring by smaller, weighted heaving lines. Once a mooring line is attached to a [[bollard]], it is pulled tight. Large ships generally tighten their mooring lines using heavy machinery called ''mooring winches'' or ''capstans''.

[[File:Fougeuse-02.jpg|right|thumb|A sailor tosses a heaving line to pass a mooring line to a handler on shore]]
The heaviest cargo ships may require more than a dozen mooring lines. Small vessels can generally be moored by four to six mooring lines.

Mooring lines are usually made from manila rope or a synthetic material such as [[nylon]]. Nylon is easy to work with and lasts for years, but it is highly [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]]. This elasticity has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that during an event, such as a high wind or the close passing of another ship, stress can be spread across several lines. However, should a highly stressed nylon line break, it may part catastrophically, causing ''snapback'', which can fatally injure bystanders. The effect of ''snapback'' is analogous to stretching a rubber band to its breaking point between your hands and then suffering a stinging blow from its suddenly flexing broken ends. Such a blow from a heavy mooring line carries much more force and can inflict severe injuries or even sever limbs.  Mooring lines made from materials such as [[Dyneema]] and [[Kevlar]] have much less elasticity and are therefore much safer to use. However, such lines do not float on water and they do tend to sink. In addition, they are relatively more expensive than other sorts of line.

Some ships use [[wire rope]] for one or more of their mooring lines. Wire rope is hard to handle and maintain. There is also risk associated with using wire rope on a ship's stern in the vicinity of its propeller.

Mooring lines and hawsers may also be made by combining wire rope and synthetic line. Such lines are more elastic and easier to handle than wire rope, but they are not as elastic as pure synthetic line. Special safety precautions must be followed when constructing a combination mooring line.

The two-headed mooring [[bitts]] is a fitting often-used in mooring.  The rope is hauled over the bitt, pulling the vessel toward the bitt. In the second step, the rope is tied to the bitt, as shown.  This tie can be put and released very quickly.  In quiet conditions, such as on a lake, one person can moor a 260-tonne ship in just a few minutes.

Quick release mooring hooks provide an alternative method of securing the rope to the quay: such a system "greatly reduces the need for port staff to handle heavy mooring ropes … means staff have to spend less time on exposed areas of the dock, and [reduces] the risk of back injuries from heavy lifting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/business/local-business/let-s-go-six-figure-investment-made-in-port-s-berths-1-5853755?WT.mc_id=Outbrain_text&amp;obref=obinsite|title=Let’s go! Six-figure investment made in port’s berths|publisher=City of Portsmouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Oil Companies International Marine Forum]] recommend the use of such hooks in oil and gas terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strainstall.com/what-we-do/our-systems/jetty-and-berth-management/quick-release-mooring-hooks/|title=Quick release mooring hooks|publisher=
James Fisher and Sons plc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic rode system is a line, cable, or chain several times longer than the depth of the water running from the anchor to the mooring buoy, the longer the rode is the shallower the angle of force on the anchor (it has more '''scope''').  A shallower scope means more of the force is pulling horizontally so that ploughing into the substrate adds holding power but also increases the swinging circle of each mooring, so lowering the density of any given mooring field. By adding weight to the bottom of the rode, such as the use of a length of heavy chain, the angle of force can be dropped further. Unfortunately, this scrapes up the substrate in a circular area around the anchor. A buoy can be added along the lower portion of rode to hold it off the bottom and avoid this issue.

=== Other types ===
Non-line mooring ("hands-free") is used where pier time is highly valuable, and includes [[suction cup]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.professionalmariner.com/September-2015/First-inland-vacuum-based-mooring-system-installed-on-St-Lawrence-Seaway-locks/ |title=First inland vacuum-based mooring system installed on St. Lawrence Seaway locks |date= September 2015|publisher=Professional Mariner|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|jYf_iHCP14Y|Hands Free Mooring}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/na-skal-de-suge-fast-skipene-til-kaia/275889 |title=Nå skal de suge fast skipene til kaia|first=Tore|last=Stensvold |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |date=30 October 2015 |accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[magnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/111541/Himanen_Laura.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techrev.org.uk/jma/4.2/jma.4.2.10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used between ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:ca7a247a-6e48-4c37-a690-47607bc0615d?collection=education |title=Intelligent Ship to Ship Mooring|date=1 January 2016|publisher= [[Delft University of Technology]] |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mediterranean mooring ===
[[File:USS Orion (AS-18).jpg|thumb|[[USS Orion (AS-18)|USS&amp;nbsp;''Orion'' (AS-18)]] "Med moored" with the stern tied to the pier and two anchors forward, in [[La&amp;nbsp;Maddalena]], [[Sardinia]].]]
Mediterranean mooring, also known as "med mooring" or "Tahitian mooring", is a technique for mooring a vessel to pier.  In a Mediterranean mooring the vessel sets a temporary anchor off the pier and then approaches the pier at a perpendicular angle.  The vessel then runs two lines to the pier.  Alternatively, simple moorings may be placed off the pier and vessels may tie to these instead of setting a temporary anchor. The advantage of Mediterranean mooring is that many more vessels can be connected to a fixed length of pier as they occupy only their width of pier rather than their length. The disadvantages of Mediterranean mooring are that it is more likely to result in collisions and that it is not practical in deep water or in regions with large tides.

=== Travelling mooring / Running mooring ===
A mooring used to secure a small boat (capable of being beached) at sea so that it is accessible at all tides.  Making a Travelling Mooring involves (1) the sinking of a heavy weight to which a block ([[pulley]] wheel) is attached at a place where the sea is sufficiently deep at low tide, (2) fitting a block / pulley wheel to a rock or secure point above the high tide mark, and (3) running a heavy rope with marker buoy between these blocks.

Mooring involves (a) beaching the boat, (b) drawing in the mooring point on the line (where the marker buoy is located), (c) attaching to the mooring line to the boat, and (d) then pulling the boat out and away from the beach so that it can be accessed at all tides.

=== Canal mooring ===
[[File:Mooring Post.jpg|thumb|A wooden mooring bollard]]
A mooring used to secure a [[Narrowboat]] (capable of traversing narrow UK canals and narrow locks) overnight, during off boat excursions or prolonged queuing for canal lock access. Water height with minimal exceptions, remain constant (not-tidal); there is water height variance in close proximity to [[Lock (water transport)|locks]].&lt;ref name=canal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/media/library/141.pdf|title=The Boater's Handbook|publisher=[[Canal &amp; River Trust]]|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mukhtar Omarkhanuli Auezov''' ({{lang-kz|Muhtar Omarhanuly Áýezov}}, Мұхтар Омарханұлы Әуезов, مۇحتار ومارحانۇلى اۋەزوۆ, {{IPA-kk|mʊχtʰɑr uʊmɑrχɑ́nʊlə æwi̯ɘ́zəf}}; {{lang-ru|Мухта́р Омарханович Ауэ́зов}}, ''Muchtar Omarchanovič Auezov'') (September 28, 1897 — June 27, 1961) was a [[Kazakh people|Kazakh]] writer, a [[social activist]], a Doctor of [[Philology]], and an honored academic of the [[Soviet Union]] (1946). He was born on September 28, 1897 and raised in [[Semey]] (Kaskabulak).

Auezov's writings were influenced by the poet [[Abay Qunanbayuli|Abai]]. Mukhtar's father and grandfather Omarkhan Auez both highly revered the poet, who was a neighbour and a friend of the Auezov family. His grandfather was a storyteller of folk tales, and taught his grandson to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Mukhtar Auezov. The path of Abai. //Republic of Kazakhstan, Almaty: "Zhazushy",2009. — pages 366–374. — {{ISBN|978-601-200-198-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and family ==
Auezov was born in a nomadic family from an area known today as [[Abay District, East Kazakhstan|Abay District, in East Kazakhstan Province]]. His grandfather taught him how to read and write. Auezov was educated at the [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] Teacher's Seminary and [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]].

Auezov is best known for his plays. The first play he authored was ''Enlik-Kebek'', a story of two young lovers that resembles the story of [[Romeo and Juliet]]. He authored more than twenty plays that dealt with the issues relevant to [[Socialism]] in [[Kazakhstan]].

After writing plays, Auezov changed his focus to writing novels. Two novels – ''Abay'' and ''The Path of Abay'' – dealing with the life of Kazakh poet [[Abay Qunanbayuli]] were the product of the last twenty years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Authors/Authors.html Iraj Bashiri, Biographies: Central Asia and Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

Auezov's other projects included drawing and translating literature into the [[Kazakh language]]. Some translations made by him include [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.

Mukhtar first studied in Kaskabulak, then later a Muslim [[madrasa]] in [[Semipalatinsk]]. At age of eleven, he moved to a nearby, five-year grammar school. His father Omarkhan died in 1900, and his mother Nurzhamal in 1912. The young Mukhtar was raised by his uncle Kasymbek and his grandfather Auez and grandmother Dinas.  In 1907, after a year of study in the [[madrasa]], he was sent to the large [[Russian language|Russian]] school in [[Semipalatinsk]].

Mukhtar Auezov attended the Semipalatinsk Pedagogical [[Seminary]] after graduating from the City College. In the 1912–1913 academic year, Mukhtar finished the first seminary class with an award and went on to complete his studies at the Semipalatinsk Seminary in 1919. Around this time he began his acquaintance with Russian and other foreign classics of literature. At the same time, Auezov wrote short stories, poems and articles that began to be published.

"The young Auezov, according to the testimonies of the pedagogues, was marked for his impeccable attention, extraordinary gifts, slim build and aristocratic self-belief. He was an extraordinary sportsman and represented “Yarysh F C”, which at the time was the best football team in the city."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auezov.kz Mukhtar Auezov Fund. The autobiography and letters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204221115/http://auezov.kz/ |date=2012-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhtar Auezov joined the faculty of a large state school, and he also worked holding various positions in the local government in Semipalatinsk with the Kazakh Central Executive Committee and in [[Orenburg]].

In the summer of 1917, Auezov married a 15-year-old girl named Raihan. They had a daughter together in 1918 who they named Mugamilya (she lived until 2009), and a year later, in 1919, a son (who died in infancy). They got divorced in 1920.

In 1928 Mukhtar Auezov graduated from the Philological Faculty of Leningrad State University and completed his PhD at the University of Tashkent. During the 1930s, his endeavors as a professional writer began to take off. Mukhtar Auezov died during an operation in [[Moscow]] on 27 June 1961. He was buried in the [[Central Cemetery]], [[Almaty]]. On his grave there stands a bust created by [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]].

After his death in 1961, the Government of the Republic [[Kazakhstan]] decided to perpetuate the name of the writer. The Institute of Literature and Art of the Academy of Sciences was renamed as the Auezov Institute of Literature and Art of the Academy of Sciences. Kazakh State Academic Drama Theatre, a literary memorial museum, a school, a street and an urban area in [[Almaty]] also bear his name.

== Writings ==
Auezov wrote numerous essays, short stories, and plays (many translated into other languages) in different genres.

In 1917, while he was studying at the seminary, he wrote “Enilik-Kebek" (a play based on folk legends).  The "Enilik-Kebek" play and the story "Korgansyzdyn Kuni", which was written in 1921 demonstrated to the world his great talent as a writer. 
From 1923 he began to devote all his energy to the literary arts and to work productively. In the period 1923–1926 he authored stories such as "Okygan azamat", "Kyr suretteri", "Uilenu", "Eskilik kolenkesinde", "Kinamshil boizhetken", "Karaly sulu".

During the period 1923–1928 years he studied and then graduated from  [[Leningrad University]] in the Faculty of Language and Literature. During the last two years of his studies  In  [[Leningrad]]  (St. Petersburg), he wrote two highly acclaimed novels: "Karash-karash" and "Kokserek".

Auezov began working in depth with themes of Kazakh history. His fixation with history is demonstrated in his works "Enilik-Kebek", "Khan Kene", "Kily zmaan", "Aiman – Sholpan", and "Karakypshak Kobylandy."
For 20 years he devoted himself to prose and plays, which have become classics of Kazakh literature. In the thirties, he wrote a series of stories, such as: "Kasennin kubylystary", "Izder", "Shatkalan", "Kum men Askar", "Burtkiwi", and plays like" Aiman-Sholpan", "Tas tilek", "Shekarada", "Tungi saryn".

In 1936 he published a piece of prose called "Tatiananyn kyrdagy ani" in the Kazakh press "Kazak adebieti", that was a section from the future novel of the same name. Some years after that(around 1940), with the cooperation of  [[Leonid Sobolev]], he wrote the "Abai"  [[tragedy]]. 
The great scientist and teacher, Auezov, worked on the history of  Kazakhs literature, and the training of personnel. He was the founder of the Abai studies and the principal author and editor of the multivolume "Kazak adebiet Tarihy". He also wrote a monograph on the Kyrgyz epic Manas.

After the Abai Joly epic, he began writing a new, large-scale epic that described a new era in the future. His first book of that period is called "Osken orken" and was first published posthumously in 1962. 
A period of blooming of Kazakh drama is associated with the works of Auezov. He wrote over twenty plays and translated such classic works of world and Russian drama as "[[The Inspector]]" by [[Gogol]], [[Othello]] and [[The Taming of the Shrew]] 'by [[Shakespeare]], Aristocrats by [[Nikolai Pogodin]], Spring Love by [[Konstantin Trenyov]], and Officer of the Navy by A. Kron.

In 1960, together with a group of [[Soviet writers]], he visited the United States. In the summer of 1960, he started work on the series of essays named “The American Impressions”. From mid-summer 1960, he began work on the novel named “The Young Tribe”.
In March 1961, Auezov embarked on a visit to India that included participation in the work of the III International Congress for Peace in [[Delhi]] together with a delegation headed by [[Nikolai Tikhonov]]. In June of that same year, he planned to visit England, the land of [[Shakespeare]], but his untimely death meant that his wish to travel to England did not occur. On June 3, 1961, he travelled to [[Moscow]] for medical tests. On June 27, 1961 – his heart failed during a [[surgical operation]].&lt;ref&gt;Mukhtar Auezov. The path of Abai.

== "Abai Zholy" (The path of Abai) ==

In his formative years, Mukhtar listened to the memories of his grandfather that told of Abai and  Kunanbay. The destiny of Mukhtar Auezov was linked by many threads to the life of Abai the hero great inspiration of his life. Abai himself graced family celebrations, arranged for Auez to mark the birth of his grandson. Nurganym, one of the wives of Kunanbai father of Abai, was the sister of Auez.

Mukhtar later became friends with the son of Abai Turagulom and married Camille, granddaughter of the great poet, that is the daughter of Magauov.
Auezov met Dilda, the first wife of Abai with whom he received a great deal of information. More information about Abai was forthcoming from Eigerim another of Abai’s life partners who survived her husband for more than a decade.

Mukhtar Omarhanuly for 15 years wrote his famous four-volume epic historical novel called "Abai Joly". It was translated into [[Russian language|Russian]]. In 1949 two books of the novel "Abai" received the first level award of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. This epic, which ended with four books, was awarded the [[Lenin prize]]. was translated into 30 languages, and received rave reviews from readers all over the world.

"Abai Zholy"  is one of the most popular and valuable novels written by Mukhtar Auezov. The first book of the series was published in 1942 and after five years in 1947 “Abai”, the second of the series was published, then came the third book in 1952 called “Abai aga” (Brother Abai). Finally, the fourth book was released in 1956. Later all of the books were repackaged and renamed as “Abai zholy” (The Path of Abai).
The first book and second books each have 7 chapters and one epilogue. The third book has 6 chapters as has the Fourth and one epilogue entire epic is divided into 20 short chapters each of which includes uniquely interesting situations.

Each chapter’s name precisely demonstrates the psychological state of the events within the story. 
If we compare there is much more [[drama]], [[tragedy]], sadness and sorrow than positive and happy moments. In the first book we can clearly see how the young and inexperienced boy grows up and at the end of the fourth book we see how he became an adult and changed and who ultimately fails.&lt;ref&gt;Kazakh culture, reference encyclopedia.

'''Purushottam Darwhekar''' (1 June 1926 – 21 September 1999) was an Indian writer and producer of Indian classical and semi-classical musical plays and radio and television programs. He is credited with a revival of the Marathi musical theater (sangeet natya) in the 1960s.

==Early life in Nagpur==

Purushottam Darwhekar studied in Nilcity High School, Nagpur. After B. Sc. B. T., he completed M. A. LL.B. with Gold Medal. He was a teacher at Kurve’s New Model High School, Hadas High School, and at Sule High School in Nagpur. He joined Balvihar (Akashvani radio, Nagpur) and thereafter became Script Writer and then Assistant Producer.

==Career in Broadcasting and Drama==

Darwhekar was Assistant Producer at Delhi Doordarshan from 1961 to 1963, before moving to Mumbai All India Radio (Akashwani) as Producer. He worked as a member of the Stage Review Committee from 1974 to 1980.

In 1977, he was appointed  Special Executive Magistrate. He was also the President of Films, Drama and Cultural Development Board in the same year. He was made the President of Baroda Marathi Sahitya Mandal. He also served as the President of 58th Drama Conference at Pune and by then he was an honorable personality of Marathi Theatre.

He was appointed as Producer in Mumbai Doordrashan in 1986. By the time he retired, he had produced 700 scripts in Hawamahal, Balvihar, and Doordarshan serials, including serials on Pandit Nehru and the China War. After retirement he returned to Nagpur and was appointed as ‘Producer Emeritus’ in the M.F.A. Department of Nagpur University.

==Marathi Theater==

On 14 October 1950, Darwhekar established the drama company Ranjan Kala Mandir and presented his first play ‘Atombomb Va Adkitta’. Ranjan Kala Mandir became an institution, spreading to Nagpur, because of his efforts. Through this institution, he contributed to the progress of Marathi Theatre. As a Director he helped start the careers of many actors.

The Child Plays of Mr. Purushottam Darwhekar:
* Upashi Rakshas
* Kabuli Vala
* Paryancha Mahal
* Morucha Mama
* Naradachi Shendi
* Abra-Ki-Dabra

Darwhekar settled in Mumbai in 1973 and expanded the scope of his drama company. His entry in the Maharashtra State Drama Festival, Chandra Nabhicha Dhalala, bagged his company first prize.

Darwhekar is remembered now for a musical play he wrote, "[[Katyar Kaljat Ghusali (play)|Katyar Kaljat Ghusali]]". The play ran during the 1960s, was revived later in 2011, and was optioned for a film. In 2015, the Marathi film "[[Katyar Kaljat Ghusali (film)|Katyar Kaljat Ghusali]]" was made by adapting his play.

He was also the director of Vasant Kanetkar's historical play "Ithe Oshalala Mrityu."

Although people in many parts of the world share common [[alphabet]]s and [[numeral system|numeral]] systems (versions of the Latin [[writing system]] are used throughout the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], and much of [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]; the [[Arabic numerals]] are nearly universal), styles of handwritten [[letterforms]] vary between individuals, and sometimes also vary systematically between regions.

==Arabic numerals==

The handwritten numerals used in Western countries have two common forms:

*"In-line" or "full-height" form is similar to that used on typewriters and is taught in North America; in this form all numerals have the same height as the majuscule alphabet (''i.e.'' the capital letters).
*In "old style" [[text figures]], numerals ''0'', ''1'' and ''2'' are [[x-height]]; numerals ''6'' and ''8'' have bowls within x-height, plus ascenders; numerals ''3'', ''5'', ''7'' and ''9'' have descenders from [[x-height]], with ''3'' resembling {{IPA|ʒ}}; and the numeral ''4'' extends a short distance both up and down from [[x-height]]. Old-style numerals are often used by British [[printing press|presses]].

Aside from these two main forms, other regional variations abound.

{{anchor|0}}'''The numeral 0''' — Some writers put a diagonal slash through the numeral 0 (zero), a practice that was used on some early, low-resolution computer terminals which displayed a slashed "zero" glyph to distinguish it from the capital letter ''O''. This practice conflicts with the use of the letter "Ø" in the [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] languages, and the [[empty set]] character "∅" used in [[set theory]]. Forms that avoid confusion with Danish include: 
*a dot placed in the centre of zero, but to be distinguished from [[Monocular O|monocular O]] or [[Bilabial clicks|bilabial clicks]]
*the use of a tick, that is, a slash that does not cross the entire bowl of the figure, but lies completely in the upper right
*a form found in Germany with a vertical slash
*a form with a slash from upper left to lower right.

Confusion between the numeral 0 and the letter O can be resolved by using a script letter O (with a loop at the top),&lt;ref&gt;F. Ryckman, ''Proposed standard SHARE character set'', SHARE Secretary Distribution 82 compiled into "Towards standards for the Handwritten Zero and Oh"article in the ACM Association of Computing Machinery Newsletter,Vol 10 No 8, 1961,[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363534.363563&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=GUIDE]&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving the numeral 0 without embellishments; this was a common practice before use of the slashed zero became the norm{{cn|date=March 2016}}&lt;!-- this used to have a ref to http://www.k8zt.com/zero.html#fonts, which is dead, but can be seen at http://web.archive.org/web/20150208062041/http://www.k8zt.com/zero.html#fonts. However, there's no mention of this in that page. --&gt;

{{anchor|1}}[[File:Handwriting variations, numeral 1.svg|right]]
'''The numeral 1''' — This numeral is sometimes written with a serif at the top extending downward and to the left. People in some parts of Europe extend this stroke nearly the whole distance to the baseline. It is sometimes written with horizontal serifs at the base; without them it can resemble the shape of the numeral ''7'', which has a near-vertical stroke without a crossbar, and a shorter horizontal top stroke. This numeral is often written as a plain vertical line without an ear at the top; this form is easily confused with the capital letter I and with the lower-case letter L.&lt;ref&gt;Misidentification of Alphanumeric Symbols in Both Handwritten and Computer-generated Information. Web. 12 Sept. 2012. &lt;http://www.ismp.org/Newsletters/acutecare/articles/20090702.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|2}}'''The numeral 2''' — In the U.S., Germany and Austria, a curly version used to be taught and is still used by many in handwriting. This 2 can be confused with a capital script Q, or a letter Z. It appears as ɚ.

{{anchor|3}}'''The numeral 3''' — This numeral is sometimes written with a flat top, similar to the character Ʒ (ezh). This form is sometimes used to prevent people from fraudulently changing a three into an eight.

{{Citation needed span |In Taiwan, the top is often written with a diagonal line from the top left, and the overall figure may be so changed that to foreigners it is completely unrecognizable even as a number. |reason=I don't know what you write. Do you mean "LIE DOWN W"?|date=October 2018}}

{{anchor|4}}[[File:Handwriting variations, numeral 4.svg|right]]
'''The numeral 4''' — Some people leave the top "open" — all the lines are either vertical or horizontal, as in a [[seven segment display]]. This makes it easier to distinguish from the numeral ''9''. Whether the horizontal bar terminates at or crosses the right vertical bar is insignificant in the West, but to be distinguished from certain Chinese characters (particularly [[wiktionary:丩|丩]]) it must cross.

{{anchor|5}}'''The numeral 5''' — In Taiwan, the left vertical bar is extended upwards as a long stem. If this is slanted, the overall figure may more closely resemble an uppercase ''Y''. If casually written it can be confused with a letter S.

{{anchor|6}}'''The numeral 6''' — Can be confused with a letter capital ''G'', or the lowercase ''b'', or the nine if inverted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drc.ohiolink.edu/handle/2374.OX/24412 |title= A study of confusing letters b, d, p, and q|first= |last= |author= Davidson, W.P.|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= 1935|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024408/http://drc.ohiolink.edu/handle/2374.OX/24412 |archivedate= 20 July  2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where the number 6 may appear at various angles (such as on billiard balls, some styles of playing cards and dice), it can be underlined (appearing as &lt;u&gt;''6''&lt;/u&gt;) or followed by a full stop (appearing as ''6.'') to indicate the proper viewing angle to disambiguate between ''6'' and ''9''; a ''9'' may or may not appear with similar underlining or full stop (as &lt;u&gt;''9''&lt;/u&gt; or ''9.''). It can also be written with a straight line rather than a curly line on top, appearing as ''b''.

{{anchor|7}}'''The numeral 7''' — The traditional form found in [[copperplate script|copperplate]] penmanship begins with a serif at the upper left and has a wavy horizontal stroke (a swash). In East Asian countries (Korea, China and Japan), this numeral is commonly written with such a serif, but no swash and no crossbar through the middle. It is usually written with just two strokes, the top horizontal and the (usually angled) vertical. A short horizontal bar is sometimes used to cross the vertical in the middle, to distinguish the seven from a numeral one, especially in cultures (such as French) that write ''1'' with a very long upstroke. This form is used commonly throughout continental Europe, parts of the United States  and frequently in Australia. In Taiwan two horizontal bars are sometimes used, although an extra-long serif is the feature which most clearly distinguishes ''7'' from ''1''. When the cross is added in the center it can cause confusion with a script capital ''F''.

{{anchor|9}}'''The numeral 9''' — In parts of Europe, this numeral is written with the vertical ending in a hook at the bottom. This version resembles how the lowercase letter &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is commonly written. ([[Image:Rhv m g1.png]]) Elsewhere the usual shape is to draw the vertical straight to the baseline. A nine may or may not appear with underlining or full stop (as &lt;u&gt;''9''&lt;/u&gt; or ''9.'') in order to avoid confusion with ''6''. In China, southern Taiwan, and South Korea, the nine is sometimes written with the loop to the right of the stick, resembling the capital letter ''P''.

==The Latin writing system==

'''The lowercase letter a''' — Some writers put a double-story through the letter a, a practice that was used on some early, typefaces which displayed a hook top '''a'''. This practice conflicts with the use of the letter "a" in the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] small letters.

Relations between the letter a and the [[A (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter a]] can be resolved by using a Latin script letter ɑ (with a single-story lowercase circle and a vertical line adjacent to the right of the circle without the hook top, also known as ''round-a''); this is a common form in most cursive scripts, the two-story form being reintroduced in handwriting as cursive scripts lose ground to print scripts, where the two-story form is more common.

'''The lowercase letter g''' — In Polish, this letter is often rendered with a straight descender without a hook or loop. This effectively means that a handwritten g looks much like a q in other writing traditions. The letter q, which is only used in foreign words and is extremely rare, is then disambiguated from g by adding a serif (often undulated) extending to the right from the bottom tip of the descender.

'''The lowercase letter p''' — The French way of writing this character has a half-way ascender as the vertical extension of the descender, which also does not complete the bowl at the bottom. In early Finnish writing, the curve to the bottom was omitted, thus the resulting letter resembled a 'n' with a descender ('ɲ').

'''The lowercase letter q''' — In block letters, some Europeans like to cross the descender to prevent confusion with the numeral ''9'', which also can be written with a straight stem. In North America the descender often ends with a hook curving up to the right. ([[Image:Rhv m q1.png]]) In Polish, the lowercase q is disambiguated from g by a serif extending from the bottom tip of the descender to the right.

'''The lowercase letter s''' — See [[long s]].

'''The lowercase letter t''' — In block letters, '''t''' is often written with straight mark without the hook bottom. In modern cursive, the descender often ends with a hook to the right.

'''The lowercase letters u and v''' — These letters have a common origin and were once written according to the location in the word rather than the sound. The '''v''' came first;  the '''u''' originally had a loop extending to the left and was only used to start words. All other locations for either '''u''' or '''v''' were written with the latter. In Germany (especially southern Germany), Austria and Switzerland, lowercase '''u''' is often written with a horizontal stroke or swish over it (''ū'', ''ũ''), to distinguish it from '''n'''.


'''The uppercase letter I''' — This letter is often written with one stroke on the top of the letter and one on the bottom. This distinguishes it from the lowercase letter l, and the numeral 1, which is often written as a straight line without the ear.

'''The uppercase letter J''' — In Germany, this letter is often written with a long stroke to the left at the top. This is to distinguish it from the capital letter "I".

'''The uppercase letter S''' — In Japan, this letter is often written with a single [[serif]] added to the end of the stroke.

'''The uppercase letter Z''' — This letter is usually written with three strokes. In parts of Europe such as Italy, Germany and Spain, it is commonly written with a short horizontal crossbar added through the middle.  This version is sometimes preferred in mathematics to help distinguish it from the numeral ''2''.  In [[Polish language|Polish]], the character [[Ƶ]] is used as an [[Allograph (handwriting)|allographic]] variant of the letter [[Ż]].  In Japan it is often written with a short diagonal crossbar through the middle.

==Kurrent and Sütterlin script==
German [[Kurrent]] and its modernized 20th century school version [[Sütterlin]], the form of handwriting taught in schools and generally used in Germany and Austria until it was banned by the Nazis in 1941, was very different from that used in other European countries. However, it was generally only used for German words. Any foreign words included in the text would usually be written in the "normal" script, which was called the ''"lateinische Schrift"'' (Latin script) in German.

'''Riksmål''' is a written [[Norwegian language]] form, meaning the ''National Language'', based on the [[Dano-Norwegian]] language used by the upper class in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (modern Oslo) in the 19th century.

==History==
After the dissolution of the [[Denmark–Norway|union with Denmark]] in 1814, [[Norway]] had no national language standard of its own, the written language being [[Danish language|Danish]], while the verbal language consisted of numerous [[dialect]]s – that to some extent were not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. The new [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union partner Sweden]] had a different language, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and there was a fear that if no measures were taken, its language would be imposed upon the Norwegians.

Hence, prominent Norwegians, such as [[Henrik Wergeland]] and [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]], advocated a standardized Norwegian language, to be based on the legacy of the [[Danish language]] as used in Norway by the upper class of [[Oslo|Christiania]]. This was proposed by [[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knud Knudsen]], a schoolteacher, who had witnessed how schoolchildren struggled with the Danish language they were taught, since it was very different from the spoken language they were used to. However, as late as in 1883 the Danish intellectual [[Georg Brandes]] stated that the language in Norway was Danish, and that the Norwegians did not have a language of their own.

===Introduction by Knud Knudson===
Knud Knudsen presented his Norwegian language in several works from the 1850s until his death in 1895, while the term ''Riksmaal'' (''aa'' is a contemporary way of writing ''[[å]]'') was first proposed by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1899 as a name for the Norwegian variety of written Danish as well as spoken Dano-Norwegian. It was borrowed from Denmark where it denoted standard written and spoken Danish. The same year the Riksmål movement became organised under his leadership in order to fight against the growing influence of Nynorsk, eventually leading to the foundation of the [[non-governmental organisation]] [[Riksmål Society|Riksmålsforbundet]] in 1907. Bjørnson became its first leader, until his death in 1910.

===Spread===
Riksmål became the chosen language for Norwegian pupils from the latter part of the 19th century, and Norwegian newspapers adapted to the language. However, many Norwegian authors, such as [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] and [[Knut Hamsun]], did not adhere and continued using Danish. Riksmål got an official writing norm in 1907, and in 1917 a new reform introduced some elements from [[Norwegian dialects]] and [[Nynorsk]] as optional alternatives to traditional Dano-Norwegian forms. This was part of an official policy to bring the two Norwegian languages more closely together, intending eventually to merge them into one. These changes met resistance from the Riksmål movement, and ''Riksmålsvernet'' (The Society for the Protection of Riksmål) was founded in 1919. They have later been the purist protectors of the traditional riksmål, in opposition to [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]], and especially [[Samnorsk]].

In the 1938 reform of Bokmål introduced more elements from dialects and Nynorsk, and more importantly, many traditional Dano-Norwegian forms were excluded. This so-called ''radical'' Bokmål or ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Samnorsk|no}}'' (Common Norwegian) met even stiffer resistance from the Riksmål movement, culminating in the 1950s under the leadership of [[Arnulf Øverland]]. Riksmålsforbundet organised a parents' campaign against Samnorsk in 1951, and the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was founded in 1953. Because of this resistance, the 1959 reform was relatively modest, and the radical reforms were partially reverted in 1981 and 2005.

==Current status==
Currently, Riksmål denotes the moderate, chiefly{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} pre-1938, unofficial variant of Bokmål, which is still in use and is regulated by the Norwegian Academy and promoted by Riksmålsforbundet. Riksmål has gone through some spelling reforms, but none as profound as the ones that shaped Bokmål. A Riksmål dictionary was published in four volumes in the period 1937 to 1957 by Riksmålsvernet, and two supplementary volumes were published in 1995 by the Norwegian Academy. After the latest Bokmål reforms in 2005, the difference between Bokmål and Riksmål have diminished and they are now comparable to [[American and British English differences]], but the Norwegian Academy still upholds its own standard.

The daily newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' is notable for its use of Riksmål as its standard language. Use of Riksmål is rigorously pursued, even with regard to readers' letters, which are "translated" into the standard.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A '''[[riparian]] buffer''' or '''stream buffer''' is a [[vegetation|vegetated]] area (a "[[buffer strip]]") near a [[stream]], usually [[forest]]ed, which helps shade and partially protect the stream from the impact of adjacent [[land use]]s.  It plays a key role in increasing [[water quality]] in associated streams, [[river]]s, and [[lake]]s, thus providing environmental benefits.  With the decline of many [[aquatic ecosystems]] due to [[agriculture]], riparian buffers have become a very common [[conservation ethic|conservation]] practice aimed at increasing water quality and reducing [[water pollution|pollution]].

== Benefits ==
Riparian buffers act to intercept [[sediment]], [[nutrient]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and other materials in [[surface runoff]] and reduce nutrients and other [[pollutants]] in shallow subsurface water flow.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). (2006).
[ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/391.pdf "National Conservation Practice Standard: Riparian Forest Buffer."] Code 391. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They also serve to provide [[habitat]] and [[wildlife corridor]]s in primarily agricultural areas.  They can also be key in reducing [[erosion]] by providing [[stream bank]] stabilization.

=== Water quality benefits ===
*Intercepting sediments/nutrients - Key to counteract [[eutrophication]] in downstream lakes and ponds which can be detrimental to aquatic habitats because of large [[fish kill]]s that occur upon large-scale eutrophication.
*Intercepting pesticides - Riparian buffers keep chemicals that can be harmful to aquatic life out of the water.  Some pesticides can be especially harmful if they [[bioaccumulate]] in the organism, with the chemicals reaching harmful levels once they are ready for human consumption.
*Bank stabilization - This is important because erosion can be a major problem in agricultural regions when cut (eroded) banks can take land out of production.  Erosion can also lead to [[sedimentation]] and [[siltation]] of downstream lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.  Siltation can greatly reduce the life span of [[reservoir]]s and the [[dam]]s that create the reservoirs.

=== Habitat benefits ===
*Provide habitat - Riparian buffers can act as crucial habitat for a large number of species, especially those who have lost [[habitat]] due to agricultural land being put into production.
*Increase biodiversity - By adding this vegetated area of land near a water source it becomes a prime location for species that may have left the area due to non-conservation land use to re-establish.  With this re-establishment the number of native species and [[biodiversity]] in general can be increased.
*Buffers acting as corridors - Buffers also serve a major role in wildlife habitat. The habitat provided by the buffers also double as corridors for species that have had their habitat fragmented by various land uses.
*Shading water - The large [[tree]]s in the first zone of the riparian buffer provide shade and therefore cooling for the water, increasing productivity and increasing habitat quality for aquatic species.
*[[Large woody debris]] - When branches and stumps fall into the stream from the [[riparian zone]], more stream habitat features are created. [[Carbon]] is added as an energy source for [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] in the stream.

=== Economic benefits ===
*Increase land value - Often people who purchase land for recreational use are willing to pay more if there is more wooded area located on the land.
*Produce profitable alternative crops - Vegetation such as [[Black Walnut]] and [[Hazelnut]], which can be profitably harvested, can be incorporated into the riparian buffer.
*Increase lease fees for hunting - The increased habitat means that the land will be more sought-after for hunting purposes.

== Buffer design ==
[[File:Late Winter Afternoon in Munson Park Wetlands.webm|thumb|Ground level view of riparian buffer between Munson Pond (off camera left) and an agricultural operation (off camera right)]]

A riparian buffer is usually split into three different zones, each having its own specific purpose for filtering runoff and interacting with the adjacent aquatic system. Buffer design is a key element in the effectiveness of the buffer.  It is generally recommended that native species be chosen to plant in these three zones, with the general width of the buffer being {{convert|50|ft|m}} on each side of the stream.&lt;ref&gt;Dosskey, M., Schultz, D., &amp; Isenhart, T. (1997). [https://fs.usda.gov/nac/documents/agroforestrynotes/an03rfb02.pdf "Riparian Buffers for Agricultural Land."] ''Agroforestry Notes,'' No. 3, January 1997. National Agroforestry Center, USDA Forest Service, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 1.''' This zone should function mainly to shade the water source and act as a bank stabilizer.  The zone should include large native tree species that grow fast and can quickly act to perform these tasks.  Although this is usually the smallest of the three zones and absorbs the fewest contaminants, most of the contaminants have been eliminated by Zone 2 and Zone 3.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"&gt;Maryland Cooperative Extension.  "Riparian Forest Buffer Design, Establishment, and Maintenance." University of Maryland, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 2.''' Usually made up of native [[shrubs]], this zone provides a habitat for wildlife, including nesting areas for [[bird]] species.  This zone also acts to slow and absorb contaminants that Zone 3 has missed.  The zone is an important transition between grassland and forest.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Zone 3.''' This zone is important as the first line of defense against contaminants.  It consists mostly of native [[grass]]es and serves primarily to slow water runoff and begin to absorb contaminants before they reach the other zones.  Although these grass strips should be one of the widest zones, they are also the easiest to install.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Streambed Zone.''' The streambed zone of the riparian area is linked closely to Zone 1.  Zone 1 provides fallen limbs, trees, and tree roots that in turn slow water flow, reducing erosional processes associated with increased water flow and flooding. This woody debris also increases habitat and cover for various aquatic species

The [https://fs.usda.gov/nac National Agroforestry Center] has developed a Filter Strip Design tool ([https://fs.usda.gov/nac/tools/AgBufferBuilder.htm AgBufferBuilder]), which is a GIS-based computer program for designing vegetative filter strips around agricultural fields that utilizes terrain analysis to account for spatially non-uniform runoff.

== Species selection (example using both native Nebraska and introduced species) ==
In Zone 1: Cottonwood, Bur Oak, Hackberry, Swamp White Oak, Siberian Elm, Honeylocust, Silver Maple, Black Walnut, and Northern Red Oak.&lt;ref name="NRDTree"&gt;Nebraska Association of Resources Districts (2003). [http://www.nrdnet.org/trees/pdfs/tree_book.pdf "Conservation Trees for Nebraska."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zone 2: [[Prunus mandshurica|manchurian apricot]], Silver Buffaloberry, Caragana, Black Cherry, Chokecherry, Sandcherry, Peking Cotoneaster, Midwest Crabapple, Golden Currant, Elderberry, Washington Hawthorn, American Hazel, Amur Honeysuckle, Common Lilac, Amur Maple, American Plum, and Skunkbush Sumac.&lt;ref name="NRDTree"/&gt;

In Zone 3: Western Wheatgrass, Big Bluestem, Sand Bluestem, Sideoats Grama, Blue Grama, Hairy Grama, Buffalo Grass, Sand Lovegrass, Switchgrass, Little Bluestem, Indiangrass, Prairie Cordgrass, Prairie Dropseed, Tall Dropseed, Needleandthread, Green Needlegrass.

== Managing forests in riparian area ==
[[Logging]] is sometimes recommended as a management practice in riparian buffers, usually to provide economic incentive. However, some studies have shown that logging can harm wildlife populations, especially birds.  A study by the University of Minnesota found that there was a correlation between the harvesting of timber in riparian buffers and a decline in bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Wildlife Management; Apr 2005, Vol. 69 Issue 2, p689-698, 10p&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, logging is generally discouraged as an environmental practice, and left to be done in designated logging areas.

== Conservation incentives ==
The [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP), a farming assistance program in the [[United States]], provides many incentives to landowners to encourage them to install riparian buffers around water systems that have a high chance of non-point water pollution and are highly erodible. For example, the [[Nebraska]] system of Riparian Buffer Payments offers the following:
*Annual rental payments = $62 to $116 per acre/year (up to $96 per acre per year for certain marginal pasture land)
*Sign up bonus: up-front payment of $10 per acre/year for the life of the contract (Example: $150/ac for a fifteen-year contract)
*Payments for 90% of costs for trees, shrubs, grass seed, site preparation and planting
*10 to 15 year contracts
*Eligible areas:
**Up to {{convert|180|ft|m}} average width along each side of a continuous or intermittent stream
**Strips of grass, shrubs, and/or trees can be used
**Planting done by the local Natural Resource Districts (NRDs)	

These incentives are offered to agriculturists to compensate them for their economic loss of taking this land out of production.  If the land is highly erodible and produces little economic gain, it can sometimes be more economic to take advantage of these CRP programs.&lt;ref&gt;University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension. "Benefits of Riparian Forest Buffers (Streamside Plantings of Trees, Shrubs and Grasses)."  University Press, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Riparian buffers have undergone much scrutiny about their effectiveness, resulting in thorough testing and monitoring.  A study done by the [[University of Georgia]], conducted over a nine-year period, monitored the amounts of fertilizers that reached the watershed from the source of the application.  It found that these buffers removed at least 60% of the [[nitrogen]] in the runoff, and at least 65% of the [[phosphorus]] from the fertilizer application.   The same study showed that the effectiveness of the Zone 3 was much greater than that of both Zone 1 and 2 at removing contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, Sharon. "Riparian Buffers Effective."  Southeast Farm Press. 4 Feb 2004. p26&lt;/ref&gt;. But another recent study did not find efficiency (or a very limiting capacity) for reducing glyphosate and AMPA leaching to streams ; Spontaneous herbaceous vegetation RBS is as efficient as Salix plantations and mesures of Glyphosate in runoff after a year&lt;ref name=study2017effic/&gt;, suggest an unexpected persistence and even a capacity of RBS to potentially favor glyphosate infiltration up to 70 cm depth in the soil&lt;ref name=study2017effic&gt;Hénault-Ethier, L., Lucotte, M., Moingt, M., Paquet, S., Maccario, S., Smedbol, É., ... &amp; Labrecque, M. (2017). ''[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717309397#f0030 Herbaceous or Salix miyabeana ‘SX64’narrow buffer strips as a means to minimize glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid leaching from row crop fields]''. Science of the Total Environment, 598, 1177-1186.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Long-term sustainability ==
After the initial installation of the riparian buffer, relatively little maintenance needs to be performed to keep the buffer in good condition.  Once the trees and grasses reach maturity, they regenerate naturally and make a more effective buffer.  The sustainability of the riparian buffer makes it extremely attractive to landowners, since they do relatively little work and still receive payments. Riparian buffers have the potential to be the most effective ways to protect aquatic biodiversity, water quality and manage water resources in developing countries that lack the funds to install water treatment and supply systems in midsize and small towns.

'''Secondary stress''' (or obsolete: ''secondary accent'') is the weaker of two degrees of [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] in the [[pronunciation]] of a word; the stronger degree of stress being called ''primary''. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] symbol for secondary stress is a short vertical line preceding and at the foot of the secondarily stressed syllable: as before the ''nun'' in ''{{IPA|proˌnunciˈation}}'' (the higher vertical line denotes primary stress). Another tradition in English is to assign [[Acute accent|acute]] and [[Grave accent|grave]] accents for primary and secondary stress: ''pronùnciátion''.

Most languages have at most one degree of stress on the [[phonemic]] level. That is, each [[syllable]] has stress or it does not. Many languages have rhythmic stress; location of the stress may not be predictable, but when the location of one stressed syllable (which may be the primary stress) is known, certain syllables before or after can be predicted to also be stressed; these may have secondary stress. An example is [[Dutch language|Dutch]], where the rule is that initial and final syllables (word boundaries) take secondary stress, then every alternate syllable before and after the primary stress, as long as two stressed syllables are not adjacent and stress does not fall on {{IPA|/ə/}} (there are, however, some exceptions to this rule). See {{slink|Dutch phonology|Stress}}. A similar rule applies in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: secondary stress falls on every alternate syllable, starting with the first, as long as it does not fall adjacent to the primary stress.&lt;ref&gt;Ioana Chițoran (2002) ''The phonology of Romanian,'' p 88&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages (including Egyptian Radio Arabic, [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Cayuga language|Cayuga]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Kaure language|Kaure]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], and [[Warrgamay language|Warrgamay]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unileiden.net/stresstyp/ StressTyp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915034012/http://www.unileiden.net/stresstyp/ |date=2012-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; secondary stress can be predicted to fall on [[heavy syllable]]s.

However, in other languages the placement of secondary stress is not predictable, or may not be predictable (and thus be [[phonemic]]) for some words. This is frequently posited for Germanic languages, including [[English language|English]]. For example, secondary stress is said to arise in [[compound word]]s like ''vacuum cleaner'', where the first syllable of ''vacuum'' has primary stress, while the first syllable of ''cleaner'' is usually said to have secondary stress. However, this analysis is problematic; {{Harvcoltxt|Bolinger|1986}} notes that these may be cases of full vs reduced unstressed vowels being interpreted as secondary stress vs unstressed. See [[Stress and vowel reduction in English]] for details.

In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the [[pitch accent]] is lost from one of the roots in a compound word, but the erstwhile tonic syllable retains the full length (long vowel or geminate consonant) of a stressed syllable; this has sometimes been characterized as secondary stress.&lt;ref&gt;Gjert Kristoffersen (2007) ''The Phonology of Norwegian,'' p 184&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley Unwin''' (7 June 1911 &amp;ndash; 12 January 2002),&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: JAN 2002 25B 14 DAVENTRY &amp;ndash; Stanley Unwin, DoB = 7 June 1911, aged 90.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes billed as '''Professor Stanley Unwin''', was an English [[comedian]], actor and comic writer.

He invented his own comic language, "Unwinese",&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to in the film ''[[Carry On Regardless]]'' (1961) as "[[gobbledygook]]". Unwinese was a corrupted form of English in which many of the words were altered in playful and humorous ways, as in its description of [[Elvis Presley]] and his contemporaries as being "wasp-waist and swivel-hippy". Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had "falolloped (fallen) over" and "grazed her kneeclabbers".

==Early life==
Unwin's parents, Ivan Oswald Unwin and his wife Jessie Elizabeth, {{née}} Brand, emigrated from the United Kingdom to South Africa in the early 1900s. Their son was born in [[Pretoria]] in 1911. Following his father's death in 1914, Unwin's mother arranged for the family to return to England. By 1919, Unwin had been sent to the [[National Children's Home]] in [[Congleton]], [[Cheshire]]. In the late 1920s, he studied radio, television and languages at [[Regent Street Polytechnic]] in [[London]].

In 1937, he married his wife Frances, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Unwin later stated that Unwinese had its roots in enlivening the bedtime stories that he used to tell his children. In 1940, he was given a job in transmitter maintenance for the [[BBC]], and was assigned to the [[Borough Hill]] transmitting station in [[Daventry]]. Unwin, Frances and their nine-month-old daughter, Marion, moved to [[Long Buckby]] in [[Northamptonshire]], where Unwin would reside for the rest of his life.

==Comedy career==
Unwin's early career and training introduced him to wireless and radio communication, and this, coupled with work in the BBC's War Reporting Unit from about 1944, ultimately proved to be his passage into the media.

While based in [[Birmingham]] from 1947 to 1951, Unwin made his first, accidental, transmission. While testing equipment, he handed the microphone to broadcaster [[Frederick Robert Buckley|F.R. "Buck" Buckley]], who [[ad-libbed]] a spoof commentary about an imaginary sport called "Fasche". [[Frederick Robert Buckley|Buckley]] then encouraged Unwin to join in and introduced him as "Codlington Corthusite", handing back the microphone{{Spaced ndash}}whereupon Unwin continued in Unwinese. The recording was played back to two BBC producers, who added sound effects; it was eventually broadcast on [[Pat Dixon]]'s ''Mirror of the Month'' programme and, after receiving a positive response, culminated in another sketch in which Unwin, playing a man from [[Atlantis]], was interviewed about life in the sunken city. The broadcast produced Unwin's first fan mail, from [[Joyce Grenfell]], who had been impressed by his performance. Since Grenfell was Unwin's heroine, the encouragement gave Unwin a boost and he was inspired to break into show business.

After the war, while in [[Egypt]] and recording a series of shows by [[Frankie Howerd]], Unwin was pushed onto the stage and told to "do a turn" after the actor suddenly fell ill. Unwin's next major breakthrough came when producer [[Roy Speer]] introduced him to the comedian [[Ted Ray (comedian)|Ted Ray]]. Once Ray had heard Unwin talking, he said simply: "I want him in the series"{{Spaced ndash}}namely, ''The Spice of Life'', co-starring [[June Whitfield]] and [[Kenneth Connor]].&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt; During the mid-1950s, Unwin performed in about a dozen shows for Speer and made the acquaintance of Johnnie Riscoe and his daughter, Patsy, who would become his managers for the rest of his career. By the end of the 1950s, Unwin had ventured into the film industry, being given a part in the [[Cardew Robinson]] film ''Fun at St Fanny's'' (1956).

In 1968 Unwin was invited to narrate "Happiness Stan", a six song [[fairy tale]] about a boy of the same name, taking up the entire side two of the [[Small Faces]]' album ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'', which reached number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Small Faces, Ogden's Nut Gone Flake | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/b3jw/ | accessdate = 17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Unwin appeared in [[Gerry Anderson]]'s "[[Supermarionation]]" TV series ''[[The Secret Service]]'', both in person and as the voice of the puppet character Father Stanley Unwin, whose appearance was based on him. Episodes typically comprised one or more scenes in which the character of Unwin would attempt to baffle opponents with his gobbledegook. When [[Lew Grade]], Anderson's financial backer and head of distributor [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]], was introduced to the Unwinese dialogue, he cancelled the production on the basis that viewers would not understand what Unwin was saying, despite the fact that such confusion was intentional.

Though less active in later decades, Unwin continued to make occasional appearances. In the 1970s, he appeared on ''The [[Max Bygraves]] Show'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], sometimes speaking normally and sometimes in gobbledegook. In the final episode, Bygraves tested a number of gobbledegook phrases on Unwin, who claimed that he could not understand them.  In 1985, Unwin recorded with [[Suns of Arqa]] on their album ''[[Ark of the Arqans]]'', providing spoken word accompaniment in Unwinese on the first three tracks.  In 1987, he recorded again with Suns of Arqa on their track "Erasmus Meets The Earthling", featured on their album ''[[Seven (Suns of Arqa album)|Seven]]'', and a remixed version of this track was released again in the 1990s.  He appeared as himself in a hospital scene of [[Inside Victor Lewis-Smith]]. In 1994, Unwin collaborated with British [[dance music]] act [[Wubble-U]] on their single "Petal"; on its re-release in 1998, the track ranked number 55 in the UK Chart. In 1998, Unwin made a cameo appearance in the [[Aardman Animations]] series ''[[Rex the Runt]]'', as an accountant who speaks largely in fairly standard English, occasionally lapsing inexplicably into Unwinese.

===Unwinese===
Unwinese, also known as "Basic Engly Twenty Fido", was an ornamented and mangled form of English in which many of the words were corrupted in a playful and humorous manner. Unwin's performances could be hilarious yet disorientating, although the meaning and context were always conveyed in a disguised and picturesque style. Unwinese may have been inspired in part by [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1871 poem ''[[Jabberwocky]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage35/Stanley-Unwin.html Carroll's influence on Unwin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414055551/http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage35/Stanley-Unwin.html |date=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Long Buckby-Grave of Stanley Unwin - geograph.org.uk - 1707018.jpg|thumb|Unwin's grave in [[Long Buckby]]]]

Unwin died at Danetre Hospital in [[Daventry]] on 12 January 2002. He is buried in the churchyard at [[Long Buckby]], with Frances, who pre-deceased him. Their gravestone bears the epitaph, "Reunitey in the heavenly-bode{{Spaced ndash}}Deep Joy!".

A thanksgiving service was held at St Lawrence's Church in Long Buckby and ended with a rendering of "[[Bye Bye Blackbird]]" by John Percival and friends. The [[valediction]] had been prepared by Unwin's family in his own style: "Goodly Byelode loyal peeploders! Now all gatherymost to amuse it and have a tilty elbow or a nice cuffle-oteedee{{Spaced ndash}}Oh Yes!"

[[Suns of Arqa]] released a tribute album to Unwin (entitled "Tributey") following his death, featuring a selection of his works with the band over the years, as well as various interviews.

Unwin's work is considered to have been a significant influence on the two books written by [[John Lennon]]: ''[[In His Own Write]]'' (1964) and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Ingham |title=The Rough Guide To The Beatles |page=220 |publisher=Rough Guides Ltd |edition=3rd |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-84836-525-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taita''', or '''Daw'ida''', is a [[Bantu language]] spoken in the [[Taita Hills]] of [[Kenya]]. It is closely related to the [[Chaga languages]] of Kenya and [[Tanzania]]. The [[Taveta people|Taveta]] language was erroneously re-classified by Jouni Maho (2009) as [[Dawida language|Daw'ida]], however it is lexically and grammatically closest to Chasu ([[Pare language|Pare]]). The Saghala (Northern Sagala, Sagalla) variety is distinct enough to be considered a language separate from Dawida.&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

The Daw'ida{{clarify|date=May 2014}} and Saghala varieties of Taita contain [[loanword]]s from two different South Cushitic languages, called [[Taita Cushitic languages|Taita Cushitic]], which are now extinct.&lt;ref name="Somner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabriele Sommer|first=Matthias Brenzinger (ed.)|title=Language Death: Factual and Theoretical Explorations with Special Reference - "A survey of language death in Africa"|date=1992|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110870606|pages=392–394|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ZeMhAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA392#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that the Cushitic speakers were assimilated fairly recently, since [[lateral obstruent]]s in the loanwords were still pronounced as such within living memory.

Discrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to [[transphobia]] or [[homophobia]], is a common occurrence for trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612144850/http://www.opha.on.ca/ppres/2003-06_pp.pdf|title=2003-06_pp.pdf|website=docs.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, D.B.

One of the most infamous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of [[Brandon Teena]], a young [[trans man]], by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth.&lt;ref name="trutv5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/5.html|title=Teena Brandon|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|publisher=[[TruTV]]|pages=5|accessdate=2009-02-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214094602/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/5.html|archivedate=2013-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events became internationally known when told in the feature film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', which earned [[Hilary Swank]] an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

== Differentiation from gay bashing ==

Unlike [[gay bashing]], trans bashing is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].{{Dubious |Not about gender identity |reason=No, it's because of their transgressive gender expression, irrespective of a cis or trans identity |date=December 2017}}  However, a trans person may be gay bashed if the person perceives them as gay rather than transgender.{{cn |date=December 2017}}

At least since the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, people from the greater trans communities have often been politically aligned with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Dayus, Transgenders Protest HRC Exec's Visit to Houston, Hous. Voice, Sept. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, researchers and some activists from the greater trans communities argue trans bashing should be categorized separately from violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation ("gay-bashing").&lt;ref name="cider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination and Hate Crimes Against Gender Variant People, It's Time Illinois . . . Political Action for the Gender Variant Community (May 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-trans bias crimes have been conceptually and characteristically distinguished from homophobic crimes in the scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Transgender Hate Crimes: The Challenge for Law Enforcement, at http://jointheimpactma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Victimization-Study-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them.  However, campaigns against gay bashing and trans bashing are often seen as a common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/bashing1008.php|title=Workers World Oct. 8, 1998: Zero tolerance for gay-trans bashing|website=www.workers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, perpetrators accused of hate crimes against trans people have tried to use a [[trans panic]] defense, an extension of [[gay panic defense]].&lt;ref name="TRTH"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SiaNoJ3puyQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22gwen+araujo%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA47,M1 ''Transpeople: Repudiation, Trauma, Healing''] by Christopher A. Shelley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCIAC"&gt;[http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=153 "Two murder convictions in Araujo case"], Zak Szymanski; ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'' 15 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The jury deadlocked, but there is evidence they rejected the trans-panic defense.  One law journal provided an analysis of the trans-panic defense, arguing in part that the emotional premise of a trans panic defense (shock at discovering unexpected genitals) is different from the emotional premise of a gay panic defense (shock at being propositioned by a member of the same sex, perhaps because of one's repressed homosexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinberg|first=Victoria L.|date=Spring 2005|title=A Heat of Passion Offense: Emotions and Bias in "Trans Panic" Mitigation Claims: Hiding From Humanity|journal=Boston College Third World Law Journal|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws covering gender identity ==

===International===
The United Nations adopted their [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 as the first global declaration of human rights.&lt;ref name=UDHR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of articles in the declaration that have been suggested to specifically pertain to transgender people and violence (including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, legal, systemic, emotional, and political violence), although LGBT rights are not explicitly outlined in the document.

* Article 2 entitles individuals to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration "without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status". 
* Article 5 states that "[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
* Article 7 states that "[a]ll are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination". 
* Article 9 bans "arbitrary arrest, detention or exile" (which, according to Article 2, is protected from distinction based on identity or belief).
* Article 20 states that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref name="AI Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LGBT Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/lgbt-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights|website=amnestyusa.org|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====United States====
[[File:Map of LGBT-related hate crime law in the United States.svg|thumb|right|Current U.S. LGBT [[hate crimes laws in the United States|hate crimes laws]] by state. A national hate crimes law encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity.
{{legend|#800080|Sexual orientation and gender identity recognized in state hate crimes law}}
{{legend|#0000ff|Sexual orientation recognized in state hate crimes law}}
{{legend|#00ffff|Sexual orientation recognized for data collection about hate crimes}}
{{legend|#cccccc|State hate crimes law uninclusive of sexual orientation or gender identity}}]]

In the United States, currently seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have hate crime laws protecting people victimized on the basis of their gender identity (they are [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/hate_crime_laws|title=Hate Crime Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s in [[Seattle]]'s [[gay village]] of [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]], there was evidence of an increase in incidents of trans bashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|title=Gentrification ousting local gay community|last=Holt|first=Emily|publisher=The Spectator|accessdate=2 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502105800/http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|archivedate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matthew Shepard Act]] expanded the federal hate crime laws to include gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In order to qualify as a federal hate crime in the United States, the crime must include successful or attempted bodily injury due to the use of firearm, explosives, weapons, fire, or incendiary devices.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”"&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – "Hate Crime Acts"|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap13-sec249.pdf|website=Government Publishing Office|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes are covered by state, rather than federal laws unless the victim or defendant travel across state lines or national borders; using an interstate commuting route; the weapon has been brought across state lines; or if the conduct interferes with or otherwise affects commerce across state lines.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”" /&gt; This means that, unless hate crimes under the federal definition occur in a way that does not just affect one state, states have the freedom to implement their own hate crime laws. The protections of these laws range widely. Pennsylvania, for example, has not included gender identity in their hate crime protections since it was rescinded from the law in 2008.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Hate Crime Laws"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giampolo|first1=Angela|title=Changing the State of Hate Crime-Laws in Philadelphia|url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202671537351/Changing-the-State-of-HateCrime-Laws-in-Pennsylvania?slreturn=20140923231944|accessdate=28 April 2015|agency=The Legal Intelligencer|publisher=The Legal Intelligencer|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====='Bathroom bills' to enforce gendered bathroom use=====

{{Main article|Bathroom bill}}

Bathroom bills are bills proposed with relation to bathroom access and gender identity.&lt;ref name="Bathroom bills definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sprigg|first1=Peter|title="Gender Identity" Protections  ("Bathroom Bills")|url=http://www.frc.org/onepagers/gender-identity-protections-bathroom-bills|website=Family Research Council|publisher=Family Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of [[Bathroom_bill#United_States|bills proposed in the United States]] intended to limit access to restrooms for those who do not identify with the sex on their birth certificate. Some of these bills are justified with the rationale of protecting cisgender women from violent acts committed by cisgender men entering their facilities under the pretense of identifying as transgender women, although there is no evidence thus far of any incidences of this.&lt;ref name="Florida lawmaker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bixby|first1=Scott|title=This Lawmaker Wants to Make It Illegal for Transgender People to Use Bathrooms|url=http://mic.com/articles/110314/this-lawmaker-wants-to-make-it-illegal-for-trans-people-to-use-bathrooms|publisher=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debunking myth about bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maza|first1=Carlos|title=Debunking The Big Myth About Transgender-Inclusive Bathrooms|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/20/debunking-the-big-myth-about-transgender-inclus/198530|agency=Media Matters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brinker|first1=Luke|title=One Month Later: How California's Transgender Student Law Is Affecting Public Schools|url=http://equalitymatters.org/blog/201401310002|agency=Equality Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some transgender people are content, and may even prefer, using [[Unisex_public_toilet|gender-neutral bathrooms]], but others expect the right to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network found that singling out trans students by offering them alternative facility options may backfire by increasing their chances of disengaging from school or dropping out entirely.&lt;ref name="GLSEN Study trans in school"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation|url=http://glsen.org/sites/default/files/Harsh%20Realities.pdf|website=Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network|publisher=GLSEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Harassment of transgender people in bathrooms=====

It is transgender people who are likely to be harassed in bathrooms by cisgender people, not the other way around. In one survey, 70 percent of the transgender respondents had faced discrimination when attempting to use a restroom of their gender identity, including "denial of access to facilities, verbal harassment, and physical assault."&lt;ref name="Williams Institute Study Bathroom access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herman|first1=Jody|title=Williams Institute|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|publisher=Williams Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such harassment occurred in 2018, when [[United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_California,_2018#District_44|California Republican Congressional candidate Jazmina Saavedra]] said she heard the "voice of a man" from a locked stall in the women's restroom of a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles and filmed herself chasing the person out of the restaurant with assistance from the restaurant manager. In the video, Saavedra said she was prepared to use pepper spray and a stungun against the transgender woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broverman|first1=Neal|title=Trump Supporter Broadcasts Live as She Chases Trans Woman Out of Bathroom|url=https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2018/5/17/trump-supporter-broadcasts-live-she-chases-trans-woman-out-bathroom|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=The Advocate|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of tactic can result in public [[outing]] of a transgender person's current or former gender identity.

===Europe===

====Malta====

Malta passed the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act in 2015. This bill states that all citizens of Malta have the right to
# The recognition of their gender identity;
# The free development of their person according to their gender identity;
# Be treated according to their gender identity and, particularly, to be identified in that way in the documents providing their identity therein; and
# Bodily integrity and physical autonomy.&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill" /&gt;

This act protects the gender identity of a person at all times. It also states that "person shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity." The act allows parents to postpone listing gender on a child's birth certificate and prohibits “non-medically necessary treatments on the sex characteristics of a person.”&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act (Malta, 2015)|url=http://tgeu.org/gender-identity-gender-expression-sex-characteristics-act-malta-2015/|website=Transgender Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explanation of Malta Gender Identity Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act|url=http://socialdialogue.gov.mt/en/Public_Consultations/MSDC/Pages/Consultations/GIGESC.aspx|publisher=Social Dialogue Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==

Media can contribute to trans bashing through misinformation and scare tactics. Transgender individuals are oftentimes misrepresented negatively in media, or not represented in media at all.Transgender individuals may be portrayed in the media as curiosities or oddities, as mentally unstable persons, and/ or as predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=108759276&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSeqLE4v%2BbwOLCmr06ep7ZSsqa4Ta6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGut1C3rLZNuePfgeyx44Hy7fEA|title="DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT DECEPTION": THE NECESSARY EROSION OF THE TRANS* PANIC DEFENSE|last=Panfil|first=Vanessa|date=June 11, 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public example of this is the attention paid to the transition of [[Chelsea Manning]], a transgender U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for releasing classified documents to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tate|first1=Julie|title=Bradley Manning sentenced to 35 years in WikiLeaks case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-to-sentence-bradley-manning-today/2013/08/20/85bee184-09d0-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html|agency=Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fox News]] story on Manning's transition was introduced with the [[Aerosmith]] song "[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]", while host [[Gretchen Carlson]] referred to Chelsea by her birth name, Bradley, mocking ''The New York Times'' for "helping him" by using Manning's preferred gender pronoun.&lt;ref name="Chelsea Manning Fox coverage"&gt;{{cite news|title='Fox &amp; Friends' Chelsea Manning Segment Introduced With Aerosmith's 'Dude (Looks Like A Lady)' (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/fox-and-friends-chelsea-manning-aerosmith-dude-looks-like-a-lady_n_3823650.html|website=Huffington Post | date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army refused to let her grow her hair as long as female prisoners, and continued referring to her as Bradley "to avoid confusion" until a court mandated her preferred gender pronouns.&lt;ref name="Army stop calling Chelsea Manning male"&gt;{{cite news|title=huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-manning_n_6811352.html|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-manning_n_6811352.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trans health==
According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care (NTDSR), which surveyed 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming people, people who do not identify with their birth sex face obstacles to getting healthcare and have a greater likelihood of facing health issues related to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Jack|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|website=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|publisher=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===

Transgender people experience greater mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as physical health disparities (e.g., cardiovascular disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c662ff9f-e9f1-4e22-ac90-f5588f42f101%2540sessionmgr107&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=115|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trans people also have a higher rate of suicide attempts than the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Youth Suicide Prevention Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics about Youth Suicide|url=http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm|website=Youth Suicide Prevention Program|publisher=Youth Suicide Prevention Program|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124702/http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, the 2.2% of U.S. adults had attempted suicide&lt;ref name="Suicide Attempt Rates US"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicidal Thoughts and Suicide Attempts|url=http://www.sprc.org/basics/scope/attempts|website=Suicide Prevention Resource Center|publisher=Suicide Prevention Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 41% of trans people had attempted suicide in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; The rate of attempted suicide in transgender individuals increased to 51% for those bullied or harassed in school, 55% for those who recently lost a job due to bias, and 61% and 64% for those who were victims of physical and sexual assault, respectively.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;
Low self-esteem in transgender people has been linked to being at high-risk for HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="Sugano et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugano|first1=E|title=The impact of exposure to transphobia on HIV risk behavior in a sample of transgender women of color in San Francisco|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=2006|volume=10|pages=215–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bockting et al. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bockting|first1=W|title=Transgender HIV prevention: Community involvement and empowerment|journal=Transgender and HIV: Risks, Prevention, and Care|date=2001|pages=119–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the rate of HIV in transgender women in North America was 27.7%.&lt;ref name="Herbst et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbst|first1=J|title=Estimating HIV prevalence and risk behaviors of Male-to-Female transgender persons in the United States: A systematic review|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=2008|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9299-3|pmid=17694429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to healthcare===

In the 2010 and 2011 NTDSRs, 19% of the people surveyed reported having been refused medical care due to their gender identity and 50% reported lack of provider knowledge of transgender health needs.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 NTDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Jaime|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_report_on_health.pdf|website=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|publisher=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the Affordable Care Act, it is illegal for any health program receiving federal funding to discriminate based on gender identity. Discrimination includes refusal to admit, treat or provide any services that are available for other patients; subjection of patients to intrusive examination; harass or refuse to respond to harassment by other staff or patients; refusal to provide support services; obligation to participate in [[conversion therapy]]; and any sort of interference in the pursuit of health care rights.&lt;ref name="ACA Accommodations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Know Your Rights Health Care|url=http://transequality.org/know-your-rights/healthcare|website=Trans Equality|publisher=Trans Equality|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial disparities===

Race has been shown to compound manifestations of existing discrimination on the basis of gender identity.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 NTDS" /&gt;
Black trans women have the highest suicide rate of any other group in the United States, at almost half attempting in their lives, while cisgender black women attempt suicide at a rate of 1.7% on average.&lt;ref name="AFSP Facts and Figures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and Figures|url=https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures|website=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Trans students of color face higher rates of harassment and violence in schools.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; American Indian transgender students face the highest rates of sexual assault in school at 24%, followed by multiracial (18%), Asian (17%), and black (15%) students. White transgender students face a 9% rate of sexual assault in K–12.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;
Black trans women have a higher rate of HIV infection than other groups, with a 30.8–56.3% rate, versus 27.7% of MTF transgender people on average.&lt;ref name="Herbst et al. 2008" /&gt;

====Police and incarceration====

In the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 22% of respondents who had interacted with the police reported harassment due to bias. 20% reported denial of equal services. 48% reported being uncomfortable asking for police assistance. Respondents who had served time in jail reported a higher rate of harassment by officers than by others in jail. For all respondents, 7% reported being held in a jail cell solely due to gender identity expression, while this number was 41% for black and 21% for Latino trans respondents.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; 
Transgender people have reported being refused medical care, particularly hormone therapy, in prison, with black trans people and American Indian trans people with the highest reporting rates.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;

'''TriG''' is a serialization format for RDF ([[Resource Description Framework]]) graphs. It is a plain text format for serializing [[named graph]]s and RDF Datasets which offers a compact and readable alternative to the XML-based [[TriX (syntax)|TriX]] syntax.

== Example ==
This example encodes three interlinked named graphs:

The '''Yupik''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|p|ɪ|k}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; languages are the several distinct languages of the several [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] peoples of western and south-central [[Alaska]] and northeastern [[Siberia]]. The Yupik languages differ enough from one another that they are not mutually intelligible although speakers of one of the languages may understand the general idea of a conversation of speakers of another of the languages. One of them, [[Sirenik]], has been an [[extinct language]] since 1997.

The Yupik languages are in the family of [[Eskimo–Aleut]] languages. The [[Aleut language|Aleut]] and [[Eskimo]] languages diverged about 2000&amp;nbsp;BC (contemporaneous with the split of [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]); within the Eskimo classification, the Yupik languages diverged from each other and from the [[Inuit language]] about 1000&amp;nbsp;AD.

==List of languages==
#[[Naukan Yupik language|'''Naukan Yupik''']] (also '''Naukanski'''): spoken by perhaps 100 people in and around [[Lavrentiya]], [[Lorino, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Lorino]], and [[Uelen]] on the Chukotka Peninsula of Eastern Siberia.
#'''[[Central Siberian Yupik language|Central Siberian Yupik]]''' (also '''Yupigestun''', '''Akuzipik''', '''Siberian Yupik''', '''Siberian Yupik Eskimo''', '''Central Siberian Yupik Eskimo''', '''St. Lawrence Island Yupik''', '''Yuit''', '''Asiatic Eskimo''', '''Jupigyt''', '''Yupihyt''', '''Bering Strait Yupik'''): spoken by the majority of Yupik in the [[Russian Far East]] and by the people on [[St. Lawrence Island]], Alaska.  Most of the 1,000 Yupiks on St. Lawrence Island still speak the St. Lawrence dialect of this language. About 300 of the 1,000 Siberian Yupiks in Russia still speak the Chaplino dialect of this language.
#'''[[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]]''' (also '''Central Yup'ik''', '''Yup'ik''', '''West Alaska Eskimo'''): spoken on the Alaska mainland from [[Norton Sound]] down to the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and on some islands such as [[Nunivak Island|Nunivak]]. The name of this language is spelled ''Yup'ik'', with an apostrophe that specifies the elongated 'p' in the way ''Yupik'' is pronounced; all the other languages are spelled ''Yupik'', but all are pronounced the same.  Of the about 21,000 Central Alaskan Yup'ik, some 13,000 still speak this language. There are several dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik. The largest dialect, General Central Yup'ik or ''Yugtun'', is spoken in the [[Yukon River]], [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]], [[Kuskokwim River]], and [[Bristol Bay]] areas. There are three other Central Alaskan Yup'ik dialects: [[Norton Sound]], [[Hooper Bay]]/[[Chevak, Alaska|Chevak]], and [[Nunivak Island]] (called ''[[Cup'ik]]'' or ''[[Cup'ig]]''). The dialects differ in pronunciation and in vocabulary. Within the General Central Yup'ik dialect there are geographic subdialects which differ mostly in word choices.
#'''[[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]]''' (also '''Supik''',&lt;ref name="refLanguageintheusa"&gt;[https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=tk85AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA587&amp;lpg=PA587&amp;dq=%22sugcestun%22+%22supik%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EBoRVAl4zw&amp;sig=73sjhu8vbXd-RGhVJDE5ixVziHU&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OYboUPfrCISHswbF-oEw&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sugcestun%22%20%22supik%22&amp;f=false Language in the USA], Cambridge University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; '''Sugpiaq''', '''Pacific Gulf Yupik''', '''Pacific Yupik''', or '''Chugach'''): is spoken from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] eastward to [[Prince William Sound]]. There are about 3,000 [[Alutiiq]]s, but only 500 – 1,000 people still speak this language. The Koniag dialect is spoken on the south side of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and on [[Kodiak Island]]. The Chugach dialect is spoken on the [[Kenai Peninsula]] and in [[Prince William Sound]].
#'''[[Sirenik]]''' an extinct language formerly spoken on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]].

Yupik is a polysynthetic language that can have analytic alternatives; speakers can express similar ideas in a series of words with a number of bound morphemes.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun. The Languages of Native North America. Cambridge University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stress====
The [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] pattern of Central Siberian and Central Alaskan is generally [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]]ic where stress occurs on the second syllable of each two-syllable [[metrical foot]]. This can be seen in words consisting of [[Syllable weight#Syllable weight in linguistics|light (L)]] syllables. Here, the parsing of syllables into feet is represented with parentheses:

:{| cellspacing="6"
| (L''''L''')L || qayáni || || (qa.yá).ni || "his own kayak"
|}

As can be seen above, the footing of a Yupik word starts from the left edge of the word. (Therefore, a foot parsing of ''L(L''''L''')(L''''L''')'' is not permitted.) Syllables that cannot be parsed into feet in words with an odd number of syllables are not stressed. (Thus, a parsing of ''(L''''L''')(''''L''')'' is impossible.)

Additionally, heavy (H) syllables (consisting of two [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]]) are obligatorily stressed:

:{| cellspacing="6"
| (L''''H''')L || qayá:ni || || (qa.yá:).ni || "in another's kayak"
|}

However, there is a restriction against stress falling on the final syllable of a phrase:

: (L''''L''')(L''''L''') (phrase-internal)
: (L''''L''')LL (phrase-final)

Stressed syllables undergo phonetic lengthening in Yupik although the details differ from dialect to dialect. Generally, a foot consisting of light CV syllables will have the stressed vowel at a greater length than the unstressed vowel. That can be analyzed as light syllables changing to heavy under stress:

:{| cellspacing="6" style="line-height: 1.1em;"
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| (L''''L''')L&lt;br /&gt;(qayá:)ni || → || (L''''H''')L&lt;br /&gt;[qayá:ni]&lt;br /&gt;[(qa.yá:).ni] || &lt;br /&gt;"in another's kayak"
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| (L''''L''')(''''H''')L&lt;br /&gt;saguyá:ni || → || (L''''H''')(''''H''')L&lt;br /&gt;[sagú:yá:ni]&lt;br /&gt;[(sa.gú:).(yá:).ni] || &lt;br /&gt;"in another's drum"
|}

Both Central Siberian and Central Alaskan Yup'ik show this iambic lengthening of light syllables.

When the stressed syllable is underlyingly heavy (such as ''LHL)''), there is dialectal variation. The Chaplinski variety of Central Siberian Yupik shows no extra lengthening of the already long vowel: the heavy syllables remain heavy (no change). The St. Lawrence variety of Central Siberian Yupik has further iambic overlengthening, resulting in a change from underlying heavy to a phonetically superheavy syllable (S). In those cases, Central Alaskan Yup'ik changes the first light syllable in what would be a (LH) foot to a heavy syllable which then receives stress. The light to heavy shift is realized as consonant gemination (of the onset) in CV syllables and as consonantal lengthening of the coda in CVC syllables:

{| cellpadding="6" style="line-height: 1.1em; border-collapse: collapse;"
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| Chaplinski: || LHL&lt;br /&gt;/qaya:ni/ || → || (L''''H''')L&lt;br /&gt;[qayá:ni]&lt;br /&gt;[(qa.yá:).ni] || &lt;br /&gt;"in another's kayak" || (no change)
|- style="vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;"
| St. Lawrence: || LHL&lt;br /&gt;/qaya:ni/ || → || (L''''S''')L&lt;br /&gt;[qayá::ni]&lt;br /&gt;[(qa.yá::).ni] || &lt;br /&gt;"in another's kayak" || (overlengthening)
|- style="vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;"
| Central Alaskan: || LHL&lt;br /&gt;/qaya:ni/ || → || (''''H''')(''''H''')L&lt;br /&gt;[qayyá:ni]&lt;br /&gt;[(qay.yá:).ni] || &lt;br /&gt;"in another's kayak" || (gemination)
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| || LLLHL&lt;br /&gt; || → || (L''''H''')(''''H''')(''''H''')L&lt;br /&gt;[qayá:píx:ká:ni]&lt;br /&gt;[(qa.yá:).(píx:).(ká:).ni] || &lt;br /&gt;"in another's future authentic kayak" || (consonant lengthening)
|}

Note that in the Chaplinski variety because of iambic lengthening there is a neutralization of vowel length contrast in nonfinal stressed syllables.

==Morphology==
The Yupik languages, like other Eskimo–Aleut languages, represent a particular type of [[agglutinative language]] called an ''affixally [[polysynthetic language]]''.

Yupik languages "synthesize" a single [[root (linguistics)|root]] at the beginning of every word with various grammatical [[suffix]]es to create long words with sentence-like meanings. Within the vocabulary of Yupik there are no more than two thousand roots and around four hundred lexical suffixes, but they can be combined to create meanings that in most languages are expressed by multiple free [[morpheme]]s.

Although every Yupik word contains ''one and only one root'' that is rigidly constrained to word-initial position, the ordering of the suffixes that follow can be varied to communicate different meanings, principally through [[recursion]]. The only exception lies with [[grammatical case|case]] suffixes on nouns and [[grammatical person|person]] suffixes on verbs, which are restricted to the end of the words in which they occur.

Yupik is an [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative language]] both in nominal and verbal morphology. It has obligatory [[polyagreement]] on all verbs with subject and object but not with the theme of a [[ditransitive verb]].

== Writing systems ==
The Yupik languages were not written until the arrival of Europeans around the beginning of the 19th century. The earliest efforts at writing Yupik were those of missionaries who, with their Yupik-speaking assistants, translated the Bible and other religious texts into Yupik. Such efforts as those of [[Saint Innocent of Alaska]], Reverend John Hinz (see [[John Henry Kilbuck]]) and [[Uyaquk]] had the limited goals of transmitting religious beliefs in written form.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.asna.ca/alaska/ Alaskan Orthodox texts] in [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]] and [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Yup'ik]] (cf. [http://www.archdiocese.ca/articles/alaskan-orthodox-texts-project-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary The Alaskan Orthodox Texts Project celebrates its 10th anniversary], May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Alaskan [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]], the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik adopted a Latin alphabet originally developed by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries in [[Greenland]] beginning in the 1760s, which the missionaries later transported to [[Labrador]]. The Alaskans were the only Northern indigenous peoples to develop their own form of picture writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html Project Naming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028155138/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054303-e.html |date=2006-10-28 }}, the identification of Inuit portrayed in photographic collections at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased]] Alaska, Yupik children were taught to write English with Latin letters in the public schools. Some were also taught the Yupik script developed by Rev. Hinz, which used Latin letters, which had become the most widespread method for writing Yupik. In Russia, most Yupik were taught to read and write only Russian, but a few scholars wrote Yupik using Cyrillic letters.

In the 1960s, the [[University of Alaska]] assembled a group of scholars and native Yupik speakers,who developed a script to replace the Hinz writing system. One of the goals of this script was that it could be input from an English keyboard without diacriticals or extra letters. Another requirement was that it accurately represent each [[phoneme]] in the language with a distinct letter. A few features of the script are that it uses 'q' for the back version of 'k', 'r' for the Yupik sound that resembles the French 'r', and consonant + ' for a geminated (lengthened) consonant. The rhythmic doubling of vowels (except schwa) in every second consecutive open syllable is not indicated in the orthography unless it comes at the end of a word.

"F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" is defined as the number of equivalent minutes of steam sterilization at temperature 121.1&amp;nbsp;°C delivered to a container or unit of product calculated using a z-value of 10&amp;nbsp;°C. The term F-value or "F&lt;sub&gt;Tref/z&lt;/sub&gt;" is defined as the equivalent number of minutes to a certain reference temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;) for a certain control microorganism with an established '''Z-value'''.&lt;ref&gt;Stumbo C.R., Thermobacteriology in Food Processing, 1973. {{ISBN|0080886477}}, 9780080886473&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Z-value''' is a term used in microbial [[thermal death time]] calculations.  It is the number of degrees the temperature has to be increased to achieve a tenfold (i.e. 1 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction in the [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]].  The D-value of an organism is the time required in a given medium, at a given temperature, for a ten-fold reduction in the number of organisms.  It is useful when examining the effectiveness of thermal inactivations under different conditions, for example in food cooking and preservation.  The z-value is a measure of the change of the D-value with varying temperature, and is a simplified version of an [[Arrhenius factor|Arrhenius equation]] and it is equivalent to z=2.303 RT T&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;/E.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth S.D, Aseptic Processing and Packaging of Food Products, 1992.  {{ISBN|185166775X}}, 9781851667758&lt;/ref&gt;

The z-value of an [[organism]] in a particular medium is the [[temperature]] change required for the D-value to change by a factor of ten, or put another way, the temperature required for the [[thermal destruction curve]] to move one [[log reduction value|log cycle]]. It is the reciprocal of the slope resulting from the plot of the logarithm of the [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]] versus the temperature at which the D-value was obtained.  While the [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]] gives the time needed at a certain temperature to kill 90% of the organisms, the z-value relates the resistance of an organism to differing temperatures. The z-value allows calculation of the equivalency of two  thermal processes, if the D-value and the z-value are known.

Example: if it takes an increase of 10&amp;nbsp;°F to move the curve one log, then our z-value is 10. Given a [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]] of 4.5 minutes at 150&amp;nbsp;°F, the D-value can be calculated for 160&amp;nbsp;°F by reducing the time by 1 log. The new D-value for 160&amp;nbsp;°F given the z-value is 0.45 minutes. This means that each 10&amp;nbsp;°F increase in temperature will reduce our D-value by 1 log. Conversely, a 10&amp;nbsp;°F decrease in temperature will increase our D-value by 1 log. So, the D-value for a temperature of 140&amp;nbsp;°F would be 45 minutes.

'''Šokac''' (''Šokački jezik'') was a language listed in Austro-Hungarian censuses. Population censuses performed in [[Austria-Hungary]] recorded the native language of the citizens, whereby Šokac was declared as native language to one part of the population, presumably members of the [[Šokci]] ethnic group.&lt;ref name="talmamedia-bacs-bodrog"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=B%E1cs-Bodrog |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-03-27 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121216114127/http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=B%E1cs-Bodrog |archive-date=2012-12-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1910 census, the speakers of Šokac were recorded in the [[Bács-Bodrog County|Bačka-Bodrog County]], in the municipalities of [[Apatin]], [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]], [[Odžaci]], and [[Bačka Palanka|Palanka]].&lt;ref name="talmamedia-bacs-bodrog"/&gt; Although, not very different from [[Croatian language|Croatian]] or [[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] speech, Šokac could be identified along with Slavonian [[subdialect]] of the ''old-Štokavian'' speech. Today, most of the members of the Šokci community declare themselves as [[Croats]] in the census, and their language as Croatian or Serbian.

==Distribution==

The Slavonian subdialect is spoken by Šokci who live in some parts of [[Slavonia]], [[Bačka]], [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]], [[Syrmia]], in eastern [[Croatia]], northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), and [[Hungary]], as well as in northern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The Slavonian subdialect has mixed [[Ikavian]] and [[Ekavian]] pronunciation. Ikavian accent is predominant in the [[Posavina]], Baranja, Bačka, and in the Slavonian enclave of [[Derventa]] and ''Orašje'', while Ekavian accent is predominant in [[Podravina]]. There are also enclaves of one accent in the territory of the other, as well as mixed Ekavian&amp;ndash;Ikavian and [[Jekavian]]&amp;ndash;Ikavian areas. In some villages in [[Hungary]], the original{{what|date=December 2011}} ''yat'' is preserved. Local variants can widely differ with the degree of neo-Štokavian influence.

The oldest variant of this dialect persisted in some settlements of Sava river valley between Gradiška and Brod: chiefly in [[Davor, Croatia|Davor]], [[Orubica]], ''Siče'', and ''Magić-Mala''. There the terminal ''l'' e.g. in the verb ''nosi'''l''''' has been retained (instead of modern ''nosio'' = ''carried''), and ''pepe'''l''''' instead of new ''pepeo'' (ash). The old group ''"šć"'' is conserved instead of modern ''št'' e.g. '''''šć'''ap'' (not modern ''štap'' = stick), and the archaic accents are often ''terminal'' or penultimate, rarely initial in polysyllabic words. In some villages in the Podravina ''čr'' instead of the usual ''cr'' is preserved, for example in old ''črn'' instead of new ''crn'' (''black''). All these features are usual in [[Chakavian]] and [[Kajkavian]], but rare old-Štokavian dialects also have these features.
