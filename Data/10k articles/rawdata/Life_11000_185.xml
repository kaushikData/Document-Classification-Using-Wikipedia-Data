'''''A-Love''''' is a female Australian-based MC from [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]. Her debut album, ''Ace of Hearts'' was nominated 'Best Urban Release' in the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2008]].&lt;ref name="ARIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/documents/2008ARIAAwardFinalistsAnnounced.pdf|title=Emerging Artists dominate 2008 ARIA Award nominations|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=18 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221024218/http://aria.com.au/documents/2008ARIAAwardFinalistsAnnounced.pdf| archivedate= 21 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
A-Love was born Antonella Formosa in Rome, Italy on 21 March 1983.  Formosa's father, [[Ric Formosa]], a composer/arranger and an original member (lead guitarist) with the Australian band [[Little River Band]] and her mother, Vicki Formosa, was an [[Rhythm &amp; Blues|R&amp;B]] singer.{{quote|My earliest memories are of my Dad carting me around to different studios to these sessions, and playing on pool tables in old studios.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref name="3D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threedworld.com.au/music/features/2007/ALove--From-The-Heart/ |title=A-Love from the heart |publisher=3D World|date=3 December 2007|accessdate=18 December 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
She attended [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] Secondary College, graduating in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://namesdatabase.com/people/FORMOSA/ANTONELLA/63056 |title=Formosa, Antonella |publisher=Names Database |accessdate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714151843/http://namesdatabase.com/people/FORMOSA/ANTONELLA/63056 |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst her first experiences of playing music were with an all-girl band, which never made any public performances,&lt;ref name="3D"/&gt; she also discovered hip hop in high school and soon found herself waxing lyrical over beats.{{quote|Rest assured, if I was a better singer, I'd be a soul singer! [MCing] was just something that I fell in love with in my teens. I've always been heavily into lyricism, no matter what kind of musical style I've been interested in. The fact that hip hop let you just not mince words and be really direct and cram so much more content and originality into your lyrics than singing was the biggest thing for me.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref name="3D"/&gt;}}

In January 2000, Formosa met Draino from the [[Puah Hedz]].  He was keen to check out her writing and despite her reluctance, he made her feature on a track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/ozmusicmonth/s986700.htm  |title=Next Crop Artists (2003) A-Love|publisher=[[Triple J]]|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second track that she had ever recorded was with [[Muph &amp; Plutonic|Muphin]], which later became "Some People" which featured on the album ''Despite the Odds''.&lt;ref name="Heavy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heavyweighttv.com/artists.php?artist=A+-+Love |title=Artist Profile – A-Love |publisher=Heavyweight TV |accessdate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722013050/http://www.heavyweighttv.com/artists.php?artist=A+-+Love |archivedate=22 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since appeared numerous times on [[Triple J]]'s 'The Hip Hop Show', [[3PBS|PBS]]' 'The Formula' (now 'Hittin Switches') and 'Auscultation', [[3RRR|RRR]]'s 'Wordburner' and [[RMIT University]]'s [[Student Youth Network|SRA FM]].  She was progressing towards a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[Anthropology]] from [[La Trobe University]] and for two years she was the co-host of a hip hop radio show at La Trobe University.

May 2002 marked A-Love's official solo introduction to the Australian hip hop and media circles, with her song "Petty" from the album, ''Culture of Kings Volume 2''&lt;ref name="Heavy"/&gt; (the first ever Australian hip hop feature album on Triple J).  "Petty" was put on medium rotation on [[Triple J]].

Formosa was a winner of the [[Nescafe Big Break]] competition in 2002, earning $20,000 with which to start up an independent record label and distribution company, Duality Records. As time progressed, she juggled the twin responsibilities of building a label and working on her own debut as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cache.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=1664302048&amp;page_url=%2f%2fnbb.tekgroup.com.au%2fwinners%2f2002%2fantonella_formosa.asp&amp;page_last_updated=8%2f4%2f2006+5%3a12%3a10+AM&amp;firstName=Antonella&amp;lastName=Formosa|title=Hip Hop Artist's career gets a spin in the right direction|publisher=Zoom Info|date=1 January 2002|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|I really concentrated on getting the admin and strategic side of the label going, but it just proved to be a bit too hard. I knew that it was either gonna be the music that went or the label – which is where we are now.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref name="3D"/&gt;}}

Formosa released her debut album, ''Ace of Hearts'' on 24 November 2007, on Crookneck Records.  The album was produced by BVA (Mnemonic Ascent) with additional beats from [[Suffa]] ([[Hilltop Hoods]]) and Jase. Guests include [[Yungun]] (UK), Raph (Mnemonic Ascent), [[Spikey Tee]] (UK) and emerging indigenous MC Jim Blah.  It was Triple J's 'Album of the Week' just three days after its release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s2099792.htm |title=A-Love : Ace of Hearts|publisher=Triple J|date=26 November 2007|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the 2008 [[ARIA Awards]] in the category of 'Best Urban Release'.&lt;ref name="ARIA"/&gt;{{quote|The minute that I stepped in the studio with BVA I knew the time was right to record this album. I felt hungry and inspired again, it all fell in place. The result is a bunch of songs with lasting sentiment; real stories about real life.|Antonella Formosa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jplay.com.au/JSite/ViewArtist.aspx?ArtistID=3400&amp;ShowFullBio=true|title=A-Love @J Play|publisher=J Play|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She was also nominated for two at the [[Jägermeister]] AIR (Australian Independent Record Labels Association) Awards in 2008, in the categories of 'Best New Independent Artist' and 'Best Independent Hip Hop Artist'.&lt;ref name="AIR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airawards.com.au/nominees/nominees-2008 |title=AIR Award Nominees 2008 |publisher=Australian Independent Record Labels Association |accessdate=18 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126082019/http://www.airawards.com.au/nominees/nominees-2008 |archive-date=26 January 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Billboard.biz|title=Yunupingu Wins AIR Awards Triple|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3iebd6a39896504e50fda355ba222fdf10|date=25 November 2008|accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formosa has performed with Mystik Journeymen (US), [[Anticon]], [[Hilltop Hoods]], [[Pegz]], [[MC Layla]], Kowhai, [[Bliss n Eso]], Scarz on 45, MC Que, [[TZU]], Bias B and DJ Brand (Canada).

'''Abundius and Irenaeus''' (died 258) were [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[martyr]]s during the reign of Roman Emperor Valerian (253-260).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3862/ St. Irenaeus and Abundius] Retrieved on 22 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Their feast in the Roman Martyrology is celebrated on August 26. Abundius also has separate commemorations in [[Augsburg]] and [[Orvieto]].

==Life==
Abundius was a devout [[Christian]] of Rome, and Irenaeus was a sewer-keeper. Together, they buried the body of [[Saint Concordia]]. Saint Concordia was the nurse of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]]. On stating to Valerian the urban prefect that she was a Christian, she was beaten to death, and her body was thrown into the sewer. Irenaeus found the body of St.Concordia and with the help of his colleague Abundius, was able to retrieve it and deliver it to Justinus, who reverently buried her on 25 August in the cemetery of Hippolytus on the Ager Veranus. Her death, however, is commemorated on 22 February in the [[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]], with a clear indication that she was buried in the cemetery of St.Laurence on the [[Via Tiburtina]]. &lt;ref name="Roman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lapidge|first=Michael |date=2018 |title=
The Roman Martyrs: Introduction, Translations, and Commentary|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=1fU-DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA324&amp;ots=OUrdt-WWuD&amp;dq=Abundius%20and%20Irenaeus&amp;hl=ru&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q=Abundius%20and%20Irenaeus&amp;f=false|page=324|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this activity, Irenaeus and Abundius after being reported to the prefect, were thrown into the sewer and suffocated by the orders of Valerian, on 26 August. Their bodies were recovered and buried by Justinus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://daily-prayers.org/saints-library/abundius-and-irenaeus-2/ Abundius and Irenaeus] Retrieved on 22 Mar 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Their story is a part of the cycle of stories of [[Hippolytus of Rome|Lawrence and Hippolytus]], and is generally considered untrustworthy.

==Veneration==
A basilica was erected in their honor near [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]]. Their bodies are buried in the cemetery of [[Cyriaca|Saint Cyriaca]]. They are commemorated on 26 August in the [[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]].&lt;ref name="Roman"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Akiyoshi Umekawa'''|梅川 昭美|Umekawa Akiyoshi|March 1, 1948 – January 28, 1979}} was a Japanese [[mass murder]]er who killed a woman on December 16, 1963, and shot dead four people on January 26, 1979. Mass media also used a number of aliases, including '''Teruyoshi Umekawa''', '''Terumi Umekawa''', '''Akimi Umekawa''' and '''Akemi Umekawa'''. He was one of the rare criminals who was shot dead by Japanese police.

==Early life==
Umekawa was born in [[Ōtake, Hiroshima|Otake]], [[Hiroshima Prefecture]].  He was a great reader and loved [[hardboiled]] fiction. On December 16, 1963, while he was 15 and still a [[minor (law)|minor]], he killed a woman. Although he was a murderer, he was still allowed to have guns because Japanese juvenile law protected his criminal history. He also saw the film ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]''. He wanted to make a big incident 15 years after he committed the first murder.

==Mitsubishi Bank sporting gun kidnapping==
Umekawa shot dead two employees and two policemen on January 26, 1979, in a [[Mitsubishi Bank]] in [[Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka|Sumiyoshi-ku]], [[Osaka]]. He took 40 hostages at the bank. He asked them, "Do you know ''Sodom no Ichi'' (Japanese alternative title of ''Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom'')?" He stripped women of their clothes.

Rokuro Yoshida, who joined criminal investigations of [[Kiyoshi Ōkubo]] and [[United Red Army]], was appointed as the incident commander. "Zero" Company of the 2nd [[Riot Police Unit]] of the Osaka Prefectural Police Headquarters (one of the predecessors of the [[Special Assault Team]]s) were called, which was the first case in the history of Japanese Police Tactical Units. They fatally shot Umekawa on January 28, 1979. Yoshida stated there was no alternative to deadly force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage2.nifty.com/otani-office/flashup/n070522.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709145742/http://homepage2.nifty.com/otani-office/flashup/n070522.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-09 |script-title=ja:口だけ出す人が何より困る |author=[[Akihiro Otani]] |language=Japanese |publisher=Otani Akihiro office |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2008-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
His crime affected Japanese youths. Neko Oikawa said that he was the main reason why she did not have [[Left-wing politics|leftist views]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikawaneko.com/diary/diary28.html |script-title=ja:私の体は脂肪でできてるの |language=Japanese |author=Neko Oikawa |publisher=OIKAWA NEKO OFFICE |date=2004-06-14 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518034053/http://www.oikawaneko.com/diary/diary28.html |archivedate=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the film ''[[Tattoo Ari]]'' was inspired by him, but an alternative name was used for him in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straydog.info/essay/200606_drama.html|script-title=ja:森岡流名前のつけ方|first=Toshiyuki|last=Morioka|language=Japanese|publisher=Straydog|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Fulton''' (died c. 1818) was a [[merchant]], [[Plantations in the American South|planter]], and local [[politician]] originally from [[Washington, Pennsylvania|Washington]], near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] in western [[Pennsylvania]], who in 1805 founded the city of [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], which he named for himself.&lt;ref name=fulton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site23.php|title=Fulton, Alexander|publisher=lahistory.org ([[Louisiana Historical Association]])|accessdate=October 9, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923115526/http://lahistory.org/site23.php|archivedate=2010-09-23|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Louisiana Historical Association uses these sources for its brief biographical sketch of Alexander Fulton: George Mason Graham Stafford, ''The Wells Family and Allied Families'' (1969; reprint ed., 1976); George Mason Graham Stafford, ''Three Pioneer Families of Rapides Parish (1946)''; Clarence Edwin Carter, comp. and ed., ''The Territorial Papers of the United States, IX'' (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

About 1795, Fulton came to Alexandria, the [[County seat|seat of government]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]] and the largest city in [[Central Louisiana]], in partnership with land speculator William Miller. Fulton, who held a land grant from the government of [[Spain]],&lt;ref name=riverfronts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myneworleans.com/Louisiana-Life/July-August-2010/Louisiana-Riverfronts-Alexandria-Pineville/|title=Louisiana Riverfronts: Alexandria-Pineville|publisher=myneworleans.com|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; purchased merchandise and built the first store in Rapides Parish and located it beside the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. On May 4, 1805, he was appointed [[coroner]] of Rapides Parish by then [[Louisiana Territory|territorial]] [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[William C.C. Claiborne]]. He became the area [[postmaster]] during the [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] administration in 1807. In 1805, he laid out the townsite of Alexandria in collaboration with his business partner, Thomas Harris Maddox.&lt;ref name=fulton/&gt;

In 1793, Fulton married the 15-year-old Mary Henrietta Wells, daughter of Samuel Levi Wells, I, and the former Dorcas Huie. Alexander and Mary Fulton had six children: Samuel, Eliza, William, Benjamin, Marcus, and Courtney Ann Fulton.&lt;ref name=fulton/&gt; Mary Wells Fulton was the aunt of later Louisiana Governor [[James Madison Wells]], who was born near Alexandria in 1808. Governor Wells was a son of Samuel Levi Wells, II.

Fulton died in 1818 and is believed to have been interred at Rapides Cemetery in [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]], the smaller city on the eastern side of the Red River. There is no grave marker, so the exact burial site is not known.&lt;ref name=fulton/&gt; His year of death is known because of existing records which show that his estate went through probate in January, 1819.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Supreme Court, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2RYtAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=%22Alexander+Fulton%22+Louisiana+1819&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ovADUaeyNoH88gTJwYFg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alexander%20Fulton%22%20Louisiana%201819&amp;f=false Louisiana Reports: Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court of Louisiana], 1845, Volume IX, page 250&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulton is honored by the naming of Fulton Street and the Fulton Street Bridge, which links [[Louisiana Highway 28]] across the Red River between Alexandria and Pineville. The founder is further recognized by the naming of the 7-story, 163,000 square foot complex, the Alexander Fulton Hotel and Convention Center, located at 701 Fourth Street in the riverfront district. The complex, newly remodeled by Sharpco Construction LLC and reopened in July 2016 as a full service hotel run by Sharpco Hotels LLC [[Holiday Inn]], is near the historic [[Bentley Hotel]], founded in 1907 by a timber magnate, Joseph Bentley.&lt;ref name=riverfronts/&gt;

'''Angelo Hays''' (born ca 1918) was a [[French people|French]] celebrity and inventor. He is best known for having survived a [[premature burial]] for two days.

==Accident and Burial==
In 1937, Hays was involved in a [[motorcycle accident]] in which he was thrown from his vehicle headfirst into a brick wall. The doctors were unable to find a pulse and Hays was declared dead. His face had been so disfigured by the impact that his parents were not allowed to view his body. He was buried three days later in the village of [[Saint-Quentin-de-Chalais|St. Quentin de Chalais]].

Two days after the funeral, when Hays was exhumed for the purposes of an insurance investigation, forensic examiners were surprised to find that the body was still warm. They found that Hays had been in a coma resulting from his head injury; his body’s diminished need for oxygen had allowed him to survive for two days underground.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Kelli|title=4 People Who Were Buried Alive (And How They Got Out)|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/54818/4-people-who-were-buried-alive-and-how-they-got-out|work=mentalfloss|accessdate=18 February 2014|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following several surgeries and rehabilitation, Hays made a complete recovery and went on to become a minor French celebrity. People traveled from afar to speak with him, and in the 1970s he went on tour with a [[security coffin]] he invented, which featuring thick upholstery, a food locker, [[chemical toilet]], library, and radio transmitter.&lt;ref name=marshall /&gt;&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Susan|title=A Fate Worse Than Death|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/0305/193.html|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=5 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''assassination of Taha Carım''', [[Turkish people|Turkish]] diplomat and ambassador to [[Holy See]] took place on 9 June 1977 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

==Background==
The fatal attack on Carım took place two years after the assassination of a Turkish ambassador to Austria, [[Daniş Tunalıgil]] and assassination of a Turkish ambassador to France, [[Ismail Erez]] by Armenian militant organization [[JCAG]].&lt;ref name="terror1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In March 1977, he was already threatened to be killed by Armenian militant groups. Due to earlier attacks on Turkish diplomats resulting in death, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] decided to send security personnel to Turkish diplomatic missions abroad. Some time later, the Ambassador Carım requested the [[Italian police]] to lift the security service. Instead, he sufficed by obtaining a pistol to protect himself.&lt;ref name="terror2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gqUcV87-KvYC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=Taha+Car%C4%B1m&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LZvWT8Ekq9&amp;sig=R9R9O2hROP6G38Ma-qGw9aJTdH8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zfGpTJm7PMGX4Aa7qJ3vDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Taha%20Car%C4%B1m&amp;f=false Sedat Laçiner, ''"Ermeni sorunu, diaspora ve Türk dış politikası''], USAK, 2008, p. 184 {{ISBN|978-605-4030-07-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The attack==
Carım was returning to his residence, and was shot by two unidentified gunmen from front and back having no chance of resistance.&lt;ref name="terror2"/&gt; The responsibility was claimed by JCAG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/turkce/diplomatlar/taha_carim.html TAHA CARIM 9 Haziran 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2016, the papacy finally condemned of the 1977 assassination of Taha Carım in order to resolve a dispute with Turkey about the Armenian genocide. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2016/02/03/turkey-sends-back-recalled-vatican-ambassador Turkey sends back recalled Vatican ambassador]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bahman Jādhūyah/Jādūyah''' (also '''Jādhōē/Jādōē'''; [[New Persian]]: {{lang|fa|بهمن جادویه}}), or '''Bahman Jādhawayh''' ({{lang-ar|بهمن جاذويه}}) (in [[Middle Persian]]: Vahūman Ĵādaggōw) was an Iranian general of the [[Sasanians]]. He had a reputation for being [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab]].&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahman-jaduya ''BAHMAN JĀDŪYA'', M. Morony, '''Encyclopaedia Iranica''']&lt;/ref&gt; He is mostly known to have led the Sasanians to victory against the [[Arabs]] at the [[Battle of the Bridge]]. The Arab Muslims referred to Bahman as ''Dhul Hājib'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ṭabarī|first=Yohanan Friedmann|title=The battle of al-Qādisiyyah and the conquest of Syria and Palestine|year=1992|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj9_SE3_DXkC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=bahman#v=onepage&amp;q=bahman&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7914-0733-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|ar|ذو الحاجب}}, "owner of bushy eyebrows").&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; He is often confused with [[Mardanshah]],&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; another Sasanian general.

== Biography ==
Nothing is known of his early life, but Bahman Jadhuyih is recorded as an old man by 634. Bahman may have been the son of the Sasanian commander [[Hormozd Jadhuyih]]. Bahman is first mentioned in 633, as one of the spokesmen for the Sasanians and a member of the Parsig faction led by [[Piruz Khosrow]].&lt;ref name="Pourshariati 2008, p. 195"&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; In 633, the Sasanian monarch ordered a [[Sasanian]] commander named [[Andarzaghar]] who was in charge of protecting the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]&lt;ref name="Pourshariati 2008, p. 195"/&gt; to protect the western frontiers from the Arabs who were plundering Persia.

In 633, Andarzaghar, along with Bahman Jadhuyih, made a counter-attack against the army of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] at [[Battle of Walaja|Walaja]], but were defeated. After the defeat, Bahman fled to [[Ctesiphon]], where he found Yazdegerd sick. However, Bahman was shortly ordered by the latter to make a counter-attack against the Arabs. Bahman, however, disobeyed the child king and sent Jaban to fight the Arabs instead. Jaban, who was sent alone on the western front to confront the Arabs, was defeated at the [[battle of Ullais]].&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Arabs under [[Abu Ubayd al-Thaqafi|Abu Ubaid]] were making an expedition in the [[Sawad]] in 634, [[Rostam Farrokhzād]] sent Bahman Jadhuyih and [[Jalinus]] against him with a force from the powerful [[Wuzurgan]] class, who had units such as [[Persian war elephants|war elephants]] and the [[Zhayedan]]. Rostam is known to have told Bahman that: "if Jalinus returns to the like of his defeat, then cut off his head."&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

During the battle, known as the [[Battle of the Bridge]], the army of Bahman had an advantage: the elephants in his army frightened the Arabs' horses, and which later resulted in the death of Abu Ubaid. The bridge was then broken by an Arab, and around 4,000 Arabs died by drowning and many others were killed by the Bahman's forces. [[Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha|Al-Muthanna]] managed to flee from the bridge and rally 3,000 Arab survivors; however, some of them fled back to [[Medina]]. Bahman did not pursue the fleeing Arab army.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Nelson Frye, ''The Cambridge History of Iran: The period from the Arab invasion to the Saljuqs'', Cambridge University Press, 1975. (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt; In 636 during the [[Battle of al-Qadisiyyah]] Bahman was killed by [[Al-Qa'qa' ibn 'Amr al-Tamimi|Qa’qa ibn Amr]] in revenge for the death of Abu Ubaid and the others killed at the Battle of the Bridge.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt;

{{History of São Tomé and Príncipe}}
The '''Batepá massacre''' occurred on 3 February 1953 in [[São Tomé]] when hundreds of native [[Creole peoples#Portuguese Africa|creoles]] known as ''[[Forro Creole|forros]]'' were massacred by the colonial administration and Portuguese landowners. Many ''forros'' believed the government intended to force them to work as contract laborers, to which they objected. In response, the governor blamed the unrest on [[communist]]s and ordered the military to round up such individuals and for civilians to protect themselves. This quickly turned into a bloodbath, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of ''forros''. No communist conspiracy was ever proven.

== Background ==
[[Carlos Gorgulho]] assumed office as governor in 1945.  At the time [[São Tomé Island]] was one of the world's largest producers of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]].  Large plantations, called ''[[roças]]'', occupied the majority of the island's farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Excorcising Devils from the Throne: Sao Tome and Principe|last=Francisco|first=Alberto da Boa Morte|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-0-87586-846-2|location=New York, NY|pages=25|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''roças'' operated as a quasi-feudal system using contract laborers (''serviçais'') from mainland Africa and [[Cape Verde]]. The ''forros'' had always refused manual field work on the estates, since they considered it slave labor. In Gorgulho's assessment the economic modernization policies of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese ''Estado Novo'' regime]] required breaking São Tomé's dependence on contract laborers from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keese|first=Alexander|year=2011|title=Early Limits of Local Decolonization in São Tomé and Príncipe: From Colonial Abuses to Postcolonial Disappointment, 1945—1976|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=44|issue=3|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To accomplish this Gorgulho implemented policies to make it easier for ''serviçais'' to return home while at the same time improving conditions on the ''roças'', which he hoped would attract local labor.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|pp=66–67}} He also introduced measures targeting the livelihood of the ''forros'' such as prohibiting the sale of palm wine and the locally produced gin and raising the poll tax from 30 to 90 escudos; Gorgulho believed these measures would result in the ''forros'' taking up wage labor on the roças.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|pp=66–67}}

Gorgulho also faced a shortage of labor to carry out his public works and construction projects.  The colonial administration used police raids to kidnap people for [[forced labor]] gangs to carry out much of this work.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|p=70}}

Faced with widespread labor shortages, in 1952 the colonial administration proposed settling fifteen thousand people from Cape Verde on São Tomé; then in January 1953 rumors spread that the government would seize the land of the ''forros'' to give to newly arrived Cape Verdians and compel the ''forros'' to work as contract labor.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|pp=71–72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Last Empire: Thirty Years of Portuguese Decolonization|last=Lloyd-Jones|first=Stewart|publisher=Intellect|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=38–39|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, 1953, hand-written pamphlets appeared in São Tomé threatening to kill anyone who contracted ''forros'' as laborers.  The government responded with on official declaration: "The government has been informed that individuals who are hostile towards the present policy, known as communists, are spreading tendentious rumors to the effect that the creoles are to be obliged to contract themselves for the work on the ''roças''  like ''serviçais.'' The government declares that no creole should give credit to these rumors, but should report such individuals to the police.  Thus, the government which has the obligation to protect the creoles, as it has always demonstrated, guarantees them that it will never agree to authorize such contracts."{{sfn|Seibert|2005|p=72}}  Crowds of protestors gathered on February 3 and the police killed one of them, Manuel da Conceição Soares.  His death precipitated a large protest in Trindade the following day.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|p=72}}

== The massacres ==
Gorgulho informed colonists and the administration that a communist rebellion was in the offing and he issued a call for all white colonists to take up arms to protect themselves and white women.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|pp=73–74}} Militias were quickly formed and some Cape Verdians responded to the call-to-arms.  In addition, planters mobilized Angolan and Mozambican workers.  Over the next few days the militias and colonial government killed hundreds of ''forros''.&lt;ref name="Gallet"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTXV9ZCknwkC&amp;pg=PA61|title=São Tomé et Principe: Les îles du milieu du monde|last=Gallet|first=Dominique|date=2008-01-01|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|year=|isbn=9782811100254|location=|pages=61–63|language=fr|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-eight people were suffocated in a cell by the local police, the ''Corpo de Polícia Indígena'' (CPI, Indigenous Police Corps); on one estate, twenty people were burned to death.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|pp=73–74}}  The authorities subjected prisoners to torture using electricity and scores of prisoners died as a result of torture, beatings, and forced labor.&lt;ref name="Gallet"/&gt;  The authorities dumped many bodies into the sea.  "Throw this shit into the sea to avoid troubles," Gorgulho is quoted as advising.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|p=78}}

== Aftermath ==
On March 4 members of the Portuguese [[PIDE|International and State Defense Police]] arrived to conduct an investigation into the alleged communist conspiracy.  They quickly concluded there was no such conspiracy and, in April, [[Manuel Sarmento Rodrigues|Sarmento Rodrigues]], the [[Ministry of the Overseas (Portugal)|Minister of Overseas Territories]], ordered Gorgulho to return to Lisbon.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|pp=81–825}}  He was promoted to the rank of general and praised by the Minister of the Army, General Abranches Pinto, for his actions.  Seven ''forros'' were tried and convicted for the killing of two police officers.{{sfn|Seibert|2005|pp=81–825}} It marked the rise of the independence movement in [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe]], and is commemorated annually as a national holiday (''Dia de Mártires da Liberdade'') on February 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stp-press.st/2018/02/02/sao-tome-principe-um-3-fevereiro-65o-aniversario-do-massacre-1953/ São-Tomé e Príncipe recorda mais um 3 Fevereiro, o 65º aniversário do Massacre de 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biblical Theological Seminary''' is an [[interdenominational]] [[graduate school]] of [[theology]] known for its [[missional]] emphasis. Biblical is currently located in [[Hatfield, Pennsylvania]] (a suburb of Philadelphia) at the former Hatfield High School campus. In May 2018 it announced that it will change its name to '''Missio Seminary''' (effective October 2018) and relocate to a new facility in the [[Logan Square, Philadelphia|Logan Square]] neighborhood of Philadelphia (in January 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BiblicalSeminary/videos/772460476276053/|title=A New Place and a New Name|last=|first=|date=May 16, 2018|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Biblical Seminary was founded in 1971 as the Biblical School of Theology by [[Jack W. Murray]], president of [[Bible Evangelism, Inc.]] and founder of the now-closed [[Clearwater Christian College]], and [[Allan MacRae|Allan A. MacRae]], a former president of [[Faith Theological Seminary]], who served as the seminary's first president.&lt;ref&gt;"History," [http://www.biblical.edu/pages/discover/history.htm www.bibical.edu], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328195358/http://www.biblical.edu/pages/discover/history.htm|date=March 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblical.edu/about-bts/about-bts/our-heritage|title=Honoring Our Heritage {{!}} Biblical Seminary|website=www.biblical.edu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former E.B. Laudenslager public school  in Hatfield, Pennsylvania was renovated to house the new school. In 1978 the name was changed to Biblical Theological Seminary.

[[Frank A. James, III]] was inaugurated as Biblical's fourth president in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/RO/20130630/NEWS01/130639962|title=Biblical Seminary in Hatfield Borough transitioning to new president|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; James previously served as provost of [[Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary]] and president of [[Reformed Theological Seminary]].

==Academics==
The seminary received regional [[school accreditation|accreditation]] from the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msche.org/institutions_view.asp?idinstitution=37|title=Middle States Commission on Higher Education|last=Ltd.|first=Info724|website=www.msche.org|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ats.edu/member-schools/biblical-theological-seminary|title=Biblical Theological Seminary {{!}} The Association of Theological Schools|website=www.ats.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seminary offers the [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.), [[Master of Divinity]] (M.Div.), [[Master of theology|Master of Theology]] (Th.M) and [[Doctor of Ministry]] (D.Min.) degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblical.edu/academic-programs-degree-landing|title=All Programs Available at Biblical Seminary|website=www.biblical.edu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certificate programs are also offered, as well as online courses.

A '''biconcave disc''' is a geometric shape resembling an [[oblate spheroid]] with two concavities on the top and on the bottom.

==Biology==
[[Erythrocytes]] are in the shape of a biconcave disc. It has been suggested that this shape is optimal for surface area to volume ratio, but this hypothesis has not been widely accepted. In addition, it has been suggested that the biconcave shape is needed to optimise the blood's flow properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uzoigwe |first1=Chika |title=The human erythrocyte has developed the biconcave disc shape to optimise the flow properties of the blood in the large vessels |journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=1159–63 |year=2006 |pmid=16797867 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.11.047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Biconcave shape of the red blood cells.
Mammalian red blood cells also known as erythrocyte are a cellular component of the blood which give the blood its characteristic red color and transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Mature red blood cells are round and biconcave because they lack a nucleus and unlike other cells, red cells require a small amount of oxygen for its metabolism and most oxygen is freed into the tissues. The absence of nucleus, ribosomes, and mitochondria partly contributes to the red blood cell’s disc-like structure which leaves room for hundreds of millions of hemoglobin molecules found within the cells. Hemoglobin is a red and iron-rich protein that merges with oxygen to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Both sides of the cell surface bend inwards similar to the inner part of a sphere. 
The biconcave shape enhances the red blood cell’s ability to maneuver through small blood vessels to transport oxygen to tissues and organs. The distinctive biconcave form also enhances the flow properties of blood in the major vessels. It minimizes platelet scatter and heightens laminar flow, which quells their atherogenic action in those major vessels. Erythrocytes, therefore, increase their applying exterior by assuming a cigar form, where they resourcefully release their oxygen load. The unique and flexible disc structure of red blood cell also helps increase the surface area to volume ratio of the tiny cells which enables oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to easily diffuse across the cell’s plasma membrane.

'''William Edward George Bassett''' (8 June 1912 – 1977) was a Welsh professional [[Association football|footballer]]. During his career, he made over 200 appearances in the [[Football League]] in spells with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

==Career==
Bassett began his career at [[Aberaman Athletic F.C.|Aberaman Athletic]] before moving on to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in 1933. He only spent a single season at Wolves, without making a first team appearance, before returning to Wales and signing for manager [[Ben Watts-Jones]] at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. He made his debut on the opening day of the 1934–35 season during a 2–1 victory over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and was a virtual ever present in his four years, scoring two goals for the Bluebirds, against [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] and [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].

He joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 1938 but the outbreak of [[World War II]] interrupted his spell at the [[London]] side and he served in the [[Welsh Guards]] during the hostilities. He finished his league career after three years with the club and took over as player-manager of [[Porthmadog F.C.|Porthmadog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Who's Who of Cardiff City | first = Dean | last = Hayes | publisher = Breedon Books | year = 2006 | p=19 | location=Derby | isbn= 1-85983-462-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biocomplexity''' is the study of complex structures and behaviors that arise from nonlinear interactions of active biological agents, which may range in scale from molecules to cells to organisms. Almost every biological system exhibits complexity - [[emergent properties]] where the ensemble possesses capabilities that its individual agents lack. Classical examples of biocomplexity include the behavior of [[molecular motor]]s during [[DNA transcription]], genetic and metabolic networks within cells, the interacting [[Cytoskeleton#The Eukaryotic Cytoskeleton|filament]]s of the [[cytoskeleton]], which allow the cell to move, the differentiation, organization and movement of cells during embryonic development, the function of the networks of neurons which compose the brain and the schooling of fish or birds. 

Primarily as a result of funding policy changes at the American [[National Science Foundation]] around 2000, some researchers have begun to use the term biocomplexity in a narrower sense to denote the [[complexity|complex]] behavioral, biological, social, chemical, and physical [[interaction]]s of [[life|living]] [[organism]]s with their [[natural environment|environment]]. This relatively new subfield of biocomplexity encompasses other domains such as [[biodiversity]] and [[ecology]].

Biocomplexity research aims to provide quantitative models of complex biological phenomena both to understand them in their own right and to interpret and guide quantiative biomedical experimentation.

[[Kluwer]] planned to publish a journal called ''Biocomplexity''. A disappointingly low number of submitted manuscripts resulted in the publisher cancelling the journal's launch issue.

On February 27, 2012, a shooting took place at [[Chardon High School]] in [[Chardon, Ohio]], in which three students died within two days of the incident. Two other students were hospitalized, one of whom sustained several serious injuries requiring extensive rehabilitation, and the other suffered a minor injury. The seriously injured victim has since been declared permanently paralyzed. A sixth student sustained a superficial wound.

While rumors of a warning of the event having been posted on the Internet circulated, student witnesses identified the shooter as Thomas "T. J." Lane III, a 17-year-old male.&lt;ref name=IBT /&gt; Although police were initially hesitant to publicly identify the juvenile after he was apprehended, by the evening of February 28, authorities confirmed that the suspect was Lane.

The weapon Lane used in the shooting was a .22 caliber handgun.  At an initial court hearing, the prosecutor revealed that he admitted to shooting 10 rounds of ammunition from the gun during the shooting, which began in the school cafeteria at approximately 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., shortly after school started. Although Lane told police that he did not know the victims and that they were chosen randomly, witnesses stated that it appeared he targeted a specific student and the group he was sitting with in the cafeteria.

After the shooting occurred, Lane reportedly left the building. Witnesses stated he was chased from the building by a teacher, and was arrested a short time later outside the school. Lane was ultimately indicted on three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated attempted murder, and one count of felonious assault. He was initially detained as a juvenile pending further court action.

Reaction to the event prompted a statement from [[List of Governors of Ohio|Ohio Governor]], [[John Kasich]]. Several prayer vigils were held and a fund for the victims was established. Thousands of people attended one of the vigils, at which the Governor spoke, the night after the attack. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] gave his condolences to the school principal in a telephone call following the incident. Analysis of the crime and comparisons to similar attacks began immediately following the shooting.

In May 2012, a judge determined that Lane was competent to stand trial.&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufman|first1=Tina|title=Judge rules TJ Lane competent to stand trial in Chardon shooting|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/oh-geauga/judge-rules-tj-lane-competent-to-stand-trial-in-chardon-shooting|accessdate=October 5, 2014|publisher=Scripps TV Station Group|date=May 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225215306/http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/oh-geauga/judge-rules-tj-lane-competent-to-stand-trial-in-chardon-shooting#|archive-date=February 25, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that month the decision was made to charge Lane [[Trial as an adult|as an adult]].&lt;ref name=CanigliaPD&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caniglia|first1=John|title=T.J.

On September 11, 2014, Lane, along with two other inmates, escaped from [[Allen Correctional Institution]] in [[Lima, Ohio]].  He was recaptured the following day.

There were rumors that there had been a warning about the shooting posted on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=IBT /&gt; News agencies published excerpts from the [[Facebook]] profile of a boy named "T. J. Lane". The profile did not give a location but several of the user's friends were listed as being from Chardon.&lt;ref name=IBT /&gt; One entry in particular, dated December 30, 2011, caught attention, especially the last line, which read: "Die, all of you."&lt;ref name=GlobalGrind&gt;[http://globalgrind.com/news/tj-lane-alleged-gunmen-chardon-high-school-shooting-letter-die-all-you-details "'Die, All Of You' T.J.

===Reactions of friends===
A friend of Lane described him as "just a very normal teenage boy".&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite news| last=Pearson| first=Michael|title=One dead, four hurt in Ohio high school shooting| url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/27/justice/ohio-school-shooting/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=February 27, 2012|date=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also told [[CNN]] that she was in "complete shock" from the incident, and that Lane often had a sad look in his eyes, but came across as completely normal.&lt;ref name=Pearson /&gt; Another friend said that Lane was regularly teased at school, which made Lane "put a wall around himself" and refuse to divulge personal information.&lt;ref name=Pearson /&gt; A third student told reporters that Lane had come from "a really broken-down home", and was a quiet person who could be nice to others if he felt comfortable with them.&lt;ref name=IBT /&gt;

Students at Lake Academy denied that he had been bullied. They described him as friendly and nice, but not very talkative.&lt;ref name=Caniglia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glasier /&gt;

After Lane's arrest, law enforcement determined that the gun used in the shooting was purchased legally. Authorities said Lane had stolen the .22-caliber handgun from his uncle.&lt;ref name="CNN Wire Staff"&gt;{{cite news|author = CNN Wire Staff | title=Prosecutor: Suspect admitted to shootings at school|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/28/justice/ohio-school-shooting/index.html| work=CNN.com |accessdate=February 28, 2012|date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press reported that it was a [[Ruger MK III|Ruger MK III Target]] [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 caliber]] [[semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]] [[handgun]].&lt;ref name=Horton2 /&gt; However, a neighbor who was close to the family said that it was a target [[revolver]] that belonged to the boy's grandfather.&lt;ref name=Nicas&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicas|first=Jack|title=Third Teen Dead in School Attack| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204653604577250930031134726 |work= The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 7, 2012|date=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how it was possible to fire as many as ten or more rounds from a revolver in quick succession, the neighbor had no explanation and eventually admitted that the revolver hypothesis was probably not true after all. Reports were that the shooter dropped the gun as he fled from the scene. It was found inside the school and recovered by police. Lane also admitted to taking a knife into Chardon High School.&lt;ref name="CNN Wire Staff"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicas/&gt;

===Suspect's prior offenses===
On February 29, 2012, Timothy J. Grendell, the juvenile court judge presiding over Lane's case, allowed the release of the suspect's juvenile records to the press. According to his records, Lane was arrested twice in December 2009. The first time, Lane restrained his uncle while his cousin hit him. The other case involved Lane hitting another boy in the face.&lt;ref name=focus&gt;{{cite web| last=Glasier|first=David|title=T.J.

==Trial==
On February 28, 2012, at 3:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. (EST), a detention hearing was held for the suspect at [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga County]] [[Juvenile Court]] in Chardon. According to the ''LA Times'', in the United States teenage suspects are generally treated as juveniles until prosecutors decide to charge them as  adults.&lt;ref name=Stanburn&gt;{{cite web| last=Stanburn |first=Samatha|title=Chardon school shootings: Third student dies| url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120228/chardon-school-shooting-tj-lane-court| work= Global Post|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Tim Grendell]] began the proceeding by asking the media not to take photographs of the defendant until it was determined whether or not he would be tried as an adult.&lt;ref name=3rd /&gt; He immediately ruled that the defendant would remain in custody. At the prosecutor's request, the judge directed that the attorneys involved in the case refrain from speaking to the media regarding the proceeding.&lt;ref name=Begos&gt;{{cite web |last=Begos |first=Kevin |title=Prosecutor: School shooter chose random victims |url=http://www.fox10tv.com/dpps/news/national/midwest/court-hearing-tuesday-for-suspect-in-ohio-shooting-nt12-jgr_4086902 |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=February 28, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then outlined conditions under which the media could participate, including not taking any facial photographs of the defendant or his family.  After hearing the prosecutor's argument for continuing the detention and receiving no objection, the judge ruled that detention, at the Portage-Geauga Juvenile Detention Center in [[Ravenna, Ohio]], should continue for 15 days.&lt;ref name=Farkas&gt;{{cite web|last=Farkas|first=Karen|title=T.J. Lane, Ohio school shooting suspect, chose victims at random, prosecutor says| url=http://www.cleveland.com/chardon-shooting/index.ssf/2012/02/tj_lane_suspect_in_shootings_a.html |work= The Plain Dealer |publisher=Cleveland Live LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues of arraignment and possible transfer to adult court were put off to future dates. The judge stated that the prosecution had until March 1, 2012, to file charges.&lt;ref name=Begos /&gt;

After the hearing, prosecutor [[David Joyce (politician)|Dave Joyce]] indicated that he would attempt to try Lane as an adult and file three counts of [[Murder#Aggravating circumstances|aggravated murder]], among other charges, for the incident.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt;  It was revealed at the hearing that Lane admitted to shooting 10 rounds of ammunition during the incident.  He also told the police that he did not know the victims and that they were selected randomly.&lt;ref name=Begos /&gt;&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt; However, a witness who said he knew the shooter indicated that Lane knew several of the victims.&lt;ref name=Farkas /&gt;

Outside defense attorneys observing the hearing questioned whether Lane's attorney was protecting his client's rights.&lt;ref name=RDrissel /&gt; First, a concern was raised that Lane's attorney agreed with the judge that the gag order would not go into effect until after the press conference that prosecutor Joyce held following the hearing.  One lawyer explained that this exception to the order gave the prosecution the opportunity to announce the defendant's confession publicly, thus influencing the jury pool.&lt;ref name=RDrissel /&gt;  A second concern regarded Joyce's statement at the conference that Lane "is someone who's not well."&lt;ref name=RDrissel /&gt;  Ian Friedman, a criminal attorney and past president of the [[Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]] said that such things are generally said by defense attorneys. Another attorney said that in this case, he would file a motion which would ensure that the juvenile's mental health would be evaluated before the case was brought to the adult court. As of March 1, 2012, Lane's defense had filed no motions.&lt;ref name=RDrissel /&gt;

On March 1, 2012, prosecutors formally charged Lane with three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated attempted murder, and one count of felonious assault.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite web| last=Stern|first=Andrew|title=Suspect in Ohio school shooting charged with murder| work= Reuters.com|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS2&gt;{{cite news| title= Ohio teen TJ Lane charged with 3 juvenile counts of aggravated murder in school shootings| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57388888-504083/ohio-teen-tj-lane-charged-with-3-juvenile-counts-of-aggravated-murder-in-school-shootings/|publisher=CBS News| accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane did not enter a plea when he was arraigned on March 6.  Two additional defense attorneys were assigned to the case in March,&lt;ref name=CBSInteractive&gt;{{cite news| title=Ohio teen TJ Lane in court over shooting deaths|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57391782/ohio-teen-tj-lane-in-court-over-shooting-deaths/| work= CBS News | publisher= CBS Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the judge postponed the decision to try Lane as an adult until after a competency evaluation was completed.&lt;ref name=APComp&gt;{{cite news|title=Competency exam for Ohio school shooting suspect| url= http://www.fresnobee.com/2012/03/28/2778498/competency-exam-for-ohio-school.html#storylink=cpy| work=fresnobee.com| agency=Associated Press| accessdate= April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 9, Lane again appeared before Judge Grendell who set the date for a competency hearing for May 2.  He also scheduled a hearing for May 12 to determine whether the defendant would be tried as an adult.&lt;ref name=HPComphearing&gt;{{cite news|title=T.J. Lane To Undergo Competency Test Before Ohio School Shooting Trial| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/09/tj-lane-competency-test_n_1413579.html| work= The Huffington Post |accessdate=April 11, 2012|first=Michael|last=McLaughlin|date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competency evaluation might have been requested by either the prosecution or the defense.  It was speculated by one observing attorney that the judge might have made the decision himself.  According to Ohio law, "a child may be found competent only if able to grasp the seriousness of the charges, if able to understand the court proceedings, if able to aid in the defense and if able to understand potential consequences.  The law says a child with a mental illness or an intellectual or developmental disability may not be found competent."&lt;ref name=APComp /&gt;

The competency hearing was held on May 2, 2012.  Testimony was given by psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick.  Resnick testified that Lane was mentally ill.  He said the defendant was suffering from psychosis that caused hallucinations and loss of contact with reality, but "does not interfere with Lane's ability to understand the charges against him."&lt;ref name=Kaufman/&gt; Judge Grendell determined at this hearing that Lane was competent to stand trial.&lt;ref name=Kaufman/&gt;

In June 2012, it was determined that Lane would be tried as an adult. He was indicted on the six charges that were filed earlier in March: three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of felonious assault. On June 8, he pleaded not guilty to those charges. His bail was set at $1 million, and he was scheduled to be transferred from the juvenile detention center to county jail on June 18.&lt;ref name=Muscal&gt;{{cite news| last= Muscal |first=Michael|title=Ohio school shooting suspect pleads not guilty in 3 deaths| url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-teen-shooting-20120608,0,5185518.story| work=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=June 8, 2012| date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 20, a motion was filed with the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas stating that if someone were to pay a $120 fee, he could remain in the Portage-Geauga County Juvenile Detention Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_geauga/attorney-someones-paying-for-chardon-shooting-suspect-to-stay-at-juvenile-facility |title=Attorney: Someone's paying for Chardon shooting suspect to stay at juvenile facility |website=Newsnet5.com |date=June 20, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924022342/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_geauga/attorney-someones-paying-for-chardon-shooting-suspect-to-stay-at-juvenile-facility# |archive-date=September 24, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2013, Lane pleaded guilty to the charges for which he had been indicted.&lt;ref name= "Caniglia: sentenced"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cleveland.com/chardon-shooting/index.ssf/2013/03/tj_lane_sentenced_in_chardon_h.html |title= T.J.

===Students return to school===
On March 2, 2012, the students entering the building received a warm welcoming. A student from [[West Geauga High School]], her mother, and neighbour organised the "Line Up At Chardon" event via Facebook. They welcomed the students of Chardon high school back into the school building with a giant sign that says "[[I'll Stand By You]]" referencing the song by [[The Pretenders]]. More than 100 children from the surrounding school districts, including West Geauga, came to show support. Also, the students of Chardon High School and their parents attended a "walk through" of the school. The senior class officers organised a procession from Chardon Square to the school that morning. The organizers invited participation in the {{convert|0.75|mi|km|3|abbr=on}} walk on Facebook; the day before the activity, over 225 students had shown interest in participating.&lt;ref name= walk&gt;{{cite web|first= John| last=Horton|title=Chardon High School students to walk together back to school this morning|url=http://www.cleveland.com/chardon-shooting/index.ssf/2012/02/chardon_high_school_student_to.html|work=Cleveland.com; The Plain Dealer|accessdate=March 2, 2012| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WOIO&gt;{{cite web|title=Chardon students march in solidarity back to high school| work=Action News|publisher=WorldNow and WOIO| url= http://www.woio.com/story/17024182/breaking-chardon|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes resumed the next day. The cafeteria, where the shooting took place, was repainted and reorganised. The table where most of the victims were sitting at the time of the attack remained in place, however, as "a counterpoint to the way the other tables are arranged". The table was covered with flowers and stuffed animals.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Ohio high schoolers head back to class after fatal shooting|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/02/justice/ohio-school-shooting/index.html|work=CNN Justice|publisher=Cable News Network.

===Funerals and protest===
On March 2, 2012, [[WEWS-TV]] reported that Fred Phelps, Jr., whose [[Fred Phelps|father]] founded the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] (WBC), had posted on Twitter that the WBC was planning to "street-preach" about the Ohio shooting "regarding God's hand, judgments and vengeance in this affair."&lt;ref name=MWaterhouse&gt;{{cite web|last=Waterhouse|first=Mike|title=Chardon supporters to create human barricade against Westboro funeral protesters|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_geauga/chardon-supporters-to-create-human-barricade-against-westboro-funeral-protesters|work=newsnet5.com|publisher=Scripps TV Station Group|access-date=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145000/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_geauga/chardon-supporters-to-create-human-barricade-against-westboro-funeral-protesters#|archive-date=March 4, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Twitter post from a member of the church said the group would protest Daniel Parmertor's funeral. In response, Chardon resident Alex Pavlick sent out a request on Facebook for people to join him in forming a barricade around St. Mary's Church, where the funeral was to be held on March 3, if the WBC showed up to protest. He wrote that he wanted to ensure the funeral was not ruined by "a group of extremists."&lt;ref name=MWaterhouse /&gt; By the time the story was posted on the television station's web site, 1600 people had agreed to join Alex in his counter-protest. The day of the funeral, the television station reported that a human barricade consisting of thousands had readied, but the WBC protestors did not come.&lt;ref name=Byrne&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Kristin|title=Thousands form human barricade outside Chardon church to protect Parmertor family from protestors|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_geauga/thousands-form-human-barricade-outside-chardon-church-to-protect-parmertor-family-from-protestors|work=newsnet5.com|publisher=Scripps TV Station Group|accessdate=March 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145015/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_geauga/thousands-form-human-barricade-outside-chardon-church-to-protect-parmertor-family-from-protestors|archive-date=March 4, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after Parmertor's funeral, Demetrius Hewlin's funeral was held, also at St. Mary's.

==2014 escape from prison==
At 7:38&amp;nbsp;p.m on September 11, 2014, eight days before his 20th birthday, Lane escaped from [[Allen Correctional Institution]] in [[Lima, Ohio]], along with two other inmates. The three inmates escaped using a makeshift ladder to scale a fence during recreation hours.&lt;ref name="wkz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/northeast-ohio/2014/09/11/tj-lane-escape/15485863/ | title=CAPTURED {{!}} Chardon shooter T.J.

Lane and the other inmate, identified as 45-year-old Clifford Opperud of [[Carlisle, Ohio]],&lt;ref name=Escapes&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/951282-t-j-lane-escapes-chardon-high-school-shooter-clifford-e-opperud-leave-prison-photo/ |title=TJ Lane Escapes: Chardon High School Shooter Thomas Michael Lane and Clifford E Opperud Leave Prison (Photos); No Word from Parents| work=[[Epoch Times]]|first= Jack |last= Phillips|date= 11 September 2014| accessdate= 26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was serving a 12-year sentence for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and kidnapping, remained at large. Police conducted searches at a wooded area and a residential neighborhood near the prison, and considered him and Opperud as "potentially armed and dangerous". Nearby residents were advised to lock their doors and stay inside their homes. Dina Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's mother, reacted to the escape, saying, "I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic stricken. I can't believe it."

At 1:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. the following day, Lane was captured near the woods, followed by Opperud over three hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.19actionnews.com/story/26513962/tj-lane-arrested |publisher= WorldNow and WOIO |title= BREAKING: TJ Lane captured| website=19ActionNews.com | date= 12 September 2014| accessdate= 26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chardon High School was closed that same day and counselors were made available to students and staff.

[[File:Connecticut quarter, reverse side, 1999.jpg|thumb|right|167px|The Charter Oak on the 50 States Series Connecticut quarter]]

The '''Charter Oak''' was an unusually large [[white oak]] [[tree]] growing on Wyllys Hyll in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]] in the [[United States]], from around the 12th or 13th century until it fell during a storm in 1856. According to tradition, [[Connecticut Constitutional History#The Connecticut Charter of 1662|Connecticut's Royal Charter of 1662]] was hidden within the hollow of the tree to thwart its confiscation by the English governor-general. The oak became a symbol of American independence and is commemorated on the Connecticut [[50 State Quarters|State Quarter]].  In 1935, for Connecticut's tercentennial, it was also depicted on both a commemorative [[half dollar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://earlycommemorativecoins.com/1935-connecticut-tercentenary-half-dollar/ 1935 Connecticut Tercentenary Half Dollar]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[postage stamp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usstampstories.com/us-stamps-1935/connecticut-charter-oaks-stamp.html Connecticut Tercentenary / Charter Oaks Stamp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer Adrian [[Adriaen Block|Block]] described a tree at the future site of Hartford in his log in 1614 which is understood to be this one. In the 1630s, a delegation of local Native Americans is said to have approached Samuel Wyllys, the early settler who owned and cleared much of the land around it, encouraging its preservation and describing it as planted ceremonially, for the sake of peace, when their tribe first settled in the area.

{{quote|text=It has been the guide of our ancestors for centuries as to the time of planting our corn; when the leaves are the size of a mouse's ears, then is the time to put the seed into the ground.&lt;ref name=Keeler&gt;{{cite book| last =Keeler

===Charter Oak incident===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
The name "Charter Oak" stems from the local legend in which a cavity within the tree was used in late 1687 as a hiding place for the Charter of 1662. 

This much regarding the charter is history:
* [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the [[Connecticut Colony]] an unusual degree of autonomy in 1662.
* His successor [[James II of England|James II]] consolidated several colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]] in 1686, in part to take firmer control of them.
* He appointed Sir [[Edmund Andros]] as governor-general over it, who stated that his appointment had invalidated the charters of the various constituent colonies. He went to each colony to collect their charters, presumably seeing symbolic value in physically reclaiming the documents.
* Andros arrived in Hartford late in October 1687, where his mission was at least as unwelcome as it had been in the other colonies.

According to the dominant tradition, Andros demanded the document and it was produced, but the lights were suddenly doused during ensuing discussion. The [[parchment]] was spirited out a window and thence to the Oak by Captain Joseph Wadsworth, ancestor of [[Elijah Wadsworth]].

Two documents{{cn|date=August 2016}} raise less dramatic possibilities, one contemporaneous and one from early in the next century, by suggesting that a parchment copy had been made of the true charter as early as June, in anticipation of Andros's arrival:
* It has been suggested that the copy was surreptitiously substituted for the original and the original secreted in the oak lest Andros find it in any search of buildings, and that Andros left believing that he had succeeded.
* Logically, such a copy (whether hidden in the oak or not) might instead have been the one kept, for the value it might have in [[propaganda]], for [[morale]], or in [[petition]]ing for its reinstatement.

The Museum of Connecticut History (a subdivision of the [[Connecticut State Library]]) credits the idea that Andros never got the original charter, and displays a parchment that it regards as the original.  (The [[Connecticut Historical Society]] is said{{by whom?|date=August 2015}} to possess a "fragment" of it.)

Andros was overthrown in Boston two years later in the [[1689 Boston revolt]].  The Dominion of New England was then dissolved.

==Relics==

[[File:Charter Oak Chair, made from the historical Charter Oak Tree, Hartford, Conn (68389).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Charter Oak Chair shown on a postcard]]

The oak was blown down in a violent storm on August 21, 1856 and timber from it was made into a number of chairs now displayed in the Hartford Capitol Building.  The desk of the Governor of Connecticut and the chairs for the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate in the state capitol were made from wood salvaged from the Charter Oak.

A wooden baseball made from the Charter Oak was presented by the Charter Oak Engine Co. No. 1 on September 20, 1860 to the Charter Oak Base Ball Club of Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Herald|date=September 21, 1860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New London Historical Society has a pair of cufflinks made from the wood of the Charter Oak with the initial "G" donated by Samuel Goldsmith.

[[Scion (grafting)|Scions]] of the tree still grow in Hartford and many other towns around Connecticut.

The '''Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies''' (Instituttet for Fremtidsforskning) is Denmark's and one of Scandinavia's largest [[Futures Studies]] think tanks. It was founded in 1970 by Professor [[Thorkil Kristensen]], former [[OECD]] Secretary-General, [[Finance Minister of Denmark|Danish Minister of Finance]] and member of the [[Club of Rome]]. It is a non-profit think tank and its mission was from the outset to help Danish organizations (public and private) understand and plan for the [[trend estimation|trends]] that are shaping their long-term future. Today it is an international think tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cifs.dk/en/omcifs.asp About The Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808153749/http://www.cifs.dk/en/omcifs.asp |date=2007-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's research covers a wide variety of topics from identification and [[statistics|statistically based analysis]] of global trends to subjective and emotional responses to the future. The work of the Institute is interdisciplinary, and its staff covers a number of academic disciplines and professional backgrounds, including [[economics]], [[political science]], [[ethnography]], [[psychology]], [[engineering]], [[public relations]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cifs.dk/en/faq.asp FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812174101/http://www.cifs.dk/en/faq.asp |date=2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's products include seminars, analyses, reports, newsletters, books, and the magazine ''Scenario''.&lt;ref&gt;Scenario Magazine read: {{cite web |url=http://www.iff.dk/en/tidsskrift.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625134011/http://www.iff.dk/en/tidsskrift.asp |archivedate=2010-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is the Danish Partner of the EUROCONSTRUCT network, which provides analysis and forecasts of construction in 19 Western and Central Eastern European countries.

The work at the Institute rests on the assumptions outlined by [[military strategist]] [[Herman Kahn]] in his book: ''The Year 2000: A Framework  for Speculation on the Next Thirty-three Years'', and later adapted for strategic business planning by [[Pierre Wack]] from [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

'''Cubist Pharmaceuticals''' was a U.S. [[biopharmaceutical]] company with activities spanning from research and development to commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Its main products target pathogens like [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]].

Cubist was one of the few firms that continued to research in antibiotics while larger pharmaceutical companies have abandoned such research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/cubist-exec-challenges-mount-antibiotics-discovery/2014-08-26| title= Cubist exec: Challenges mount in antibiotics discovery| last= Mullin| first=Emily| date=26 Aug 2014| accessdate= 23 Nov 2014| website= Fiercebiotechresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company employs 638 people, with 370 in their headquarters in Lexington, MA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. homesite | work=2009 Annual Report|url=http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/file.aspx?FID=1500026840&amp;IID=4093793 |accessdate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2011, the company’s headquarters are under expansion and is expected to occupy {{convert|373,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in Lexington, MA. On 8 December 2014, [[Merck &amp; Co.]] acquired Cubist for $102 per share in cash ($8.4 billion) as entree to the market for drugs that can combat [[super bug (bacteria)|superbugs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/09/us-cubist-pharma-m-a-merck-idUSKBN0JM19X20141209 Merck to take on superbugs with Cubist Pharma buy]. [[Reuters]], 9 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cubist was founded in May 1992 by John K. Clarke, [[Paul Schimmel|Paul R. Schimmel, Ph.D.]] and [[Barry Bloom]], Ph.D, all of whom were also directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SEC Form S3 Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | date=March 8, 2000 | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/spos/filing.ashx?filingid=1123315}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cubist appeared on Fortune 2010’s List of fastest growing companies, and was named to the 2010 Deloitte Technology Fast 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortunefastestgrowing/2010/|title=100 FASTEST-GROWING COMPANIES|date=2010|accessdate=28 May 2011|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 it had the [[List of biotechnology companies|19th highest sales]] among American based biotechnology companies.

In 2011, the company acquired Adolor, maker of a drug for treatment of [[constipation]].&lt;ref name=apcubist2012/&gt;

Cubist had an ambitious growth plan laid out for the 2012-2017 quinquennium. Under this plan, the company was expected to reach 2B dollars in sales and have 4 new drugs in late stage development by 2017. As a part of this plan, sales of its flagship drug Cubicin were expected to grow to more than 1B dollars per year.

In July 2013, Cubist Pharmaceuticals agreed to purchase [[Trius Therapeutics]] and [[Optimer Pharmaceuticals]] for around $1.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/31/us-cubist-deal-idUSBRE96T1BI20130731| title= Cubist to pay up to $1.6 billion for two antibiotics makers | author= Vrinda Manocha and Zeba Siddiqui | publisher=Reuters | date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, succeeding [[Michael Bonney]] as President, Robert J. Perez, was announced to take leadership on January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/10/20/new-cubist-pharmaceuticals-chief-executive-will-robert-perez/wf8FbqJsIQSS4HxQQmCzVM/story.html| title=New Cubist Pharmaceuticals chief executive will be Robert J. Perez | date= 20 Oct 2014| accessdate= 23 Nov 2014| last=Weisman| first=Robert| website=www.BostonGlobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 Cubist Pharmaceuticals became a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co.

==Products==
The company markets Cubicin ([[daptomycin]]) for injection, the first antibiotic in a class of anti-infectives called [[lipopeptides]].

In April 2011 it reached a deal with Optimer Pharmaceuticals in which its class of bacterium fighting drugs will be co marketed with Optimer's Fidaxomicin/Dificid (for $15 million per year).  Optimer chose Cubist because according to its CEO, "Cubist has a proven track record and well established relations with all stakeholders involved in the antibiotics space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-06/optimer-to-co-market-dificid-drug-with-cubist-pharmaceuticals.html|title=Optimer to Market Dificid Drug With Cubist Pharmaceuticals|date=2011-04-06 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Death Cafe''' is a scheduled non-profit get-together (called "social franchises" by the organizers) for the purpose of talking about [[death]] over food and drink, usually tea and cake. The goal of these nonprofit groups is to educate and help others become more familiar with the end of life. The idea originates with the Swiss [[Sociology|sociologist]] and [[anthropologist]] {{ill|Bernard Crettaz|fr}}, who organized the first '''café mortel''' in 2004. They have since been held in several countries, beginning with France and the United Kingdom.

The death café is not a physical location, but is an event hosted at someone's house or other pop-up/ temporary venue. The official objective of a death café is to help people make the most of their finite lives. Individuals can discuss their understanding, thoughts, dreams, fears and all other areas of death and dying at these events. There have been Death Cafes which specifically create a chance for health/care professionals to talk about death (Miles &amp; Corr, 2015). Generally a death café will have in the region of 12 people gathered in a group discussing death related topics and usually lasts 2 hours (Adler, Remer, Coulter, &amp; Miller, 2015). Tea and cake are one of the most important features to the event they assist with creating a nurturing and supportive environment (Underwood, 2015). The concept has spread due to media attention and because of the topic evoking so many different people's thoughts of what death means (Miles &amp; Corr, 2015).

Crettaz organized the first Cafe Mortel in [[Neuchâtel]] in 2004 with the aim of breaking the "tyrannical secrecy" surrounding the topic of death.&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;Gary Singh, "Expiration Date," Silicon Alleys, ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'', July 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aargau&gt;Karen Schärer, [http://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/leben/leben/die-todes-caf-wenn-man-sich-im-restaurant-trifft-um-ueber-den-tod-zu-plaudern-127438442 "Die Todes-Café: Wenn man sich im Restaurant trifft, um über den Tod zu plaudern"], ''[[Aargauer Zeitung]]'', December 3, 2013 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written a book on the topic, ''Cafés Mortels: Sortir la Mort du Silence'' (Death Cafes: Bringing Death out of Silence).&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;Molly Guinness, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/never-say-die-far-from-it-in-paris-death-caf233-2121850.html "Never say die? Far from it in Paris death café"], ''[[The Independent]]'', November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Death Cafe website created by Death Cafe founder Jon Underwood, states the purpose as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At a Death Cafe people, often strangers, gather to eat cake, drink tea and discuss death.

Our objective is 'to increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their (finite) lives'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deathcafe.com/p/what-is-death-cafe.html/ What is Death Cafe?], Death Cafe.com, retrieved July 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Facilitators have said that there is "a need among people to open [the] closet"&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;Deena Prichep, [https://www.npr.org/2013/03/08/173808940/death-cafes-breathe-life-into-conversations-about-dying "Death Cafes Breathe Life Into Conversations About Dying"], [[NPR]], March 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; into which death, the "last taboo",&lt;ref name=Metro/&gt; has been placed, to reduce fear and enable people to live more fully.&lt;ref name=Metro/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; He has said that at these gatherings, "the assembled company, for a moment, and thanks to death, is born into authenticity."&lt;ref&gt;Clare Davies, [http://aeon.co/magazine/being-human/death-has-become-too-sanitised/ "The Death Café"], ''Aeon'', September 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Underwood, a former senior council worker and web developer who founded Death Cafe based on the ideas of Bernard Crettaz, held the first Death Cafe in his home in London, stating that "we have lost control of one of the most significant events we ever have to face."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Eleanor Tucker, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/22/death-cafe-talk-about-dying "What on earth is a death cafe?"], Family, ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one commentator, Crettaz wants to revive the pagan tradition of the funeral feast, "where the living would renew their bonds while letting go of what weighed on their hearts."&lt;ref&gt;Ondine Millot, [http://www.liberation.fr/vous/2010/10/27/cafes-mortels-trepas-sur-le-pouce_689396 "Cafés mortels: trépas sur le pouce"], ''[[Libération]]'', October 27, 2010 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Paris Cafe Mortel with Crettaz took place in 2010&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; and Underwood held the first London event in 2011 at his home,&lt;ref name=Metro/&gt; subsequently developing the Death Cafe website, generating guidelines with his mother (psychotherapist and Underwood's first Death Cafe facilitator) Susan Barsky Reid, and publicising the concept which took off globally.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Carter, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-25580275 "Death Cafe: Discussing mortality over tea and cake"], [[BBC News]], January 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/spiritualoutlook/20131215 "Sunday, 15 December 2013: Death Cafe"], Spiritual Outlook, [[Radio New Zealand]] National, retrieved July 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first US event was organized by Lizzy Miles, a [[hospice]] worker, in summer 2012 near [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Paula Span, [http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/death-be-not-decaffeinated-over-cup-groups-face-taboo/ "Death Be Not Decaffeinated: Over Cup, Groups Face Taboo"], The New Old Age, blogs, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janice Lloyd, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/07/health-spirituality-dying-death/2046805/ "'Death cafes' normalize a difficult, not morbid, topic"], ''[[USA Today]]'', April 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jaweed Kaleem, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/death-cafe-dying-end-of-life_n_2618226.html "Death Cafes Grow As Places To Discuss, Learn About End Of Life"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', February 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2014, the idea had spread to [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;Christy Choi, [http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1532994/hong-kongs-death-cafe-it-love-and-life-menu "At Hong Kong's Death Cafe, it is love and life that is on the menu"], ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', June 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|03}}, over 5,900 have been held worldwide.

Death Cafes have helped to relax the taboo of speaking about death, particularly with strangers, and encouraged people to express their own wishes for after they die. The open-ended discussions also provide an avenue to express thoughts about one's own life stirred up by the death of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;Lizzy Miles and Charles A. Corr, [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0030222815612602 "Death Cafe: What Is It and What We Can Learn From It"], ''Omega'', October 29, 2015, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Underwood's death on 25 June 2017, Death Cafe is now run by his sister Jools Barsky and mother Susan Barsky Reid. An informative monograph on the movement, its thematic emphases, and its communicative dynamics can be found in ''The Death Café Movement: Exploring the Horizons of Mortality'' (2017) by Dr. Jack Fong.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fong, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Death_Caf%C3%A9_Movement.html?id=q9VbMQAACAAJ ''The Death Café Movement: Exploring the Horizons of Mortality.''

In the [[United States Armed Forces]], a '''dignified transfer''' is a procedure honoring the return of the [[corpse|remains]] of a [[servicemember]] from the theater of operations where they have died in the service of the United States. The transfer is conducted upon arrival at [[Dover Air Force Base]], Delaware, from the arriving aircraft to a transfer vehicle, which then proceeds to the [[Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs]].&lt;ref name="AFMAO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mortuary.af.mil/library/dignifiedtransfer/index.asp |title=Dignified Transfer |publisher=Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations |accessdate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US military officials do not designate the dignified transfer as a ceremony so that loved ones of the deceased do not feel obliged to attend.&lt;ref name=Shane2009&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/dignified-transfer-for-soldier-follows-same-simple-script-1.90032 |title='Dignified transfer' for soldier follows same, simple script |first=Leo |last=Shane III |work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] |date=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is described as "a solemn movement of the transfer case".&lt;ref name="AFMAO"/&gt;

A dignified transfer is conducted for every U.S. military member who dies in a theater of operation while in the service of their country. A senior ranking officer of the fallen member's [[military branch|branch of service]] presides over each dignified transfer, with a carry team made up of members of the same branch. Per [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] policy, the remains are returned to the deceased's loved ones as quickly as possible, either by direct flight to Dover from the field, or via [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany.&lt;ref name="AFMAO"/&gt; At Dover, each [[coffin|transfer case]] is moved one by one from the aircraft to the waiting vehicle, usually a truck.

Media access to dignified transfers was prohibited from 1991 to 2009, when [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] allowed media attendance contingent on the consent the family of the deceased.&lt;ref name=Shane2009/&gt; Coverage is further restricted only to personnel who died in the line of duty supporting certain operations, such as [[Enduring Freedom]], [[Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Inherent Resolve|Inherent Resolve]].&lt;ref name="AFMAO"/&gt;

On August 9, 2011, President [[Barack Obama]], [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Leon Panetta]] and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Adm. [[Mike Mullen]], among other leaders, attended the dignified transfer for 38 U.S. and Afghan personnel killed aboard a helicopter shot down in [[Afghanistan]] three days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/08/09/afghanistan.chopper.crash/index.html |title=Obama attends transfer of service members' remains from downed copter |first=Larry |last=Shaughnessy |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eukaryotes''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|k|ær|i|oʊ|t|,_|-|ə|t}}) are [[organism]]s whose cells have a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] enclosed within [[biological membrane|membranes]], unlike [[prokaryote]]s ([[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]).&lt;ref name="Youngson"&gt;{{cite book| last= Youngson| first= Robert M. | name-list-format = vanc | title= Collins Dictionary of Human Biology| year= 2006| publisher= HarperCollins| location= Glasgow| isbn= 978-0-00-722134-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson&amp;Cox"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Nelson| first1= David L. | last2 = Cox| first2 = Michael M. | name-list-format = vanc |year=2005|title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|edition=4th|location=New York|publisher=W.H.

Their name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:εὖ|εὖ]] (''eu'', "well" or "true") and [[wikt:κάρυον|κάρυον]] (''karyon'', "nut" or "kernel").&lt;ref name="OnlineEtDict"&gt;{{cite web|title=eukaryotic|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=eukaryotic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eukaryotic cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles such as [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]], and in addition, some cells of [[plant]]s and [[algae]] contain [[chloroplast]]s. Unlike [[unicellular organism|unicellular]] archaea and bacteria, eukaryotes may also be [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] and include organisms consisting of many [[cell type]]s forming different kinds of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. Animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes.

Eukaryotes can reproduce both [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] through [[mitosis]] and [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] through [[meiosis]] and [[gamete]] fusion. In mitosis, one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells. In meiosis, [[DNA replication]] is followed by two rounds of [[cell division]] to produce four [[Ploidy|haploid]] daughter cells. These act as sex cells (gametes). Each gamete has just one set of chromosomes, each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental [[chromosome]]s resulting from [[genetic recombination]] during meiosis.

The [[domain (biology)|domain]] Eukaryota appears to be [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], and makes up one of the domains of life in the [[three-domain system]]. The two other domains, Bacteria and Archaea, are prokaryotes&lt;ref name="nyt_2016_apr_11"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://nyti.ms/25UUNvj | title=Scientists Unveil New 'Tree of Life' | newspaper=The New York Times | date=11 April 2016 | access-date=2016-04-11 | last = Zimmer | first = Carl | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have none of the above features. Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things.&lt;ref name="Whitman etal"/&gt; However, due to their generally much larger size, their collective worldwide [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] is estimated to be about equal to that of prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="Whitman etal"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitman WB, Coleman DC, Wiebe WJ | title = Prokaryotes: the unseen majority | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6578–83 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618454 | pmc = 33863 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/95/12/6578.pdf | format = PDF | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eukaryotes evolved approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago, during the [[Proterozoic]] eon.

==History==
[[File:Konstantin Mereschkowski.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] proposed a [[symbiogenesis|symbiotic origin]] for cells with nuclei.]]

The concept of the eukaryote has been attributed to the French biologist [[Edouard Chatton]]  (1883-1947). The terms prokaryote and eukaryote were more definitively reintroduced by the Canadian microbiologist [[Roger Stanier]] and the Dutch-American microbiologist [[C. B. van Niel]] in 1962. In his 1938 work ''Titres et Travaux Scientifiques'', Chatton had proposed the two terms, calling the bacteria prokaryotes and organisms with nuclei in their cells eukaryotes. However he mentioned this in only one paragraph, and the idea was effectively ignored until Chatton's statement was rediscovered by Stanier and van Niel.&lt;ref name=Sapp&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sapp J | title = The prokaryote-eukaryote dichotomy: meanings and mythology | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 292–305 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15944457 | pmc = 1197417 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.69.2.292-305.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 and 1910, the Russian biologist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] (1855–1921) argued that [[plastid]]s were reduced [[cyanobacteria]] in a [[mutualism (biology)|symbiosis]] with a non-[[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] ([[heterotroph]]ic) host that was itself formed by symbiosis between an amoeba-like host and a bacterium-like cell that formed the nucleus. Plants had thus inherited photosynthesis from cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name=MartinGargZimorski&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin WF, Garg S, Zimorski V | title = Endosymbiotic theories for eukaryote origin | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 370 | issue = 1678 | pages = 20140330 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26323761 | pmc = 4571569 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2014.0330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, [[Lynn Margulis]] provided microbiological evidence for [[endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]] as the origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria in eukaryotic cells in her paper, ''On the origin of mitosing cells.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sagan L | title = On the origin of mitosing cells | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–74 | date = March 1967 | pmid = 11541392 | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3 | authorlink = Lynn Margulis }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, [[Carl Woese]] explored microbial [[phylogenetics]], studying variations in 16S [[ribosomal RNA]]. This helped to uncover the origin of the eukaryotes and the [[symbiogenesis]] of two important eukaryote [[organelle]]s, [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In 1977, Woese and George Fox introduced a "third form of life", which they called the Archaebacteria; in 1990, Woese, Otto Kandler and Mark L. Wheeler renamed this the Archaea.&lt;ref name=Sapp/&gt;

In 1979, G. W. Gould and G. J. Dring suggested that the eukaryotic cell's [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]] came from the ability of [[Gram-positive bacteria]] to form [[endospore]]s. In 1987 and later papers, [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] proposed instead that the membranes of the nucleus and [[endoplasmic reticulum]] first formed by infolding a prokaryote's plasma membrane. In the 1990s, several other biologists proposed endosymbiotic origins for the nucleus, effectively reviving Mereschkowski's theory.&lt;ref name=MartinGargZimorski/&gt;

==Cell features==

Eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those of [[prokaryote]]s having a volume of around 10,000 times greater than the prokaryotic cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microorganisms and the origin of the eukaryotic cell|url=http://protistology.jp/journal/jjp47/JJP47YAMAGUCHI.pdf|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a variety of internal membrane-bound structures, called organelles, and a [[cytoskeleton]] composed of [[microtubule]]s, [[microfilament]]s, and [[intermediate filament]]s, which play an important role in defining the cell's organization and shape. Eukaryotic [[DNA]] is divided into several linear bundles called [[chromosome]]s, which are separated by a [[spindle apparatus|microtubular spindle]] during nuclear division.

===Internal membrane===
[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|300px|left|The endomembrane system and its components]]

Eukaryote cells include a variety of membrane-bound structures, collectively referred to as the [[endomembrane system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Evolutionary Integration of Chloroplast Metabolism with the Metabolic Networks of the Cells| editor-last1 = Burnap | editor-first1 = Robert L. | editor-last2 = Vermaas | editor-first2 = Willem F.J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Functional Genomics and Evolution of Photosynthetic Systems |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |isbn=978-9400715332 |page=215 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfzEgaLibuwC&amp;pg=PA215 | last1 = Linka | first1 = Marc | last2 = Weber | first2 = Andreas P.M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple compartments, called [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] and [[vacuole]]s, can form by budding off other membranes. Many cells ingest food and other materials through a process of [[endocytosis]], where the outer membrane [[Invagination|invaginates]] and then pinches off to form a vesicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marsh, Mark| title = Endocytosis| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2001| page = vii| isbn = 978-0-19-963851-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that most other membrane-bound organelles are ultimately derived from such vesicles. Alternatively some products produced by the cell can leave in a vesicle through exocytosis.

The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane (commonly referred to as a [[nuclear membrane]] or nuclear envelope), with pores that allow material to move in and out.&lt;ref name=TheNuclearEnvelope-NCBI&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hetzer MW | title = The nuclear envelope | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = a000539 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20300205 | pmc = 2829960 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a000539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various tube- and sheet-like extensions of the nuclear membrane form the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], which is involved in protein transport and maturation. It includes the rough endoplasmic reticulum where [[ribosome]]s are attached to synthesize proteins, which enter the interior space or lumen. Subsequently, they generally enter vesicles, which bud off from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough and Smooth) |url=http://bscb.org/learning-resources/softcell-e-learning/endoplasmic-reticulum-rough-and-smooth/ |publisher=British Society for Cell Biology |access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most eukaryotes, these protein-carrying vesicles are released and further modified in stacks of flattened vesicles ([[cisterna]]e), the [[Golgi apparatus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Golgi Apparatus |url=http://bscb.org/learning-resources/softcell-e-learning/golgi-apparatus/ |publisher=British Society for Cell Biology |access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vesicles may be specialized for various purposes. For instance, [[lysosome]]s contain digestive [[enzyme]]s that break down most [[biomolecule]]s in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lysosome |url=http://bscb.org/learning-resources/softcell-e-learning/lysosome/ |publisher=British Society for Cell Biology |access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peroxisome]]s are used to break down [[peroxide]], which is otherwise toxic. Many [[protozoa]]ns have contractile vacuoles, which collect and expel excess water, and [[extrusome]]s, which expel material used to deflect predators or capture prey. In higher plants, most of a cell's volume is taken up by a central vacuole, which mostly contains water and primarily maintains its [[osmotic pressure]].

===Mitochondria and plastids===

The outer mitochondrial membrane is freely permeable and allows almost anything to enter into the [[mitochondrial intermembrane space|intermembrane space]] while the inner mitochondrial membrane is semi permeable so allows only some required things into the mitochondrial matrix.

Mitochondria contain [[Mitochondrial DNA|their own DNA]], which has close structural similarities to bacterial DNA, and which encodes [[rRNA]] and [[tRNA]] genes that produce RNA which is closer in structure to bacterial RNA than to eukaryote RNA.&lt;ref name="MolecGene"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=James |last2=Hopkins |first2=Nancy |last3=Roberts |first3=Jeffery |last4=Steitz |first4=Joan Argetsinger |last5=Weiner |first5=Alan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Molecular Biology of the Gene |date=1988 |publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Menlo Park, CA |isbn=978-0-8053-9614-0 |page=1154 |edition=Fourth |language=English |chapter=28: The Origins of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now generally held to have developed from [[endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] prokaryotes, probably [[proteobacteria]].

Some eukaryotes, such as the [[metamonad]]s such as ''[[Giardia]]'' and ''[[Trichomonas]]'', and the amoebozoan [[Pelomyxa]], appear to lack mitochondria, but all have been found to contain mitochondrion-derived organelles, such as [[hydrogenosome]]s and [[mitosome]]s, and thus have lost their mitochondria secondarily.&lt;ref name="Karn"/&gt; They obtain energy by enzymatic action on nutrients absorbed from the environment. The metamonad ''[[Monocercomonoides]]'' has also acquired, by [[lateral gene transfer]], a cytosolic [[sulfur]] mobilisation system which provides the clusters of iron and sulfur required for protein synthesis. The normal mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster pathway has been lost secondarily.&lt;ref name="KarnkowskaVacek2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karnkowska A, Vacek V, Zubáčová Z, Treitli SC, Petrželková R, Eme L, Novák L, Žárský V, Barlow LD, Herman EK, Soukal P, Hroudová M, Doležal P, Stairs CW, Roger AJ, Eliáš M, Dacks JB, Vlček Č, Hampl V | title = A Eukaryote without a Mitochondrial Organelle | journal = Current Biology | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1274–84 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27185558 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2016.03.053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/first-eukaryote-found-lack-mitochondria |title=Scientists Shocked To Discover Eukaryote With NO Mitochondria |date=13 May 2016 |author=Davis, Josh L. |website=IFL Science |access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants and various groups of [[algae]] also have [[plastid]]s. Plastids also have [[Chloroplast DNA|their own DNA]] and are developed from [[endosymbionts]], in this case [[cyanobacteria]]. They usually take the form of [[chloroplast]]s which, like cyanobacteria, contain [[chlorophyll]] and produce organic compounds (such as [[glucose]]) through [[photosynthesis]]. Others are involved in storing food. Although plastids probably had a single origin, not all plastid-containing groups are closely related. Instead, some eukaryotes have obtained them from others through [[secondary endosymbiosis]] or ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sato, N. |year=2006|pages= 75–102 |title=The Structure and Function of Plastids|volume=23|editor1=R.R.

===Cytoskeletal structures===
{{Main | Cytoskeleton}}
[[File:Chlamydomonas TEM 09.jpg|thumb|Longitudinal section through the flagellum of ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'']]
Many eukaryotes have long slender motile cytoplasmic projections, called [[flagellum|flagella]], or similar structures called [[cilium|cilia]]. Flagella and cilia are sometimes referred to as [[undulipodia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Margulis]], Heather I. McKhann &amp; Lorraine Olendzenski (ed.), ''Illustrated Glossary of Protoctista'', Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, 1993, p. xviii. {{ISBN|0-86720-081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are variously involved in movement, feeding, and sensation. They are composed mainly of [[tubulin]]. These are entirely distinct from prokaryotic flagellae. They are supported by a bundle of microtubules arising from a [[centriole]], characteristically arranged as nine doublets surrounding two singlets. Flagella also may have hairs, or [[mastigonemes]], and scales connecting membranes and internal rods. Their interior is continuous with the cell's [[cytoplasm]].

Microfilamental structures composed of [[actin]] and actin binding proteins, e.g., α-[[actinin]], [[fimbrin]], [[filamin]] are present in submembraneous cortical layers and bundles, as well. [[Motor protein]]s of microtubules, e.g., [[dynein]] or [[kinesin]] and actin, e.g., [[myosins]] provide dynamic character of the network.

[[Centrioles]] are often present even in cells and groups that do not have flagella, but [[conifer]]s and [[angiosperm|flowering plants]] have neither. They generally occur in groups that give rise to various microtubular roots. These form a primary component of the cytoskeletal structure, and are often assembled over the course of several cell divisions, with one flagellum retained from the parent and the other derived from it. Centrioles produce the spindle during nuclear division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Vorobjev IA, Nadezhdina ES | title = The centrosome and its role in the organization of microtubules | volume = 106 | pages = 227–93 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3294718 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7696(08)61714-3 | isbn = 978-0-12-364506-7 | series = International Review of Cytology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of cytoskeletal structures is underlined in the determination of shape of the cells, as well as their being essential components of migratory responses like [[chemotaxis]] and [[chemokinesis]]. Some protists have various other microtubule-supported organelles. These include the [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]], which produce [[Pseudopodia#Morphology|axopodia]] used in flotation or to capture prey, and the [[haptophyte]]s, which have a peculiar flagellum-like organelle called the [[haptonema]].

===Cell wall===
{{main|Cell wall}}
The cells of plants and algae, fungi and most [[Chromalveolata|chromalveolates]] have a cell wall, a layer outside the [[cell membrane]], providing the cell with structural support, protection, and a filtering mechanism. The cell wall also prevents over-expansion when water enters the cell.&lt;ref name="Howland 2000"&gt;{{cite book| last=Howland | first=John L. | name-list-format = vanc | year=2000 | title=The Surprising Archaea: Discovering Another Domain of Life | pages=69–71 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | isbn=978-0-19-511183-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major [[polysaccharides]] making up the primary cell wall of [[land plants]] are [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[pectin]]. The cellulose [[microfibril]]s are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network, which is embedded in the pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall is [[xyloglucan]].&lt;ref name="Fry1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fry |first1=Stephen C.|title=The Structure and Functions of Xyloglucan |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=40 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1093/jxb/40.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences among eukaryotic cells==
There are many different types of eukaryotic cells, though animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes, and thus provide an excellent starting point for understanding eukaryotic structure. Fungi and many protists have some substantial differences, however.

===Animal cell===
[[File:Animal cell structure en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Structure of a typical animal cell]]
[[File:Plant cell structure-en.svg|thumb|250px|Structure of a typical [[plant cell]]]]

All animals are eukaryotic. Animal cells are distinct from those of other eukaryotes, most notably [[plant cells|plants]], as they lack [[cell wall]]s and [[chloroplast]]s and have smaller [[vacuole]]s. Due to the lack of a [[cell wall]], animal cells can transform into a variety of shapes. A [[phagocyte|phagocytic]] cell can even engulf other structures.

===Plant cell===
{{Main|Plant cell}}
[[Plant cell]]s are quite different from the cells of the other eukaryotic organisms. Their distinctive features are:
* A large central [[vacuole]] (enclosed by a membrane, the [[tonoplast]]), which maintains the cell's [[turgor]] and controls movement of [[molecule]]s between the [[cytosol]] and [[plant sap|sap]]&lt;ref name=Raven1987&gt;{{cite journal| last=Raven | first=J. A. | name-list-format = vanc | date=July 1987 | title=The role of vacuoles | journal= New Phytologist | volume=106 | issue=3 | pages=357–422 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb00149.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A primary [[cell wall]] containing [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[pectin]], deposited by the [[protoplast]] on the outside of the [[cell membrane]]; this contrasts with the cell walls of [[fungus|fungi]], which contain [[chitin]], and the [[cell envelope]]s of prokaryotes, in which [[peptidoglycan]]s are the main structural molecules
* The [[plasmodesmata]], pores in the cell wall that link adjacent cells and allow plant cells to communicate with adjacent cells.&lt;ref name=Oparka&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Oparka K | year=2005 | title=Plasmodesmata | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals have a different but functionally analogous system of [[gap junction]]s between adjacent cells.
* [[Plastid]]s, especially [[chloroplast]]s, [[organelle]]s that contain [[chlorophyll]], the pigment that gives [[plant]]s their green color and allows them to perform [[photosynthesis]]
* [[Bryophyte]]s and [[pteridophyte|seedless vascular plants]] only have flagellae and centrioles in the sperm cells.&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Raven PH, Evert RF, Eichorm SE | year=1999| title= Biology of Plants |  publisher=W.H. Freeman | location=New York | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperm of [[cycad]]s and ''[[Ginkgo]]'' are large, complex cells that swim with hundreds to thousands of flagellae.&lt;ref name="Silflow"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silflow CD, Lefebvre PA | title = Assembly and motility of eukaryotic cilia and flagella.

* [[Pinophyta|Conifers]] (Pinophyta) and [[flowering plant]]s (Angiospermae) lack the [[flagellum|flagellae]] and [[centriole]]s that are present in animal cells.

===Fungal cell===

The cells of [[fungi]] are most similar to animal cells, with the following exceptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Deacon J |title=Fungal Biology |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4051-3066-0 |pages=4 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A cell wall that contains [[chitin]]
* Less compartmentation between cells; the [[hypha]]e of higher fungi have porous partitions called [[septum|septa]], which allow the passage of cytoplasm, organelles, and, sometimes, nuclei. Primitive fungi have few or no septa, so each organism is essentially a giant [[multinucleate]] supercell; these fungi are described as [[coenocytic]].
* Only the most primitive fungi, [[chytrid]]s, have flagella.

===Other eukaryotic cells===
Some groups of eukaryotes have unique organelles, such as the cyanelles (unusual chloroplasts) of the [[glaucophyte]]s,&lt;ref name="keeling"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keeling PJ | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 91 | issue = 10 | pages = 1481–93 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 21652304 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1481 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the haptonema of the [[haptophyte]]s, or the [[ejectosome]]s of the [[cryptomonad]]s. Other structures, such as [[pseudopodia]], are found in various eukaryote groups in different forms, such as the lobose [[amoebozoa]]ns or the reticulose [[foraminiferan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=51 |author=David J. Patterson |title=Amoebae: Protists Which Move and Feed Using Pseudopodia |publisher=Tree of Life Web Project |access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates the ''twofold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

[[Cell division]] generally takes place [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by [[mitosis]], a process that allows each daughter nucleus to receive one copy of each [[chromosome]]. Most eukaryotes also have a life cycle that involves [[sexual reproduction]], [[alternation of generations|alternating]] between a [[haploid]] phase, where only one copy of each chromosome is present in each cell and a [[diploid]] phase, wherein two copies of each chromosome are present in each cell. The diploid phase is formed by fusion of two haploid gametes to form a zygote, which may divide by mitosis or undergo chromosome reduction by [[meiosis]]. There is considerable variation in this pattern. Animals have no multicellular haploid phase, but each plant generation can consist of haploid and diploid multicellular phases.

Eukaryotes have a smaller surface area to volume ratio than prokaryotes, and thus have lower metabolic rates and longer generation times.&lt;ref name="Lane2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lane N | title = Energetics and genetics across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | page = 35 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21714941 | pmc = 3152533 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-6-35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the two lineages of [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s were recognized. They were given the [[taxonomic rank]] of [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. Though he included the [[fungi]] with plants with some reservations, it was later realized that they are quite distinct and warrant a separate kingdom, the composition of which was not entirely clear until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Moore1980"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Moore RT |year=1980 |title=Taxonomic proposals for the classification of marine yeasts and other yeast-like fungi including the smuts |journal=Botanica Marina |volume=23 |pages=361–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various single-cell eukaryotes were originally placed with plants or animals when they became known. In 1830, the German biologist [[Georg A. Goldfuss]] coined the word ''[[protozoa]]'' to refer to organisms such as [[ciliate]]s, and this group was expanded until it encompassed all single-celled eukaryotes, and given their own kingdom, the [[Protista]], by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=Scamardella1999&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scamardella, JM |title=Not plants or animals: a brief history of the origin of Kingdoms Protozoa, Protista and Protoctista |year=1999 |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |volume=2 |pages=207–21 |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/08december99/03%20Scamardella.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614000656/http://www.im.microbios.org/08december99/03%20Scamardella.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothschild1989&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothschild LJ | title = Protozoa, Protista, Protoctista: what's in a name? | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–305 | year = 1989 | pmid = 11542176 | doi = 10.1007/BF00139515 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/LW54T61737212643.pdf | authorlink = Lynn J.

* Kingdom [[Protista]]
* Kingdom [[Plantae]]
* Kingdom [[Fungi]]
* Kingdom [[Animalia]]

The protists were understood to be "primitive forms", and thus an [[evolutionary grade]], united by their primitive unicellular nature.&lt;ref name=Rothschild1989/&gt; The disentanglement of the deep splits in the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] only really started with [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequencing]], leading to a system of [[domain (biology)|domains]] rather than kingdoms as top level rank being put forward by [[Carl Woese]], uniting all the eukaryote kingdoms under the eukaryote domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woese CR, Kandler O, Wheelis ML | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–79 | date = June 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | pmc = 54159 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, work on the protist tree intensified, and is still actively going on today. Several alternative classifications have been forwarded, though there is no consensus in the field.

'''Eukaryotes''' are a clade usually assessed to be sister to [[Heimdallarchaeota]] in the [[Asgard (archaea)|Asgard]] grouping in the [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name="SpangSaw2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaremba-NiedzwiedzkaCaceres2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu_2018" /&gt; The basal groupings are the [[Opimoda]], [[Diphoda]], the [[Discoba]], and the [[Loukozoa]].

The [[rRNA]] trees constructed during the 1980s and 1990s left most eukaryotes in an unresolved "crown" group (not technically a true [[crown group|crown]]), which was usually divided by the form of the mitochondrial cristae; see [[crown eukaryotes]].

The origin of the eukaryotic cell is a milestone in the evolution of life, since eukaryotes include all complex cells and almost all multicellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; [[Andrew H. Knoll|Knoll]] (2006) suggests they developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago.

Whenever their origins, eukaryotes may not have become ecologically dominant until much later; a massive uptick in the zinc composition of marine sediments {{Ma|800}} has been attributed to the rise of substantial populations of eukaryotes, which preferentially consume and incorporate zinc relative to prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid29869832"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Isson TT, Love GD, Dupont CL, Reinhard CT, Zumberge AJ, Asael D, Gueguen B, McCrow J, Gill BC, Owens J, Rainbird RH, Rooney AD, Zhao MY, Stueeken EE, Konhauser KO, John SG, Lyons TW, Planavsky NJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Tracking the rise of eukaryotes to ecological dominance with zinc isotopes | journal = Geobiology | volume = 16| issue = 4| pages = 341–52| date = June 2018 | pmid = 29869832 | doi = 10.1111/gbi.12289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Archaea===
The nuclear DNA and genetic machinery of eukaryotes is more similar to [[Archaea]] than [[Bacteria]], leading to a controversial suggestion that eukaryotes should be grouped with Archaea in the clade [[Neomura]]. In other respects, such as membrane composition, eukaryotes are similar to Bacteria. Three main explanations for this have been proposed:
* Eukaryotes resulted from the complete fusion of two or more cells, wherein the cytoplasm formed from a [[eubacterium]], and the nucleus from an archaeon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin W | title = Archaebacteria (Archaea) and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 630–37 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16242992 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2005.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viral Eukaryogenesis|from a virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takemura M | title = Poxviruses and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 419–25 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11443345 | doi = 10.1007/s002390010171 | bibcode = 2001JMolE..52..419T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell PJ | title = Viral eukaryogenesis: was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 251–56 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11523012 | doi = 10.1007/s002390010215 | bibcode = 2001JMolE..53..251L }}&lt;/ref&gt; or from a [[pre-cell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wächtershäuser G | title = From pre-cells to Eukarya--a tale of two lipids | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–22 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12492850 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03267.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wächtershäuser G | title = From volcanic origins of chemoautotrophic life to Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

* Eukaryotes and Archaea developed separately from a modified eubacterium.

Alternative proposals include:
* The chronocyte hypothesis postulates that a primitive eukaryotic cell was formed by the endosymbiosis of both archaea and bacteria by a third type of cell, termed a chronocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartman H, Fedorov A | title = The origin of the eukaryotic cell: a genomic investigation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 1420–25 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11805300 | pmc = 122206 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.032658599 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.1420H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The universal common ancestor (UCA) of the current tree of life was a complex organism that survived a mass extinction event rather than an early stage in the evolution of life. Eukaryotes and in particular akaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) evolved through reductive loss,&lt;ref name=HariTunlKurl13/&gt; so that similarities result from differential retention of original features.

Assuming no other group is involved, there are three possible phylogenies for the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota in which each is monophyletic. These are labelled 1 to 3 in the table below. The eocyte hypothesis is a modification of hypothesis 2 in which the Archaea are paraphyletic. (The table and the names for the hypotheses are based on Harish and Kurland, 2017.&lt;ref name=Harish17/&gt;)

In recent years, most researchers have favoured either the three domains (3D) or the eocyte hypotheses. An [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] analyses supports the eocyte scenario, apparently with the Eukaryote root in [[Excavata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hug LA, Baker BJ, Anantharaman K, Brown CT, Probst AJ, Castelle CJ, Butterfield CN, Hernsdorf AW, Amano Y, Ise K, Suzuki Y, Dudek N, Relman DA, Finstad KM, Amundson R, Thomas BC, Banfield JF | title = A new view of the tree of life | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 16048 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27572647 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.48 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavalier-Smith2010b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavalier-Smith2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cavalier2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavalier-Smith_2018" /&gt; A cladogram supporting the eocyte hypothesis, positioning eukaryotes within Archaea, based on phylogenomic analyses of the [[Asgard (archaea)|Asgard]] archaea, is:&lt;ref name="SpangSaw2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spang A, Saw JH, Jørgensen SL, Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka K, Martijn J, Lind AE, van Eijk R, Schleper C, Guy L, Ettema TJ | title = Complex archaea that bridge the gap between prokaryotes and eukaryotes | journal = Nature | volume = 521 | issue = 7551 | pages = 173–79 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25945739 | pmc = 4444528 | doi = 10.1038/nature14447 | bibcode = 2015Natur.521..173S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zaremba-NiedzwiedzkaCaceres2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka K, Caceres EF, Saw JH, Bäckström D, Juzokaite L, Vancaester E, Seitz KW, Anantharaman K, Starnawski P, Kjeldsen KU, Stott MB, Nunoura T, Banfield JF, Schramm A, Baker BJ, Spang A, Ettema TJ | title = Asgard archaea illuminate the origin of eukaryotic cellular complexity | journal = Nature | volume = 541 | issue = 7637 | pages = 353–58 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28077874 | doi = 10.1038/nature21031 | bibcode = 2017Natur.541..353Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Zhou Z, Pan J, Baker BJ, Gu JD, Li M | title = Comparative genomic inference suggests mixotrophic lifestyle for Thorarchaeota | journal = The ISME Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 1021–31 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29445130 | pmc = 5864231 | doi = 10.1038/s41396-018-0060-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Asgard group is seen as a sister taxon of the [[TACK]] group, which comprises [[Crenarchaeota]] (formerly named [[Eocyte hypothesis|eocytes]]), [[Thaumarchaeota]], and others.

In 2017, there has been significant pushback against this scenario, arguing that the eukaryotes did not emerge within the Archaea. Cunha ''et al.'' produced analyses supporting the three domains (3D) or Woese hypothesis (2 in the table above) and rejecting the eocyte hypothesis (4 above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Da Cunha V, Gaia M, Gadelle D, Nasir A, Forterre P | title = Lokiarchaea are close relatives of Euryarchaeota, not bridging the gap between prokaryotes and eukaryotes | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = e1006810 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28604769 | pmc = 5484517 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harish and Kurland found strong support for the earlier two empires (2D) or Mayr hypothesis (1 in the table above), based on analyses of the coding sequences of protein domains.

Here the membranes originated after the engulfment of the mitochondrion, in part thanks to mitochondrial genes (the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] is one particular version).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin W, Müller M | title = The hydrogen hypothesis for the first eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6671 | pages = 37–41 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9510246 | doi = 10.1038/32096 | bibcode = 1998Natur.392...37M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study using genomes to construct [[supertree]]s, Pisani ''et al.'' (2007) suggest that, along with evidence that there was never a mitochondrion-less eukaryote, eukaryotes evolved from a [[syntrophy]] between an archaea closely related to [[Thermoplasmatales]] and an [[Alphaproteobacteria|α-proteobacterium]], likely a [[symbiosis]] driven by sulfur or hydrogen. The mitochondrion and its genome is a remnant of the α-proteobacterial endosymbiont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pisani D, Cotton JA, McInerney JO | title = Supertrees disentangle the chimerical origin of eukaryotic genomes | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1752–60 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17504772 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msm095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypotheses===
Different [[hypotheses]] have been proposed as to how eukaryotic cells came into existence. These hypotheses can be classified into two distinct classes – autogenous models and chimeric models.

====Autogenous models====
{{Plain image with caption|Serial endosymbiosis.svg|An autogenous model for the origin of eukaryotes.|360px}}

Autogenous models propose that a proto-eukaryotic cell containing a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] existed first, and later acquired [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Latorre A, Durban A, Moya A, Pereto J |title=The role of symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution. Origins and evolution of life – An astrobiological perspective |year=2011 |pages=326–39 |chapter=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to this model, a large [[prokaryote]] developed [[invaginations]] in its [[plasma membrane]] in order to obtain enough [[surface area to volume ratio|surface area]] to service its [[cytoplasmic]] volume. As the invaginations differentiated in function, some became separate compartments—giving rise to the [[endomembrane system]], including the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[golgi apparatus]], [[nuclear membrane]], and single membrane structures such as [[lysosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ayala J | title = Transport and internal organization of membranes: vesicles, membrane networks and GTP-binding proteins | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 107 ( Pt 4) | issue = 107 | pages = 753–63 | date = April 1994 | pmid = 8056835 | url = http://jcs.biologists.org/content/107/4/753.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mitochondria]] are proposed to come from the [[endosymbiosis]] of an aerobic [[proteobacterium]], and it is assumed that all the eukaryotic lineages that did not acquire mitochondria became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin|first=William F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Origin of Mitochondria|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356|work=Scitable|publisher=Nature education|access-date=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chloroplasts came about from another endosymbiotic event involving [[cyanobacteria]]. Since all eukaryotes have mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts, the [[serial endosymbiosis]] theory proposes that mitochondria came first.

====Chimeric models====
Chimeric models claim that two prokaryotic cells existed initially – an [[Archaea|archaeon]] and a [[Bacteria|bacterium]]. These cells underwent a merging process, either by a physical fusion or by [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]], thereby leading to the formation of a eukaryotic cell. Within these chimeric models, some studies further claim that mitochondria originated from a bacterial ancestor while others emphasize the role of endosymbiotic processes behind the origin of mitochondria.

Based on the process of [[Symbiosis#Mutualism|mutualistic symbiosis]], the hypotheses can be categorized as – the serial [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] theory (SET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Margulis L |title=Origin of Eukaryotic Cells. |year=1970 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Margulis L |title=Symbiosis in Cell Evolution. |year=1993 |publisher=W.

According to serial endosymbiotic theory (championed by [[Lynn Margulis]]), a union between a motile [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacterium (like ''Spirochaeta'') and a thermoacidophilic [[crenarchaeon]] (like ''Thermoplasma'' which is sulfidogenic in nature) gave rise to the present day eukaryotes. This union established a motile organism capable of living in the already existing acidic and sulfurous waters. Oxygen is known to cause toxicity to organisms that lack the required [[Metabolism|metabolic]] machinery. Thus, the archaeon provided the bacterium with a highly beneficial reduced environment (sulfur and sulfate were reduced to sulfide). In microaerophilic conditions, oxygen was reduced to water thereby creating a mutual benefit platform. The bacterium on the other hand, contributed the necessary [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] products and [[electron]] acceptors along with its motility feature to the archaeon thereby gaining a swimming [[motility]] for the organism. From a consortium of bacterial and archaeal DNA originated the nuclear [[genome]] of eukaryotic cells. [[Spirochete]]s gave rise to the motile features of eukaryotic cells. Endosymbiotic unifications of the ancestors of alpha-proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, led to the origin of mitochondria and [[plastid]]s respectively. For example, ''Thiodendron'' has been known to have originated via an [[Ectosymbiosis|ectosymbiotic]] process based on a similar [[syntrophy]] of sulfur existing between the two types of bacteria – ''Desulphobacter'' and ''Spirochaeta''. However, such an association based on motile symbiosis have never been observed practically. Also there is no evidence of archaeans and spirochetes adapting to intense acid-based environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors = Latorre A, Durban A, Moya A, Pereto J  |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3oFebknu1cC&amp;pg=PA326 |chapter=The role of symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution  |title=Origins and Evolution of Life: An Astrobiological Perspective |editor-last1=Gargaud |editor-first1=Muriel |editor-last2=López-Garcìa |editor-first2=Purificación |editor-last3=Martin |editor-first3=Hervé | name-list-format = vanc |year=2011 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=326–39 |isbn=978-0-521-76131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hydrogen hypothesis, the symbiotic linkage of an anaerobic and [[autotroph]]ic methanogenic archaeon (host) with an alpha-proteobacterium (the symbiont) gave rise to the eukaryotes. The host utilized [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) to produce [[methane]] while the symbiont, capable of aerobic respiration, expelled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and {{CO2}} as byproducts of anaerobic fermentation process. The host's methanogenic environment worked as a sink for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which resulted in heightened bacterial fermentation. Endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) acted as a catalyst for the host to acquire the symbionts' [[carbohydrate]] metabolism and turn [[heterotroph]]ic in nature. Subsequently, the host's methane forming capability was lost. Thus, the origins of the heterotrophic organelle (symbiont) are identical to the origins of the eukaryotic [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]. In this hypothesis, the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the selective force that forged eukaryotes out of prokaryotes.{{citation needed |date=March 2017}}

The syntrophy hypothesis was developed in contrast to the hydrogen hypothesis and proposes the existence of two symbiotic events. According to this theory, the origin of eukaryotic cells was based on metabolic symbiosis (syntrophy) between a methanogenic archaeon and a delta-proteobacterium. This syntrophic symbiosis was initially facilitated by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transfer between different species under anaerobic environments. In earlier stages, an alpha-proteobacterium became a member of this integration, and later developed into the mitochondrion. [[Gene]] transfer from a delta-proteobacterium to an archaeon led to the methanogenic archaeon developing into a nucleus. The archaeon constituted the genetic apparatus, while the delta-proteobacterium contributed towards the [[cytoplasm]]ic features. This theory incorporates two selective forces at the time of nucleus [[evolution]] – (a) presence of metabolic partitioning to avoid the harmful effects of the co-existence of [[Anabolism|anabolic]] and [[Catabolism|catabolic]] cellular pathways, and (b) prevention of abnormal [[protein biosynthesis]] due to a vast spread of [[intron]]s in the archaeal genes after acquiring the mitochondrion and losing [[methanogenesis]].{{citation needed |date=March 2017}}

'''Gregg Toland''', [[A.S.C.]] (May 29, 1904&amp;nbsp;– September 28, 1948) was an American [[cinematographer]] known for his innovative use of techniques such as [[deep focus]], examples of which can be found in his work on [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946), and [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Long Voyage Home]]'' (1940). Toland was voted as one of the top 10 (actually 11 with a tie) most influential cinematographers in the history of films by the [[International Cinematographers Guild]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/top-10-most-influential-cinematographers-voted-on-by-camera-guild.47138561/|title=Top 10 Most Influential Cinematographers Voted on by Camera Guild|work=IGN Boards|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/icg-announces-top-10-influential-cinematographers/415189|title=ICG Announces Top 10 Influential Cinematographers|date=2014-06-09|work=Creative Planet Network|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907082404/http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/icg-announces-top-10-influential-cinematographers/415189|archive-date=2017-09-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Toland was born in [[Charleston, Illinois]] on May 29, 1904 to Jennie, a [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], and Frank Toland. His mother moved to California several years after his parents divorced in 1910.

He first demonstrated his [[chiaroscuro]], side-lit style on the short film ''[[The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra]]'' (1928), on which one of the two 400W bulbs they had available burned out, leaving only a single bulb to light with.

During the 1930s, Toland became the youngest cameraman in [[Hollywood]] but soon one of its most sought-after cinematographers. Over a seven-year span (1936–1942), he was nominated five times for the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]], including an Academy Award for his work on ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' (1939).  He worked with many of the leading directors of his era, including [[John Ford]], [[Howard Hawks]], [[Erich von Stroheim]], [[King Vidor]], [[Orson Welles]], and [[William Wyler]].

Just before his death, he was concentrating on the "ultimate focus" lens, which makes both near and far objects equally distinct.  "Just before he died he had worked out a new lens with which he had made spectacular shots. He carried in his wallet a strip of film taken with this lens, of which he was very proud. It was a shot of a face three inches from the lens, filling one-third of the left side of the frame. Three feet from the lens, in the center of the foreground, was another face, and then, over a hundred yards away was the rear wall of the studio, showing telephone wires and architectural details. Everything was in focus, from three inches to infinity".&lt;ref&gt;Wyler, William. ''Sequence'' #8, Summer 1949, p. 09&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in his sleep, in [[Los Angeles, California]] on September 28, 1948 of [[coronary thrombosis]] at age 44. He is interred in the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Hollywood, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Contributions on ''Citizen Kane''==
[[File:Citizen-Kane-Filming-Low-Angle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Orson Welles]] and Gregg Toland at work on ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941); the camera appears to be one of the very few brand-new [[Mitchell Camera]] Corp BNCs which were made before the World War II embargo on the manufacture of new production cameras (excepting those intended for the U.S. Army Signal Corps and U.S. allies).]]
Some film historians believe ''[[Citizen Kane]]'''s visual brilliance was due primarily to the contributions of Toland, rather than director [[Orson Welles]]. However, many Welles scholars maintain that the visual style of ''Kane'' is similar to many of Welles's other films, and hence should be considered the director's work. Nevertheless, the Welles movies that most resemble ''Citizen Kane'' (''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'', and ''[[Touch of Evil]]'') were shot by Toland collaborators [[Stanley Cortez]] and [[Russell Metty]] (at [[RKO]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

At the time ''Kane'' was produced and released, Welles and Toland (among others) insisted that Welles gave lighting instructions that fall normally under the director of photography's responsibility. Many of the transitions in the film are done as lighting cues on set (such as the transition at the opening of the film from the outside of Xanadu into Kane's bedroom for his death), where lights are dimmed up and down on stage. Apparently, Welles was unaware that one could achieve the effects optically on a film so he instructed the crew to dim the lights the way you would on a theater production, which led to the unique dissolves. Different areas of the frame dissolve at different times, based on the lighting cue.  However, the visuals were truly a collaboration, as Toland contributed great amounts of technical expertise that Welles needed so that he could achieve his vision. Years later, Welles acknowledged, "Toland was advising him on camera placement and lighting effects secretly so the young director would not be embarrassed in front of the highly experienced crew."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/toland.htm Gregg Toland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovations in ''The Long Voyage Home'' (1940) and ''Citizen Kane'' (1941)==
Toland's techniques were revolutionary in the art of cinematography. Cinematographers before him used a shallow [[depth of field]] to separate the various planes on the screen, creating an impression of space as well as stressing what mattered in the frame by leaving the rest (the foreground or background) out of focus.

In Toland's lighting schemes, shadow became a much more compelling tool, both dramatically and pictorially, to separate the foreground from the background and so to create space within a two-dimensional frame while keeping all of the picture in focus. According to Toland, this visual style was more comparable with what the eyes see in real life since vision blurs what is ''not'' looked at rather than what is.

For [[John Ford]]'s ''The Long Voyage Home'' (1940), Toland leaned more heavily on back-projection to create his deep focus compositions, such as the shot of the island women singing to entice the men of the SS Glencairn. He continued to develop the technologies that would allow for him to create his images in ''Citizen Kane''.

==Deep focus technique and lighting schemes==

Toland innovated extensively on ''Citizen Kane'', creating deep focus on a sound-stage, collaborating with set designer [[Perry Ferguson]] so ceilings would be visible in the frame by stretching bleached muslin to stand in as a ceiling, allowing placement of the microphone closer to the action without being seen in frame.  He also modified the [[Mitchell Camera]] to allow a wider range of movement, especially from low angles.  ″It was Toland who devised a remote-control system for focusing his camera lens without having to get in the way of the camera operator who would now be free to pan and tilt the camera."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Roger Dale “Gregg Toland—His Contributions to Cinema,” University Microfilms International, Ann Arbor, 1976. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The main way to achieve deep focus was closing down the [[aperture]], which required increasing the lighting intensity, lenses with better [[Anti-reflective coating|light transmission]], and faster [[film stock]]. On ''Citizen Kane'', the cameras and coated lenses used were of Toland's own design working in conjunction with engineers from Caltech. His lenses were treated with [[Anti-reflective coating#History|Vard Opticoat]]&lt;ref&gt;Ogle, Patrick “Technological and Aesthetic Influences Upon the Development of Deep Focus Cinematography in the United States,” Screen vol. 13, no. 1, Spring 1972. p. 95-96. Among the many technical advances discussed by Ogle in his article is the “Vard” opticoating system, where chemicals are applied to the lenses enabling an increase in speed such that the lens can be further stopped down, creating more depth of field. Developed at Caltech with the input of Toland, they were scarce before their use in ''Kane'', the only major example being the use of Bausch &amp; Lomb lenses for the projection of ''Gone with the Wind'' in theatres.&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce glare and increase light transmission. He used the [[Kodak]] Super XX film stock, which was, at the time, the fastest film available, with an ASA [[film speed]] of 100. Toland had worked closely with a Kodak representative during the stock's creation before its release in October 1938, and was one of the first cinematographers using it heavily on set.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Wallace Roger “Gregg Toland—His Contributions to Cinema,” University Microfilms International, 1976 p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Lens apertures employed on most productions were usually within the f/2.3 to f/3.5 range; Toland shot his scenes in between f/8 and f/16.  This was possible because several elements of technology came together at once: the [[technicolor]] three strip process, which required the development of more powerful lights, had been developed and the more powerful [[Arc lamp#Carbon arc lamp|Carbon Arc]] light was beginning to be used.  By utilizing these lights with the faster stock, Toland was able to achieve apertures previously unattainable on a stage shoot.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, George: “A Great Cameraman,” Films in Review, December 1956, p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical print shots and in-camera composites on ''Citizen Kane''==

Gregg Toland collaborated on a number of shots with [[special effects|special-effects]] cinematographer [[Linwood G. Dunn]]. Although these looked like they were using deep focus, they were actually a [[Composite image|composite]] of two different shots. Some of these shots were composited with an [[optical printer]], a device which Dunn improved upon over the years, which explains why foreground and background are both in focus even though the lenses and film stock used in 1941 could not allow for such [[depth of field]].

But Toland hated this technique, since he felt he was "duping," (i.e. a copy of a copy) thereby lowering the quality of his shots. Thus other shots (like the shot of Susan Alexander Kane's bedroom after her suicide attempt, with a glass in the foreground and Kane entering the room in the background) were in-camera composites, meaning the film was [[double exposure|exposed twice]]—another technique that Linwood Dunn improved upon.

==Similarities between ''Citizen Kane'' and ''The Long Voyage Home''==

Toland had already had experience with heavy in-camera compositing, and many of the shots in ''Kane'' look similar in composition and dynamics to a number of shots in John Ford's ''[[The Long Voyage Home]]''.

For instance, both movies contain shots that create an artificial lighting situation such that a character is lit in the background and walks or runs through dark areas to the foreground, where his arrival triggers, off-screen, a light not on before. The result is so visually dramatic because a character moves, only barely visible, through vast pools of shadow, only to exit the shadow very close to the camera, where his whole face is suddenly completely lit. This use of much more shadow than light, soon one of the main techniques of [[low-key lighting]], heavily influenced [[film noir]].

''The Long Voyage Home'' and ''Citizen Kane'' share a number of other striking similarities:

*Both films allowed lenses at times to distort faces in [[close-up]], especially during low-key lighting sequences described above.
*Sets, both interiors and exteriors, were lit mostly from the floor instead of from the rafters high above. A radical departure from Hollywood's traditional lighting, this technique also took much longer to execute, thus contributing significantly to production costs. However, the effect was strikingly more realistic, since light sources placed closer to the characters allowed softer lighting, which lights placed far above the set could not produce.
*Both directors, Welles as well as Ford, put Toland's credit as cinematographer on screen at the same time as their own credit as director (director/producer in Welles's case), an unusual and conspicuously generous tribute; in both films, Toland's credit was also the same size as the director's.

==Other important works==
Although ''Citizen Kane'' is his most well-regarded achievement, his style was much more varied than most people realize. For ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940), he took inspiration from [[Dorothea Lange]]'s photographs, achieving a rare (for Hollywood) gritty and realist look. For one of his final projects, Toland turned to [[Technicolor]] film. Made for Disney, the 1946 ''[[Song of the South]]'' combined animation with live action in bright, deeply saturated Technicolor.  In ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' his deep focus cinematography served to highlight all the aspects of the characters' lives.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, p. 154. “Obviously, ''Best Years'' performed no greater function than that of forcing people to focus, much in the fashion of Toland’s camera, on all the elements that constituted the reality of the times.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service during World War II==
When the [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]] (predecessor to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and later the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) was created by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] before the United States' entry into World War II, Toland was recruited to work in the agency's film unit.&lt;ref&gt;P. 111 in Persico, Joseph E. 2001. ''Roosevelt's Secret War: FDR and World War II Espionage.'' New York: Random House. 536 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Toland was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Navy's camera department, which led to his only work as a director, ''[[December 7th: The Movie]]'' (1943); this documentary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which Toland co-directed with John Ford, is so realistic in its restaged footage that many today mistake it for actual attack footage. This 82-minute film took the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)]].

==Media==
In addition to sharing a title card with Orson Welles on Kane—an indication of the high esteem the director held for his cameraman—Welles also gave Toland a cameo in the film as the reporter who is slow to ask questions when Kane returns from Europe.

[[File:Title_Card_for_Citizen_Kane.jpg|thumb|right|The final ending Title Card for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', placing Toland on same card as [[Orson Welles]], the Director, because Welles felt he deserved it; there was only one beginning Title Card, which stated, simply, "CITIZEN KANE", in total silence.]]

Toland was the subject of an "Annals of Hollywood" article in ''The New Yorker'', "The Cameraman," by Hilton Als (June 19, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;46).

[[File:Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing.jpg|thumb|Drawing by Spöring]]

== Early life ==
He was born in 1733 {{Citation needed|reason=According to fi.wiki there is no certainty about his birth year|date=November 2018}} in the [[Finland|Finnish]] town of [[Turku]], at that time the major Finnish city and administrative center under the Kingdom of [[Sweden]]. He was the son of an amateur naturalist and professor of Medicine at the [[Academy of Åbo]], [[Herman Spöring Sr.]] (1701–1747). Spöring Jr. attended the Academy as a youth, studying medicine under his father.

Sometime around 1755, at the age of 22 he went to [[London]], where he worked at a [[watchmaker]]s. During this time he became acquainted with the Swedish naturalist [[Daniel Solander]], who employed him as a personal clerk for a time.

In 1768 Spöring was enlisted as a clerk, assistant naturalist and personal secretary in the entourage of [[Joseph Banks]], a wealthy young botanist who was preparing for an expedition sponsored by the [[Royal Society]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This expedition had as one of its principal goals the observation of the [[transit of Venus]]; however it was also intended to make scientific studies of the flora and fauna of any new lands encountered. Indeed, the confidential purpose of the voyage (in particular, from the point of view of the British [[Admiralty]]) was to seek out the hypothetical "unknown southern continent", or''Terra Australis (Incognita)''.

The other noted naturalist on the voyage was Daniel Solander, Spöring's former employer who had recommended Spöring for the post when he himself signed up. Solander was a former student and protégé of the noted Swedish botanist and founder of modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[Carl Linnaeus]].

Spöring was also a skilled instrument maker, and in addition to his cataloging duties was assigned the maintenance and upkeep of the ship's scientific equipment during the voyage.

== Voyage to the Pacific ==
The expedition left England in 1768, aboard [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] under the command of [[Royal Navy|R.N.]] [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[James Cook]], bound for the [[Society Islands]] (present-day [[Tahiti]]). They arrived there in 1769, where the observations of Venus were taken during the transit on June 3. Spöring had to repair the astronomical [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] after it had become damaged when it was taken by the local [[Polynesia]]n inhabitants.

Leaving the Society Islands, the expedition sailed southwards, reaching [[New Zealand]], where Spöring and the other naturalists spent the ensuing months gathering and documenting specimens of native plant and animal life. At a bay now known as [[Tolaga Bay]] (not far from the modern township of [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]]), Cook bestowed the name '''[[Spöring Island]]''' to a landmark, after the botanist. The island is today known by its original [[Māori language|Māori]] name, ''Pourewa''.

The expedition continued westwards, and in 1770 the ''Endeavour'' encountered the southeastern coastline of the [[Australia]]n continent, and became the first European vessel to have navigated the eastern side of the continent. The expedition made first landfall at a site Cook named [[Botany Bay]], very near the site at which 18 years later the colony of [[Sydney]] would be established. Banks, Solander and Spöring collected further unique specimens from this site. This collection would be greatly augmented later when the ''Endeavour'' was laid up for several weeks for repairs, after having run aground on a section of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] much further to the north. The naturalists availed themselves of the opportunity whilst repairs were being made to continue their compilation of new species.

Once repairs were made the expedition continued northwards to the [[East Indies]] port of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (Jakarta). Until this point in the voyage, no crewmember or passenger had been lost to disease; however, the unhealthy conditions of the port and their new provisions would soon result in quite a few deaths, including that of Spöring himself. In 1771 on the return leg, Spöring died of [[dysentery]] complications related to [[food poisoning]]. He was buried at sea on January 24, 1771.

== Achievements and commemorations ==
He has a commemorative statue dedicated to him in [[Sydney]], Australia.

In 1990, a rock taken from Pourewa (Spöring) Island was transported to Spöring's birthplace of Åbo, Finland, to be placed in a monument set up to commemorate his achievements and ties with New Zealand, as the first Finn to have landed there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Scandinavians/1/ENZ-Resources/Standard/1/en Spöring Island and monument]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.captaincooksociety.com/ccsu41130.htm "Turku and the Spöring Memorial"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst his achievements are the discovery and illustration of a number of hitherto-unknown Australian species. His colleagues and successors who studied his materials have recognised the accuracy and form of his drawings and annotations. His efforts, along with those of others on the voyage provided critical new materials for study, which allowed further advances in the historical development of the theory of [[evolution]] to be made.

In early [[embryogenesis]] of most [[eutherian]] mammals, the '''inner cell mass''' (abbreviated '''ICM''' and also known as the '''embryoblast''' in mammals or [[pluriblast]]) is the mass of cells inside the primordial [[embryo]] that will eventually give rise to the definitive structures of the [[fetus]]. This structure forms in the earliest steps of development, before [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] into the [[endometrium]] of the [[uterus]] has occurred. The ICM lies within the [[blastocoele]] (more correctly termed "blastocyst cavity," as it is not strictly homologous to the blastocoele of [[Anamniotes|anamniote]] vertebrates) and is entirely surrounded by the single layer of cells called [[trophoblast]].

==Further development==
The physical and functional separation of the inner cell mass from the trophectoderm (TE) is a special feature of mammalian development and is the first cell lineage specification in these embryos.  Following fertilization in the oviduct, the mammalian embryo undergoes a relatively slow round of cleavages to produce an eight cell [[morula]].  Each cell of the morula, called a blastomere, increases surface contact with its neighbors in a process called compaction.  This results in a polarization of the cells within the morula, and further cleavage yields a [[blastocyst]] of roughly 32 cells.&lt;ref name=Wolpert&gt;Wolpert, Lewis. Principles of Development: Third Edition. 2007.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  In mice, about 12 internal cells comprise the new inner cell mass and 20 – 24 cells comprise the surrounding trophectoderm.&lt;ref name=Marikawa&gt;Marikawa, Yusuke, et al. Establishment of Trophectoderm and Inner Cell Mass Lineages in the Mouse Embryo. Molecular Reproduction &amp; Development 76:1019–1032 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Suwinska&gt;Suwinska A, Czołowska R, Ozdze_nski W, Tarkowski AK. 2008. Blastomeres of the mouse embryo lose totipotency after the fifth cleavage division: Expression of Cdx2 and Oct4 and developmental potential of inner and outer blastomeres of 16- and 32-cell embryos. Dev Biol 322:133–144.&lt;/ref&gt; There is variation between species of mammals as to number of cells at compaction with bovine embryos showing differences related to compaction as early as 9-15 cells and in rabbits not until after 32 cells.&lt;ref&gt;Koyama ''et al'' [http://www.biolreprod.org/content/50/1/163.full.pdf Analysis of Polarity of Bovine and Rabbit Embryos by Scanning Electron Microscopy] Biol of Reproduction, 50, 163-170 1994&lt;/ref&gt; There is also interspecies variation in gene expression patterns in early embryos.&lt;ref&gt;Kuijk, ''et al'' [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/58/ Validation of reference genes for quantitative RT-PCR studies in porcine oocytes and preimplantation embryos] BMC Developmental Biology 2007, 7:58  doi:10.1186/1471-213X-7-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICM and the TE will generate distinctly different cell types as implantation starts and embryogenesis continues.  Trophectoderm cells form extraembryonic tissues, which act in a supporting role for the embryo proper. Furthermore, these cells pump fluid into the interior of the blastocyst, causing the formation of a polarized blastocyst with the ICM attached to the trophectoderm at one end (see figure). This difference in cellular localization causes the ICM cells exposed to the fluid cavity to adopt a primitive endoderm (or hypoblast) fate, while the remaining cells adopt a primitive ectoderm (or epiblast) fate. The [[hypoblast]] contributes to extraembryonic membranes and the [[epiblast]] will give rise to the ultimate embryo proper as well as some extraembryonic tissues.&lt;ref name=Wolpert/&gt;

==Regulation of cellular specification==
Since segregation of pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass from the remainder of the blastocyst is integral to mammalian development, considerable research has been performed to elucidate the corresponding cellular and molecular mechanisms of this process. There is primary interest in which transcription factors and signaling molecules direct blastomere asymmetric divisions leading to what are known as inside and outside cells and thus cell lineage specification. However, due to the variability and regulative nature of mammalian embryos, experimental evidence for establishing these early fates remains incomplete.&lt;ref name=Marikawa/&gt;

At the transcription level, the transcription factors Oct4, Nanog, Cdx2, and Tead4 have all been implicated in establishing and reinforcing the specification of the ICM and the TE in early mouse embryos.&lt;ref name=Marikawa/&gt; [[File:ICM signaling.jpg|thumb|Early embryo apical and basolateral polarization is established at the 8-16 cell stage following compaction. This initial difference in environment strengthens a transcriptional feedback loop in either an internal or external direction.  Inside cells express high levels of ''Oct4'' which maintains pluripotency and suppresses ''Cdx2''.  Outside cells express high levels of ''Cdx2'' which causes TE differentiation and suppresses ''Oct4''.]]
*Oct4: ''Oct4'' is expressed in the ICM and participate in maintaining its pluripotency, a role that has been recapitulated in ICM derived mouse embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;Nichols J, Zevnik B, Anastassiadis K, Niwa H, Klewe-Nebenius D, Chambers I, Sch€oler H, Smith A. 1998. Formation of pluripotent stem cells in the mammalian embryo depends on the POU transcription factor Oct4. Cell 95:379–391.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oct4'' genetic knockout cells both in vivo and in culture display TE morphological characteristics. It has been shown that one transcriptional target of Oct4 is the ''Fgf4'' gene. This gene normally encodes a ligand secreted by the ICM, which induces proliferation in the adjacent polar TE.&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt;
*Nanog:  ''Nanog'' is also expressed in the ICM and participates in maintaining its pluripotency. In contrast with ''Oct4'', studies of ''Nanog''-null mice do not show the reversion of the ICM to a TE-like morphology, but demonstrate that loss of ''Nanog'' prevents the ICM from generating primitive endoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda DJ, Chew JL, Lim LH, Loh YH, Wang B, Ng HH, Robson P. 2005. Transcriptional regulation of nanog by OCT4 and SOX2. J Biol Chem 280:24731–24737.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cdx2: ''Cdx2'' is strongly expressed in the TE and is required for maintaining its specification. Knockout mice for the ''Cdx2'' gene undergo compaction, but lose the TE epithelial integrity during the late blastocyst stage. Furthermore, ''Oct4'' expression is subsequently raised in these TE cells, indicating Cdx2 plays a role in suppressing ''Oct4'' in this cell lineage.  Moreover, embryonic stem cells can be generated from ''Cdx2''-null mice, demonstrating that Cdx2 is not essential for ICM specification.&lt;ref name=Strumpf&gt;Strumpf D, Mao CA, Yamanaka Y, Ralston A, Chawengsaksophak K, Beck F, Rossant J. 2005. Cdx2 is required for correct cell fate specification and differentiation of trophectoderm in the mouse blastocyst. Development 132:2093–2102.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tead4: Like ''Cdx2'', ''Tead4'' is required for TE function, although the transcription factor is expressed ubiquitously.  ''Tead4''-null mice similarly undergo compaction, but fail to generate the blastocoel cavity. Like ''Cdx2''-null embryos, the Tead4-null embryos can yield embryonic stem cells, indicating that Tead4 is dispensable for ICM specification.&lt;ref&gt;Nishioka N, Yamamoto S, Kiyonari H, Sato H, Sawada A, Ota M, Nakao K, Sasaki H. 2008. ''Tead4'' is required for specification of trophectoderm in pre-implantation mouse embryos. Mech Dev 125:270–283.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has shown that ''Tead4'' may help to upregulate Cdx2 in the TE and its transcriptional activity depends on the coactivator Yap. Yap’s nuclear localization in outside cells allows it to contribute to TE specificity, whereas inside cells sequester Yap in the cytoplasm through a phosphorylation event.&lt;ref&gt;Nishioka N, et al. 2009. The Hippo signaling pathway components Lats and Yap pattern Tead4 activity to distinguish mouse trophectoderm from inner cell mass. Dev Cell 16: 398–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together these transcription factors function in a [[positive feedback]] loop that strengthens the ICM to TE cellular allocation. Initial polarization of blastomeres occurs at the 8-16 cell stage.  An apical-basolateral polarity is visible through the visualization of apical markers such as Par3, Par6, and aPKC as well as the basal marker E-Cadherin.&lt;ref name=Marikawa/&gt; The establishment of such a polarity during compaction is thought to generate an environmental identity for inside and outside cells of the embryo.  Consequently, stochastic expression of the above transcription factors is amplified into a feedback loop that specifies outside cells to a TE fate and inside cells to an ICM fate. In the model, an apical environment turns on ''Cdx2'', which upregulates its own expression through a downstream transcription factor, Elf5. In concert with a third transcription factor, Eomes, these genes act to suppress pluripotency genes like ''Oct4'' and ''Nanog'' in the outside cells.&lt;ref name=Marikawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strumpf/&gt; Thus, TE becomes specified and differentiates.  Inside cells, however, do not turn on the ''Cdx2'' gene, and express high levels of ''Oct4'', ''Nanog'', and ''Sox2''.&lt;ref name=Marikawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suwinska/&gt; These genes suppress ''Cdx2'' and the inside cells maintain pluripotency generate the ICM and eventually the rest of the embryo proper. 
 
Although this dichotomy of genetic interactions is clearly required to divide the blastomeres of the mouse embryo into both the ICM and TE identities, the initiation of these feedback loops remains under debate. Whether they are established stochastically or through an even earlier asymmetry is unclear, and current research seeks to identify earlier markers of asymmetry. For example, some research correlates the first two cleavages during embryogenesis with respect to the prospective animal and vegetal poles with ultimate specification. The asymmetric division of epigenetic information during these first two cleavages, and the orientation and order in which they occur, may contribute to a cell’s position either inside or outside the morula.&lt;ref&gt;Bischoff, Marcus, et al. Formation of the embryonic-abembryonic axis of the mouse blastocyst: relationships between orientation of early cleavage divisions and pattern of symmetric/asymmetric divisions. Development 135, 953-962 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jedrusik, Agnieszka, et al. Role of Cdx2 and cell polarity in cell allocation and specification of trophectoderm and inner cell mass in the mouse embryo. Genes Dev. 2008 22: 2692-2706&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stem cells==
Blastomeres isolated from the ICM of mammalian embryos and grown in culture are known as embryonic stem (ES) cells. These pluripotent cells, when grown in a carefully coordinated media, can give rise to all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) of the adult body.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;Robertson, Elizabeth , et al. Germ-line transmission of genes introduced into cultured pluripotential cells by retroviral vector. Nature 323, 445 - 448 (2 October 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the transcription factor LIF4 is required for mouse ES cells to be maintained in vitro.&lt;ref&gt;Smith AG, Heath JK, Donaldson DD, Wong GG, Moreau J, Stahl M and Rogers D (1988) Inhibition of pluripotential embryonic stem cell differentiation by purified polypeptides. Nature, 336, 688–690&lt;/ref&gt; Blastomeres are dissociated from an isolated ICM in an early blastocyst, and their transcriptional code governed by ''Oct4'', ''Sox2'', and ''Nanog'' helps maintain an undifferentiated state.

One benefit to the regulative nature in which mammalian embryos develop is the manipulation of blastomeres of the ICM to generate [[knockout mice]].  In mouse, mutations in a gene of interest can be introduced retrovirally into cultured ES cells, and these can be reintroduced into the ICM of an intact embryo.  The result is a chimeric mouse, which develops with a portion of its cells containing the ES cell genome. The aim of such a procedure is to incorporate the mutated gene into the germ line of the mouse such that its progeny will be missing one or both alleles of the gene of interest. Geneticists widely take advantage of this ICM manipulation technique in studying the function of genes in the mammalian system.&lt;ref name=Wolpert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robertson/&gt;

About six months after the [[invasion of Iraq]] rumors of '''Iraq prison abuse scandals''' started to emerge.

The best known abuse incidents occurred at the large [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. Graphic pictures of some of those abuse incidents were made public. Less well-known abuse incidents have been documented at American prisons throughout [[Iraq]].

==Timeline of events==
According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the coalition forces regularly use "[[torture]]-like" methods during the interrogation of suspects. Such methods were reportedly applied to people to find the hiding place of [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]]. [[British troops]] have also on occasion been accused of abusing Iraqi detainees. Such treatment violates article 17 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] and the [[United States|USA]] and [[UK|Britain]]'s official policies on [[combat]] and [[Military occupation|occupation]]. Despite numerous complaints by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], it took a year before the first US soldier was [[court-martial]]ed for their actions concerning abuse of Iraqis.

===Unknown date===
Eight [[United States Marine Corps|marine]] reservists were investigated for abuse and the death of a prisoner, outside [[Nasiriyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2555551 |date=May 7, 2004 |title=Details emerge of past cases |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050913182100/http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2555551 |archivedate=September 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph leaked after the initial set shows Spc. [[Sabrina Harman]] smiling and giving a [[thumbs signal|thumbs up]] next to the body of [[Manadel al-Jamadi]]. Jamadi was reportedly beaten to death during interrogations in the prison's showers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6988054/| title=Reports detail Abu Ghraib prison death; was it torture?| first=Seth| last=Hettena| date=February 17, 2005| publisher=MSNBC| accessdate=2006-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Death certificates repeatedly stated that prisoners had died "while sleeping", and of "natural reasons". Iraqi doctors are not allowed to investigate the deaths of prisoners, even if death certificates are allegedly forged. No investigations against US military doctors who are alleged to have forged death certificates have been reported.

===Spring 2003===
A US veteran sergeant reports witnessing torture of journalists and writers all over Iraq. Kurdistan region was not an exception. Writers without Borders embarrassed the Iraqi government quite frequently in reports covering minority, women and marginalised Iraqis from all over the country but with much focus on Baghdad, Karkuk, Salahedin and Mosul.

Honorably discharged US veteran, Sergeant Frank "Greg" Ford reports that he witnessed war crimes in Samarra, Iraq. According to Ford, several members of his own unit, the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade participated in the torture of Iraqi detainees as young as 14.&lt;ref name="Whitewashing Torture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacifica.org/programs/dn/041209.html |title=Democracy Now! |publisher=Pacifica.org |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205174712/http://www.pacifica.org/programs/dn/041209.html |archivedate=February 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:n:Veteran sergeant accounts US torture coverup|Veteran sergeant accounts US torture coverup]] (Wikinews)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Bartlam, a British soldier of the [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Brigade]], was arrested after submitting film to a photo developers shop in [[Tamworth, England]] while on leave. The photographs depict a gagged Iraqi POW suspended hanging by rope from a fork lift, and other pictures seem to show prisoners being forced to perform sexual acts. Bartlam and two other soldiers were convicted at court martial of abuse - a fourth soldier was cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/4283255.stm| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710195815/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/4283255.stm| archive-date=10 July 2012| date=23 February 2005| title=Photos led to abuse convictions| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2007-01-11 | location=London| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

British Lieutenant Colonel [[Tim Collins (soldier)|Tim Collins]] was alleged by US Army Major [[Re Biastre]] to have been responsible for mistreatment of Iraqi civilians and prisoners of war. Lieutenant Colonel Collins was later cleared of any wrongdoing by an MOD investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/3198047.stm| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720013037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/3198047.stm| archive-date=20 July 2012| date=1 September 2003| title=Officer cleared of Iraqi war crimes| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2007-01-11 | location=London| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2003===
In separate incidents, the Royal Military Police declared that Radhi Natna died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while in British custody, yet his family reports that he had no heart trouble; and the [[Royal Highland Regiment|Black Watch regiment]] arrested the 17-year-old Ahmad Jabber Kareem Ali in Basra, who then drowned after being ordered to swim across a river despite not being able to swim, according to his friend Ayad Salim Hanoon.&lt;ref name="mirror 14210212"/&gt;

[[United States Army Reserve|Army Reservists]] abused Prisoners at [[Camp Bucca]], and were later [[court-martial]]ed.

[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ennis Whitehead III]] reported that [[Master Sergeant]] [[Lisa Marie Girman]], a state trooper, "repeatedly kick[ed a prisoner] in the [[groin]], [[abdomen]] and head, and encouraging her subordinate [[soldier]]s to do the same,"

[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Vic Harris reported that [[Staff Sergeant]] [[Scott A. McKenzie]] who worked at a [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]] [[Basic Combat Training|boot-camp]]-style [[prison]], and  [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] [[Timothy F. Canjar]]: held prisoners' legs, encouraged others to then kick them in the groin, stepped on their previously injured arms, and made false sworn statements to the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army Criminal Investigation Division]].

They received [[Military discharge|"general under honorable conditions" discharges]], were ordered to forfeit two months' salary, and returned to the United States.

[[Sergeant]] [[Shawna Edmondson]], also involved in the case, received an "other-than-honorable" discharge, after she requested it instead of being court-martialed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001830549_discharge06.html |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=January 6, 2004 |title=3 reservists discharged from Army after abuse |first=Diana |last=Elias |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010024050/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001830549_discharge06.html |archivedate=October 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July to December 2003===
American forces detained the family of an unidentified lieutenant general to induce him to turn himself in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A54345-2003Jul27| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918100436/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A54345-2003Jul27| dead-url=yes| archive-date=September 18, 2012|  title=U.S. Adopts Aggressive Tactics on Iraqi Fighters| first=Thomas E.| last=Ricks| publisher=Washington Post| date=July 28, 2003| page=A01| accessdate=2006-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse|abuses at Abu Ghraib prison]] were reportedly committed by MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/05/06/AR2005040206744.html| title=New Prison Images Emerge| first= Christian| last=Davenport| date=May 6, 2004| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are allegations that private contractors contributed to them as well and that intelligence agencies such as the [[CIA]] ordered them to do so in order to break prisoners for interrogations. It is said to be a usual practice in other US prisons as well, such as in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Camp X-Ray|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11017-2004May8.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022030050/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11017-2004May8.html| archive-date=2012-10-22| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-05-27 | work=The Washington Post| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] submitted a detailed report to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in October 2003 about abuses in prisons, and the president of the Red Cross stated he had informed high-ranking members of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration about the abuses during a meeting in the [[White House]] in January 2004. A soldier came forward that month with photos of abuse that he found disturbing, some showed the stacking of prisoners into a human pyramid, with one prisoner's skin visibly bearing a slur written in English. Another showed a prisoner being forced to stand on a box with wires attached to his head and hands, who had reportedly been told that if he fell off the box, he would be electrocuted. Photos released to the public later included a person being attacked by a guard dog, which the soldier involved described as being useful for intimidation of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorker.com/printable/?fact/040517fa_fact2 |title=404 error |accessdate=2006-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205005825/http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?fact%2F040517fa_fact2 |archivedate=February  5, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that an Iraqi hired as a translator raped a juvenile male prisoner while a female soldier took pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43783-2004May20.html| title=New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge| author=Scott Higham and Joe Stephens| publisher=Washington Post| date=May 21, 2004| page=A01| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mg.co.za/Content/l3.asp?ao=66729| title=US general linked to Abu Ghraib abuse| date=22 May 2004| publisher=Mail&amp;Guardian Online| accessdate=2006-05-28| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603013743/http://www.mg.co.za/Content/l3.asp?ao=66729| archivedate=3 June 2004| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges have been brought against the contractor because he does not fall under military jurisdiction; it is questionable whether any charges will or even can be brought against him.

[[Donald Rumsfeld]] had said that army and government had only been informed in January and not in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=0C63AB4B-D343-4A66-9B53F4E2A945EBBC |title=Service Unavailable - Fail to connect |accessdate=2006-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307181449/http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=0C63AB4B-D343-4A66-9B53F4E2A945EBBC |archivedate=2006-03-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2004, a press release was issued by the [[United States Central Command]] (CENTCOM) stating that an investigation had been initiated in response to allegations of detainee abuse at an unspecified detention facility (now known to be Abu Ghraib prison).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20040143.txt| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-05-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051219180146/http://www.centcom.mil/CENTCOMNews/News_Release.asp?NewsRelease=20040143.txt |archivedate = December 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, 6 soldiers in Abu Ghraib were charged with dereliction of duty, cruelty and maltreatment, and sexual abuse. 17 others were suspended from duty, including the seven U.S. officers who ran the prison. Also recommended for discipline was [[Brigadier general|Brig. Gen]] [[Janis Karpinski]], the commander of the 800th brigade. The [[International Red Cross|Red Cross]], which had access to these prisons, has stated that the instances of torture were not aberrations but were systemic. Some officers have attempted to defend themselves by saying that they were only doing their duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4907419/ns/msnbc-about_msnbc_tv/t/deborah-norville-tonight-may/#.Uzh6cPldWSp | title=Deborah Norville MSNBC | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to ongoing complaints, the US military initiated a program to reform the internment and treatment systems. The reforms are expected to increase safeguards for prisoners' rights, to ensure each prisoner receives a copy of their internment order, and has their charges explained to them within 72 hours. They additionally plan to publicly post information about detainees so that family members can know what happened to their loved ones. Reforms were made in March 2004.

Theft of prisoner's possessions by soldiers, dirty, cramped quarters and bad food, prisoners forced into uncomfortable positions for prolonged periods of time, extreme exposure to the elements, and excessive jailings of people based on the paid testimony of individual informants were reported. 55-year-old cafe owner Mahmoud Khodair, who was arrested and held for six months before being released in early march without ever knowing what he was charged with, stated, "It was just like hell", and "Nothing has changed since Saddam. Before, the Mukhabarat [secret police] would take us away, and at least they wouldn't blow down the door. Now, some informant fingers you and gets $100 even if you're innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/03/28/iraqi_detentions_fuel_anti_us_sentiment?mode=PF| title= Iraqi detentions fuel anti-US sentiment| first=Thanassis| last=Cambanis| newspaper=Boston Globe| date=2004-03-28| accessdate=2006-05-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060116163920/http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/03/28/iraqi_detentions_fuel_anti_us_sentiment?mode=PF |archivedate = January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During April 2004 the media started to report on the abuse. The journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] (who was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his disclosure of the [[Vietnam War]] tragedy at the hamlet of [[My Lai]]) published a series of articles in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' with photo coverage of U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] on 2004-04-30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hersh |first=Seymour |date=May 10, 2004 |title=Torture at Abu Ghraib |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Dan Rather, the deputy director of operations for the US-led coalition, Brig. Gen. [[Mark Kimmitt]], stated "We're appalled. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day. They represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down. If we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect, we can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers."

On May 1, 2004, photos of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq being abused and humiliated by United States soldiers provoke an international outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1207572,00.html| title=British investigate 10 claims of abuse| date=May 1, 2004| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=2006-05-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthering the charges, excerpts from the [[Abu Ghraib]] [[Taguba report]]  were published on May 3, 2004. The report documented: the sodomizing of a prisoner with a chemical light, pouring phosphoric liquid on detainees, rape of a female prisoner, forced masturbation, "ghost detainees" moved around to avoid the [[Red Cross]], and many other abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4894033/| title=Key excerpts from the Taguba report| date=May 3, 2004| publisher=MSNBC| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Excerpts From Prison Inquiry | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/03/world/fg-excerpts3| work=Los Angeles Times | date=2004-05-03 | accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the photographs and reports had led to renewed calls for investigations into the abuses reported in other US military prisons, such as [[Camp X-Ray]] and [[Camp Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=14042696_method=full_siteid=50143_headline=-MY-HELL-IN-CAMP-X-RAY-name_page.html| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2004, reporters for the Guardian documented a coercive technique which soldiers called "bitch in a box". The prisoner was shoved into the trunk of a car on a hot day, and driven around until the prisoner was near ready to pass out. Another technique documented was "waterboarding", which involves water being poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. They also interviewed many soldiers not involved in the current scandal, who claimed that they were taught to use [[sleep deprivation]], to stage mock executions, and to use other procedures. One platoon leader who objected to these practices was reportedly told that his stand could end his military career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1216579,00.html| title=US forces were taught torture techniques| first=Suzanne| last=Goldenberg| date=May 14, 2004| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=2006-05-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Secretary of Defense|USA Defence Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] told an armed services committee of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on 2004-05-07 that "There are a lot more photographs and videos that exist [...] I looked at them last night and they're hard to believe [...] The pictures I've seen depict conduct, behaviour that is so brutal and so cruel and so inhumane that anyone engaged in it or involved in it would have to be brought to justice."

In a scene described as "surreal" by AFP, it was found in mid May, 2004 that US troops were handing out cash to freed prisoners along with a note stating "You have not been mistreated.". A reporter visiting the prison Camp War Horse described the tour:

:"Have you been mistreated?" the governor asks the detainees, dressed in orange boilersuits.

:"No. We have never been tortured," chorused those behind bars as some 50 soldiers stood nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/05/17/d40517130288.htm| volume=4| issue=342 | date=May 17, 2004| title=US military now trying to buy abused prisoners| newspaper=The Daily Star| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Daily Mirror'' false allegations====
Alleged photographs of prisoner abuses by UK troops were published by the ''[[The Daily Mirror|Daily Mirror]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/newspapers/1_may_2004/html/3.stm| title=Daily Mirror front page| date=1 May 2004| accessdate=2006-05-28 | work=BBC News | location=London}} (appears to be missing as of last access date)&lt;/ref&gt; within 48 hours of the breaking of the story of abuses by US troops in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq.

[[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|General Sir Mike Jackson]], [[British Army|Chief of the General Staff]], said "if proven, the perpetrators are not fit to wear the Queen's uniform and they have besmirched the Army's good name and conduct".

The authenticity of the photographs was called into question a day later. In particular, a number of specifics in the images, such as the type of rifles the soldiers in the pictures are carrying and the type of truck pictured did not match the equipment used by UK troops in Iraq. The ''Mirror'' responded to these criticisms of the photographs on May 3, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14205311&amp;method=full |date=3 May 2004 |title=xxxx |accessdate=2006-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305090751/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14205311&amp;method=full |archivedate=March 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist Tara McKelvey, writing for the magazine The American Prospect, interviewed an Iraqi sheik in the fall of 2004 about this issue and he told her that "he had seen a young girl, 15 years old, with internal bleeding. She had been raped over and over again by the soldiers, and she could no longer talk. He is a deeply religious man. But that night, he shouted at Allah. ‘How is it possible that you are there and these things are happening?!' he said.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://prospect.org/article/unusual-suspects | title=Usual Subjects | publisher=The American Prospect | accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July 2004===
The International Red Cross reports that more than 100 children were kept in six different prisons of the coalition. Witnesses say US forces also abused children and youths. Soldier Samuel Provance from Abu Ghraib reported the harassment of a 15- to 16-year-old girl in her cell as well as a 16-year-old boy who was driven through the cold after he had been showered and who was then covered with mud. Allegations have been made that children have been subjected to torture and rape. This has been used to make detained parents talk in cases where other interrogation methods have failed. Seymour Hersh told a San Francisco audience: "what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys, children, in cases that have been [video] recorded, the boys were sodomized, with the cameras rolling... the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking." An unpublished [[UNICEF]] report is said to include statements about children that were arrested in Basra and Kerbela and routinely detained in Umm Kasr. The children are said to be without contact to their families and cannot expect a trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/43796] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516101533/http://www.sundayherald.com/43796 |date=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0804/dailyUpdate.html?s=ent Terrorism &amp; Security | csmonitor.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423051127/http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0804/dailyUpdate.html?s=ent |date=April 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&amp;itemid=800 U.S. Government, Media Silent on Torture of Detained Iraqi Kids - The NewStandard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2004===
Reports of mock executions by the US Marines in Iraq have surfaced in December 2004, as the [[ACLU]] published internal documents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) obtained through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The documents were written seven weeks after the publication of the photographs which triggered the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17206&amp;c=206 ACLU]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several torture cases were also reported, notably torture by electricity, beatings, and sprayings of prisoners with fire extinguishers.

On 21 December, the [[ACLU]] released further documents&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17224&amp;c=206 American Civil Liberties Union : Newly Released Documents Show Possible Interference by Army Commander In Investigation Into Murder of Iraqi Detainee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; documenting tortures. Notably, in a case of shooting of suspects without warning, Army commanders are reported to have interfered with the investigation. Procedures of autopsy of detainees who died in unclear circumstances have been canceled by battalion and group commands. Other cases include 
*An apparent attempt by a soldier in Baghdad to force a detainee to hold a gun to create the appearance of a justifiable homicide.
*Two mock executions of Iraqi juveniles by Army personnel (documents obtained by the ACLU two weeks ago showed that U.S. Marines had also conducted a mock execution of juvenile detainees).
*Allegations of a competition among Army dog handlers at Abu Ghraib prison to see who could make Iraqi detainees urinate themselves the fastest.
*The use of death threats during interrogations. Command failures in providing appropriate training to military interrogators in Baghdad detention facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/doa.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116124849/http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/doa.html |date=November 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 2005===
On 24 January 2005, the ACLU accused the Pentagon of deliberately closing investigations over Human Rights violations and torture cases before they were over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17350&amp;c=206 American Civil Liberties Union : Newly Released Investigative Files Provide Further Evidence Soldiers Not Held Accountable for Abuse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch accused Iraqi security forces of using torture and improper treatments on prisoners. Arbitrary arrests and long periods of isolation are now common. Human Right Watch interviewed 90 prisoners, among which 72 said they had been tortured during interrogation. [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], HRW director, said that the Iraqi provisional government was not holding to its promise to stand by Human Rights: 
"A new Iraqi government requires more than a change of leadership - it requires a change of attitude about basic human dignity" . 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"During the first three days there was continuous torture. I was beaten with an aluminum rod and with cables. ? Then I was told to sign a statement with my hands tied behind my back, so I didn't even see the paper and I don't know what I signed."  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among bad treatments were such elements as beatings with cables, electric shocks, including on genitals, being tied and blindfolded for days, cells so crowded that it is only possible to stand, arbitrary detention, refusal of trials, access to lawyers or contacts with families. These treatments were inflicted to insurgents and criminals alike.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/26/iraq10053.htm Iraq: Torture Continues at Hands of New Government (Human Rights Watch, 25-1-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4203637.stm Iraqi forces 'committing abuse' (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6863916/ Torture in Iraq still routine, report says (MSNBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2005===
A Pentagon order is mentioned in a military report filed on May 16, 2005 ordering U.S. personnel to turn a blind eye to Iraqi torture by refraining from investigating instances of apparent detainee abuse by Iraqi personnel, unless the investigation is first approved by U.S. headquarters: "Provided the initial report confirms US forces were not involved in the detainee abuse, no further investigation will be conducted unless directed by HHQ." Such approval was rarely granted.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, 2010 Oct. 24, "The Secret Iraq Files: The War US Turned Blind Eye to Torture; Leaked Documents on Iraq War Contain Thousands of Allegations of Abuse, But a Pentagon Order Told Troops to Ignore Them," http://english.aljazeera.net/secretiraqfiles/2010/10/20101022161828428516.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2005===
In a report published by Human Rights Watch in September 2005, U.S. Troops are accused to routinely torture prisoners in Iraq. Two sergeants and a captain describe e.g. the breaking of a detainee’s leg, and applying chemical substances to detainees’ skin and eyes. Capt. [[Ian Fishback]] of the 82nd Airborne who made persistent efforts over 17 months to raise concerns about detainee abuse with his chain of command was consistently told to ignore abuses and to “consider your career.” When he made an appointment with Senate staff members of Senators [[John McCain]] and [[John Warner]], he says his commanding officer denied him a pass to leave his base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/09/25/usint11776.htm New Accounts of Torture by U.S. Troops (Human Rights Watch, 24-9-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/politics/24abuse.html | work=The New York Times | title=3 in 82nd Airborne Say Beating Iraqi Prisoners Was Routine | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=2005-09-24 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"the difficulties [our troops face] come from the two decisions that I had the most insight into that were made in this more or less alternative decision-making process. And those two decisions were the inept and incompetent planning for post-invasion Iraq, and [...] the decision... from that alternative decision-making process to depart from the Geneva Conventions and from international law, in general.

:"[The President's memorandum said] the spirit of Geneva would be adhered to... consistent with military necessity. [...] It did not say 'consistent with national security demands.' It did not say 'consistent with the demands of the war on terror.' It said 'consistent with military needs.' Now, military needs are very simple and clear to a man like me who spent 31 years in the military. It means that if one of my buddy's life is threatened or my life is threatened, I can take drastic action. I can even shoot a detainee. And I can expect not to be punished under Geneva, or at least if I am court-martialed, I have a defense. It doesn't mean that I can take a detainee in a cold, dark cell in Bagram, Afghanistan, for example, in December 2002, shackled to the wall, and pour cold water on him at intervals when the outside temperature is 50 degrees anyway, and eventually kill him, which is what happened."''

The [[Haditha killings]] occurred on November 19 in the town of [[Haditha, Iraq]]. A convoy of [[United States Marines]] was attacked with an [[improvised explosive device]] which killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas. Up to twenty-four Iraqis were subsequently killed; it is alleged that they were non-combatant local residents who were massacred by Marines in the aftermath of the insurgent attack.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/01/military.training/index.html U.S. military mourns 'tragic' Haditha deaths]'', CNN.

===December 2005===
John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), told [[Reuters]] that there were an estimated 14,000 people being held in prison in Iraq contrary to UN Resolution 1546, according to which the US government claims legal permission to occupy Iraq. In a December 5, 2005, interview, Pace said,

:"All [prisoners in Iraq] except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison.

:"Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country.

:"It's very rare to get judges ordering you to be released and effectively the police respecting that order.

:"We have cases also where the judge who has ordered a group of people to be released, about 50-60 people, and the police, the Interior Ministry simply refuses.

:"We have another case in another part of the country where the judge was actually the subject of reprisal for having found people not getting, as ordered, their release.

:"The judge is now in jail.

:"The judiciary has a lot to answer for in this country. It is really not carrying out its duties," he said, adding that bribes were sometimes paid for jobs in the judiciary and police.

:"This is not denied," Pace said. "This is symptomatic of the corruption problems in this country and stands in the way of any kind of rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US detentions abuse Iraq mandate: UN |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/US-detentions-abuse-Iraq-mandate-UN/2005/12/05/1133631177030.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2009===
In 2009, an additional 21 color photographs surfaced, showing prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq being abused by their U.S. captors.
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) said, "[T]he government had long argued that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was isolated and was an aberration. The new photos would show that the abuse was more widespread." President [[Barack Obama]] initially indicated he would not fight the release of the photographs, but "reversed course in May and authorized an appeal to the high court." "The Obama administration believe[d] giving the imminent grant of authority over the release of such pictures to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] would short-circuit a lawsuit filed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] under the Freedom of Information Act." On Oct 10, 2009 the US "Congress [was] set to allow [[the Pentagon]] to keep new pictures ... from the public"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress could thwart bid to view abuse photos |author=Mark Sherman |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 10, 2009 |url=https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/congress-could-thwart-bid-to-view-abuse-photos-1.1515034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010-present===
On February 3, 2010, David A. Larson, an elected official in California who has a relationship with government contract personnel, made disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) alleging that under the Bush Administration, prisoners detained at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, and undisclosed "black sites" were being used as involuntary research subjects for human biomedical experimentation, behavior modification research, and drug-testosterone delivery in a manner similar to past CIA [[Project MKULTRA]] activities investigated in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and Inuoye. The allegation supports information contained in an International Red Cross report relative to the expanded role of CIA medical personnel in torture and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130102094447/http://www.electlarson.com/issues.htm On the Issues, David A.

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An [[Associated Press]] article said {{quote|Despite Abu Ghriab- or perhaps because of reforms in its wake- prisoners have more recently said they receive far better treatment in American custody than in Iraqi jails.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Sameer | last=Yacoub | title=Changing of the guard at last U.S. run prison | url=| work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 8A | date=15 July 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 [[Amnesty International]] warned in a report titled ''New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq'' that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the US detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime, in which [[human rights]] abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the security forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say that "Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. US authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by US forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation Abuse and torture rife in Iraqi prisons]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2010 nearly 400,000 secret [[United States]] army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, [[the Guardian]] and several other [[international]] media organisations through the [[whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]]. Among others, the logs detail how US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, [[torture]], [[rape]] and even [[murder]] by [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] police and soldiers, whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished and that US troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks Iraq war logs: secret files show how US ignored torture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html WikiLeaks' Iraq War Logs: US Troops Abused Prisoners For Years After Abu Ghraib]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the UK and the US have condemned the unauthorised release of classified material, but did not question its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11612731 Wikileaks: Iraq war logs 'reveal truth about conflict']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Several sets of investigations, both congressional via the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], military via [[courts-martial]], and criminal for non-military contractors, were launched in response to the scandal.

[[Seymour Hersh]], who exposed the Abu Ghraib scandal, and reports in Newsweek, has taken the case even further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact Annals of National Security: The Gray Zone: The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302212815/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact |date=March 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4989438/ The Roots of Torture - Newsweek: World News - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415220915/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4989438/ |date=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] instituted a policy that "encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq.". This policy stemmed from an earlier policy taken toward al-Qaeda prisoners. A memo to the Bush White House from counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] claimed that the new sort of war renders the Geneva Conventions' limitations on interrogating enemy prisoners "obsolete". The program was approved by the [[CIA]], [[NSA]], and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. President [[George W. Bush]] was informed of it. The [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] [[Steven Cambone]] administered the operation. His deputy, [[William Boykin]], instructed the head of operations at [[Camp X-ray]] [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Geoffrey Miller (MG)|Geoffrey Miller]] to do the same at [[Abu Ghraib]]. Miller told Brig. Gen. [[Janis Karpinski]] that the prison would now be dedicated to gathering intelligence.   [[Douglas Feith]] and [[William J. Haynes, II|William Haynes]] were also involved in the operation.

On May 18, 2004, a military intelligence analyst named [[Samuel Provance]] came out to the press, stating "There's definitely a cover-up". Provance, who ran a computer network used by military intelligence in the prison and who had been ordered not to speak to the press, told ABC News "Anything [the MPs] were to do legally or otherwise, they were to take those commands from the interrogators," and that the sexual humiliation began as a technique ordered by the investigators. He described several of the goings-on in the prison that he witnessed, such as the punching people in the neck hard enough to knock them unconscious after assuring them they weren't going to be hit, in order to catch them off guard. He also stated that Maj. Gen. [[George Fay]], the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, has shown little interest in investigating the interrogators and has gone only after the MPs, and that there is a culture of silence right now among those involved, who fear that if they say anything, the investigations will turn to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/sections/WNT/Investigation/abu_ghraib_cover_up_040518.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2004, a court martial hearing was held for Cpl. [[Charles Graner|Charles A. Graner Jr.]], who has been accused of being the ringleader of the group employing torture at Abu Ghraib. In an unexpected move, all three key witnesses - Lt. Col. [[Steven L. Jordan]], Capt. Donald J. Reese, and contractor Adel L. Nakhla - refused to testify. This is an almost unheard of action. Under court martial proceedings, one cannot refuse to testify unless they have a belief that they will be exposed to criminal charges for doing so. Consequently, it is likely that the investigative proceedings will be forced to move higher up the chain of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/iraq/la-fg-prison19may19,1,5951548,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines | archive-url=https://archive.is/20040609204053/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/iraq/la-fg-prison19may19,1,5951548,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2004-06-09 | work=Los Angeles Times }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joe "The Boss" Hipp''' (born December 7, 1962) is a retired professional [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[heavyweight]] [[boxing|boxer]]. A member of the [[Blackfeet Tribe]], he became the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to challenge for a world heavyweight boxing championship on August 19, 1995 when he fought [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] champion [[Bruce Seldon]] at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]]. In May 2009, he was inducted into the American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
Hipp began his professional career with a 4-round decision over Steve Cortez at the Lane County Fairgrounds in [[Eugene, Oregon]] on August 29, 1987. For his second fight 2 months later, Hipp travelled to [[Carson City, Nevada]] to face [[Utah]] native Veti Katoa.  The fight was stopped by the ringside doctor after Hipp suffered a broken jaw in the third round.

Hipp rebounded successfully from the defeat by notching 3 consecutive first-round knockout victories before facing Katoa in a rematch at Gardnerville Park in [[Gardnerville, Nevada]] on July 2, 1988. Hipp dominated the action on the inside with his hard-hitting, banging style to take a 5-round unanimous decision.

Hipp then took a year-long hiatus from boxing before returning to face Andrew Matthews on the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] of the following year. Outweighing his opponent by over 30 pounds, Hipp punched his way to a first-round stoppage. Exactly two weeks later, Hipp scored a unanimous four-round decision over up-and-coming contender Cleveland Woods in what [[Ring Magazine]] referred to as "...the upset of the night" on the card for that evening.

Hipp began another winning streak (including a brutal third-round knockout of Katoa in their third and final meeting) before facing [[Bert Cooper]] in Cooper's final bout prior to his fight with [[Evander Holyfield]] for the world title one month later. Cooper outslugged Hipp en route to a fifth-round stoppage by referee [[Joe Cortez]].

Hipp again rebounded by winning 3 consecutive contests before facing [[Tommy Morrison]] on June 27, 1992 in [[Reno, Nevada]]. In a slugfest that saw Morrison break his jaw and one of his hands, Hipp lost by a 9th-round TKO, resulting in broken cheekbones for Hipp. After recovering from his injuries, Hipp fought once in 1993, earning a victory with a ten-round decision in a rematch with Kevin Ford.

Hipp began 1994 with a victory over [[Alex García (boxer)|Alex Garcia]] for the fringe [[North American Boxing Federation|NABF]] heavyweight title and finished the year with two more wins. He began the following year by continuing his winning ways with a third-round TKO of journeyman Phillip Brown. This win would lead to Hipp's most important bout, the fight that would land him in the history books as the first Native American to challenge for one of the four recognized heavyweight title belts.

===WBA Heavyweight Title Bout===
On August 19, 1995 at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in Las Vegas on the undercard of the infamous [[Mike Tyson]] v. [[Peter McNeeley]] fight (Tyson's first fight after being released from prison for rape), Hipp squared off against [[Bruce Seldon]] for the WBA Heavyweight championship. With Seldon well ahead on all scorecards, the fight was stopped in the tenth round by referee [[Richard Steele]] after Hipp experienced massive swelling and bleeding on his face.

===Career Decline===
Hipp's career was rather undistinguished afterwards. He fired off a series of victories over third-rate competition before being knocked out by hard-hitting journeyman [[Ross Puritty]] on June 15, 1997. Hipp had secured a comfortable lead on the scorecards before Puritty came out swinging for the tenth and final round of their bout. An exhausted Hipp was no match for Puritty in the last round and he suffered his first KO defeat. Hipp racked up three consecutive victories against nondescript competition after the Puritty fight, but then blew out his knee against [[Jeff Pegues]] in a fifth-round TKO loss on December 9, 1999. 

He attempted a comeback four years later, but that came to an abrupt end in his second fight as he dropped a six-round decision to journeyman Billy Zumbrun on November 14, 2003.

Hipp, referred to as "The Boss" by his loyal fans, returned from another extended layoff to win a six-round decision over Ted Reiter on August 13, 2005, in what was his final fight.

==Outside the Ring==
In 2004, Rocky Mountain Community College and the Billings Writer's Voice sponsored a poetry reading held by various Native American groups in tribute to Hipp.

In December 2005, Hipp was a FEMA worker for the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Responding to the call, he joined his fellow Blackfeet members who were called upon due to their experience in wildfires and search and rescue missions.

By 2007 Hipp was working for his former manager Ray Frye at a Seattle area sweeping company. He also co-owned a small construction company.

A '''kick''' is a physical [[Strike (attack)|strike]] using the [[leg]], in unison usually with an area of the knee or lower using the [[foot]], [[heel]], [[tibia]], ball of the foot, blade of the foot, toes or [[knee]] (the latter is also known as a [[knee (strike)|knee strike]]). This type of attack is used frequently by [[hoof|hooved]] animals as well as humans in the context of [[stand-up fighting]].  Kicks play a significant role in many forms of [[martial arts]], such as [[savate]], [[taekwondo]], [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]], [[sikaran]], [[karate]], [[Pankration]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Vovinam]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Yaw-Yan]], [[capoeira]], [[silat]], and [[kalaripayattu]].

Kicking is also prominent from its use in many [[sports]], especially those called [[football]]. The best known of these sports is [[association football]], also known as [[soccer]].

==History==
The English verb [[:wikt:kick|to kick]] appears only in the late 14th century, apparently as a loan from Old Norse, originally in the sense of a [[hoof|hooved]] animal delivering strikes with his hind legs; the oldest use is Biblical.

Kicks as an act of [[human aggression]] have likely existed worldwide since prehistory.  However, high kicks, aiming above the waist or to the head appear to have originated from [[Asian martial arts]].  Such kicks were introduced to the [[western martial arts|west]] in the 19th century with early [[hybrid martial arts]] inspired by Asian styles such as [[Bartitsu]] and [[Savate]]. Practice of high kicks became more universal in the second half of the 20th century with the more widespread development of hybrid styles such as [[kickboxing]] and eventually [[mixed martial arts]].

The history of the high kick in Asian martial arts is difficult to trace. It appears to be prevalent in all traditional forms of [[Indochinese kickboxing]], but these cannot be traced with any technical detail to pre-modern times. For example, [[Muay Boran]] or "ancient boxing" in Thailand was developed under [[Rama V]] (r. 1868-1910). While it is known that earlier forms of "boxing" existed during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the details regarding these techniques are unclear.  Some stances that look like low kicks, but not high kicks, are visible in the [[Shaolin temple]] frescoes, dated to the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04013.htm 4.13]), an [[Sanskrit epics|Indian epic]] compiled at some point before the 5th century AD, describes an unarmed hand-to-hand battle, including the sentence "and they gave each other violent kicks" (without providing any further detail).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Applications==

As the human leg is longer and stronger than the arm, kicks are generally used to keep an opponent at a distance, surprise him or her with their range, and inflict substantial damage.  On the other hand, [[Stance (martial arts)|stance]] is very important in any combat system, and any attempt to deliver a kick will necessarily compromise one's stability of stance. The application of kicks is thus a question of the tradeoff between the power that can be delivered vs. the cost incurred to balance. Since combat situations are fluid, understanding this tradeoff and making the appropriate decision to adjust to each moment is key.

Kicks are commonly directed against helpless or downed targets, while for more general [[self-defense]] applications, the consensus is that simple kicks aimed at vulnerable targets below the chest may be highly efficient, but should be executed with a degree of care. Self-defense experts, such as author and teacher Marc Macyoung, claim that kicks should be aimed no higher than the waist/stomach.  Thus, the fighter should not compromise their balance while delivering a kick, and retract the leg properly to avoid grappling. It is often recommended to build and drill simple combinations that involve attacking different levels of an opponent. A common example would be distracting an opponent's focus via a fake jab, following up with a powerful attack at the opponent's legs and punching.

Further, since low kicks are inherently quicker and harder to see and dodge in general they are often emphasized in a street fight scenario.

==Practicality of high kicks==

The utility of high kicks (above chest level) has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/5/13/4324768/kicking-mma-striking-styles-crocop-renan-barao-ufc-mma |title=Kicking is starting to impact MMA striking |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents have viewed that some high front snap kicks are effective for striking the face or throat, particularly against charging opponents, and flying kicks can be effective to scare off attackers.  Martial arts systems that utilize high kicks also emphasize training of very efficient and technically perfected forms of kicks, include recovery techniques in the event of a miss or block, and will employ a wide repertoire of kicks adapted to specific situations.

Detractors have asserted that the flying/jumping kicks performed in synthesis styles are primarily performed for conditioning or aesthetic reasons while the high kicks as practiced in sport martial arts are privileged due to specialized tournament rules, such as limiting the contest to [[stand-up fighting]], or reducing the penalty resulting from a failed attempt at delivering a kick.

Although kicks can result in an easy [[takedown (grappling)|takedown]] for the opponent if they are caught or the resulting imbalance is exploited, kicks to all parts of the body are very present in [[mixed martial arts]], with some fighters employing them sporadically, while others, like [[Lyoto Machida]], [[Edson Barboza]] and [[Donald Cerrone]] rely heavily on their use and have multiple [[knockouts]] by kicks on their resumee.

==Basic kicks==

===Front kick===
{{Main|Front kick}}
[[Image:EVD-taekwondo-061.jpg|thumb|Taekwondo front kick]]
Delivering a front kick involves raising the [[knee]] and [[foot]] of the striking leg to the desired height and extending the leg to contact the target. The actual strike is usually delivered by the [[ball of the foot]] for a forward kick or the top of the toes for an upward kick. [[Taekwondo]] practitioners utilize both the heel and ball of the foot for striking. Various combat systems teach 'general' front kick using the heel or whole foot when footwear is on. Depending of fighter's tactical needs, a front kick may involve more or less body motion. Thrusting one's hips is a common method of increasing both reach and power of the kick. The front kick is typically executed with the upper body straight and balanced. Front kicks are typically aimed at targets below the chest: stomach, thighs, groin, knees or lower. Highly skilled martial artists are often capable of striking head-level targets with front kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Breen |first=Andrew |url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-techniques/kicks/the-front-kick-how-to-do-it-when-to-use-it-what-to-destroy-with-it-part-1/ |title=The Front Kick: How to Do It, When to Use It, What to Destroy With It (Part 1) – - Black Belt |publisher=Blackbeltmag.com |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2014-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112133655/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-techniques/kicks/the-front-kick-how-to-do-it-when-to-use-it-what-to-destroy-with-it-part-1/# |archive-date=2014-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/3/19/2872876/ufc-strikeforce-judo-chop-front-kick-lyoto-machida-anderson-silva-josh-thomson-ko |title=Judo Chop: Front Kicks With Lyoto Machida, Anderson Silva, Josh Thomson |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roundhouse kick ===
{{Main|Roundhouse kick}}
[[File:Muay Thai High kick.jpg|thumb| Roundhouse Kick]]
This is the most commonly used kick in [[kickboxing]] due to its power and ease of use.  In most styles, the [[instep]] is used to strike, though most Karate styles would allow the shin as official technique for a street fight. To execute, the attacker swings their leg sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent's side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. Also performable is a 360-degree kick in which the attacker performs a full circle with their leg, in which the striking surface is generally either the instep, shin or ball of the foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/2/6/2773302/ufc-143-stephen-thompson-judo-chop-instep-roundhouse-kick |title=UFC 143 Judo Chop: The Instep Roundhouse Kick Of Stephen Thompson |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations of the roundhouse kick based on various chambering of the cocked leg (small, or full, or universal or no chambering) or various footwork possibilities (rear-leg, front-leg, hopping, switch, oblique, dropping, ground spin-back or full 360 spin-back). An important variation is the downward roundhouse kick, nicknamed the Brazilian Kick from recent K-1 use: A more pronounced twist of the hips allows for a downward end of the trajectory of the kick that is very deceiving.&lt;ref&gt;The Essential Book of Martial Arts Kicks: 89 Kicks from Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and Others by Marc De Bremaeker and Roy Faige&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its power, the roundhouse kick may also be performed at low level against targets, such as the knees, calf, or even thigh, since attacking leg muscles will often cripple an opponent's mobility.

===Side kick===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kickboxing]] --&gt;
{{Redirect|Side kick||Sidekick (disambiguation)}}

The side kick refers to a kick that is delivered sideways in relation to the body of the person kicking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/10/27/3562436/ufc-macau-anderson-silva-cung-le-bruce-lee-judo-chop-mma-technique |title=UFC Macau Judo Chop: Anderson Silva, Cung Le, Bruce Lee and the Side Kick |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the most adaptable kicks, useful as both an offensive move and as a defensive counter to a blitzing opponent. There are two areas that are commonly used as impact points in sidekicks: the heel of the foot or the outer edge of the foot. The heel is more suited to hard targets such as the ribs, stomach, jaw, temple and chest. However, when executing a side kick with the heel, the toes should be pulled back so that they only make contact the heel and not with the whole foot. If a person hits with the arch or the ball of the foot, it can injure the foot or break an ankle. A standard sidekick is performed by first chambering the kicking leg diagonally across the body, then extending the leg in a linear fashion toward the target, while flexing the abdominals.

Another way of doing the side kick is to make it an end result of a faked roundhouse. This technique is considered antiquated, and used only after an opponent is persuaded to believe it is a roundhouse, and then led to believe that closing the distance is best for an upper body attack, which plays into the tactical position and relative requirement of this version of the side kick. In Korean, ''yeop chagi''. In Okinawan te fighting, it is sometimes called a ''dragon kick''. Some have called this side kick a "twist kick" due to its roundhouse like origins. This side kick begins as would a roundhouse kick however the practitioner allows the heel to move towards the center of the body. The kick is then directed outward from a cross-leg chamber so that the final destination of the kick is a target to the side, rather than one that is directly ahead.

===Back kick===
[[Image:EVD-taekwondo-083.jpg|thumb|left|Taekwondo back kick.]]
Also referred to as a donkey kick, mule kick, or turning back kick. This kick is directed backwards, keeping the kicking leg close to the standing leg and using the heel as a striking surface. In wushu, this kick is called the "half-moon" kick but involves the slight arching of the back and a higher lift of the leg to give a larger curvature. It is often used to strike opponents by surprise when facing away from them.

==Advanced kicks==
These are often complicated variations of basic kicks, either with a different target or combined with another move, such as jumping.

===Axe kick===&lt;!-- Aerial cartwheel links to this anchor; please don't change without fixing links --&gt;
[[File:München WKU 2013 Christine Theiss 231.JPG|thumb|Axe kick by [[Christine Theiss]] 2013]]
In Japanese, ''kakato-geri'' or ''kakato-otoshi''; in Korean, ''doki bal chagi'' or ''naeryeo chagi'' or "chikka chagi". In Chinese, "pigua tui" or "xiapi tui".

An axe kick, also known as a ''hammer kick'' or ''stretch kick'', is characterized by a straightened leg with the heel descending onto an opponent like the blade of an [[axe]]. It begins with one foot rising upward as in a crescent kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/6/16/1518356/bloody-elbow-judo-chop-mirko-cro |title=Judo Chop: Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipovic Unleashes an Axe Kick on Pat Barry |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upward arc motion is stopped, and then the attacking foot is lowered so as to strike the target from above. The arc can be performed in either an inward (counter-clockwise) or outward (clockwise) fashion.

A well-known proponent of the axe kick was [[Andy Hug]], the Swiss Kyokushinkai Karateka who won the 1996 [[K-1 Grand Prix]].

===Butterfly kick===
{{Main|Butterfly kick}}
[[Image:Butterfly Kick Samuel Lee.gif|right|thumb|200px|Wushu Butterfly kick (animated video)]]

The butterfly kick is done by doing a large circular motion with both feet in succession, making the combatant airborne. There are many variations of this kick. The kick may look like a slanted aerial cartwheel, and at the same time, the body spins horizontally in a circle. It begins as a jump with one leg while kicking with the other, then move the kicking leg down and the jumping leg up into a kick, landing with the first kicking leg, all while spinning. This kick involves also the arching the back backwards when airborne to give a horizontal body with high angled legs to the horizontal. It may also resemble a jumping spin roundhouse kick (developed by James 'Two Screens' Perkins) into a spinning [[hook kick]], all in one jump and one spin although the difference is that both legs should remain in the air at the same time for a considerable amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO2Skxg_GLQ |title=Shaolin Kung Fu Stretches &amp; Moves : Butterfly Kick in Shaolin Kung Fu |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First practiced in Chinese martial arts, the butterfly kick, or "xuan zi", is widely viewed as ineffective for actual combat.  However, its original purpose was to evade an opponent's floor sweep and flip to the antagonist's exposed side or it may be used as a double aerial kick to an opponent standing off to the side. It is now widely used in demonstrative wushu forms (taolu) as a symbol of difficulty. Also note the similarity in execution when compared to an ice skating maneuver known as a [[Camel_spin#Variations|flying camel spin]] (aka: [[Dick_Button|Button]] Camel).

===Calf kick===
This strike is a low roundhouse kick that hits the backside of the [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]] with the [[Shin (anatomy)|shin]]. While a Calf Kick sacrifices range in comparison to a standard low roundhouse kick to the thigh, the Calf Kick can't be checked with a knee or grabbed with an arm making it a safer kick for a striker in MMA matches vs opponents capable of checking low kicks or grapplers looking for takedown opportunities.

===Crescent kick===
In Japanese, ''mikazuki Geri''; in Korean, ''bandal chagi'' (반달 차기).

The crescent kick, also referred to as a 'swing' kick, has some similarities to a [[hook kick]], and is sometimes practised as an off-target front snap kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1908450-kicks-arent-going-anywhere-part-2-katsunori-kikuno |title=Kicks Aren't Going Anywhere Part 2: Katsunori Kikuno |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2014-01-02 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leg is bent like the front kick, but the knee is pointed at a target to the left or right of the true target. The energy from the snap is then redirected, whipping the leg into an arc and hitting the target from the side. This is useful for getting inside defenses and striking the side of the head or for knocking down hands to follow up with a close attack. In many styles of [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Kalaripayattu]], crescent kicks are taught as tripping techniques. When training for crescent kicks, it is common to keep the knee extended to increase the difficulty. This also increases the momentum of the foot and can generate more force, though it takes longer to build up the speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/4/5/1387681/bloody-elbow-judo-chop-katsunori |title=Judo Chop: Katsunori Kikuno Puts the Crescent Kick To Work on Kuniyoshi Hironaka at DREAM.13 |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''inward'''/'''inner'''/'''inside''' crescent hits with the inside edge of the foot. Its arch is clockwise for the left leg and counter-clockwise for the right leg. Force is generated by both legs' hip adduction. The inward variant has also been called a ''hangetsu geri'' (Half moon kick) in karate and is employed to "wipe" an opponents hand off of one's wrist. It can quickly be followed up by a low side-blade kick to the knee of the offender.

The '''outward'''/'''outer'''/'''outside''' crescent hits with the 'blade', the outside edge of the foot. Its path is counter-clockwise for the left leg and clockwise for the right leg, and force is generated by both legs' hip abduction. This is similar to a rising side kick, only with the kicking leg's hip flexed so that the line of force travels parallel to the ground from front to side rather than straight up, beginning and ending at the side.

===Hook kick===
In Korean, ''huryeo chagi'' (후려 차기) or ''golcho chagi''.
[[Image:Steven Ho Martial Arts Kick.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Ho (martial artist)|Steven Ho]] executing a Jump Spin Hook kick]]
The hook kick strikes with the heel from the side (or flat of the foot in sparring). It is executed similar to a side kick. However, the kick is intentionally aimed slightly off target in the direction of the kicking foot's toes. At full extension, the knee is bent and the foot snapped to the side, impacting the target with the heel. In Taekwondo it is often used at the resulting miss of a short slide side kick to the head, but is considered a very high level technique in said circumstance. Practitioners of [[jeet kune do]] frequently use the term ''heel hook kick'' or ''sweep kick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2013/7/21/4543338/technique-talk-henri-hooft-on-the-rise-of-spinning-kicks-and-attacks/in/3450013 |title=Technique Talk: Henri Hooft on the rise of spinning kicks and attacks in mixed martial arts |publisher=MMA Fighting |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7g2gzoqK14&amp;feature=related |title=Taekwondo Kicks : Taekwondo Reverse Hook Kick |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/9/24/4762484/judo-chop-chris-clements-spinning-sweep-kick-stephen-thompson-gif-andy-hug |title=UFC 165 Judo Chop: Chris Clement's Spinning Sweep Kick |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known as [[Gancho]] in [[Capoeira]].

There are many variations of the hook kick, generally based on different footworks: rear- or front-leg, oblique or half-pivot, dropping, spin-back and more. The hook kick can be delivered with a near-straight leg at impact, or with a hooked finish (Kake in Japanese Karate) where the leg bends before impact to catch the target from behind. An important variation is the downward hook kick, delivered as a regular or a spin-back kick, in which the end of the trajectory is diagonally downwards for a surprise effect or following an evading opponent.

The hook kick is mainly used to strike the jaw area of an opponent, but is also highly effective in the temple region.

===Reverse roundhouse/wheel kick===
[[Image:Triple Reverse Turning Kick Combo Samuel Lee.gif|right|thumb|200px|Low, middle and high Reverse roundhouse kicks performed in succession]]
In Japanese, {{Nihongo|ushiro mawashi geri|後ろ回し蹴り}}; in Korean, ''bandae dollyo chagi'' (반대 돌려 차기), ''dwit hu ryo chagi'', ''nakkio mom dollyo chagi'' or ''parryo chagi''.

This kick is also known as a ''heel kick'', ''reverse turning kick'', ''reverse round kick'', ''spinning hook kick'', ''spin kick'', or "wheel kick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/11/11/5081204/ufn-31-rustam-khabilov-jorge-masvidal-spinning-kick-gif-ko-mma-technique-judo-chop |title=UFN 31 Judo Chop: Rustam Khabilov's Spinning Hook Kick |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low reverse roundhouse is also known as a ''Sweep Kick''. This kick traditionally uses the heel to strike with. The kicking leg comes from around the kicker's back and remains straight, unlike a reverse hooking kick. See above for more on hook kicks. Variations exist for low, middle and high height. Spinning and leaping variations of the kick are also popular, and are often showcased in film and television media.  Edson Barboza executed the first wheel kick for a knockout in the UFC at UFC 142:Aldo vs. Mendes.  He knocked out Terry Etim 3:23 into the third round of their fight. [[Mickie James]] uses this move calling it ''Mick-Kick''

A different kick that is similarly named also exists. It is literally a [[roundhouse kick]] performed by turning as if for a ''back straight kick'' and executing a roundhouse kick.  It is known as a ''Reverse Roundhouse Kick'' because the kicker turns in the opposite, or "reverse", direction before the kick is executed. This kick strikes with the ball of the foot for power or the top of the foot for range. The kick was exhibited by [[Bruce Lee]] on numerous occasions in his films [[Enter the Dragon]], [[Fist of Fury]] and [[The Big Boss]]. Bill Wallace was also a great user of this kick, as seen in his fight with Bill Briggs, where he KO'd his opponent with the clocked 60&amp;nbsp;mph kick. The Jump Spin Hook Kick was popularized in the mid-eighties by Steven Ho in open martial art competitions.

In Olympic format (sport) [[taekwondo]], this technique is performed using the balls of the feet, and in a manner similar to a [[back kick|back thrust]], rather than the circular technique adopted in other styles/Martial Arts.

===Flying kicks===
{{Main|Flying kick}}
[[Image:Flying back kick Samuel Lee.gif|thumb|Flying back kick. ''Note: The running-up part of the flying kick sequence is cut off in this animation, so only the jumping component of the kick is seen''.]]

A flying kick, in martial arts, is a general description of kicks that involve a running start, jump, then a kick in mid-air. Compared to a regular kick, the user is able to achieve greater momentum from the run at the start. Flying kicks are not to be mistaken for jumping kicks, which are similar maneuvers. A jumping kick is very similar to a flying kick, except that it lacks the running start and the user simply jumps and kicks from a stationary position. Flying kicks are often derived from the basic kicks. Some of the more commonly known flying kicks are the: flying side kick, flying back kick and the flying [[roundhouse kick]], as well as the flying [[reverse roundhouse kick]]. [[Flying kicks]] are commonly practiced in [[Taekwondo]], [[Karate]], [[Chinese martial arts|Wushu]], and Muay Thai for fitness, exhibitions and competition. It is known as ''tobi geri'' in Japanese martial arts, and ''twyo chagi'' in Taekwondo.

===Scissor kick===
{{Main|Scissor kick (martial arts)}}

Several kicks may be called a scissor kick, involving swinging out the legs to kick multiple targets or using the legs to [[Takedown (grappling)|take down]] an opponent.

The popularized version of a scissor kick is, while lying down, or jumping, the kicker brings both legs to both sides of the opponent's legs or to their body and head, then brings both in as a take down (as the name states, leg motions are like that of a pair of scissors).

The scissor kick in Taekwondo is called ''kawi chagi''. In [[Capoeira]] it is called tesoura (scissors).

Scissor kicks and other variants are also commonly applied in [[Vovinam]].

===Spinning heel kick===
A spinning heel kick is where the artist turns his/her body 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s before landing the heel or the ball of his/her foot on the target. It is found in Muay Thai and is known in Capoeira as armada.

===Vertical kick (thrust kick/push kick/side kick)===
The vertical kick involves bringing the knee forward and across the chest, then swinging the hip while extending the kicking leg outward, striking with the outside ("sword") edge of the foot.  It can deliver a considerable amount of power.  This is called a ''yoko geri keage'' in karate.

In Taekwondo, the vertical kick is called ''sewo chagi'', and can be performed as either an inward (''anuro'') or outward (''bakuro'') kick.

===Multiple kick===
In Japanese karate, the term ''ren geri'' is used for several kicks performed in succession.  Old karate did not promote the use of the legs for weapons as much as modern karate does, seeing them as being too open for countering.  However, in modern sport karate (non-traditional) competitions, the ability to use multiple kicks without setting the foot down has become a viable option, not only for effectiveness but also for stylish aesthetics.

In Taekwon-Do, three types of multiple kick are distinguished:

Double kick (''i-jung chagi'') - two kicks of the same type executed in succession by the same foot in the same direction.

Consecutive kick (''yonsok chagi'') - two or more kicks executed in succession by the same foot but in different directions, or with different attacking tools.

Combination kick (''honhap chagi'') - two or more kicks executed in succession by both feet.

One such Multiple Kick commonly seen in Taekwon-Do, is a slightly complex Side Kick where a High Side Kick is followed by a Low Side Kick which is in turn followed by a more powerful Side Kick. This combination is done rapidly and is meant not for multiple targets but for a single one. The Multiple Kick usually targets the face, thigh, and chest, but in turn can be a multiple chest attack which is useful for knocking the breath out of an attacker. The Multiple Kick is usually done in the "second" style described in the Side Kick article which "involves shooting the leg forward as in a front kick and then pivoting and turning so" to actually deliver a side kick. That style "has far less power but is much faster and more deceptive", which is what the Multiple Kick was designed for. The Multiple Kick, unlike some Side Kicks or "side blade kicks", never uses the outer edge of the foot; it is intended solely for the heel to be used as the impact point.  Depending on the strength and skill of the attacker and the attacked, the combination can be highly effective or highly ineffective when compared to more pragmatic attacks. In some encounters with highly trained and conditioned fighters, multiple side-kicks have seen disastrous results against the abs of their targets.

===Showtime kick===
The Showtime kick gained notability after being used by [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] [[Anthony Pettis]], during his fight gainst [[Benson Henderson]] on December 16, at [[WEC 53]] for the [[List of WEC champions#Lightweight Championship|WEC Lightweight Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=12683&amp;zoneid=13 |title=HENDERSON VS.

{{Antisemitism}}

'''Leo Max Frank''' (April 17, 1884{{spaced en dash}}August 17, 1915) was an American factory superintendent who was convicted in 1913 of the murder of a 13-year-old employee, Mary Phagan, in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. His trial, conviction, and appeals attracted national attention. His [[lynching]] two years later, in response to the commutation of his sentence, became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding [[History of antisemitism in the United States|antisemitism]]. Today, the consensus of researchers on the subject holds that Frank was wrongly convicted.

Born to a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] family in [[Texas]], Frank was raised in [[New York (state)|New York]] and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from [[Cornell University]] before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying in 1910, he involved himself with the city's Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the [[B'nai B'rith]], a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. Although antisemitism was not locally common, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories owned by members of the Jewish community. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory's cellar the next morning. Two notes, made to look as if she had written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a "night witch", they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory.

On May 24, 1913, Frank was indicted on a charge of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor [[John M. Slaton]] commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.

The case attracted national press and many reporters deemed the conviction a travesty. Within Georgia, this outside criticism fueled antisemitism and hatred toward Frank. On August 16, 1915, he was kidnapped from prison by a group of armed men who were infuriated by the governor's decision, and [[lynching|lynched]] at [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], Mary Phagan's hometown, the next morning. The new governor vowed to punish the lynchers, who included prominent Marietta citizens, but nobody was charged. In 1986, Frank was posthumously pardoned by the [[Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles]], although not officially absolved of the crime. Most researchers today agree that Conley was likely the murderer. The case inspired various media productions, including movies, plays, a TV miniseries, and books.

==Background==

===Social and economic conditions===

In the early 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, underwent significant economic and social change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLean p.&amp;nbsp;921.&lt;/ref&gt; Employment conditions in the city included [[child labor]], a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Oney says that Georgia was the only state that allowed children as young as ten to work eleven hours a day in factories and the legislature in early 1913 had defeated a bill to raise the minimum age to 14.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Men from the traditional and [[paternalistic]] rural society felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were seen as places for potential moral corruption.&lt;ref&gt;MacLean p.&amp;nbsp;919.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this same period, the Atlanta Jewish elite was unusually assimilated into the political, economic, and social fabric of the city. One of their strategies was to select rabbis and leaders who would put forth a positive image for their people and help reduce tensions between Jews and Gentiles. In Atlanta, a prominent leader from 1895 to 1946 was David Marx. To improve the image of Jews in their community, Marx's [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] temple adopted Americanized appearances. However, a conflict arose between the established German Jews of the city who generally were able to economically thrive while getting along with their neighbors, and newly arrived Russian Jews. Rabbi Marx went so far as to describe the new arrivals as "barbaric and ignorant" and feared that these backward arrivals would awaken anti-Semitism ''where it had been notably absent''. ''Rabbi Marx bitterly blamed the eastern Jews for creating a climate that made Frank's arrest and conviction possible''. &lt;ref&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA231 p.&amp;nbsp;231].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their success, many Jews recognized themselves as different from the Gentile majority and were uncomfortable with their image.{{refn|A 1900 Jewish newspaper in Atlanta wrote that "no one knows better than publishers of Jewish papers how widespread is this prejudice; but these publishers do not and will not tell what they know of the smooth talking Jew-haters, because it would widen the breech already existent."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mJLHrb-o5E0C&amp;pg=180 pp.&amp;nbsp;177–180].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}    Despite his acceptance by the [[Gentile]] community, Marx believed that "in isolated instances there is no prejudice entertained for the individual Jew, but there exists wide-spread and deep seated prejudice against Jews as an entire people."&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 1994 181"&gt;Dinnerstein 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mJLHrb-o5E0C&amp;pg=181 p.&amp;nbsp;181].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Dinnerstein wrote, "Men wore neither skullcaps nor prayer shawls, traditional Jewish holidays that the Orthodox celebrated on two days were observed by Marx and his followers for only one, and religious services were conducted on Sundays rather than on Saturdays."&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 1994 181" /&gt;|group=n}}{{refn|Lindemann writes, "As in the rest of the nation at this time, there were new sources of friction between Jews and Gentiles, and in truth the worries of the German-Jewish elite about the negative impact of the newly arriving eastern European Jews in the city were not without foundation."&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=%22As+in+the+rest+of+the+nation+at+this+time,+there+were+new+sources+of+friction+between+Jews+and+Gentiles%22 p.&amp;nbsp;231].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

An example of the type of tension that Rabbi Marx feared occurred in April 1913. At a conference involving the child labor problem, many proposed solutions were presented that covered the entire political spectrum. Author Steve Oney writes, "At the radical end of the spectrum could be heard alarming notions inspired by the fact that many of Atlanta's factories&amp;nbsp;... were Jewish owned."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Leonard Dinnerstein summarized Atlanta's situation in 1913 as follows:

{{quote|The pathological conditions in the city menaced the home, the state, the schools, the churches, and, in the words of a contemporary Southern sociologist, the 'wholesome industrial life.' The institutions of the city were obviously unfit to handle urban problems. Against this background, the murder of a young girl in 1913 triggered a violent reaction of mass aggression, hysteria, and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early life===
Leo Max Frank was born in [[Cuero, Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;Frey [https://books.google.com/books?id=s4YurAGAxYQC&amp;pg=PA19 p.&amp;nbsp;19].&lt;/ref&gt; on April 17, 1884 to Rudolph Frank and Rachel "Rae" Jacobs.&lt;ref name=Oney10&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Brooklyn]] in 1884 when Leo was three months old.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended New York City public schools and graduated from [[Pratt Institute]] in 1902. He then attended [[Cornell University]], where he studied mechanical engineering. After graduating in 1906, he worked briefly as a draftsman and as a testing engineer.&lt;ref name="Frey20"&gt;Frey [https://books.google.com/books?id=s4YurAGAxYQC&amp;pg=PA20 p.&amp;nbsp;20].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the invitation of his uncle Moses Frank, Leo traveled to Atlanta for two weeks in late October 1907 to meet a delegation of investors for a position with the National Pencil Company, a manufacturing plant in which Moses was a major shareholder.&lt;ref name=Oney10/&gt; Frank accepted the position, and traveled to Germany to study pencil manufacturing at the [[Eberhard Faber]] pencil factory. After a nine-month apprenticeship, Frank returned to the United States and began working at the National Pencil Company in August 1908.&lt;ref name="Frey20"/&gt; Frank became superintendent of the factory the following month, earning $180 per month plus a portion of the factory's profits.&lt;ref name="Lindemann 251"&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA251 p.&amp;nbsp;251].&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank was introduced to Lucille Selig shortly after he arrived in Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;80.&lt;/ref&gt; She came from a prominent, upper-middle class Jewish family of industrialists who, two generations earlier, had founded the first synagogue in Atlanta.{{refn|Levi Cohen, from her maternal lineage, had participated in founding the first synagogue in Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artery.org/Selig-PioneerNeon.htm The Selig Company Building{{spaced en dash}}Pioneer Neon Company.] Marietta Street ARTery Association.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Though she was less devout in her Jewish faith than Frank, they married in November 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank described his married life as happy.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;85,&amp;nbsp;483.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Frank was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the [[Southern United States]], and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson pp.&amp;nbsp;211,&amp;nbsp;250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and Jewish faith added to the sense that he was different.&lt;ref&gt;Alphin p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Mary Phagan==
[[File:Mary Phagan Atlanta Journal.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=A portrait of Mary Phagan in the pages of a newspaper. A caption above her says "Girl Slain in Strangling Mystery".|Mary Phagan as shown in ''The Atlanta Journal'']]

===Phagan's early life===
Mary Phagan was born on June 1, 1899, into an established Georgia family of tenant farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qf8zAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=8|title=Murder at the Pencil Factory: The Killing of Mary Phagan 100 Years Later|author=R. Barri Flowers|date=October 6, 2013|publisher=True Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died before she was born. Shortly after Mary's birth, her mother, Frances Phagan, moved the family back to their hometown of [[Marietta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Phagan14"&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; During or after 1907, they again relocated to [[East Point, Georgia]], in southwest Atlanta, where Frances opened a boarding house.&lt;ref&gt;Phagan Kean pp.&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Phagan left school at age 10 to work part-time in a textile mill.&lt;ref name="Oney5"&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, after her mother married John William Coleman, the family moved into the city of Atlanta.&lt;ref name="Phagan14"/&gt; That spring, Phagan took a job with the National Pencil Company, where she earned ten cents an hour operating a [[knurling]] machine that inserted rubber erasers into the metal tips of pencils, and worked 55 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Oney5"/&gt;{{refn|Oney writes, "Ordinarily, she was scheduled to work fifty-five hours. During the past six days, however, she'd been needed only for two abbreviated shifts. The sealed envelope awaiting her in her employer's office safe contained just $1.20."&lt;ref name="Oney 8-9"&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} She worked on the second floor of the factory in the metal room in a section called the tipping department, which was across the hallway from Leo Frank's office.&lt;ref name="Oney5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frey [https://books.google.com/books?id=s4YurAGAxYQC&amp;pg=PA5 p.&amp;nbsp;5].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of Phagan's body===

On April 21, 1913, Phagan was laid off due to a shortage of brass sheet metal.&lt;ref name="Oney 8-9" /&gt; Around noon on April 26, she went to the factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body in the rear of the basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, and her head was bruised and battered. A {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} strip of {{convert|1/4|in|mm|adj=on}} wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on}} deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A service ramp at the rear of the basement led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.&lt;ref name=Oney30&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two notes were found in a pile of rubbish by Phagan's head, and became known as the "murder notes". One said: "he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef." The other said, "mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me." The phrase "night witch" was thought to mean "night watch[man]"; when the notes were initially read aloud, night watchman Newt Lee is reported by police to have said, "Boss, it looks like they are trying to lay it on me" (or words to that effect). Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the body{{spaced en dash}}he stated that the girl was white when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.&lt;ref&gt;Golden pp.&amp;nbsp;19,&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21,&amp;nbsp;379.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police investigation===
[[File:Mary-phagan-murder-note.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A used page from an order pad|One of the two murder notes found near the body]]

In addition to Lee, the police arrested a friend of Phagan's for the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits. By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred on the second floor (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Newt Lee, after the discovery of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4&amp;nbsp;a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory.&lt;ref&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt; When the police arrived after 7&amp;nbsp;a.m. without telling the specifics of what happened at the factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;27–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, April 28, Frank, accompanied by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10&amp;nbsp;p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6&amp;nbsp;p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate that he had no cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood stains on the laundry at Frank's house.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;48–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank then met with his assistant, N. V. Darley, and Harry Scott of the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]], whom Frank hired to help investigate the case.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pinkerton detectives investigated many leads, ranging from crime scene evidence to allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of Frank. The Pinkertons were required to submit duplicates of all evidence to the police, including any that hurt Frank's case. Scott's collaboration with police detective John Black, who from the outset believed in Frank's guilt, resulted in a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's residence at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. looking for evidence, and found a blood-smeared shirt at the bottom of a [[burn barrel]].&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank was subsequently arrested around 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. at the factory. Steve Oney states that "no single development had persuaded&amp;nbsp;... [the police] that Leo Frank had murdered Mary Phagan. Instead, to the cumulative weight of Sunday's suspicions and Monday's misgivings had been added several last factors that tipped the scale against the superintendent."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors were the dropped charges against two suspects; the rejection of rumors that Phagan had been seen on the streets, making Frank the last person to admit seeing Phagan; Frank's meeting with the Pinkertons; and a "shifting view of Newt Lee's role in the affair."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; The police were convinced Lee was involved as Frank's accomplice and that Frank was trying to implicate him. To bolster their case, the police staged a confrontation between Lee and Frank while both were still in custody; there were conflicting accounts of this meeting, but the police interpreted it as further implicating Frank.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, April 30, a [[coroner's inquest]] was held. Frank testified about his activities on Saturday and other witnesses produced corroboration. A young man said that Phagan had complained to him about Frank. Several former employees spoke of Frank flirting with other women; one said she was actually propositioned. The detectives admitted that "they so far had obtained no conclusive evidence or clues in the baffling mystery&amp;nbsp;...". Lee and Frank were both ordered to be detained.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, the detective [[William J. Burns]] traveled to Atlanta to offer further assistance in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his [[William J. Burns International Detective Agency|Burns Agency]] withdrew from the case later that month. C. W. Tobie, a detective from the Chicago affiliate who was assigned to the case, said that the agency "came down here to investigate a murder case, not to engage in petty politic[s]."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency quickly became disillusioned with the many societal implications of the case, most notably the notion that Frank was able to evade prosecution due to his being a rich Jew, buying off the police and paying for private detectives.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James "Jim" Conley===
[[File:Jim Conley.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A portrait of Jim Conley in the pages of a magazine|Jim Conley as shown in the August 1915 issue of ''[[Watson's Magazine]]'']]

The prosecution based much of its case on the testimony of Jim Conley, the factory's janitor, who is believed by many historians to be the actual murderer.{{refn|For example: "The best evidence now available indicates that the real murderer of Mary Phagan was Jim Conley, perhaps because she, encountering him after she left Frank's office, refused to give him her pay envelope, and he, in a drunken stupor, killed her to get it."&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA254 p.&amp;nbsp;254].&lt;/ref&gt; "The city police, publicly committed to the theory of Frank's guilt, and hounded by the demand for a conviction, resorted to the basest methods in collecting evidence. A Negro suspect [Conley], later implicated by evidence overwhelmingly more incriminating than any produced against Frank, was thrust aside by the cry for the blood of the 'Jew Pervert.'"&lt;ref name="Woodward 435"&gt;Woodward p.&amp;nbsp;435.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} The police had arrested Conley on May 1 after he had been seen washing red stains out of a blue work shirt; detectives examined it for blood, but determined that it was rust as Conley had claimed, and returned it.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt; Conley was still in police custody two weeks later when he gave his first formal statement. He said that, on the day of the murder, he had been visiting saloons, shooting dice, and drinking. His story was called into question when a witness told detectives that "a black negro&amp;nbsp;... dressed in dark blue clothing and hat" had been seen in the lobby of the factory on the day of the murder. Further investigation determined that Conley could read and write,&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; and there were similarities in his spelling with that found on the murder notes. On May 24, he admitted he had written the notes, swearing that Frank had called him to his office the day before the murder and told him to write them.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;129–132.&lt;/ref&gt; After testing Conley again on his spelling{{spaced en dash}}he spelled "night watchman" as "night witch"{{spaced en dash}}the police were convinced he had written the notes. They were skeptical about the rest of his story, not only because it implied premeditation by Frank, but also because it suggested that Frank had confessed to Conley and involved him.&lt;ref name=Oney133&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;133–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a new affidavit (his second affidavit and third statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He said he had met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told him to leave the factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.&lt;ref name="Oney 134-136"&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;134–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The police were satisfied with the new story, and both ''The Atlanta Journal'' and ''The Atlanta Georgian'' gave the story front-page coverage. Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the ''Journal''. They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building, intending to rob her, but found Phagan was an easier target.&lt;ref name="Oney 134-136"/&gt; The police placed little credence in the officials' theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan's purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney, who was out of town. The police were quoted in ''The Atlanta Constitution'' saying that this refusal was an indication of Frank's guilt, and the meeting never took place.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, Conley was interviewed for four hours.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; His new affidavit said that Frank told him, "he had picked up a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two had returned to the office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." Conley's affidavit concluded, "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Georgian'' hired William Manning Smith to represent Conley for $40. Smith was known for specializing in representing black clients, and had successfully defended a black man against an accusation of rape by a white woman. He had also taken an elderly black woman's civil case as far as the Georgia Supreme Court. Although Smith believed Conley had told the truth in his final affidavit, he became concerned that Conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters. Smith was also anxious about reporters from the [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] papers, who had taken Frank's side. He arranged for Conley to be moved to a different jail, and severed his own relationship with the ''Georgian''.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 1914, Conley was sentenced to a year in jail for being an accomplice after the fact to the murder of Mary Phagan.&lt;ref&gt;Frey [https://books.google.com/books?id=s4YurAGAxYQC&amp;pg=PA132 p.&amp;nbsp;132].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
[[File:Leo-frank-police-have-the-strangler-headline.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=The front page of the Atlanta Georgian newspaper. The headline says "Police Have the Strangler". The article lead says "Late this afternoon, Chief of Detectives Lanford made this important statement to a Georgian reporter: 'We have the strangler. In my opinion the crime lies between two men, the negro watchman, Newt Lee and Frank. We have eliminated John Gantt and Arthur Mullinax.'"|''The Atlanta Georgian'' headline on April 29, 1913, showing that the police suspected Frank and Newt Lee.]]

''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution#The Atlanta Constitution|The Atlanta Constitution]]'' broke the story of the murder and was soon in competition with ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution#The Atlanta Journal|The Atlanta Journal]]'' and ''[[The Atlanta Georgian]]''. Forty extra editions came out the day Phagan's murder was reported. ''The Atlanta Georgian'' published a doctored morgue photo of Phagan, in which her head was shown spliced onto the body of another girl. The papers offered a total of $1,800 in reward money for information leading to the apprehension of the murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;36,&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the murder, Atlanta's mayor criticized the police for their steady release of information to the public. The governor, noting the reaction of the public to press sensationalism soon after Lee's and Frank's arrests, organized ten militia companies in case they were needed to repulse mob action against the prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of the case in the local press continued nearly unabated throughout the investigation, trial, and subsequent appeal process.

Newspaper reports throughout the period combined real evidence, unsubstantiated rumors, and journalistic speculation. Dinnerstein wrote, "Characterized by innuendo, misrepresentation, and distortion, the [[yellow journalism]] account of Mary Phagan's death aroused an anxious city, and within a few days, a shocked state."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; Different segments of the population focused on different aspects. Atlanta's working class saw Frank as "a defiler of young girls", while the German-Jewish community saw him as "an exemplary man and loyal husband."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;74,&amp;nbsp;87–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Lindemann, author of ''The Jew Accused'', opined that "ordinary people" may have had difficulty evaluating the often unreliable information and in "suspend[ing] judgment over a long period of time" while the case developed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA249 p.&amp;nbsp;249].&lt;/ref&gt; As the press shaped public opinion, much of the public's attention was directed at the police and the prosecution, whom they expected to bring Phagan's killer to justice. The prosecutor, [[Hugh Dorsey]], had recently lost two high-profile murder cases; one state newspaper wrote that "another defeat, and in a case where the feeling was so intense, would have been, in all likelihood, the end of Mr. Dorsey, as solicitor."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
[[File:Frank's trial.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|The courtroom on July 28, 1913. Dorsey is examining witness Newt Lee. Frank is in the center.]]

On May 23, 1913, a [[grand jury]] convened to hear evidence for an [[indictment]] against Leo Frank for the murder of Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;115–116,&amp;nbsp;236.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;178–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, the trial began at the Fulton County Superior Court (old city hall building). The judge, Leonard S. Roan, had been serving as a judge in Georgia since 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaappeals.us/history/judges.php?id=05 Leonard S. Roan, 1913–1914.] Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution team was led by Dorsey and included William Smith (Conley's attorney and Dorsey's jury consultant). Frank was represented by a team of eight lawyers{{spaced en dash}}including jury selection specialists{{spaced en dash}}led by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows. The defense, in their legal appeals, would later cite the crowds as factors in intimidation of the witnesses and jury.&lt;ref&gt;Knight [https://books.google.com/books?id=iKhauatvig4C&amp;pg=PA189 p.&amp;nbsp;189].&lt;/ref&gt;

Both legal teams, in planning their trial strategy, considered the implications of trying a white man based on the testimony of a black man in front of an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of ''Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South'', writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as "a new kind of African American{{spaced en dash}}anarchic, degraded, and dangerous."&lt;ref name=Melnick41&gt;Melnick [https://books.google.com/books?id=xQyzSumSD38C&amp;pg=PA41 p.&amp;nbsp;41].&lt;/ref&gt; Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as "a familiar type" of "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker.&lt;ref name=Melnick41/&gt; Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lEsv3zPuWGIC&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Gerald Ziedenberg|page=59|title=Epic Trials in Jewish History|date=2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4772-7060-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining the immediate aftermath of the murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein37,58&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;37,&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution presented witnesses who testified to bloodstains and strands of hair found on the lathe, to support their theory that the murder occurred on the factory's second floor in the machine room near Frank's office.&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein37,58/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;233.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense denied that the murder occurred on the second floor. Both sides contested the significance of physical evidence that suggested the place of the murder. Material found around Phagan's neck was shown to be present throughout the factory. The prosecution interpreted the scene in the basement to support Conley's story{{spaced en dash}}that the body was carried there by elevator{{spaced en dash}}while the defense suggested that the drag marks on the floor indicated that Conley carried the body down a ladder and then dragged it across the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;208–209,&amp;nbsp;231–232.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense argued that Conley was the murderer and that Newt Lee helped Conley write the two murder notes. The defense brought many witnesses to support Frank's account of his movements, which indicated he did not have enough time to commit the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Golden pp.&amp;nbsp;118–139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense, to support their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed in court that he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, although he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open and there was no purse in it.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;197,&amp;nbsp;256,&amp;nbsp;264,&amp;nbsp;273.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;179,&amp;nbsp;225,&amp;nbsp;228.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frank's alleged sexual behavior===
The prosecution focused on Frank's alleged sexual behavior.{{refn|Lindemann indicates there was a developing stereotype of "wanton, young Jewish males who hungered for fair-haired Gentile women." A familiar stereotype in Europe, it reached Atlanta in the 1890s "with the arrival of eastern European Jews." "Fear of Jewish sexuality may have had a special explosiveness in Atlanta at this time because it could easily connect to a central myth, or cultural theme, in the South{{spaced en dash}}that of the pure, virtuous, yet vulnerable White woman."&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA239 p.&amp;nbsp;239].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} They alleged that Frank, with Conley's assistance, regularly met with women in his office for sexual relations. On the day of the murder, Conley said he saw Phagan go upstairs, from where he heard a scream coming shortly after. He then said he dozed off; when he woke up, Frank called him upstairs and showed him Phagan's body, admitting that he had hurt her. Conley repeated statements from his affidavits that he and Frank took Phagan's body to the basement via the elevator, before returning in the elevator to the office where Frank dictated the murder notes.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;241–243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conley was cross-examined by the defense for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire testimony concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–47,&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;245–247,&amp;nbsp;252–253,&amp;nbsp;258–259,&amp;nbsp;265–266,&amp;nbsp;279.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson testified that she had tried to get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;273,&amp;nbsp;280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense called a number of factory girls, who testified that they had never seen Frank flirting with or touching the girls, and that they considered him to be of good character.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;295–296.&lt;/ref&gt; In the prosecution's rebuttal, Dorsey called "a steady parade of former factory workers" to ask them the question, "Do you know Mr. Frank's character for lasciviousness?" The answers were usually "bad".&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;309–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===

A paragraph below the drawing references these numbers in describing events were and when they happened.|''The Atlanta Journal''{{'s}} diagram of Jim Conley's account of the events after Phagan's murder]]

The prosecution realized early on that issues relating to time would be an essential part of its case.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;37–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;50,&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.{{refn|Both the motorman, W. M. Matthews, and the conductor, W. T. Hollis, testified that Phagan got off the trolley at 12:10. In addition, they both testified that Epps was not on the trolley. Epps said at trial that Phagan got off the trolley at 12:07. From the stop where Phagan exited the trolley, according to Atlanta police officer John N. Starnes, "It takes not over three minutes to walk from Marietta Street, at the corner of Forsyth, across the viaduct, and through Forsyth Street, down to the factory."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;48; Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;50,&amp;nbsp;197,&amp;nbsp;266.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}{{refn|Frank stated in his initial police deposition that Phagan "came in between 12:05 and 12:10, to get her pay envelope".&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

Lemmie Quinn, foreman of the metal room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank in his office at 12:20.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;278,&amp;nbsp;285.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank had not mentioned Quinn when the police first interviewed him about his whereabouts at noontime on April 26. Frank had said at the coroner's inquest that Quinn arrived less than ten minutes after Phagan had left his office,&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;87,&amp;nbsp;285.&lt;/ref&gt; and during the murder trial said Quinn arrived hardly five minutes after Phagan left.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.&amp;nbsp;226.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, it would have taken at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense's calculations, Frank's time was fully accounted for from 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;359.&lt;/ref&gt; Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that she come in that Saturday and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon. The prosecution labeled Quinn's testimony as "a fraud" and reminded the jury that early in the police investigation Frank had not mentioned Quinn.&lt;ref name="Oney 329"&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newt Lee, the night watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was normally calm, came bustling out of his office.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson pp.&amp;nbsp;182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank told Lee that he had not yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out and have a good time in town before coming back.&lt;ref&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;70.&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
When Lee returned at 6:00, James Gantt had also arrived. Lee told police that Gantt, a former employee who had been fired by Frank after $2 was found missing from the cash box, wanted to look for two pairs of shoes he had left at the factory. Frank allowed Gantt in, although Lee said that Frank appeared to be upset by Gantt's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank arrived home at 6:25; at 7:00, he called Lee to determine if everything had gone all right with Gantt.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction and sentencing===
During the trial, the prosecution alleged bribery and witness tampering attempts by the Frank legal team.&lt;ref&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the defense requested a [[mistrial]] because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people inside and outside the courtroom, but the motion was denied.{{refn|In its motion for a mistrial, the defense presented examples of the crowd's behavior to the court.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson pp.&amp;nbsp;398–399.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an [[acquittal]], Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read.{{refn|This was challenged as a violation of Frank's [[due process]] rights in Frank's appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court in November 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.&amp;nbsp;410,&amp;nbsp;fn.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his U.S. Supreme Court appeal, ''Frank v. Mangum'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/frank/frankappeals.html|title=Appellate Decisions in the Leo Frank Case|publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law|accessdate=October 1, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114072547/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/frank/frankappeals.html|archivedate=January 14, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.{{refn|The Atlanta ''Journal'' reported the next day that deliberation took less than two hours; at the first ballot one juror was undecided, but within two hours, the second vote was unanimous.&lt;ref name="Lawson 407"&gt;Lawson p.&amp;nbsp;407.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

The ''Constitution'' described the scene as Dorsey emerged from the steps of city hall: "The solicitor reached no farther than the sidewalk. While mounted men rode like [[Cossacks]] through the human swarm, three muscular men slung Mr. Dorsey on their shoulders and passed him over the heads of the crowd across the street."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leofrank.info/enright/new-york-times-1914-12-14-finds-mob-frenzy-convicted-frank.pdf "Finds Mob Frenzy Convicted Frank."] ''The New York Times'', December 14, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Lindemann suggests "the powerless experienced a moment of exhilaration in seeing the defeat and humiliation of a normally powerful and inaccessible oppressor."&lt;ref name="Lindemann 251"/&gt;

On August 26, the day after the guilty verdict was reached by the jury, Judge Roan brought counsel into private chambers and sentenced Leo Frank to death by hanging with the date set to October 10. The defense team issued a public protest, alleging that public opinion unconsciously influenced the jury to the prejudice of Frank.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.&amp;nbsp;409.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was carried forward throughout the appeal process.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;352–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==
[[File:ThomasEWatson.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|alt=refer to caption|[[Thomas E. Watson|Tom Watson]], publisher of ''Watson's Magazine'' and ''The Jeffersonian'', incited public opinion against Frank.]]

Under Georgia law at the time, appeals of death penalty cases had to be based on errors of law, not a reevaluation of the evidence presented at trial.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, "I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I do not have to be convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linder, Douglas. "New Evidence and Appeals," in [https://web.archive.org/web/20170307192357/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/frank/frankaccount.html The Trial of Leo Frank: An Account].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman pp.&amp;nbsp;1477–80 with footnotes 39–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State appeals===
The next step, a hearing before the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]], was held on December 15. In addition to presenting the existing written record, each side was granted two hours for oral arguments. In addition to the old arguments, the defense focused on the reservations expressed by Judge Roan at the reconsideration hearing, citing six cases where new trials had been granted after the trial judge expressed misgivings about the jury verdict. The prosecution countered with arguments that the evidence convicting Frank was substantial and that listing Judge Roan's doubts in the defense's bill of exceptions was not the proper vehicle for "carry[ing] the views of the judge."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;81,&amp;nbsp;163–165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oney 369-370"&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;369–370.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, 1914, in a 142-page decision, the court denied Frank a new trial by a 4–2 vote. The majority dismissed the allegations of bias by the jurors, saying the power of determining this rested strictly with the trial judge except when an "abuse of discretion" was proved. It also ruled that spectator influence could only be the basis of a new trial if ruled so by the trial judge. Conley's testimony on Frank's alleged sexual conduct was found to be admissible because, even though it suggested Frank had committed other crimes for which he was not charged, it made Conley's statements more credible and helped to explain Frank's motivation for committing the crime according to the majority. On Judge Roan's stated reservations, the court ruled that these did not trump his legal decision to deny a motion for a new trial.&lt;ref name="Oney 369-370"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 81-82"&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenting justices restricted their opinion to Conley's testimony, which they declared should not have been allowed to stand: "It is perfectly clear to us that evidence of prior bad acts of lasciviousness committed by the defendant&amp;nbsp;... did not tend to prove a preexisting design, system, plan, or scheme, directed toward making an assault upon the deceased or killing her to prevent its disclosure." They concluded that the evidence prejudiced Frank in the jurors' eyes and denied him a fair trial.&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 81-82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;370.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last hearing exhausted Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution was set for April 17 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;377.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense continued to investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion{{refn|Dinnerstein defines an "extraordinary motion" as a motion based on new information not available at the time of the trial. It was needed to continue through the appeals process because the ordinary procedures had been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;201 (fn 12).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a [[stay of execution]] and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;395.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of the hair on the lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At the same time that the various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;84–90,&amp;nbsp;102–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;371–373,&amp;nbsp;378–380,&amp;nbsp;385–387,&amp;nbsp;389–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense also raised a federal constitutional issue on whether Frank's absence from the court when the verdict was announced "constituted deprivation of the due process of law". Different attorneys were brought in to argue this point since Rosser and Arnold had acquiesced in Frank's absence. There was a debate between Rosser and Arnold on whether it should be raised at this time since its significance might be lost with all of the other evidence being presented. Louis Marshall, President of the American Jewish Committee and constitutional lawyer, urged them to raise the point, and the decision was made that it should be made clear that if the extraordinary motion was rejected they intended to appeal through the federal court system and there would be an impression of injustice in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; For almost every issue presented by the defense, the state had a response: most of the repudiations were either retracted or disavowed by the witnesses; the question of whether outdated order pads used to write the murder notes had been in the basement before the murder was disputed; the integrity of the defense's investigators were questioned and intimidation and bribery were charged; and the significance of Conley's letters to Annie Carter was disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;403–416.&lt;/ref&gt; The defense, in its rebuttal, tried to bolster the testimony relating to the murder notes and the Carter letters. (These issues were reexamined later when the governor considered commuting Frank's sentence.)&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;416–417.&lt;/ref&gt; During the defense's closing argument, the issue of the repudiations was put to rest by Judge Hill's ruling that the court could only consider the revocation of testimony if the subject were tried and found guilty of perjury.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;418.&lt;/ref&gt; The judge denied Frank a new trial and the full court upheld the decision on November 14, 1914. The full court also said that the due process issue should have been raised earlier, characterizing what it considered a belated effort as "trifling with the court".&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;446.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal appeals===
The next step for the Frank team was to appeal the issue through the federal system. The original request for a writ of error on the absence of Frank from the jury's announcement of the verdict was first denied by Justice [[Joseph Rucker Lamar]] and then Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] Both denied the request because they agreed with the Georgia court that the issue was raised too late. The full Supreme Court then heard arguments, but denied the motion without issuing a written decision. However, Holmes said, "I very seriously doubt if the petitioner&amp;nbsp;... has had [[due process]] of law&amp;nbsp;... because of the trial taking place in the presence of a hostile demonstration and seemingly dangerous crowd, thought by the presiding Judge to be ready for violence unless a verdict of guilty was rendered."&lt;ref&gt;Freedman p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes' statement, as well as public indignation over this latest rejection by the courts, encouraged Frank's team to attempt a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' motion, arguing that the threat of crowd violence had forced Frank to be absent from the verdict hearing and constituted a violation of due process. Justice Lamar heard the motion and agreed that the full Supreme Court should hear the appeal.

On April 19, 1915, the Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 7–2 vote in the case ''Frank v. Mangum''. Part of the decision repeated the message of the last decision: that Frank failed "to raise the objection in due season when fully cognizant of the fact."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;110.&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes and [[Charles Evans Hughes]] dissented, with Holmes writing, "It is our duty to declare lynch law as little valid when practiced by a regularly drawn jury as when administered by one elected by a mob intent on death."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;468.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commutation of sentence==

===Hearing===
[[File:John Slaton and wife.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Governor John Slaton and wife]]

On April 22, 1915, an application for a commutation of Frank's death sentence was submitted to a three-person Prison Commission in Georgia; it was rejected on June 9 by a vote of 2–1. The dissenter indicated that he felt it was wrong to execute a man "on the testimony of an accomplice, when the circumstances of the crime tend to fix the guilt upon the accomplice."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;470,&amp;nbsp;473,&amp;nbsp;480–488.&lt;/ref&gt; The application then passed to Governor [[John Slaton]]. Slaton had been elected in 1912 and his term would end four days after Frank's scheduled execution. In 1913, before Phagan's murder, Slaton agreed to merge his law firm with that of Luther Rosser, who became Frank's lead attorney (Slaton was not directly involved in the original trial). After the commutation, popular Georgia politician [[Thomas E. Watson|Tom Watson]] attacked Slaton, often focusing on his partnership with Rosser as a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann p.&amp;nbsp;270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaton opened hearings on June 12. In addition to receiving presentations from both sides with new arguments and evidence, Slaton visited the crime scene and reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. This included various letters, including one written by Judge Roan shortly before he died asking Slaton to correct his mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;489–499.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaton also received more than 1,000 death threats. During the hearing, former Governor Joseph Brown warned Slaton, "In all frankness, if Your Excellency wishes to invoke lynch law in Georgia and destroy trial by jury, the way to do it is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.leofrank.info/enright/new-york-times-1915-06-13-begin-last-frank-plea-to-governor.pdf "Begin Last Frank Plea to Governor"], ''The New York Times'', June 13, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The Roan letter was addressed to the pardons board but received by Rosser.

The state of uncertainty is largely due to the character of the negro Conley's testimony, by which the verdict was evidently reached&amp;nbsp;...

Roan indicated a willingness to meet with the governor and the parole board, but died before he could do so.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;469–479.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} According to Tom Watson's biographer, [[C. Vann Woodward]], "While the hearings of the petition to commute were in progress Watson sent a friend to the governor with the promise that if Slaton allowed Frank to hang, Watson would be his 'friend', which would result in his 'becoming United States senator and the master of Georgia politics for twenty years to come.'"&lt;ref&gt;Woodward p.&amp;nbsp;440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaton produced a 29-page report. In the first part, he criticized outsiders who were unfamiliar with the evidence, especially the press in the North. He defended the trial court's decision, which he felt was sufficient for a guilty verdict. He summarized points of the state's case against Frank that "any reasonable person" would accept and said of Conley that "It is hard to conceive that any man's power of fabrication of minute details could reach that which Conley showed, unless it be the truth." After having made these points, Slaton's narrative changed course and asked the rhetorical question, "Did Conley speak the truth?"&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;499–500.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Dinnerstein wrote, "Slaton based his opinions primarily upon the inconsistencies he had discovered in the narrative of Jim Conley."&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 127"&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;127.&lt;/ref&gt; Two factors stood out to Slaton: the transporting of the body to the basement and the murder notes.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;500–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transport of the body====
During the initial investigation, police had noted undisturbed human excrement in the elevator shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an indication that the elevator could not have been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.{{refn|"Thus, Conley's elaborate testimony, which included using the elevator with Frank to take the body to the basement, was put into question."&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=%22Thus,+Conley's+elaborate+testimony,+which+included+using+the+elevator+with+Frank+to+take+the+body+to+the+basement,+was+put+into+question.%22 p.&amp;nbsp;269].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}{{refn|"Where in the past, Frank's lawyers had caught Conley in little lies, ones he blithely admitted, here, for the first time in an official forum, they had apparently caught him in a big lie, one that cast doubt on his entire testimony."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;489.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}{{refn|"If one accepted the fact that the girl's body did not reach the basement via the elevator, then Conley's whole narrative fell apart, the Governor concluded."&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 127" /&gt;|group=n}}
 
During the commutation hearing, Slaton asked Dorsey to address this issue. Dorsey said that the elevator did not always go all the way to the bottom and could be stopped anywhere. Frank's attorney rebutted this by quoting Conley, who said that the elevator stops when it hits the bottom. Slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to the factory, concluding that every time the elevator made the trip to the basement it touched the bottom. Slaton said, "If the elevator was not used by Conley and Frank in taking the body to the basement, then the explanation of Conley cannot be accepted."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;495–496,&amp;nbsp;501.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Quoting from Slaton's statement, "In addition, there was found in the elevator shaft at 3 o'clock Sunday morning, the parasol, which was unhurt, and a ball of cord which had not been mashed."&lt;ref&gt;Golden pp.&amp;nbsp;266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

====Murder notes====
The murder notes had been analyzed before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert [[Albert S. Osborn]] reviewed the previous evidence at the commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written in the third person rather than the first person. He said that the first person would have been more logical since they were intended to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a [[Cornell University|Cornell]]-educated manager like Frank.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conley's former attorney, William Smith, had become convinced that his client had committed the murder. Smith produced a 100-page analysis of the notes for the defense. He analyzed "speech and writing patterns" and "spelling, grammar, repetition of adjectives, [and] favorite verb forms". He concluded, "In this article I show clearly that Conley did not tell the truth about those notes."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;483.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaton compared the murder notes, Conley's letters to Annie Maude Carter, and his trial testimony. Throughout these documents, he found similar use of the words "like", "play", "lay", "love", and "hisself". He also found double adjectives such as "long tall negro", "tall, slim build heavy man", and "good long wide piece of cord in his hands".&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaton was also convinced that the murder notes were written in the basement, not in Frank's office. Slaton accepted the defense's argument that the notes were written on dated order pads signed by a former employee that were only kept in the basement.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaton wrote that the employee signed an affidavit stating that, when he left the company in 1912, "he personally packed up all of the duplicate orders&amp;nbsp;... and sent them down to the basement to be burned. This evidence was never passed upon by the jury and developed since the trial."&lt;ref&gt;Golden pp.&amp;nbsp;267–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing and physical evidence===
Slaton's narrative touched on other aspects of the evidence and testimony that suggested reasonable doubt. For example, he accepted the defense's argument that charges by Conley of perversion were based on someone coaching him that Jews were circumcised. He accepted the defense's interpretation of the timeline;&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;501.&lt;/ref&gt; citing the evidence produced at trial{{spaced en dash}}including the possibility that Stover did not see Frank because she did not proceed further than the outer office{{spaced en dash}}he wrote: "Therefore, Monteen Stover must have arrived before Mary Phagan, and while Monteen Stover was in the room it hardly seems possible under the evidence, that Mary Phagan was at that time being murdered."&lt;ref&gt;Golden pp.&amp;nbsp;268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaton also said that Phagan's head wound must have bled profusely, yet there was no blood found on the lathe, the ground nearby, in the elevator, or the steps leading downstairs. He also said that Phagan's nostrils and mouth were filled with dirt and sawdust which could only have come from the basement.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaton also commented on Conley's story (that Conley was watching out for the arrival of a lady for Frank on the day of the murder):

{{quote|His story necessarily bears the construction that Frank had an engagement with Mary Phagan which no evidence in the case would justify. If Frank had engaged Conley to watch for him, it could only have been for Mary Phagan, since he made no improper suggestion to any other female on that day, and it was undisputed that many did come up prior to 12.00 o'clock, and whom could Frank have been expecting except Mary Phagan under Conley's story. This view cannot be entertained, as an unjustifiable reflection on the young girl.&lt;ref&gt;Golden p.&amp;nbsp;348.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Conclusion===
On Monday, June 21, 1915, Slaton released the order to commute Frank's murder conviction to life imprisonment. Slaton's legal rationale was that there was sufficient new evidence not available at the original trial to justify Frank's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;502.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

{{quote|In the Frank case three matters have developed since the trial which did not come before the jury, to-wit: The Carter notes, the testimony of Becker, indicating the death notes were written in the basement, and the testimony of Dr. Harris, that he was under the impression that the hair on the lathe was not that of Mary Phagan, and thus tending to show that the crime was not committed on the floor of Frank's office. While defense made the subject an extraordinary for a new trial, it is well known that it is almost a practical impossibility to have a verdict set aside by this procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Golden p.&amp;nbsp;352.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The commutation was headline news. Atlanta Mayor Jimmy Woodward remarked that "The larger part of the population believes Frank guilty and that the commutation was a mistake."&lt;ref name="Oney 503"&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;503.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Slaton invited the press to his home that afternoon, telling them:

{{quote|All I ask is that the people of Georgia read my statement and consider calmly the reasons I have given for commuting Leo M. Frank's sentence. Feeling as I do about this case, I would be a murderer if I allowed that man to hang. I would rather be ploughing in a field than to feel for the rest of my life that I had that man's blood on my hands.&lt;ref name="Oney 503" /&gt;}}

He also told reporters that he was certain that Conley was the actual murderer.&lt;ref name="Oney 503" /&gt; Slaton privately told friends that he would have issued a full pardon, if not for his belief that Frank would soon be able to prove his own innocence.{{refn|"Privately, Slaton confided to friends that he believed Frank innocent and would have granted a full pardon if he were not convinced that in a short while the truth would come out and then 'the very men who were clamoring for Frank's life would be demanding a pardon for him.' The Governor knew certain 'facts' about the case, which he did not reveal at the time, corroborating the defense's theory of the way Conley had murdered Mary Phagan."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;129,&amp;nbsp;169–171.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

===Reaction of the public===
The public was outraged. A mob threatened to attack the governor at his home. A detachment of the Georgia National Guard, along with county policemen and a group of Slaton's friends who were sworn in as deputies, dispersed the mob.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2137 John M. Slaton (1866–1955)], ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaton had been a popular governor, but he and his wife left Georgia immediately thereafter.&lt;ref name=glad&gt;[https://www.leofrank.info/enright/new-york-times-1915-06-30-slaton-here-glad-he-saved-frank.pdf "Slaton Here; Glad He Saved Frank"], ''The New York Times'', June 30, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Frank's protection, he was taken to the [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] State Penitentiary in the middle of the night before the commutation was announced. The penitentiary was "strongly garrisoned and newly bristling with arms" and separated from Marietta by {{convert|150|mi|km}} of mostly unpaved road.&lt;ref&gt;Oney 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;513–514.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 17, ''The New York Times'' reported that fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat with a {{convert|7|in|cm|adj=on}} butcher knife, severing his jugular vein. The attacker told the authorities he "wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence, Frank's presence was a disgrace to the prison, and he was sure he would be pardoned if he killed Frank."&lt;ref&gt;For stories about the attack, see:

==Antisemitism and media coverage==

The sensationalism in the press that started before the trial continued throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond.{{refn|The ''Georgian'' offered a $500 reward for information on the case, and produced several extras during the trial. Speaking on the impact of the reward money, Oney wrote, "In effect, the bounty served to deputize the entire city, and by late Monday, the officers working the case would be spending more time following dubious tips than developing legitimate leads."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, but they were not entirely anti-Frank. The ''Constitution'' alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the ''Georgian'' and the ''Journal'' would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the ''Journal'' called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would "amount to judicial murder." Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on "the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury of our fellow human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;381–382.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Bricker wrote in 1943, "My feelings, upon the arrest of the old negro nightwatchman, were to the effect that this one old negro would be poor atonement for the life of this innocent girl. But, when on the next day, the police arrested a Jew, and a Yankee Jew at that, all of the inborn prejudice against Jews rose up in a feeling of satisfaction, that here would be a victim worthy to pay for the crime."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

On October 12, 1913, the ''New York Sun'' became the first major northern paper to give a detailed account of the Frank trial. In discussing the charges of antisemitism in the trial, it described Atlanta as more liberal on the subject than any other southern cities. It went on to say that antisemitism did arise during the trial as Atlantans reacted to statements attributed to Frank's Jewish supporters, who dismissed Phagan as "nothing but a factory girl". The paper said, "The anti-Semitic feeling was the natural result of the belief that the Jews had banded to free Frank, innocent or guilty. The supposed solidarity of the Jews for Frank, even if he was guilty, caused a Gentile solidarity against him."&lt;ref name="Oney 366"&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;366.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 1913, the executive committee of the [[American Jewish Committee]], headed by [[Louis Marshall]], addressed the Frank case. They did so following Judge Roan's reconsideration motion and motivated by the issues raised in the ''Sun''. They chose not to take a public stance as a committee, instead deciding to raise funds individually to influence public opinion in favor of Frank.&lt;ref name="Oney 366"/&gt;

[[Albert Lasker]], a wealthy advertising magnate, responded to these calls to help Frank. Lasker contributed personal funds and arranged a public relations effort in support of Frank. In Atlanta, during the time of the extraordinary motion, Lasker coordinated Frank's meetings with the press and coined the slogan "The Truth Is on the March" to characterize the efforts of Frank's defense team. He persuaded prominent figures such as [[Thomas Edison]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[Jane Addams]] to make statements supporting Frank.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;367,&amp;nbsp;377–378,&amp;nbsp;388.&lt;/ref&gt; During the commutation hearing, Vice President [[Thomas R. Marshall]] weighed in, as did many leading magazine and newspaper editors, including [[Herbert Croly]], editor of the ''New Republic''; C.P.J. Mooney, editor of the ''Chicago Tribune''; Mark Sullivan, editor of ''Collier's''; R. E. Stafford, editor of the ''Daily Oklahoman''; and D. D. Moore, editor of the ''New Orleans Times-Picayune''.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;491.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolph Ochs]], publisher of ''The New York Times'', became involved about the same time as Lasker, organizing a prolonged campaign advocating for a new trial for Frank.{{refn|Oney writes, "December 1914 found the New York Times in the midst of an all-out drive of the sort it had never undertaken before. Only three days during the month did the paper not publish a major article on the Frank case. Some of its stories, particularly if there was a new development, strove for balance, but by and large, Ochs's sheet was more interested in disseminating propaganda than in practicing journalism."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Both Ochs and Lasker attempted to heed Louis Marshall's warnings about antagonizing the "sensitiveness of the southern people and engender the feeling that the north is criticizing the courts and the people of Georgia." Dinnerstein writes that these attempts failed, "because many Georgians interpreted every item favorable to Frank as a hostile act."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Watson, editor of the ''Jeffersonian'', had remained publicly silent during Frank's trial. Among Watson's political enemies was Senator [[Hoke Smith]], former owner of ''The Atlanta Journal'', which was still considered to be Smith's political instrument. When the ''Journal'' called for a reevaluation of the evidence against Frank, Watson, in the March 19, 1914 edition of his magazine, attacked Smith for trying "to bring the courts into disrepute, drag down the judges to the level of criminals, and destroy the confidence of the people in the orderly process of the law."&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 97"&gt;Dinnerstein 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson also questioned whether Frank expected "extraordinary favors and immunities because of his race"&lt;ref name="Dinnerstein 97" /&gt; and questioned the wisdom of Jews to "risk the good name&amp;nbsp;... of the whole race" to save "the decadent offshoot of a great people."&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;383.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent articles concentrated on the Frank case and became more and more impassioned in their attacks. C. Vann Woodward writes that Watson "pulled all the stops: Southern chivalry, sectional animus, race prejudice, class consciousness, agrarian resentment, state pride."{{refn|Among Watson's comments: "Here we have the typical young libertine Jew who is dreaded and detested by the city authorities of the North for the very reason that Jews of this type have an utter contempt for law, and a ravenous appetite for the forbidden fruit{{spaced en dash}}a lustful eagerness enhanced by the racial novelty of the girl of the uncircumcized."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward pp.&amp;nbsp;437–439.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

When describing the public reaction to Frank, historians mention the class and ethnic tensions in play while acknowledging the complexity of the case and the difficulty in gauging the importance of his Jewishness, class, and northern background. Historian [[John Higham (historian)|John Higham]] writes that "economic resentment, frustrated progressivism, and race consciousness combined to produce a classic case of lynch law.&amp;nbsp;... Hatred of organized wealth reaching into Georgia from outside became a hatred of Jewish wealth."{{refn|Higham places the incidents in Atlanta within the context of a wider national trend. The failure of progressives to solve national and international problems led to nativist displays "of hysteria and violence that had been rare or nonexistent since the 1890s."&lt;ref&gt;Higham p.&amp;nbsp;185.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Historian [[Nancy MacLean]] writes that some historians have argued that this was an American [[Dreyfus affair]], which she said "[could] be explained only in light of the social tensions unleashed by the growth of industry and cities in the turn-of-the-century South. These circumstances made a Jewish employer a more fitting scapegoat for disgruntled whites than the other leading suspect in the case, a black worker."&lt;ref&gt;MacLean p.&amp;nbsp;918.&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Lindemann said that Frank on trial found himself "in a position of much latent tension and symbolism." Stating that it is impossible to determine the extent to which antisemitism affected his image, he concluded that "[Frank was seen as] a representative of Yankee capitalism in a southern city, with row upon row of southern women, often the daughters and wives of ruined farmers, 'at his mercy'{{spaced en dash}}a rich, punctilious, northern Jew lording it over vulnerable and impoverished working women."{{refn|Lindemann wrote, "Even many Jews in Atlanta long remained doubtful about the importance of Frank's Jewishness in his arrest and conviction. They could hardly ignore the much-heightened tensions between Jew and non-Jew in the city as a result of the trial, as a result particularly of the widespread belief, after Frank's conviction, that the Jews were trying, through devious means, to arrange that a convicted murderer be freed."&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann [https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=%22Even+many+Jews+in+Atlanta+long+remained+doubtful+about+the+importance+of+Frank's+Jewishness+in+his+arrest+and+conviction.%22 pp.&amp;nbsp;238–239].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

==Abduction and lynching of Frank==
[[File:JosephMacBrown.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=refer to caption|Former Georgia Governor [[Joseph Mackey Brown]], one of the "Knights"]]

The June 21, 1915 commutation provoked Tom Watson into advocating Frank's lynching.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward p.&amp;nbsp;439.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in ''The Jeffersonian'' and ''Watson's Magazine'': "This country has nothing to fear from its rural communities. Lynch law is a good sign; it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward p.&amp;nbsp;432.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|About two dozen people were lynched each year in Georgia; in 1915 the number was 22; see Oney p.&amp;nbsp;122.|group=n}} A group of prominent men organized themselves into the "Knights of Mary Phagan" and openly planned to kidnap Frank from prison. They consisted of 28 men with various skills: an electrician was to cut the prison wires, car mechanics were to keep the cars running, and there was a locksmith, a telephone man, a medic, a hangman, and a [[wiktionary:lay preacher|lay preacher]].&lt;ref name=Phagan223&gt;Phagan Kean p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;/ref&gt; The ringleaders were well known locally but were not named publicly until June 2000, when a local librarian posted a list on the Web based on information compiled by Mary Phagan's great-niece, Mary Phagan Kean (b. 1953).&lt;ref&gt;Emory University, Leo Frank Collection, Mary Phagan Kean's list of vigilance committee's members, [https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/frank674/#dsc Box 1, Folder 14].&lt;/ref&gt; The list included [[Joseph Mackey Brown]], former governor of Georgia; [[Eugene Herbert Clay]], former mayor of Marietta and later president of the Georgia Senate; E.

They arrived at the prison at around 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., and the electrician cut the telephone wires, members of the group drained the gas from the prison's automobiles, handcuffed the warden, seized Frank, and drove away. The {{convert|175|mi|km|adj=on}} trip took about seven hours at a top speed of {{convert|18|mph}} through small towns on back roads. Lookouts in the towns telephoned ahead to the next town as soon as they saw the line of cars pass by.

In Atlanta, thousands besieged the undertaker's parlor, demanding to see the body; after they began throwing bricks, they were allowed to file past the corpse.&lt;ref name=grim/&gt; Frank's body was then transported by rail on [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]]'s train No. 36 from Atlanta to New York and buried in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in [[Glendale, Queens]], New York on August 20, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;573–576.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' wrote that the vast majority of Cobb County believed he had received his [[Retributive justice|"just deserts"]], and that the lynch mob had simply stepped in to uphold the law after Governor Slaton arbitrarily set it aside.&lt;ref name=grim/&gt; A [[Cobb County]] grand jury was convened to indict the lynchers; although they were well known locally, none were identified.&lt;ref&gt;Alphin p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nat Harris]], the newly elected governor who succeeded Slaton, promised to punish the mob, issuing a $1,500 state reward for information. Despite this, Charles Willis Thompson of ''The New York Times'' said that the citizens of Marietta "would die rather than reveal their knowledge or even their suspicion [of the identities of the lynchers]", and the local ''Macon Telegraph'' said, "Doubtless they can be apprehended{{spaced en dash}}doubtful they will."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;582–583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several photographs were taken of the lynching, which were published and sold as postcards in local stores for 25 cents each; also sold were pieces of the rope, Frank's nightshirt, and branches from the tree. According to Elaine Marie Alphin, author of ''An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank'', they were selling so fast that the police announced that sellers would require a city license.&lt;ref&gt;Alphin [https://books.google.com/books?id=luQSBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22Any+person+selling+articles+represented+as+souvenirs+of+the+lynching+of+Leo+Frank+must+have+a+city+license.%22 p.&amp;nbsp;122.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the postcards, members of the lynch mob or crowd can be seen posing in front of the body, one of them holding a portable camera. Historian Amy Louise Wood writes that local newspapers did not publish the photographs because it would have been too controversial, given that the lynch mob can be clearly seen and that the lynching was being condemned around the country. The ''[[The State (newspaper)|Columbia State]]'', which opposed the lynching, wrote: "The heroic Marietta lynchers are too modest to give their photographs to the newspapers." Wood also writes that a news film of the lynching that included the photographs was released, although it focused on the crowds without showing Frank's body; its showing was prevented by censorship boards around the U.S., though Wood says there is no evidence that it was stopped in Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;Wood pp.&amp;nbsp;77,&amp;nbsp;106,&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Wood writes that Kenneth Rogers, the head of photography at ''The Atlanta Constitution'' and ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' between 1924 and 1972, had access to at least one of the photographs, leaving it in the Kenneth Rogers Papers at the Atlanta History Center.

==After the trial==
Leo Frank's case was mentioned by [[Adolf Kraus]] when he announced the creation of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in October 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Moore p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chanes p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt; After Frank's lynching, around half of Georgia's 3,000 Jews left the state.&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis and Cox p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Steve Oney, "What it did to Southern Jews can't be discounted&amp;nbsp;...

Critics cite a number of problems with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial.{{refn|Early newspaper charges included a charge by a madam, Nina Formby, that Frank wanted her assistance in keeping a young girl on the night of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; A private detective claimed to have seen Frank rendezvousing with a young girl in a wooded area in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Early reports of blood and hair samples in the office next to Frank's turned out to be suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann pp.&amp;nbsp;242–[https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA243 243].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider.{{refn|It is alleged that Dorsey "suppressed evidence" favorable to Frank, intimidated and bribed witnesses, "drilled Conley in false testimony", "may have lacked the moral strength to back down" as contradictory evidence was uncovered, and feared that if he reversed himself he would have "ruined his career" and be accused of "having sold out to the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Lindemann pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA250 250],&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA252 252].&lt;/ref&gt; Dinnerstein writes on p.&amp;nbsp;19, "He had recently prosecuted two important accused murderers and had failed each time to convict them."

"Among reporters, the consensus was that the Phagan prosecution represented nothing less than a last chance for him."&lt;ref&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.{{refn|Physical evidence suggested the murder occurred in the basement rather than upstairs (as claimed by Conley). Smith's analysis of the murder notes convinced him Conley composed them independently and were planted by Phagan's body as if she wrote them.

===Applications for posthumous pardon===

====First attempt====
In 1982, Alonzo Mann, who had been Frank's office boy at the time of Phagan's murder, told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' that he had seen Jim Conley alone shortly after noon carrying Phagan's body through the lobby toward the ladder descending into the basement.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tennessean'' special news section, p.&amp;nbsp;15, in Dinnerstein 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Mann's testimony was not sufficient to settle the issue, it was the basis of an attempt by Charles Wittenstein, southern counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, and Dale Schwartz, an Atlanta lawyer, to obtain a posthumous pardon for Frank from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The board also reviewed the files from Slaton's commutation decision.&lt;ref&gt;Oney p.&amp;nbsp;684.&lt;/ref&gt; It denied the pardon in 1983, hindered in its investigation by the lack of available records. It concluded that, "After exhaustive review and many hours of deliberation, it is impossible to decide conclusively the guilt or innocence of Leo M. Frank. For the board to grant a pardon, the innocence of the subject must be shown conclusively."&lt;ref name="Oney 647-648"&gt;Oney pp.&amp;nbsp;647–648.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the lead editorial in ''The Atlanta Constitution'' began, "Leo Frank has been lynched a second time."&lt;ref&gt;Dinnerstein, Leonard (October 1996).

====Second attempt====
Frank supporters submitted a second application for pardon, asking the state only to recognize its culpability over his death. The board granted the pardon in 1986.&lt;ref name="Oney 647-648" /&gt; It said:

{{quote|Without attempting to address the question of guilt or innocence, and in recognition of the State's failure to protect the person of Leo M.

'''Mamert Stankiewicz''' (January 22, 1889 &amp;ndash; November 26, 1939) was a [[Poland|Polish]] naval officer of the [[merchant marine]], the commander of ''[[Lwów (ship)|Lwów]]'', SS ''Polonia'' and finally the captain of the Polish ocean liner [[MS Piłsudski|MS ''Piłsudski'']]. On the 26th of November 1939 during  [[World War II]], while the captain of "Pilsudski" incorporated into the British Navy and converted into the ship transporting British and Polish soldiers was torpedoed by German U-boat, he, after inspecting the entire sinking ship that there were no sailors and soldiers left behind, and after rescuing sailors and soldiers from the ice-cold Northern Atlantic, he died of exhaustion. Stankiewicz's life was immortalized by [[Karol Olgierd Borchardt]], whose series of books on Stankiewicz became a best-seller among [[literature in Poland|Polish maritime books]].

== Biography ==
Stankiewicz was born in [[Mitau]] in [[Courland]](now Jelgava in [[Latvia]]) to a [[Szlachta|Polish noble]]  family with "Grave" coat of arms. The Stankiewicz Family lived there, after the return from imprisonment in Syberia for the involvement in the [[January Uprising]] of 1830 against the occupying Poland the Czar's Russia. He graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps in [[St. Petersburg]] and joined the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. During [[World War I]] he was initially a navigation officer on board the [[Rurik (1906)|Russian armoured cruiser ''Riurik'']], the flagship of the [[Baltic Fleet]]. A successful officer, he was made Chief of Staff of the Baltic Fleet during the first battles in the [[Gulf of Riga]], after which he also briefly served as a commanding officer of one of the Char's Navy [[battleship]]s. 

Dispatched by the Imperial court to the [[United States]], in 1918 he became a naval attache in the Russian consulate in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. However, the following year he returned to Russia and joined the riverine flotilla in Siberia during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Arrested by the [[Cheka]], he was imprisoned in [[Irkutsk]] and then in a prison camp in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Following the [[Peace of Riga]] ending the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] Stankiewicz was a subject of a [[prisoner of war]] exchange and was allowed to settle in Poland. Verified in the rank of [[lieutenant-commander]] (komandor podporucznik), Stankiewicz joined the newly formed [[Polish Navy]] and became a commander of the Navigation Department of the Naval School of [[Tczew]], the first maritime school in Polish history. Soon afterwards he also started his career as a lecturer of navigation and [[astronomy]] at the Maritime Officers' School in [[Toruń]]. 

In 1923 he returned to the high seas as one of the officers on board ''[[Lwów (ship)|Lwów]]'', a barque serving as a [[school ship]] during her voyage to Brazil. The following year he became the commanding officer of that ship and held that post until 1926, when he left the Polish Navy and joined the merchant marine as a commander of numerous cargo ships and a ship pilot at the Maritime Authority in [[Gdynia]]. One of the most experienced [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]s in the [[Polish Merchant Marine]], in 1931 he became the commanding officer of the prestigious, yet obsolete [[ocean liner]]s [[SS Pułaski|SS ''Pułaski'']] and SS ''Polonia''. About that time he also became a member of the team supervising the design and construction of a modern ocean liner, the MS ''Piłsudski''. 

When she was completed in 1935, Stankiewicz became her first commanding officer. The ship, being the most modern ship in the Polish merchant marine and among the most luxurious European ocean liners, made numerous voyages from Poland and [[Constanţa]] in Romania to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]] and the United States. M/S ''Piłsudski'' commenced her last voyage as an ocean liner on a Gdynia – [[Copenhagen]] – [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] – [[New York City]] route on August 11, 1939. However, she was caught on the high seas by the outbreak of the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Polish Defensive War]] and World War II. She was then commandeered by the Polish Navy, renamed [[ORP Piłsudski|ORP ''Piłsudski'']] and moved to a shipyard in northern England, where she was turned into an [[troopship]]. 

However, on November 26, 1939, during her maiden voyage in the new role, the Australia-bound ORP ''Piłsudski'' was struck by two explosions from German torpedoes and sank not far from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Kingston-upon-Hull]]. Captain Mamert Stankiewicz was the last to leave the ship as he wanted to ensure that all of ''Piłsudski'''s crew and were safe and no sailors and soldiers were left behind on the sinking ship. He rescued several sailors and soldiers and protected their safety on the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, while himself immersed in ice-cold Northern Atlantic. The sailors, soldiers, and Captain Stankiewicz were finally rescued by a British ship. He died of exhaustion and hypothermia. He was buried with full [[military honours]] in [[Hartlepool]] near [[Middlesbrough]]. He was [[posthumous award|posthumously]] awarded with the [[Virtuti Militari]] for bravery on the battle field with the highest Polish military decoration (being the only merchant fleet captain so decorated), and the British [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. In 1962 the general cargo vessel [[MS Kapitan M. Stankiewicz|MS ''Kapitan M. Stankiewicz'']] was named after him. 
His elder brother Jan (known as 'the Bull'), was also a captain of Polish Merchant Marine. His younger brother Roman was the officer of Polish Navy, in the rank of commander, who led in "Blyskawica" the three Polish destroyers on their way from Poland to Britain in Aug. '39. Roman Stankiewicz died ecxactly a year after Mamert, on the 26th of Nov '40 in the Polish/French patrol vessel "Medoc".

== Family ==
He was married to Helena (de domo Jankowska). They had four daughters: Zofia (died in Syberia), Anna (primo voto Tomaszewska, who fought in the [Warsaw Uprising] in the Polish Home Army, formation "Gustaw"), Irena (primo voto Malecka, who fought and was wounded in the [Warsaw Uprising] in the Polish Home Army, formation "Tower"), Janina (killed in the [Warsaw Uprising]).

== His nickname ==
Already during his lifetime Stankiewicz became known to his crew as ''Znaczy Kapitan'', which could be roughly translated as '' 'It means' Captain'', a nickname coined after Stankiewicz's habit of starting almost every sentence with the word ''znaczy'' (alternatively it may be translated as ''You mean'', but the expression is the third-person neuter singular form of "to mean"). The nickname also became the title of Karol Olgierd Borchardt's first book on Stankiewicz.

'''Menachem (Max) Stark''' (July 15, 1974 – January 3, 2014) was an American [[real estate developer]] based in the [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City]]. A prominent member of Brooklyn's [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] community, Stark was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] outside his office at 331 Rutledge Street in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]] on January 2, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Daily News]]'', 3 January 2014, [http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-real-estate-businessman-feared-kidnapped-home-article-1.1565406]&lt;/ref&gt; in an intended [[robbery]].&lt;ref name="Worker Charged"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|title=Construction Worker Kendal Felix Charged in Menachem Stark Murder|url=http://forward.com/articles/197392/construction-worker-kendal-felix-charged-in-menach/?|accessdate=2014-04-30|newspaper=Forward|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was found smoldering in a dumpster&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/01/04/burned-body-in-dumpster-might-be-kidnapped-hasid-cops/ Kidnapped developer’s body found in dumpster] New York Post, January 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; outside a Getty station on Cutter Mill Road in [[Great Neck, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[CBS NY]]'', 4 January 2014, [http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/04/police-suspects-kidnapped-man-outside-brooklyn-real-estate-office/]&lt;/ref&gt; on January 3, 2014.

According to [[coroner]] reports, he died of [[suffocation]], and was also badly burned on his torso and hands. When found, he had $4,000 cash in his pocket, and uncashed checks in his name worth another $41,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303933104579305012173994376|Finances Probed in Killing.

Stark exited his office at around 11:45pm on January 2, 2014, into a heavy [[blizzard]]. A surveillance camera positioned near the office captured images of Stark struggling with two attackers for nearly five minutes, before being forced into a silver [[Dodge Caravan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsNmQzT9xho New York Police Department video of Stark kidnapping, accessed on YouTube via WSJ online, January 15, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Broken handcuffs and plastic restraining tape were later found on the sidewalk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/murdered-brooklyn-landlord-good-man-relatives-article-1.1567157 Murdered Brooklyn landlord Menachem Stark's family says a 'devil' did this] New York Daily News, Monday, January 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

During the weeks before his death, Stark reportedly ended his conversations with the phrase "Please pray for me", and asked the person to whom he was speaking to invoke his name and his mother's name, a sign in [[Orthodox Judaism]] of someone facing a life-threatening situation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/03/30/cops-say-an-arrest-looms-in-abduct-slay-of-brooklyn-landlord/ Arrest looms in abduct-slay of Brooklyn landlord] New York Post, March 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause of death, arrest of suspect ==
In May 2014, construction worker Kendal Felix, 29, was indicted on charges of [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees of murder in the United States|second-degree murder]], kidnapping, and attempted robbery in the Stark case.&lt;ref name="nypost.com"&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/05/05/slumlord-murderer-indicted-but-investigation-continues/ Slumlord murderer indicted but investigation continues]&lt;/ref&gt; Felix lived in nearby Crown Heights, and had done about $20,000 worth of construction work for Stark but had not been paid. He said that he and two accomplices had kidnapped Stark, hoping to get the money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/suspect-arrested-murder-menachem-stark-article-1.1774032 Construction worker contracted by Brooklyn landlord Menachem Stark fingered in the Hasidic man's killing ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Felix confessed to the killing and admitted to being the driver of the van, as well as one of the men who wrestled with Stark on the sidewalk.

The ''Post'' said that Felix implicated two other men in the murder, but that they had been arrested and then released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/04/30/cops-question-3-suspects-in-brooklyn-landlord-slay/] Suspect confesses role in Brooklyn slumlord murder&lt;/ref&gt; According to Felix's alleged confession, one of the accomplices said "He owes me money" just before they grabbed Stark.&lt;ref name="nypost.com"/&gt;

According to the Nassau County Medical Examiner, which conducted an autopsy, Stark died of asphyxia by compression of the neck and chest.

Public records showed that Stark and his business partner, Israel Perlmutter, had some business troubles dating back to the real estate market crash, including a $29 million loan default resulting in a 2009 bankruptcy and a lawsuit in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/nyregion/as-mourning-continues-for-abducted-man-rumors-fly-in-hasidic-community.html?ref=vivianyee Rumors Fly Among Hasidim About Abducted Man’s Death], New York Times, January 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and an unrelated $2.9 million loan default that lead to a $4 million judgement in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20BCO%2020120316850 IN RE SOUTH SIDE HOUSE, LLC], accessed via Leagle.com, January 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The media also reported on a long list of building violations in properties owned by Stark and his partners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/nyregion/a-developer-is-mourned-and-vilified-in-brooklyn.html?_r=0 A Developer Is Mourned and Vilified in Brooklyn] New York Times, January 5, 2014,&lt;/ref&gt; Tenants had described revolting conditions in Stark-owned residential buildings for many years, although shortly after Stark's death, glowing reviews of his properties began to appear on social media sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/nyregion/01greenpoint.html?pagewanted=all Cheap Rooms, and a Drug for Every Floor], New York Times, January 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://therealdeal.com/blog/2014/01/06/menachem-starks-tenants-brokers-paint-conflicting-pictures-of-slain-developer/ Menachem Stark’s tenants, brokers paint conflicting pictures of slain developer] The Real Deal: New York Real Estate News, January 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2014/01/menachem_max_stark.php "Satmar Slumlord" or "The Livelihood of the Synagogue?"

Among Stark and Perlmutter's creditors was the [[Broadway Bank (Illinois)|Broadway Bank]] of Chicago, notable for its loans to [[organized crime]] figures, such as convicted bookmaker Michael "Jaws" Giorango. Stark and Perlmutter defaulted on a $1.5 million loan from the bank, part of the $104 million in loan defaults that contributed to the bank's demise.&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2014/01/13/slain-slumlord-helped-sink-bank-with-8m-in-unpaid-loans/ |title=Slain slumlord's unpaid debt helped sink Obama's bank |publisher= New York Post |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank accounts belonging to Southside LLC (Stark and Perlmutter's corporation) appear to have been tampered with to conceal a diversion of funds. According to court filings, $3.6 million was found to be missing from accounts maintained by Southside LLC. Unauthorized withdrawals had been made in the second half of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/menachem-stark-s-business-missing-more-money-than-thought-1.7109854 Menachem Stark accounts missing more money than thought] Newsday, February 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Flaxer, a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to oversee the Southside LLC case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/trustee-missing-money-in-menachem-stark-s-company-accounts-1.6857999 Trustee: Missing money in Menachem Stark's company accounts] Newsday, January 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; said that Stark had "obtained cashier's checks made out to a multitude of individuals, entities and law firms to pay for personal debts or for use in other real estate transactions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/slain-brooklyn-landlord-3-6m-business-pay-debts-article-1.1712438 Slain Brooklyn landlord took nearly $3.6M from business to pay personal debts]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', the checks were marked "customer withdrawal". The ''Daily News'' said that court records show that, in the month before Stark was murdered, five "customer withdrawals" were taken out from the account, totaling $267,101.

According to court records, a rent security account at one of Southside LLC's businesses contained only $3,500, when it should have in excess of $200,000 on deposit. The account contained rents collected from the company's buildings, which the company continued to manage as its bankruptcy was being processed.

Flaxer said he would call Stark's widow and his partner Perlmutter to testify in the case. Perlmutter, via his attorney, said he would use his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right to avoid [[self-incrimination]] if he is questioned about the missing money.

Perlmutter also reportedly told police that the pair owed about $1 million to a [[loan shark]] and/or a [[Russia]]n businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/01/09/slain-slumlords-business-partner-ducks-family-wedding-to-stay-hidden/ Slain slumlord's business partner 'ducks family wedding' to stay hidden]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stark died without a [[Will and testament|will]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/menachem-stark-died-article-1.1742435 Menachem Stark, Williamsburg landlord abducted and slain in January, died without a will] New York Daily News, April 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outrage about ''New York Post'' front page ==
The ''[[New York Post]]'' featured an image of the deceased Stark on the front page of their January 5 edition with the headline "Who Didn't Want Him Dead?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-posts-menachem-stark-cover-2014-1/ |title=New York Post Cover On Murdered Jewish Landlord: 'Who Didn't Want Him Dead?' |publisher= Business Insider |accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front page sparked outrage, specifically among members of the Orthodox Jewish Community, amid suggestions that the ''Post'' was helping to create a climate of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/190353/in-menachem-stark-slay-wheres-the-humanity/ |title=In Menachem Stark, Where is the Humanity? |publisher= Forward |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brooklyn]] Borough President [[Eric Adams (politician)|Eric Adams]], New York Assemblyman [[Dov Hikind]], and other local politicians condemned the coverage at a press conference at [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosizneias.com/151412/2014/01/05/brooklyn-ny-outrage-in-the-jewish-community-over-ny-post-sunday-headline/ |title=Outrage in the Jewish Community over NY Post Sunday Headline |publisher= Vos Iz Neias |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were calls for a [[boycott]] of the tabloid. The ''Post'' refused to apologize, saying that the headline referred only to Stark's "many enemies", and expressed its sympathies to the deceased man's family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2014/01/05/post-report-on-slain-slumlord-draws-harsh-criticism/ Post's report on slain slumlord draws harsh criticism], NY Post, January 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagojewishnews.com/2014/01/14/a-man-of-dishonor/ Chicago Jewish News: "A man of dishonor"] July 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Stark left behind a wife and seven children.

Stark was publicly mourned by the Hasidic community. ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' noted that, "For his Satmar friends and colleagues, Stark, 38, embodied the best of their world: a generous person with an open wallet for anyone in search of aid."&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/190580/who-was-menachem-stark-and-why-was-he-murdered/ Who Was Menachem Stark — and Why Was He Murdered?] The Jewish Daily Forward, January 9, 2014
http://forward.com/articles/190580/who-was-menachem-stark-and-why-was-he-murdered/&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Forward'' added that "Stark appears to have personified a contradiction familiar both inside and outside ultra-Orthodox circles: a pious philanthropist whose business dealings didn't always live up to avowed communal standards."

After his death, the Chassidic fertility charity [[Bonei Olam]] dedicated a new Clinical Genetics Fund in his name "to help couples with genetic issues realize their dreams of parenthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vosizneias.com/152260/2014/01/14/brooklyn-ny-bonei-olam-genetic-research-fund-to-be-established-in-memory-of-menachem-stark/|title=Brooklyn, NY - Bonei Olam Genetic Research Fund To Be Established In Memory Of Menachem Stark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Neko atsume screenshot.jpeg|thumb|upright|Cats will interact with objects when they visit a player's yard.]]
Gameplay revolves around the player purchasing food, [[Cat play and toys|toys]], and furniture to attract a variety of cats to the player's home. The player can watch cats interact with objects, take photos of them which can be saved in an album, and receive gifts of fish and mementos from them.

Cats will leave the player either silver or gold "[[niboshi]]" ({{lang|ja|にぼし}}, small dried [[sardines]]), called "fish" in the English version, after leaving the yard. Players can also enter a daily password to receive a random amount of silver or gold fish. This feature can be located in the "news" button from the main menu. Once there, the player simply taps the cat that is holding the sign and this will direct the player to a new page with the following options; "Input Password", "Submit Feedback" and the game's  "Official FAQ". The player can tap on "Input Password" and a daily log will be created, and fish will be rewarded. After five daily passwords are entered, the player will receive a free can of "Ritzy Bitz" (a high quality food).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://recombu.com/mobile/article/neko-atsume-tips-tricks|title=Neko Atsume tips &amp; tricks: How to get free gold and silver fish, cheats,…|website=Recombu|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish can be used to purchase new types of food and goods, remodels, as well as extensions to the yard. Cats may leave collectible "mementos" for the player.

After purchasing the initial expansion to the garden, the player can then purchase a remodel for their yard. Players have the option to remodel their yard to one of seven different styles: Original,  Zen, Rustic, Modern, Western, Sugary, or Cafe.

There is no end game and cats will continue to come as long as the player puts out food for them.

The game is [[Free-to-play|free to play]], though additional fish are available for purchase.

=== Cats ===
There are currently 63 cats for the player to collect. Among these, 22 are considered "rare cats" and only appear when certain items and foods are placed in the yard. Each cat has a unique name, personality and appearance. The player may rename the cats after they have encountered them. Rare cats have a unique interaction with their  items. Many of the rare cats in the English version of the game are named after famous people, both fictional and non-fictional, with the names of the cats being [[pun]]s, like Lady Meow Meow ([[Lady Gaga]]) Mr. Meowgi ([[Kesuke Miyagi|Mr. Miyagi]]), Chairman Meow ([[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]]), Guy Furry ([[Guy Fieri]]), Saint Purrtrick ([[Saint Patrick]]), Xerxes IX ([[Xerxes I]]), Hermeowne ([[Hermione Granger]]), Billy the Kitten ([[Billy the Kid]]), Señor Don Gato (gato=cat in Spanish) ([[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]), and Joe DiMeowgio ([[Joe DiMaggio]], complete with megaphone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author=  |user= nekoatsume_tw|number= 590774991995609088 |date=22 Apr 2015  |title= 持っているのはバットではなくメガホンです。 |access-date=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and baseball). While Peaches is not considered a rare cat, it has been noted that this cat is harder to find than the others. Peaches is a cream-coloured cat with an orange heart on her body. She has an orange circle over her left eye, on her side, and on the tip of her tail.

==Development==
Yutaka Takazaki, the developer of the game, said that his goal was to create a game that even children could enjoy without a significant investment of skill or time.&lt;ref name="cnn131"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.co.jp/tech/35067131.html|title=世界で注目の「ねこあつめ」、はまるユーザー続出|publisher=CNN.co.jp|date=9 July 2015|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he loves cats himself, he has said that "to be honest, I do not know why this game is so popular."&lt;ref name="cnn131"/&gt; The game "was made between the development of other applications".&lt;ref name="oricon"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2015|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/special/47733/|title=Twitterで人気急伸『ねこあつめ』とは？|publisher=株式会社[[:ja:オリコン|オリコン]]|accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was a software of the "just look and enjoy" style for players who like cats, and could be completed in 2–3 weeks for free.&lt;ref name="jcast0711"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.j-cast.com/2015/07/08239741.html?p=all|title=米CNNも絶賛のスマホゲーム「ねこあつめ」日本語版だけなのに海外でも大人気の謎|publisher=J-CASTニュース|date=2015-07-08|accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takazaki says, "We're not going to put cheats or complexity in it, and we would like to pursue a game that can be enjoyed with only simple operations."&lt;ref name="jcast0711"/&gt;

==Release==
On 30 October 2015, an English version of the game, called ''Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector'', was released on the Android and iOS App stores. As of version 1.4.5, players can switch between Japanese and English versions of the game any time they want from the game menu.&lt;ref name="pc.watch.nekoatsume"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/yajiuma/20151030_728304.html |title=ねこあつめ、遂に世界進出。アップデートで英語対応|trans-title=Finally, a global expansion for Neko Atsume.

In version 1.5.5, there is a chance that the player's yard will be covered in snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ねこあつめ公式 on Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/nekoatsume_tw/status/692527510098186241|website = Twitter|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snow event typically lasts for 24 hours and changes the appearance of the yard as well as the background music.

[[File:Altardediademuertos.jpg|thumb|[[pan de muerto]] altar commemorating a deceased man in Milpa Alta, México DF]]
An '''''ofrenda''''' (Spanish: "[[Sacrifice|offering]]") is a collection of objects placed on a ritual display during the annual and traditionally Mexican ''[[Día de Muertos]]'' celebration.  An ''ofrenda'', which may be quite large and elaborate, is usually created for an individual person who has died and is intended to welcome them to the altar setting

__TOC__
{{anchor|ORDER}}

==Background==

This display coincides with the [[Día de Muertos]], which is a tradition originating with the [[Aztecs]].&lt;ref name="Aztecs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scalora|first1=Salvatore|title=Celebrating the spirits' return|journal=Americas (English Edition)|date= 1995|pages=32(10)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aztec culture considered souls to continuously live and enter different realms when a body would die.  This view the Aztecs held was commingled with the Christian beliefs that the soul is eternal (whether it be in [[heaven]], [[purgatory]], or [[hell]]) during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] when the two cultures were merged.  The ofrenda is presented in one's home in order to commemorate the souls of loved ones in the family.

==Components of the Offering==

A common format for an ''ofrenda'' contains three levels or tiers.  The topmost tier identifies the dead person who is being invited to the altar, frequently with photos of the deceased, along with [[Veneration|images of various saints]], statuettes of the Virgin Mary, crucifixes, etc. which are positioned in a ''retablo'' which forms the back of the altar;&lt;ref name="CarrascoSessions2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Davíd Carrasco|author2=Scott Sessions|title=Daily Life of the Aztecs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIw5q1RTa2wC&amp;pg=PA251|date=31 July 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37744-0|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the second tier are things placed to encourage the dead to feel at home and welcome: the deceased person's favorite food items might go here, including such things as ''[[Mole sauce|mole]]'', candy, ''[[Pan dulce (sweet bread)|pan dulce]]'', and especially a sweet bread called ''[[pan de muerto]]''. For deceased adults, the ''ofrenda'' might include a bottle or poured shot glasses of [[tequila]] or [[mezcal]], while if the deceased is a child a favorite toy might be placed here.  The bottom-most tier almost always contains lit candles, and might also have a washbasin, mirror, soap, and a towel so that the spirit of the deceased can see and refresh themselves upon arrival at the altar. Throughout the altar are placed ''[[calavera]]s'' (decorated candied skulls made from compressed sugar) and bright orange and yellow marigolds (''cempazuchitl''), an Aztec flower of the dead. ''Ofrendas'' are constructed in the home as well as in village cemeteries and churches.&lt;ref name="Untiedt2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth L. Untiedt|title=Death Lore: Texas Rituals, Superstitions, and Legends of the Hereafter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gk9-M3wf6EMC&amp;pg=PA149|year=2008|publisher=University of North Texas |isbn=978-1-57441-256-7|page=149|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herrera-Sobek2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Herrera-Sobek|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY-tY62V1FIC&amp;pg=PA406|date=31 July 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34340-7|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ofrenda typically features types of decorations that are representative of the [[four elements]].&lt;ref name="Commemorating"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mack|first1=Stevie|last2=Williams|first2=Kathleen|title=Commemorating the Ancestors|journal=SchoolArts: The Art Education Magazine for Teachers|date=2010|volume=110 |issue=2|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, candles are lit on the table to symbolize the element of fire.   Incense from the resin of copal trees are also used in the offering in order to produce smells that will scare away evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Aztecs" /&gt;

==Literature==

A non-fiction children's book called ''Day of the Dead: A Mexican-American Celebration'' was written by Diane Hoyt-Goldsmith.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED370748|title=Day of the dead : a Mexican-American celebration|last=Hoyt-Goldsmith|first=Diane|publisher=|others=Migdale, Lawrence, Holiday House (Firm)|year=|isbn=0823410943|edition= First|location=New York|pages=|oclc=29522859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is about a Mexican-American family celebrating the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos) in California and is focused on two young twins in the family.  The twins help the family create an ofrenda for their loved ones, as well as a larger ofrenda for their community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''okapi''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|k|ɑː|p|iː}}; ''Okapia johnstoni''), also known as the '''forest giraffe''', '''congolese giraffe''' or '''zebra giraffe''', is an [[artiodactyl]] [[mammal]] native to the northeast of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in Central Africa. Although the okapi bears striped markings reminiscent of [[zebra]]s, it is most closely related to the [[giraffe]]. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family [[Giraffidae]]. The okapi stands about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and has an average body length around {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its weight ranges from {{Convert|200|to|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. Its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs and white ankles. Male okapis have short, hair-covered, horn-like protuberances  on their heads called [[ossicone]]s, less than {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. Females possess [[hair whorl]]s, and ossicones are absent.

Okapis are primarily [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]], but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are [[herbivore]]s, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and [[fungus|fungi]]. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The [[gestational period]] is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.

Okapis inhabit [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] forests at altitudes of {{convert|500|-|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. They are endemic to the tropical forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they occur across the central, northern, and eastern regions. The [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]  classifies the okapi as [[endangered]]. Major threats include habitat loss due to [[logging]] and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and [[illegal mining]] have also led to a decline in populations. The [[Okapi Conservation Project]] was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
[[File:Pieces from Okapi leather, obtained by Sir Harry Johnston (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Strips of skin, the first evidence of the okapi's existence]] 
Although the okapi was unknown to the Western world until the 20th century, it may have been depicted since the early fifth century BCE on the [[façade]] of the [[Apadana]] at [[Persepolis]], a gift from the Ethiopian procession to the [[Achaemenid]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/collections/pa/persepolis/apadana.html The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, Photographic Archives]; [http://oi.uchicago.edu/gallery/pa_iran_paai_per_apa/index.php/2C9_72dpi.png?action=big&amp;size=resize&amp;fromthumbnail=true photo detail]. The Oriental Institute identifies the subject as an Okapi with a question mark.&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, Europeans in Africa had heard of an animal that they came to call the African [[unicorn]]. In his travelogue of exploring the Congo, [[Henry Morton Stanley]] mentioned a kind of [[donkey]] that the natives called the ''atti''&lt;!--The Ancient Greek word ati means horse--&gt;, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi was some sort of rainforest zebra.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

When the British governor of Uganda, [[Harry Johnston|Sir Harry Johnston]], discovered some pygmy inhabitants of the Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected to be on the trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.earthtouchnews.com/conservation/endangered/new-hope-for-the-elusive-okapi-congos-mini-giraffe/|title=New hope for the elusive okapi, Congo’s mini giraffe|work=Earth Touch News Network|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Okapi 1901.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Illustration of an okapi by Sir Harry Johnston, based on preserved skins, 1901]]
Though Johnston did not see an okapi himself, he did manage to obtain pieces of striped skin and eventually a skull. From this skull, the okapi was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as ''Okapia johnstoni''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

''Okapia johnstoni'' was first described as ''Equus johnstoni'' by English zoologist [[Philip Sclater|Philip Lutley Sclater]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sclater|first=Philip Lutley|year=1901|title=On an Apparently New Species of Zebra from the Semliki Forest.|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/31590976|journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|volume=v.1|pages=50–52|via=Biodiversity Heritage Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Genus|generic name]] ''Okapia'' derives from the [[Lese language|Lese]] [[Karo language|Karo]] name ''o'api'', while the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] (''johnstoni'') is in recognition of the British Governor of [[Uganda]], [[Sir Harry Johnston]], who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the [[Ituri Forest]] while repatriating a group of [[Pygmies]] to the Belgian Congo.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Nowak, Ronald M (1999) ''Walker's Mammals of the World.'' 6th ed. p. 1085.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Okapi: Mysterious Animal of Congo-Zaire |last=Lindsey |first=Susan Lyndaker |last2=Green |first2=Mary Neel |last3=Bennett |first3=Cynthia L. |publisher=University of Texas Press |date=1999 |isbn=0292747071 |pages=4–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s journeys in 1887. Remains of a carcass were later sent to London by the English adventurer and colonial administrator Harry Johnston and became a media event in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=57 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hpR_hPSqYa0C&amp;pg=PA544|page=544 |journal = The American review of reviews|title=The African okapi, a beast unknown to the zoos | author = Shaw, Albert | year = 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Sclater presented a painting of the okapi before the [[Zoological Society of London]] that depicted its physical features with some clarity. Much confusion arose regarding the taxonomical status of this newly discovered animal. Sir Harry Johnston himself called it a ''[[Helladotherium]]'', or a relative of other extinct giraffids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proceedings of the general meetings for scientific business of the Zoological Society of London|journal=[[Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London]]|date=1901|volume=2 (May to December)|issue=1|pages=1–5|url=https://archive.org/stream/proceedingsofzoo19012zool#page/n47/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the description of the okapi by [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]], who referred to it as a "horse", Sclater named the species ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]] johnstoni''.&lt;ref name=kingdon1979&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kingdon|first1=Jonathan|title=East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa, Volume 3, Part B|date=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226437224|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Lankester declared that the okapi represented an unknown genus of the [[Giraffidae]], which he placed in its own genus, ''Okapia'', and assigned the name ''Okapia johnstoni'' to the species.&lt;ref name=prothero&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prothero|first1=Donald R.|last2=Schoch|first2=Robert M.|title=Horns, tusks, and flippers : the evolution of hoofed mammals|date=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=9780801871351|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Swiss zoologist [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] suggested the inclusion of ''O. johnstoni'' in the extinct giraffid subfamily [[Palaeotragus|Palaeotraginae]]. However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish [[palaeontologist]] [[Birger Bohlin]] in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohlin|first1=B.|title=Die Familie Giraffidae: mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der fossilen Formen aus China|journal=Palaeontologica Sinica, series C|date=1926|volume=4|pages=1–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to the lack of a [[Cingulum (tooth)|cingulum]], a major feature of the palaeotragids.&lt;ref name=colbert&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colbert|first1=E. H.|title=The relationships of the okapi|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=February 1938|volume=19|issue=1|pages=47|doi=10.2307/1374281|jstor=1374281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, ''Okapia'' was finally established as a sister genus of ''[[Giraffa]]'' on the basis of [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis. The two genera together with ''[[Palaeotragus]]'' constitute the tribe Giraffini.&lt;ref name=geraads&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geraads|first1=Denis|title=Remarques sur la systématique et la phylogénie des Giraffidae (Artiodactyla, Mammalia)|journal=Geobios|date=January 1986|volume=19|issue=4|pages=465–477|doi=10.1016/S0016-6995(86)80004-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
[[File:Okapi Giraffe Neck.png|thumb|upright|Despite the vast difference in neck length, the okapi (left) and the giraffe (right) both have seven [[cervical vertebrae]].]]
The earliest members of the Giraffidae first appeared in the early [[Miocene]] in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like [[Climacoceratidae|climacoceratids]]. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first [[Radiation (biology)|radiation]]. Another radiation began in the [[Pliocene]], but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=finlayson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlayson|first1=Clive|title=Neanderthals and Modern Humans : An Ecological and Evolutionary Perspective|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521121000|page=25|edition=Digitally printed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23-10 million years ago), including ''[[Canthumeryx]]'', ''[[Giraffokeryx]]'', ''[[Palaeotragus]]'', and ''[[Samotherium]]''. According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, ''Samotherium'' split into ''Okapia'' (18 million years ago) and ''Giraffa'' (12 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hunt, Kathleen|title=Transitional Vertebrate Fossils FAQ Part 2C|publisher=TalkOrigins|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional/part2c.html#arti|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. D. Skinner argued that ''Canthumeryx'' gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of ''Palaeotragus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=G.|last2=Skinner|first2=J.D.|title=On the origin, evolution and phylogeny of giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa|volume=58|issue=1|year=2003|doi=10.1080/00359190309519935|pages=51–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The okapi is sometimes referred to as an example of a [[living fossil]], as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. ''Samotherium'').&lt;ref name=prothero/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19570624&amp;id=wAMkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kCUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6731,2170969| title=Why Is the Okapi Called a Living Fossil | journal=The Milwaukee Journal|date=24 June 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found that the common ancestor of giraffe and okapi lived about 11.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agaba|first1=M.|last2=Ishengoma|first2=E.|last3=Miller|first3=W.C.|last4=McGrath|first4=B.C.|last5=Hudson|first5=C.N.|last6=Bedoya Reina|first6=O.C.|last7=Ratan|first7=A.|last8=Burhans|first8=R.|last9=Chikhi|first9=R.|last10=Medvedev|first10=P.|last11=Praul|first11=C.A.|last12=Wu-Cavener|first12=L.|last13=Wood|first13=B.|last14=Robertson|first14=H.|last15=Penfold|first15=L.|last16=Cavener|first16=D.R.|title=Giraffe genome sequence reveals clues to its unique morphology and physiology|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=May 2016|volume=7|pages=11519|doi=10.1038/ncomms11519|pmid=27187213|pmc=4873664}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Okapi (Okapia johnstoni) 2009-04-04 04.jpg|upright|left|thumbnail|Male okapi displaying its striking white stripes and short, hair-covered ossicones]]
The okapi is a medium-sized giraffid, standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder. Its average body length is about {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and its weight ranges from {{Convert|200|to|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Burnie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Burnie|author2=Don E. Wilson|last-author-amp=yes|title=Animal|date=2001|publisher=DK|location=New York|isbn=0789477645|edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a long neck, and large and flexible ears. The coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs and white ankles. The striking stripes make it resemble a zebra.&lt;ref name=adw/&gt; These features serve as an effective camouflage amidst dense vegetation. The face, throat, and chest are greyish white. [[Interdigital gland]]s are present on all four feet, and are slightly larger on the front feet.&lt;ref name=bodmer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodmer|first1=R.E.|last2=Rabb|first2=G.B.|title=''Okapia johnstoni''|journal=Mammalian Species|date=10 December 1992|issue=422|pages=1–8|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-422-01-0001.pdf|doi=10.2307/3504153|jstor=3504153|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924122153/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-422-01-0001.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male okapis have short, hair-covered horns called [[ossicone]]s, less than {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The okapi exhibits [[sexual dimorphism]], with females {{convert|4.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} taller on average, slightly redder, and lacking prominent ossicones, instead possessing hair whorls.&lt;ref name=grzimek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grzimek|first1=B.|title=Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals (Volume 5)|date=1990|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solounias|first1=N.|title=Prevalence of ossicones in Giraffidae (Artiodactyla, Mammalia)|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=November 1988|volume=69|issue=4|pages=845–8|doi=10.2307/1381645 |jstor=1381645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The okapi shows several adaptations to its tropical habitat. The large number of [[rod cell]]s in the [[retina]] facilitate night vision, and an efficient olfactory system is present. The large [[auditory bullae]] allow a strong sense of hearing. The dental formula of the okapi is {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.3.3|lower=3.1.3.3}}.&lt;ref name=bodmer/&gt; Teeth are low-[[Crown (dentistry)|crowned]] and finely [[Cusp (anatomy)|cusped]], and efficiently cut tender foliage. The large caecum and colon help in microbial digestion, and a quick rate of food passage allows for lower cell wall digestion than in other ruminants.&lt;ref name=kingdon/&gt;
[[File:Ybokp 7b (16224361745).jpg|thumb|upright|Head of a male okapi]] 
The okapi can be easily distinguished from its nearest extant relative, the [[giraffe]]. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a [[Horse gait#Pace|pacing]] gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg on the same side of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body&lt;ref name=dagg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dagg|first1=A.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Okapis are primarily [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]], but may be active for a few hours in darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lusenge|first1=T.|last2=Nixon|first2=S.|title=Conservation status of okapi in Virunga National Park|journal=DRC, Zoological Society of London|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. They have overlapping home ranges and typically occur at densities around 0.6 animals per square kilometre.&lt;ref name=adw&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palkovacs|first1=E.|title=Okapi ''Okapia johnstoni''|url=http://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Okapia_johnstoni.html|website=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male home ranges average {{convert|13|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while female home ranges average {{convert|3|-|5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Males migrate continuously, while females are sedentary.&lt;ref name=hart/&gt; Males often mark territories and bushes with their urine, while females use common defecation sites. Grooming is a common practice, focused at the earlobes and the neck. Okapis often rub their necks against trees, leaving a brown [[exudate]].&lt;ref name=bodmer/&gt;

The male is protective of his territory, but allows females to pass through the domain to forage. Males visit female home ranges at breeding time.&lt;ref name=kingdon/&gt; Although generally tranquil, the okapi can kick and butt with its head to show aggression. As the [[vocal cord]]s are poorly developed, vocal communication is mainly restricted to three sounds — "chuff" (contact calls used by both sexes), "moan" (by females during courtship) and "bleat" (by infants under stress). Individuals may engage in [[Flehmen response]], a visual expression in which the animal curls back its upper lips, displays the teeth, and inhales through the mouth for a few seconds. The leopard is the main predator of the okapi.&lt;ref name=bodmer/&gt;

===Diet===
[[File:Okapi tongue.jpg|thumbnail|left|The long tongue of the okapi]]
Okapis are [[herbivore]]s, feeding on tree leaves and buds, [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[fern]]s, fruits, and [[fungus|fungi]]. They are unique in the Ituri Forest as they are the only known mammal that feeds solely on understory vegetation, where they use their 18 inch tongues to selectively browse for suitable plants. The tongue is also used to groom their ears and eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.giraffidsg.org/files/2016/02/Okapi-conservation-strategy-2015-2025-final-EN1.pdf|title=Okapi Conservation Strategy and Status Review|last=|first=|date=2018-02-21|website=www.giraffidsg.org|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They prefer to feed in [[treefall gap]]s. The okapi has been known to feed on over 100 species of plants, some of which are known to be poisonous to humans and other animals. Fecal analysis shows that none of those 100 species dominates the diet of the okapi. Staple foods comprise [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s. The main constituents of the diet are woody, [[dicot]]yledonous species; [[monocot]]yledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families [[Acanthaceae]], [[Ebenaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Flacourtiaceae]], [[Loganiaceae]], [[Rubiaceae]], and [[Violaceae]].&lt;ref name=bodmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=hart/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Okapi and son.jpg|thumbnail|A female okapi stands next to its calf at [[Antwerp Zoo]].]]
Female okapis become sexually mature at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach maturity after two years. [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|Rut]] in males and [[estrous]] in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days.&lt;ref name=kingdon/&gt;&lt;ref name=reproduction&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarzenberger|first1=F|last2=Rietschel|first2=W|last3=Matern|first3=B|last4=Schaftenaar|first4=W|last5=Bircher|first5=P|last6=Van Puijenbroeck|first6=B|last7=Leus|first7=K|title=Noninvasive reproductive monitoring in the okapi (''Okapia johnstoni'')|journal=Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians|date=December 1999|volume=30|issue=4|pages=497–503|pmid=10749434}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head, and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.&lt;ref name=grzimek/&gt;

The [[gestational period]] is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born, weighing {{convert|14|-|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The [[udder]] of the pregnant female starts swelling two months before [[parturition]], and [[vulva]]l discharges may occur. Parturition takes 3–4 hours, and the female stands throughout this period, though she may rest during brief intervals. The mother consumes the afterbirth and extensively grooms the infant. Her milk is very rich in proteins and low in fat.&lt;ref name=kingdon/&gt;

As in other ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although generally similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal [[Mane (horse)|mane]], and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and give way to the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Calves are known not to defecate for the first month or two of life, which is hypothesized to help avoid predator detection in their most vulnerable phase of life.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in the first few months of birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's typical lifespan is 20 to 30 years.&lt;ref name=bodmer/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The okapi is [[endemic]] to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it occurs north and east of the [[Congo River]]. It ranges from the [[Maiko National Park]] northward to the [[Ituri rainforest]], then through the river basins of the Rubi, [[Lake Tele]], and [[Ebola River|Ebola]] to the west and the [[Ubangi River]] further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of the Congo River. It is also common in the [[Wamba, Luo Reserve|Wamba]] and Epulu areas. It is extinct in [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The okapi inhabits [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] forests at altitudes of {{convert|500|-|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It occasionally uses seasonally inundated areas, but does not occur in [[gallery forest]]s, [[swamp forest]]s, and habitats disturbed by [[human settlement]]s. In the wet season, it visits rocky [[inselbergs]] that offer forage uncommon elsewhere. Results of research conducted in the late 1980s in a mixed ''[[Cynometra]]'' forest indicated that the okapi population density averaged 0.53 animals per square kilometre.&lt;ref name=hart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hart |first1=J.

In 2008, it was recorded in [[Virunga National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Nixon, S. C.

==Threats and conservation==
[[File:Okapi2.jpg|thumb|left|Okapi at [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]]] 
The IUCN classifies the okapi as endangered.&lt;ref name=OCP&gt;{{cite news |last=Hebert |first=Amanda |date=26 November 2013 |title=Okapi Added to IUCN’S Endangered Species List |url=http://www.epulu-story.org/assets/endangered-press-release-11.25.docx |location=[[Jacksonville, Florida]] |publisher=[[Okapi Conservation Project]] |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is fully protected under Congolese law. The [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve]] and [[Maiko National Park]] support significant populations of the okapi, though a steady decline in numbers has occurred due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the [[Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve]] and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to [[logging]] and human settlement. Extensive hunting for [[bushmeat]] and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the [[Virunga National Park]], but is bereft of protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve]], killing six guards and other staff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flocken|first1=J.|title=Tragic Losses in the Heart of Darkness|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-flocken/okapi-wildlife-reserve-attack_b_1634403.html|accessdate=18 April 2015|agency=Huffington Post|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=P.|title=Infamous elephant poacher turns cannibal in the Congo|url=https://news.mongabay.com/2013/04/infamous-elephant-poacher-turns-cannibal-in-the-congo/|accessdate=16 July 2017|agency=Mongabay|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Okapi Conservation Project]], established in 1987, works towards the conservation of the okapi, as well as the growth of the indigenous [[Mbuti people]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; In November 2011, the [[White Oak Conservation]] center and [[Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens]] hosted an international meeting of the Okapi [[Species Survival Plan]]  and the Okapi [[European Endangered Species Programme]]  at [[Jacksonville]], which was attended by representatives from zoos from the USA, Europe, and Japan. The aim was to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe currently have okapis in captivity.&lt;ref name=meet&gt;{{cite web|title=Okapi SSP and EEP International Meeting|url=http://www.okapiconservation.org/ssp-eep/|website=Okapi Conservation Project|publisher=Wildlife Conservation Global|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Okapis in Zoos===
[[File:Jonge dieren in onze dierentuinen, Blijdorp Weeknummer 60-17 - Open Beelden - 47662.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:09|1960 Dutch newsreel about okapis in [[Diergaarde Blijdorp]]]]
Around 100 okapis are in accredited [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) zoos. The okapi population is managed in America by the AZA's Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that works to ensure genetic diversity in the captive population of endangered animals, while the [[European Endangered Species Programme|EEP]] (European studbook) and ISB (Global studbook) are managed by [[Antwerp Zoo]]&lt;ref&gt;http://old.zooantwerpen.be/nl/kweekprogrammas&lt;/ref&gt;, which was the first zoo to have an Okapi on display (in 1919), as well as one of the most successful in breeding them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flanderstoday.eu/living/okapis-and-men-antwerp-zoo-helps-preserve-endangered-species&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bronx Zoo]] was the first zoo in North America to exhibit Okapi, in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;https://newsroom.wcs.org/News-Releases/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4802/Bronx-Zoo-Debuts-Its-Baby-Okapi.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; They have had one of the most successful breeding programs, with 13 calves having been born since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/11/08/baby-okapi-makes-public-debut-at-bronx-zoo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Diego Zoo]] has exhibited okapis since 1956, and had their first birth of an okapi in 1962. Since then, over 60 births have occurred between the zoo and the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park]], with the most recent being Mosi, a male calf born in early August 2017 at the San Diego Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/okapi|title=Okapi - San Diego Zoo Animals &amp; Plants|website=animals.sandiegozoo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brookfield Zoo]] in [[Chicago]] has also greatly contributed to the captive population of okapis in accredited zoos. The zoo has had 28 okapi births since 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/05/26/brookfield-zoo-okapi-birth/|title=Brookfield Zoo Celebrates Its 28th Okapi Birth Since 1959|date=26 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other North American Zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include the [[Denver Zoo]], [[Cheyenne Mountain Zoo]] (Colorado), [[Houston Zoo]], [[Dallas Zoo]], [[San Antonio Zoo]] (Texas), [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], [[Zoo Miami|Miami Zoo]], [[Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo]], [[Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens|Jacksonville Zoo]] (Florida),  [[Los Angeles Zoo]] (California), [[Saint Louis Zoo]] (Missouri), [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]], [[Columbus Zoo and Aquarium|Columbus Zoo]] (Ohio), [[Memphis Zoo]] (Tennessee), [[The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore|Maryland Zoo]] (Maryland), [[Sedgwick County Zoo|The Sedgwick County Zoo]] (Kansas), and [[Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium|Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo]] (Nebraska).

In Europe, zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include [[Chester Zoo]], [[London Zoo]], [[Bristol Zoo]], [[Marwell Zoo]], [[Wild Place Project|The Wild Place]] (United Kingdom); [[Dublin Zoo]] (Ireland); [[Berlin Zoo]], [[Frankfurt Zoological Garden|Frankfurt Zoo]], [[Wilhelma|Wilhelma Zoo]], [[Wuppertal Zoo]], [[Cologne Zoological Garden|Cologne Zoo]], [[Leipzig Zoological Garden|Leipzig Zoo]] (Germany) and [[Antwerp Zoo]] (Belgium); [[Zürich Zoologischer Garten|Zurich Zoo]], [[Basel Zoo|Zoo Basel]] (Switzerland); [[Copenhagen Zoo]] (Denmark); [[Diergaarde Blijdorp|Rotterdam Zoo]], [[Safaripark Beekse Bergen]] (Netherlands) and [[Dvůr Králové Zoo]] (Czech Republic), [[Wrocław Zoo]] (Poland); [[Zoo de Doué|Bioparc Zoo de Doué]], [[ZooParc de Beauval]] (France); [[Lisbon Zoo]] (Portugal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoo Network-Europe|url=https://www.okapiconservation.org/zoo-network-europe-2/|publisher=okapiconservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Okapis in the Europe|url=https://www.zoochat.com/community/threads/okapis-in-europe.465976/|publisher=zoochat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, only two zoos in Japan exhibit okapis; [[Ueno Zoo]] in Tokyo and [[Zoorasia]] in Yokohama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Okapis in the Zoo|url=http://okapis.net/OkpaisinZoos.html|publisher=Okapis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17188">'''Plant embryogenesis''' is a process that occurs after the [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] of an [[ovule]] to produce a fully developed plant [[embryo]]. This is a pertinent stage in the plant life cycle that is followed by [[dormancy]] and [[germination]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Robert|last2=Paiva|first2=Genaro|last3=Yadegari|first3=Ramin|date=|title=Plant Embryogenesis: Zygote to Seed|url=|journal=Science|publication-date=October 28, 1994|volume=266|pages=605-614|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[zygote]] produced after fertilization, must undergo various cellular divisions and differentiations to become a mature embryo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An end stage embryo has five major components including the shoot apical [[meristem]], [[hypocotyl]], root meristem, root cap, and [[Cotyledon|cotyledons]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unlike animal embryogenesis, plant embryogenesis results in an immature form of the plant, lacking most structures like leaves, stems, and reproductive structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jurgens|first=Gerd|date=May 19, 1995|title=Axis formation in plant embryogenesis: cues and clues|url=|journal=Cell|volume=81|pages=467-470|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphogenic events ==
[[Embryogenesis]] occurs naturally as a result of single, or double fertilzation, of the ovule, giving rise to two distinct structures: the plant embryo and the [[endosperm]] which go on to develop into a seed.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radoeva|first=Tatyana|last2=Weijers|first2=Dolf|date=November 2014|title=A roadmap to embryo identity in plants|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2014.06.009|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=19|pages=709-716|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zygote goes through various cellular differentiations and divisions in order to produce a mature embryo. These morphogenic events form the basic cellular pattern for the development of the shoot-root body and the primary tissue layers; it also programs the regions of meristematic tissue formation. The following morphogenic events are only particular to eudicots, and not monocots.

=== Two cell stage ===
Following fertilization, the zygote and endosperm are present within the ovule, as seen in stage I of the illustration on this page. Then the zygote undergoes an asymmetric transverse [[cell division]] that gives rise to two cells - a small apical cell resting above a large basal cell.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Marilyn A. L.|last2=Harada|first2=John J.|date=October 1993|title=Embryogenesis in Higher Plants: An Overview|url=|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=5|pages=1361-1369|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plant_dev"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peris |first1=Cristina I.

;apical cell:The small apical cell is on the top and contains most of the [[cytoplasm]], the aqueous substance found within cells, from the original zygote.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Souter|first=Martin|last2=Lindsey|first2=Keith|date=June 2000|title=Polarity and signaling in plant embryogenesis|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=51|pages=971-983|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It gives rise to the '''hypocotyl''', '''shoot apical meristem''', and '''cotyledons'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
;basal cell:The large basal cell is on the bottom and consists of a large [[vacuole]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and gives rise to the '''hypophysis'''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and the [[Suspensor#Plants|'''suspensor''']]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== Eight cell stage ===
After two rounds of longitudinal division, and one round of transverse division, an eight-celled embryo is the result.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Raven Biology of Plants|last=Evert|first=Ray F.|last2=Eichhorn|first2=Susan E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=526-530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage II, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like during the eight cell stage. According to Laux et al., there are four distinct domains during the eight cell stage.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laux|first=T.|last2=Wurschum|first2=T.|last3=Breuninger|first3=Holger|date=|title=Genetic Regulation of Embryonic Pattern Formation|url=|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=6|pages=190-202|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two domains contribute to the embryo proper. The ''apical embryo domain'', gives rise to the shoot apical meristem and cotyledons.  The second domain, the ''central embryo domain'' , gives rise to the hypocotyl, root apical meristem, and parts of the cotyledons. The third domain, the ''basal embryo domain,'' contains the hypophysis. The hypophysis will later give rise to the radicle and the root cap. The last domain, the ''suspensor'', is the region at the very bottom, which connects the embryo to the endosperm for nutritional purposes.

=== Sixteen cell stage ===
Additional cell divisions occur, which leads to the sixteen cell stage. The four domains are still present, but they are more defined with the presence of more cells. The important aspect of this stage is the introduction of the protoderm, which is meristematic tissue that will give rise to the epidermis.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt; The protoderm is the outermost layer of cells in the embryo proper.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;

=== Globular stage ===
The name of this stage is indicative of the embryo's appearance at this point in embryogenesis; it is spherical or globular. Stage III, in the photograph above, depicts what the embryo looks like during the globular stage. 1 is indicating the location of the endosperm. The important component of the globular phase is the introduction of the rest of the primary meristematic tissue. The protoderm was already introduced during the sixteen cell stage. According to Evert and Eichhorn, the ground meristem and procambium are initiated during the globular stage.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt; The ground meristem will go on to form the [[ground tissue]], which includes the pith and cortex. The procambium will eventually form the [[vascular tissue]], which includes the xylem and phloem.

=== Heart stage ===
According to Evert and Eichhorn, the heart stage is a transition period where the cotyledons finally start to form and elongate.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt; It is given this name in eudicots because most plants from this group have two cotyledons, giving the embryo a heart shaped appearance. Between the cotyledons is where the shoot apical meristem lies. Stage IV, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like at this point in development. 5 indicates the position of the cotyledons.

=== Torpedo stage ===
This stage is defined by the continued growth of the cotyledons and axis elongation.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt; In addition, programmed cell death must occur during this stage. This is carried out throughout the entire growth process, like any other development.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bozhkov|first=P. V.|last2=Filonova|first2=L. H.|last3=Suarez|first3=M. F.|date=January 2005|title=Programmed cell death in plant embryogenesis|url=|journal=Current Topics in Developmental Biology|volume=67|pages=135-179|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the torpedo stage of development, parts of the suspensor complex must be terminated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The suspensor complex is shortened because at this point in development most of the nutrition from the endosperm has been utilized, and there must be space for the mature embryo.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Souter|first=Martin|last2=Lindsey|first2=Keith|date=June 2000|title=Polarity and signaling in plant embryogenesis|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=51|pages=971-983|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the suspensor complex is gone,  the embryo is fully developed.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Stage V, in the illustration above, indicates what the embryo looks like at this point in development.

=== Maturation ===
The second phase, or postembryonic development, involves the maturation of cells, which involves cell growth and the storage of macromolecules (such as oils, starches and proteins) required as a 'food and energy supply' during [[germination]] and seedling growth. The appearance of a mature embryo is seen in Stage VI, in the illustration above.

== Dormancy ==
The end of embryogenesis is defined by an arrested development phase, or stop in growth. This phase usually coincides with a necessary component of growth called [[dormancy]]. Dormancy is a period in which a seed cannot germinate, even under optimal environmental conditions, until a specific requirement is met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baskin|first=Jeremy M.|last2=Baskin|first2=Carol C.|date=2004|title=A classification system for seed dormancy|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/024181C2EEE1FC55B9D7578660A5CB66/S0960258504000017a.pdf/classification_system_for_seed_dormancy.pdf|journal=Seed Science Research|volume=14|pages=1-16|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking dormancy, or finding the specific requirement of the seed, can be rather difficult. For example, a seed coat can be extremely thick. According to Evert and Eichhorn, very thick seed coats must undergo a process called scarification, in order to deteriorate the coating.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Raven Biology of Plants|last=Evert|first=Ray F.|last2=Eichhorn|first2=Susan E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=526-530}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, seeds must experience stratification. This process exposes the seed to certain environmental conditions, like cold or smoke, to break dormancy and initiate germination.

== The role of auxin ==
&lt;p&gt;[[Auxin]] is a hormone related to the elongation and regulation of plants.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|last2=Xu|first2=Z|last3=Chua|first3=N|date=|title=Auxin Polar Transport Is Essential for the Establishment of Bilateral Symmetry during Early Plant Embryogenesis.|url=|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=5|pages=621-630|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also plays an important role in the establishment polarity with the plant embryo. Research, conducted by Cooke, Racusen, and Cohen, has shown that the hypocotyl from both gymnosperms and angiosperms show auxin transport to the root end of the embryo&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooke|first=T. J.|last2=Racusen|first2=R. H.|last3=Cohen|first3=J. D.|date=November 1993|title=The role of auxin in plant embryogenesis|url=|journal=Plant Cell|volume=11|pages=1494-1495|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hypothesized that the embryonic pattern is regulated by the auxin transport mechanism, and the polar positioning of cells within the ovule. The importance of auxin was shown, in their research, when carrot embryos, at different stages, were subjected to auxin transport inhibitors. The inhibitors that these carrots were subjected to made them unable to progress to later stages of embryogenesis. During the globular stage of embryogenesis, the embryos continued spherical expansion. In addition, oblong embryos continued axial growth, without the introduction of cotyledons. During the heart embryo stage of development there were additional growth axes on hypocotyls. Further auxin transport inhibition research, conducted on ''Brassica juncea'', show that after germination, the cotyledons were fused and not two separate structures.&lt;/p&gt;
== Alternative forms of embryogenesis ==

=== Somatic embryogenesis ===
Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called [[Protoplast|protoplasts]]; development of synthetic seed technology. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]]. [[Plant growth regulators]] in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form the callus. The ratio of different [[plant growth regulators]] required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant. Asymmetrical cell division also seems to be important in the development of somatic embryos, and while failure to form the suspensor cell is lethal to zygotic embryos, it is not lethal for somatic embryos.

=== Androgenesis ===
The process of androgenesis allows a mature plant embryo to form from a reduced, or immature, [[pollen]] grain.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maraschin|first=S. F.|last2=de Priester|first2=W.|last3=Spaink|first3=H. P.|last4=Wang|first4=M.|date=July 2005|title=Androgenic switch: an example of plant embryogenesis from the male gametophyte perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=56|pages=1711-1726|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Androgenesis usually occurs under stressful conditions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Embryos that result from this mechanism can germinate into fully functional plants. As mentioned, the embryo results from a single pollen grain. Pollen grains consists of three cells - one vegetative cell containg two generative cells.  According to Maraschin et al., androgenesis must be triggered during the asymmetric division of microspores.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, once the vegetative cell starts to make starch and proteins, androgenesis can no longer occur. Maraschin et al., indicates that this mode of embryogenesis consists of three phases. The first phase is the ''acquisition of embryonic potential'', which is the repression of gametophyte formation, so that the differentiation of cells can occur. Then during the ''initiation of cell divisions'', multicellular structures begin to form, which are contained by the exine wall. The last step of androgenesis is ''pattern formation'', where the embryo-like structures are released out of the exile wall, in order for pattern formation to continue.

After these three phases occur, the rest of the process falls in line with the standard embryogenesis events.
==Plant growth and buds==
Embryonic tissue is made up of actively growing [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and the term is normally used to describe the early formation of tissue in the first stages of growth. It can refer to different stages of the [[sporophyte]] and [[gametophyte]] plant; including the growth of embryos in seedlings, and to meristematic tissues,&lt;ref&gt;Pandey, Brahma Prakash. 2005. Textbook of botany angiosperms: taxonomy, anatomy, embryology (including tissue culture) and economic botany. New Delhi: S. Chand &amp; Company. p 410.&lt;/ref&gt; which are in a persistently embryonic state,&lt;ref&gt;McManus, Michael T., and Bruce E. Veit. 2002. Meristematic tissues in plant growth and development. Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to the growth of new buds on stems.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Gurcharan. 2004. Plant systematics: an integrated approach. Enfield, NH: Science Publishers. p 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both [[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperm]]s, the young plant contained in the seed, begins as a developing egg-cell formed after [[fertilization]] (sometimes without fertilization in a process called [[apomixis]]) and becomes a plant embryo.
This embryonic condition also occurs in the [[bud]]s that form on [[plant stem|stem]]s. The buds have tissue that has differentiated but not grown into complete structures. They can be in a resting state, lying dormant over winter or when conditions are dry, and then commence growth when conditions become suitable. Before they start growing into stem, leaves, or flowers, the buds are said to be in an embryonic state.

{{about|a final [[resurrection]] at the [[end time]]||Resurrection (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Holy Thorn Reliquary.jpg|thumb|275px|The Last Trumpet sounded, detail of the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], 1390s]]
{{Eschatology|expanded=inter}}
'''Resurrection of the dead''', or '''resurrection from the dead''' ([[Koine Greek|Koine]]: {{lang|grc|ἀνάστασις [τῶν] νεκρῶν}}, ''anastasis [ton] nekron''; literally: "standing up again of the dead"{{sfn|Strong|2007|p=1604: '''G386 ἀνάστασις'''}}) is used in the doctrine and theology of various religions to describe an event by which a person, or people are [[resurrection|resurrected]] (brought back to life). Various forms of this concept can be found in  &lt;!-- ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;[[Islamic eschatology|Islamic]], [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish]] and [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]. In [[Christianity and Neopaganism|some Neopagan views]] this refers to [[reincarnation]] between the three realms: Life, Death, and the Realm of the Divine.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, the three common usages for this term pertain to (1) the [[resurrection of Jesus]]; (2) the [[Universal resurrection|rising from the dead of all men]], at the end of this present age and (3) the resurrection of certain ones in history, who were restored to life.{{sfn|Abbott-Smith|1999|p=33}}{{sfn|Thayer|1890|p='''ἀνάστασις'''}}

==Zoroastrianism==
{{Main|Frashokereti}}
The [[Zoroastrian]] belief in an end times renovation of the earth is known as ''[[frashokereti]]'', which includes some form of revival of the dead that can be attested from no earlier than the 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard N. Longenecker]] – ''Life in the Face of Death: The Resurrection Message of the New Testament'' p. 48 1998 "Franz König, for example, concludes that the earliest attestation of Zoroastrian belief in a resurrection cannot be dated before the fourth century BC (cf. Zarathustras Jenseitsvorstellungen und das Alte Testament [Vienna: Herder, ."&lt;/ref&gt; As distinct from Judaism this is the resurrection of all the dead to universal purification and renewal of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. M. M. Tuschling]] – Angels and Orthodoxy: A Study in Their Development in Syria and ... – 2007 pp.. 23, 271 " While admitting that Judaism and Zoroastrianism share a belief in resurrection, he points to a significant difference between them: in Iranian religion all are resurrected and purified as part of the renewal of the world."&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''frashokereti'' doctrine, the final renovation of the universe is when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God ([[Ahura Mazda]]). The term probably means "making wonderful, excellent". The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the "salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this." Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1979|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-415-23902-8|pages=27–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism==

[[File:Resurrection of the Dead vision.jpg|250px|thumb|Resurrection of the Dead, fresco from the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]]]]
[[File:127.Ezekiel’s Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''[[Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones|Ezekiel's Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones]]'', engraving by [[Gustave Doré]] (1866)]]

In [[Judaism]] and [[Samaritanism]], it is believed that the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] will one day give ''teḥiyyat ha-metim'' ("life to the dead") to the righteous during the [[Messianic Age#Judaism|Messianic Age]], and they will live forever in the [[world to come]] (''Olam Ha-Ba'').{{cn|date=August 2018}} Jews base this belief on the prophecies contained in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]: the [[Book of Isaiah]] (Yeshayahu), [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Yeḥez'qel), and [[Book of Daniel]] (Dani'el). Samaritans base it solely on a passage called the ''[[Haazinu|Ha'azeinu]]'' in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], since they only accept the [[Torah]] and reject the rest of the Hebrew Bible.

Jews believe that both the righteous and the wicked who are deceased will be resurrected and judged by God. They believe that the righteous Jews and the [[Noahide laws|Noahides]] ([[Ger toshav|righteous gentiles]]) will have [[immortality|eternal life]] on earth in the world to come, while the wicked will be punished and executed. Samaritans believe that only the righteous of Israel will be resurrected and given eternal life on earth.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The resurrection of the dead is a core belief of the [[Mishnah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Neusner]], ''World Religions in America: An Introduction'' (2009), p. 133: "D. He who says, the resurrection of the dead is a teaching which does not derive from the Torah, "...[Neusner] Excluded are those who deny the resurrection of the dead, or deny that the Torah teaches that the dead will live".&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in resurrection is expressed on all occasions in the [[Jewish liturgy]]; e.g., in the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Morning|morning prayer ''Elohai Neshamah'']], in the ''[[Shemoneh Esrei|Shemoneh 'Esreh]]'' and in the [[Bereavement in Judaism|funeral services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=233&amp;letter=R&amp;search=Resurrection#656 |title=Resurrection: Jewish Creed or Not? |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] made it the last of his [[Thirteen Articles of Faith]]: "I firmly believe that there will take place a revival of the dead at a time which will please the Creator, blessed be His name."{{cn|date=August 2018}}

There are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:
* The prophet [[Elijah]] prays and God raises a young boy from death (1 Kings 17:17–24)
* [[Elisha]] raises the son of the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4:32–37); this was the very same child whose birth he previously foretold (2 Kings 4:8–16)
* A dead man's body that was thrown into the dead Elisha's tomb is resurrected when the body touches Elisha's bones (2 Kings 13:21)

During the [[Second Temple period]], Judaism developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]],&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2 Esdras]]. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is "little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead" in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. "Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls" in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, ''Life''-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and "pass into other bodies," while "the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], who also was a Pharisee,&lt;ref&gt;Acts 23.6, 26.5.&lt;/ref&gt; said that at the resurrection what is "sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 15.35–53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] refers only to the resurrection of the soul, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Sysling, in his 1996 study of ''Teḥiyyat Ha-Metim'' in the Palestinian [[Targum]]im, identifies a consistent usage of the term "[[second death]]" in texts from the Second Temple period and [[Rabbinical literature|early rabbinical writings]], but not in the Hebrew Bible. "Second death" is identified with judgment, followed by resurrection from ''Gehinnom'' ("[[Gehenna]]") at the [[End time#Judaism|Last Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry Sysling, ''Teḥiyyat ha-metim: the resurrection of the dead in the Palestinian Targums'' (1996), p. 222: "Here the second death is identical with the judgment in Gehinnom. The wicked will perish and their riches will be given to the righteous..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Resurrection-Headstone.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail from a North Mississippi Christian cemetery headstone with the inscription: "May the resurrection find thee On the bosom of thy God."]]

===Epistles===
In the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] chapter 15, ἀνάστασις νεκρῶν is used for the resurrection of the dead.{{cn|date=August 2018}} In verses 54–55, [[Paul the Apostle]] is conveyed as quoting from the [[Book of Hosea]] 13:14 where he speaks of the abolition of death.
In the [[Pauline epistles]] of the [[New Testament]], [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote that those who will be resurrected to [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] will be resurrected with [[Spiritual body|spiritual bodies]], which are imperishable; the "flesh and blood" of natural, perishable bodies cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and, likewise, those that are corruptible will not receive incorruption (1 Corinthians 15:35–54). Even though Paul does not explicitly establish that immortality is exclusive to physical bodies, some scholars understand that according to Paul, flesh is simply to play no part, as we are made [[Immortality|immortal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Archibald Robertson (bishop)|Archibald Robertson]] &amp; [[Alfred Plummer]]. ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the First Epistle of St Paul to the Corinthians.'' Edinburgh 1914:375–76; [[Oscar Cullmann]]. "Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead" in [[Krister Stendahl]] (ed.) ''Immortality and Resurrection.'' New York 1965 [1955]:35; [[Gunnar af Hällström]]. ''Carnis Resurrection: The Interpretation of a Credal Formula.'' Helsinki 1988:10; [[Caroline Walker Bynum]]. ''The Resurrection of the Body in Western Christianity, 200–1336.'' New York 1995:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gospels and Acts ===
The [[Gospel of Matthew]] introduces the expression ἀναστάσεως τῶν νεκρῶν, which is used in a [[monologue]] by Jesus who speaks to the crowds about "the resurrection" called simply, ῇ ἀναστάσει (Mat. 22:29–33). This type of resurrection refers to the raising up of the dead, all mankind, at the end of this present age,{{sfn|Thayer|1890|p=ἀνάστασις}} the general or [[universal resurrection]].{{sfn|Abbott-Smith|1999|p=33}}

In the [[Gospel]]s, however, the resurrection, as exemplified by the [[resurrection of Jesus]], is presented with an increasing emphasis on the resurrection of the flesh: from the [[empty tomb]] in Mark; the women embracing the feet of the resurrected Jesus in Matthew; the insistence of the resurrected Jesus in Luke that he is of "flesh and bones" and not just a spirit or ''[[pneuma]]''; to the resurrected Jesus encouraging the disciples to touch his wounds in John.

In [[Acts of the Apostles]] the expression ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν was used by the [[Apostles]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] to defend the doctrine of the resurrection. Paul brought up the resurrection in his trial before [[Ananias son of Nedebaios|Ananias ben Nedebaios]]. The expression was variously used in reference to a general resurrection (Acts 24:21){{sfn|Abbott-Smith|1999|p=33}} at the end of this present age (Acts 23:6, 24:15).{{sfn|Thayer|1890|p=ἀνάστασις}}

===Nicene Creed and early Christianity===
[[File:Signorelli Resurrection.jpg|right|thumb|400px|''Resurrection of the Flesh'' (c. 1500) by [[Luca Signorelli]] – based on 1 Corinthians 15: 52: "the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed." Chapel of San Brizio, Duomo, Orvieto.]]
Most [[Christian denominations]] profess the [[Nicene Creed]], which affirms the resurrection of the dead; most [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]] include the phrase: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The Christian writers [[Irenaeus]] and [[Justin Martyr]], in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], wrote against the idea that only the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] survived. Martyr insists that a man is both soul and body and Christ has promised to raise both, just as his own body was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb-soft.com/believe/txv/martyr7.htm |title=Justin Martyr on the Resurrection |publisher=Mb-soft.com |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Christian doctrine of resurrection is based on Jewish belief, how the emphasis on this involving the actual flesh increased parallel with Christianity succeeding among the Greek populace may connect to [[Immortality#Ancient Greek religion|traditional Greek beliefs]] that true immortality always had to involve both body and soul. Although the Greeks held that a few individuals had been [[Resurrection#Ancient Greek religion|resurrected to physical immortality]] and that this really was the best fate possible, there was no ancient Greek belief in a general resurrection of the dead. Indeed, they held that once a body had been destroyed, there was no possibility of returning to life as not even the gods could recreate the flesh.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Several early Church Fathers, like [[Exhortation to the Greeks|Pseudo-Justin]], Justin Martyr, [[Tatian]], Irenaeus, and [[Athenagoras of Athens]], argue about the Christian resurrection beliefs in ways that answer to this traditional Greek scepticism to post-mortal physical continuity. The human body could not be annihilated, only dissolved – it could not even be integrated in the bodies of those who devoured it. Thus God only had to reassemble the minute parts of the dissolved bodies in the resurrection.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Traditional [[Christian Church]]es, i.e. ones that adhere to the [[Creed#Christian creeds|creeds]], continue to uphold the belief that there will be a general and universal resurrection of the dead at "the [[end of the world (religion)|end of time]]", as described by Paul when he said, "...he hath appointed a day, in which he will [judge the world..." (Acts 17:31 KJV) and "...there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust." (Acts 24:15 KJV).

===Modern Era===
Early Christian church fathers defended the resurrection of the dead against the pagan belief that the immortal soul went to the [[underworld]] immediately after death. Currently, however, it is a popular Christian belief that the souls of the righteous go to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=h&amp;word=HEREAFTER Hereafter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epm.org/articles/qa-reunite_children.html Will We Be Reunited with Children Who Have Died?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207044604/http://www.epm.org/articles/qa-reunite_children.html |date=7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the medieval period, the modern era brought a shift in Christian thinking from an emphasis on the resurrection of the body back to the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="Christian Theology Vol 2005"&gt;Encyclopedia of Christian Theology Vol. 3, "Resurrection of the Dead" by [[André Dartigues]], ed. by Jean-Yves Lacoste (New York: Routledge, 2005), 1381.&lt;/ref&gt; This shift was a result of a change in the ''[[zeitgeist]]'', as a reaction to the [[Renaissance]] and later to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].  André Dartigues has observed that especially "from the 17th to the 19th century, the language of popular piety no longer evoked the resurrection of the soul but [[Eternal life (Christianity)|everlasting life]]. Although theological textbooks still mentioned resurrection, they dealt with it as a speculative question more than as an existential problem."&lt;ref name="Christian Theology Vol 2005"/&gt;

This shift was supported not by any scripture, but largely by the popular religion of the Enlightenment, [[Deism]]. Deism allowed for a [[God|supreme being]], such as the philosophical [[first cause]], but denied any significant personal or relational interaction with this figure. Deism, which was largely led by rationality and reason, could allow a belief in the [[immortality of the soul]], but not necessarily in the resurrection of the dead. American deist [[Ethan Allen]] demonstrates this thinking in his work, ''[[Ethan Allen#Publications|Reason the Only Oracle of Man]]'' (1784) where he argues in the preface that nearly every philosophical problem is beyond humanity's understanding, including the miracles of Christianity, although he does allow for the immortality of an immaterial soul.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Unbelief, Vol. 1, A–K, "Deism," Edited by [[Gordon Stein]] (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985), 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on secular law and custom===
In Christian theology, it was once widely believed that to rise on [[Judgment Day]] the body had to be whole and preferably [[Burial#Orientation|buried with the feet to the east]] so that the person would rise facing God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Yorke]] (2006), ''The Conversion of Britain''  Pearson Education, {{ISBN|0-582-77292-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-582-77292-2}}.

===Denominational views===
In [[Catholicism]], in accordance to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'': ""No doctrine of the Christian Faith", says [[St. Augustine]], "is so vehemently and so obstinately opposed as the doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh"... This opposition had begun long before the days of St. Augustine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12792a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: General Resurrection |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1911 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm |title=CCC – PART 1 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ARTICLE 11 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', spiritual beings that have been restored to glorified bodies will have the following basic qualities:
* Impassibility (incorruptible / painless) — immunity from death and pain
* Subtility (permeability) — freedom from restraint by matter
* Agility — obedience to spirit with relation to movement and space (the ability to move through space and time with the speed of thought)
* Clarity — resplendent beauty of the soul manifested in the body (as when [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Jesus was transfigured]] on [[Mount Tabor]])&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Catechism'' by Father [[John A. Hardon]], p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anglicanism]], scholars such as the Bishop of Durham [[N. T. Wright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html | work=Time | title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&amp;#13; | date=7 February 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010 | first=David | last=Van Biema}}&lt;/ref&gt; have defended the primacy of the resurrection in Christian faith. Interviewed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 2008, senior [[Anglican]] bishop and theologian [[N. T. Wright]] spoke of "the idea of bodily resurrection that people deny when they talk about their ‘souls going to Heaven,'" adding: “I've often heard people say, ‘I'm going to heaven soon, and I won't need this stupid body there, thank goodness.’ That's a very damaging distortion, all the more so for being unintentional.” Instead, Wright explains: “In the Bible we are told that you die, and enter an [[intermediate state]]." This is "conscious," but "compared to being bodily alive, it will be like being asleep." This will be followed by resurrection into new bodies, he says. "Our culture is very interested in life after death, but the New Testament is much more interested in what I've called the life after life after death."

Of [[Baptists]], [[James Leo Garrett Jr.]], E. Glenn Hinson, and James E. Tull write that "Baptists traditionally have held firmly to the belief that Christ rose triumphant over death, sin, and hell in a bodily resurrection from the dead."&lt;ref name="GarrettHinson1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|first1=James Leo|last2=Hinson|first2=E.

In [[Lutheranism]], [[Martin Luther]] personally believed and taught resurrection of the dead in combination with [[soul sleep]]. However, this is not a mainstream teaching of [[Lutheranism]] and most Lutherans traditionally believe in resurrection of the body in combination with the [[immortal soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Evangelical Lutheran intelligencer: Volume 5–1830 Page 9 Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Maryland and Virginia "Every one of those committed to our care is possessed of an immortal soul and should we not exceedingly rejoice, that we in the hands of the Supreme Being, may be instrumental in leading them unto "fountains of living water."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS), on the last day all the dead will be resurrected. Their souls will then be reunited with the same bodies they had before dying. The bodies will then be changed, those of the wicked to a state of everlasting shame and torment, those of the righteous to an everlasting state of celestial glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/bilarson/eschatology.txt|title=Outlines of Doctrinal Theology |pages=233–ff. |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |date=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Methodism]], the Reverend M. Douglas Meeks, professor of theology and Wesleyan studies at [[Vanderbilt Divinity School]], states that "it is very important for Christians to hold to the resurrection of the body."&lt;ref name="Interpreter2012"/&gt; [[F. Belton Joyner]] in ''United Methodist Answers'', states that the "New Testament does not speak of a natural immortality of the soul, as if we never actually die. It speaks of resurrection of the body, the claim that is made each time we state the historic Apostles' Creed and classic Nicene Creed", given in ''[[The United Methodist Hymnal]]''.&lt;ref name="Joyner2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyner|first=F.

The resurrected body will be a spiritual body, but the person will be whole identifiable.

St. Paul, in the 53d verse of this chapter, tells us that 'this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.' [1 Corinthians 15:53]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/sermons/137/|title=Sermon 137, On the Resurrection of the Dead|work=General Board of Global Ministries|publisher=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=21 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422231726/http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/sermons/137/|archivedate=22 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, notable Methodist hymns, such as those by [[Charles Wesley]], link 'our resurrection and Christ's resurrection".&lt;ref name="Interpreter2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=We shall be raised!|last=Holmes|first=Cecile S.|date=March–April 2012|work=Interpreter Magazine|publisher=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christian conditionalism]], there are several churches, such as the [[Anabaptists]] and [[Socinians]] of the Reformation, then [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Christadelphians]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and theologians of different traditions who reject the idea of the immortality of a non-physical soul as a vestige of [[Neoplatonism]], and other [[Paganism|pagan]] traditions.{{cn|date=August 2018}} In this school of thought, the dead remain dead (and do not immediately progress to a [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], or [[Purgatory]]) until a physical resurrection of some or all of the dead occurs at the end of time, or in [[Paradise#Jehovah's Witnesses|Paradise]] restored on earth, in a general resurrection. Some groups, Christadelphians in particular, consider that it is not a universal resurrection, and that at this time of resurrection that the [[Last Judgment]] will take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ashton]]. ''Raised to Judgement Bible Teaching about Resurrection &amp; Judgement'' Christadelphian, Birmingham 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[evangelicals]], ''The Doctrinal Basis of the Evangelical Alliance'' affirms belief in "the resurrection of the body, the judgment of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, with the eternal blessedness of the righteous, and the eternal punishment of the wicked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds3.v.viii.html|title=Creeds of the Evangelical Protestant Churches|year=1846|publisher=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Latter Day Saints]] believe that God has a [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]]. Before the resurrection, the spirits of the dead are believed to exist in a place known as the [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]], which is similar to yet fundamentally distinct from the traditional concept of Heaven and Hell. It is believed that the spirit retains its wants, beliefs, and desires in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church [https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-41-the-postmortal-spirit-world?lang=eng Chapter 41: The Postmortal Spirit World]&lt;/ref&gt; [[LDS Church]] doctrine teaches the Jesus Christ was the first person to be resurrected,&lt;ref name=LDSres&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/resurrection|title= The Guide to the Scriptures: Resurrection |work=''LDS.org'' |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that all those who have lived on the earth will be resurrected because of Jesus Christ, regardless of their righteousness.&lt;ref name=LDSres/&gt; The LDS Church teaches that not all are resurrected at the same time; the righteous will be resurrected in a "first resurrection" and unrepentant sinners in a "last resurrection."&lt;ref name=LDSres/&gt; The resurrection is believed to unite the spirit with the body again, and the LDS Church teaches that the body (flesh and bone) will be made whole and become incorruptible, a state which includes immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/study/topics/resurrection?lang=eng |title= Resurrection |work=''LDS.org'' |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a belief in LDS doctrine that a few exceptional individuals were removed from the earth "without tasting of death." This is referred to as [[Translation (LDS Church)|translation]], and these individuals are believed to have retained their bodies in a purified form, though they too will eventually be required to receive resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/translated-beings?lang=eng&amp;letter=t Translated Beings]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Millenarianism|millennialists]] interpret the [[Book of Revelation]] as requiring two physical resurrections of the dead, one before the [[Millennium]], the other after it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Witherington]] ''Revelation'' p291 2003 "In short John affirms two resurrections of the dead: one is blessed, the other not blessed; one is before the millennium, the other after it.5 It is then proper to conclude that John believes in a future millennial reign upon the earth ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Islamic eschatology|Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Qiyamah}}
In [[Islam]], ''Yawm al-Qiyāmah'' ({{lang-ar|يوم القيامة}} "the Day of Resurrection") or ''Yawm ad-Din'' ({{lang-ar|يوم الدين}} "the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]]") is believed to be [[God in Islam|God's]] final assessment of humanity. The sequence of events (according to the most commonly held belief) is the annihilation of all creatures, [[resurrection]] of the body, and the judgment of all sentient creatures. The exact time when these events will occur is unknown, however there are said to be major&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shaykh Ahmad Ali |url=http://www.inter-islam.org/faith/Majorsigns.html |title=Major Signs before the Day of Judgment by Shaykh Ahmad Ali |publisher=Inter-islam.org |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and minor signs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=admin@inter-islam.org |url=http://www.inter-islam.org/faith/Signs-Of-Qiyaamah.htm |title=Signs of Qiyaamah |publisher=Inter-islam.org |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are to occur near the time of ''Qiyamah'' ([[end time]]). Many Qur'anic verses, especially the earlier ones, are dominated by the idea of the nearing of the day of resurrection.&lt;ref name="EoQ"&gt;Isaac Hasson, ''Last Judgment'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;L. Gardet, ''Qiyama'', ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sign of ''nafkhatu'l-ula'', a trumpet will be sounded for the first time, and which will result in the death of the remaining sinners.  Then there will be a period of forty years. The eleventh sign is the sounding of a second trumpet to signal the resurrection as ''ba'as ba'da'l-mawt''.&lt;ref&gt;Sura 39 ([[Surat al-Zumar|Az-Zumar]]), [[ayah]] 68 {{Cite quran|39|68|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then all will be naked and running to the Place of Gathering, while the enemies of Allah will be travelling on their faces with their legs upright.

The Day of Resurrection is one of [[the six articles of Islamic faith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionfacts.com/six-articles-of-islamic-faith Six Articles of Islamic Faith]&lt;/ref&gt; Everybody will account for their deeds in this world and people will go to [[heaven]] and [[hell]] forever.

'''Rufus Wheeler Peckham''' (December 20, 1809 – November 22, 1873) was a judge and [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]] from New York, and the father of a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] justice.

==Biography==
Peckham was born in [[Rensselaerville, New York]] in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] on December 20, 1809 to Peleg Benjamin (1762–1828) and Desire (Watson) Peckham (1767–1852). He graduated from [[Union College]] at [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] in 1827, where he was an early member of [[Kappa Alpha Society|The Kappa Alpha Society]], and after studying law was admitted to the bar in 1830.  He served as the [[district attorney]] of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] from 1838 to 1841. Peckham was elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from New York's 14th District, serving in the [[Thirty-third United States Congress|Thirty-third Congress]] from March 4, 1853, until March 3, 1855.  During his term, he was the chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Revolutionary Claims]].

Peckham afterwards returned to legal practice in a partnership with Judge [[Lyman Tremain]], until he was elected to serve as a justice of the [[New York Supreme Court]] for the Third Judicial District, from 1861 until 1869.  He then sat as an associate judge on the [[New York Court of Appeals]] from July 4, 1870, until his death. It is believed that he was under consideration for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court at the time of his death.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Peckham had three sons by his first wife, Isabella Adoline Lacey, who died on April 4, 1848 at the age of 35. [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]] (1838&amp;ndash;1909) followed in his namesake father's footsteps as a lawyer and in three of the positions that his father had held in New York: as the Albany district attorney (1869&amp;ndash;1872), as a New York Supreme Court judge (1883&amp;ndash;1886), and as a judge on the New York Court of Appeals (1886&amp;ndash;1895). He remarried to Mary Elizabeth Foote (1830–1873). 
[[File:The sinking of the Steamship Ville du Havre.jpg|thumb|left|Sinking of the ''SS Ville du Havre'']]

The younger Peckham never went into Congress, however, but served on the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] from 1895 until his death. Peckham's oldest son, [[Wheeler Hazard Peckham]] (1833&amp;ndash;1905), was also a lawyer who practiced in New York City. Wheeler was also nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court but the [[United States Senate|Senate]] failed to confirm him. Peckham had another son named Joseph Henry, who died at the age of 17 on April 2, 1852.

Peckham and his second wife, Mary, were among 226 passengers and crew of the [[Steamboat|steamer]] [[SS Ville du Havre|SS ''Ville du Havre'']] lost at sea, while the couple were en route to southern France to improve his failing health. The ship sank after colliding with the [[Scotland|Scottish]] vessel [[Loch Line|''Loch Earn'']] in the north Atlantic Ocean on November 22, 1873; Peckham's last words were reported to be, "Wife, we have to die, let us die bravely." His remains were never recovered, and a [[cenotaph]] was erected at [[Albany Rural Cemetery]] in [[Menands, New York]].

'''Shenzhou 6''' ({{zh|s=神舟六号}} ''Shénzhōu lìuhào'') was the second [[human spaceflight]] of the [[Chinese space program]], launched on October 12, 2005 on a [[Long March 2F]] rocket from the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]. The [[Shenzhou spacecraft]] carried a crew of [[Fei Junlong|Fèi Jùnlóng]] (费俊龙) and [[Nie Haisheng|Niè Hǎishèng]] (聂海胜) for five days in [[low Earth orbit]]. It launched three days before the second anniversary of China's first human spaceflight, ''[[Shenzhou 5]]''.

The crew were able to change out of their new lighter [[space suit]]s, conduct scientific experiments, and enter the orbital module for the first time, giving them access to toilet facilities. The exact activities of the crew were kept secret but were thought by some to include military reconnaissance, however this is likely untrue given that similar experiments in the [[United States of America|US]] and [[Soviet Union|USSR]] determined that humans are not suited for military reconnaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou6.htm|title=Shenzhou 6|accessdate=2006-09-19|author=Mark Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018142400/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou6.htm|archivedate=2006-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It landed in the [[Siziwang Banner]] of [[Inner Mongolia]] on October 16, 2005, the same site as the previous manned and unmanned [[Shenzhou program|Shenzhou]] flights.

=== Crew notes ===
This is the first spaceflight for both crew members. The crew was introduced to the Chinese public and international media about five hours before the launch. Niè Hǎishèng celebrated his 41st birthday in space.

[[Huang Chunping]], the chief designer of the Long March 2F rocket, was quoted in the ''[[Beijing Times]]'' as saying the crew members who would fly the mission were selected from a pool of three pairs. Five pairs of astronauts trained for the flight and about one month before launch the two pairs with the lowest performance were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/china-05z.html|title=Astronauts In Training For Second Manned Spaceflight|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=March 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' newspaper had reported that Zhai Zhigang and Nie Haisheng were the leading pair, after having been in the final group of three for ''[[Shenzhou 5]]''.

== Mission highlights ==

=== Launch ===

The crew arrived at the spacecraft about 2 hours and 45 minutes before the launch and the hatch closed 30 minutes after their arrival. At 01:00:05.583 UTC on October 12 ''Shenzhou 6'' lifted off from the launch pad at [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]. The launch phase was reported to be normal with the escape rocket separating 120 seconds after launch when the rocket was travelling 1,300&amp;nbsp;m/s (4300&amp;nbsp;ft/s). Sixteen seconds later the four booster rockets separated at an altitude of {{convert|52|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The [[payload fairing]] and first stage detached 200 seconds after launch. The second stage burned for a further 383 seconds and the spacecraft separated from the rocket {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the [[Yellow Sea]]. The spacecraft then used its own propulsion system to place it into a 211&amp;nbsp;km by 345&amp;nbsp;km (131 by 214 statute miles) orbit, with an [[inclination]] of 42.4 degrees, about 21 minutes after launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-10/13/content_484586.htm|title=Nerve hub of China's space programme|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2005-10-13|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 01:39 UTC [[Chen Bingde]], the Chief Commander of the [[Chinese space program]], announced the launch was successful. The crew ate their first meal in space at 03:11 UTC.

Before the flight, the launch time had been the object of speculation by the Chinese media. For several months before the planned launch its time was only given as mid-October, or even late-September. Then on September 23 it was reported by the Hong Kong-based [[news agency]] ''[[China News Service]]'' that the launch was tentatively scheduled for 03:00 UTC on October 13. This launch time was confirmed two weeks later by [[Jiang Jingshan]], a member of the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]]. But then on October 10 an official from the technical department of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center said the launch was then scheduled for 01:00 UTC on October 12. This new launch time could have been designed to dodge the cold weather which had been forecast to hit the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cold weather may force China to postpone manned space mission: report|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=2005-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assembly of the rocket was reported complete on September 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200509/26/eng20050926_210970.html|title=Shenzhou-6 spaceship finishes assembling|publisher=[[People's Daily]]|date=2005-09-26|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, the ''Shenzhou 6'' spacecraft was attached to the [[Long March 2|CZ-2F rocket]], also known as ''Shenjian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2005-10-06/03317101389s.shtml|title=神六飞船与神箭在酒泉发射中心完美对接|publisher=Sina.com|date=2005-10-06|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the unmanned Shenzhou flights, ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' and ''6'' were launched during daylight hours to provide greater safety in case of abort. The launch was televised live with [[China Central Television]] selling advertising for [[Renminbi|RMB¥]]2.56 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]316,000) for five seconds, to RMB¥8.56 million (US$1 million) for 30 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sinodaily.com/2005/050920101933.sj5y9qa3.html|title=State TV begins selling ads for China's manned space flight|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=2005-09-20|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video camera had been added to the rocket and images of it were broadcast during the ascent and the separation of the Shenzhou spacecraft.

Shortly after launch, recovery crews began searching a region from the [[Badain Jaran Desert]] in [[Inner Mongolia]] to [[Shaanxi]] for the launch escape tower, booster rockets, first stage and payload fairing. Of particular interest was the "[[Flight data recorder|black box]]" of the rocket, which contained [[telemetry]] that may not have been downlinked during the launch phase. It was found 45 minutes after launch somewhere near [[Otog Banner]]. It was first sighted by a herdswoman, Lian Hua, about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from her home. Other wreckage from the launch was found and destroyed at its impact location or brought back to Jiuquan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/12/content_3608596.htm|title=Rocket "black box" found in Inner Mongolia|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=2005-10-12|accessdate=2006-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131642/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/12/content_3608596.htm|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Hu Jintao]] was present at the [[Beijing Aerospace Control Center]] to watch the launch. [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] was present at the [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]].

=== Five days in orbit ===

The first of several orbit changing maneuvers happened as planned at 07:54:45, with a 63-second burn to circularize the orbit. Based on [[United States Space Command]] [[orbital elements]], it was in a 332 by 336&amp;nbsp;km (206 by 209 statute miles) orbit. After about an hour and a half, the hatch between the re-entry and orbital modules was opened and, for the first time, crew were able to enter the second living compartment of the Shenzhou spacecraft. Fèi Jùnlóng was the first to enter, while Niè Hǎishèng remained in the reentry module. They would swap positions about three hours later.

At 13:32 UTC, Niè and Fèi had a seven-minute conversation with their wives and children who were in Mission Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/TRsummer/77436.htm|title=Chinese Astronaut Calls Family from Space|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=2005-10-15|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niè's daughter sang "[[Happy Birthday to You]]", as his birthday is October 13.

The activities of the crew were not fully revealed by the Chinese. Only vague references to experiments were made, though some were made public. One experiment involved the crew testing the reaction of the spacecraft to movement within the orbital and reentry modules. They moved between the modules, opening and closing the hatches and operating equipment with "more strength" than normally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:ZCpwSP6DZU8J:www.shanghaidaily.com/art/2005/10/13/202008/Astronauts_test_the_spacecraft.htm+Astronauts_test_the_spacecraft&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a|title=Astronauts test the spacecraft|date=2005-10-13|publisher=[[Shanghai Daily]]|accessdate=2006-09-17}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second orbital maneuver occurred at 21:56 on October 13. It raised the orbit that had been lowered due to [[atmospheric drag]], and lasted 6.5 seconds.

On October 15, Niè and Fèi had a two-minute conversation with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Hu Jintao]], beginning at 08:29. During the conversation, Hu told them "The motherland and people are proud of you. I hope you will successfully complete your task by carrying out the mission calmly and carefully and have a triumphant return".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/051015_shenzhou6_day4.html|title=Chinese President Praises Shenzhou 6 Crew |date=2005-10-15|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Re-entry and landing ===
[[File:Nie Haisheng gets out of reentry.jpg|right|thumb|[[Nie Haisheng]] exits the re-entry capsule of Shenzhou 6 at the main landing field in Central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.]]

The re-entry process began at 19:44 on October 16 when the orbital module separated as planned from the rest of the spacecraft. Unlike with the [[Soyuz spacecraft]], this is done before the re-entry burn, allowing the orbital module to stay in orbit for extended months-long missions or to act as a docking target for later flights. The orbital module fired its engines twice on October 19 to give it a circular orbit with a height of {{convert|355|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/051021_shenzhou6_orbital_module.html|title=Shenzhou 6 Orbital Module Reaches Higher Orbit|date=2005-10-21|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One minute after this separation, the engines on the service module ignited over the coast of [[West Africa]] to slow the spacecraft. At 20:07, the re-entry module separated and five minutes later the re-entry proper began, as the Shenzhou capsule entered the top of the atmosphere, over China. The [[communications blackout]] that occurs during re-entry started at 20:16 and two minutes later radio communication was regained with the spacecraft. The main parachute opened and the capsule began to slowly descend to a landing on the Inner Mongolia northern grasslands at 4:33&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time (20:33 UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0510/16shenzhou6/|title=Chinese astronauts return from space|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=October 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capsule landed approximately 1&amp;nbsp;km (about 1000 yards) from its planned target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2238/2005-10-17/118@277025.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711171814/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2238/2005-10-17/118@277025.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-11|title=Shenzhou-6 Landed Successfully|date=2005-10-17|publisher=[[China Radio International]]|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half an hour after landing, the recovery forces had the hatch of the spacecraft open and first Fèi, and then Niè emerged. Hou Ying, chief designer of the landing site system, said the recovery was improved over that of ''Shenzhou 5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/17/content_3623154.htm|title=Shenzhou-6's recovery extremely satisfactory|date=2005-10-17|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2006-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131650/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/17/content_3623154.htm|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After medical check-ups and a light meal the astronauts were put on a special plane bound for Beijing, where they were placed into medical isolation for the following two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/18/content_3638323.htm|title=Astronauts in medical isolation|date=2005-10-18|publisher=[[China Central Television]]|accessdate=2006-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109230220/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/18/content_3638323.htm|archivedate=2006-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 21:46, [[Chen Bingde]] had declared the entire mission to be a success.

The capsule was returned to Beijing by train and handed over to [[China Research Institute of Space Technology]] at [[Changping railway station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/18/content_3642275.htm|title=Shenzhou-6 re-entry capsule handed over to developer|date=2005-10-18|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2006-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024020748/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/18/content_3642275.htm|archivedate=2007-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbital module continued to orbit the Earth, gathering more information from experiments on board. The module also gave Chinese mission controllers experience at long-duration spaceflights. After 2,920 orbits of the Earth, its active mission ended on April 15, 2006. It is still in orbit, and will reenter when its orbit sufficiently decays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Orbiting_Chinese_Space_Capsule_Completes_Mission.html|title=Orbiting Chinese Space Capsule Completes Mission|date=2006-04-15|publisher=Agence France-Presse|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two planned landing sites for the mission. The primary site was the [[Banner (Inner Mongolia)|banner]] of [[Siziwang]] in [[Inner Mongolia]]. The secondary site was at the Jiuquan launch site. In addition, there were recovery forces at [[Yinchuan]], [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Yulin]] and [[Handan]]. It is also possible for the Shenzhou spacecraft to [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] in the ocean should the need arise, with further recovery crews in the [[Yellow Sea]], the [[East China Sea]] and the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/12/content_3608775.htm|title=Landing field system operating after Shenzhou-6 lifts off|date=2005-10-12|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2006-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131738/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/12/content_3608775.htm|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Chinese diplomats are trained and equipped for any emergency landing at sites that are not on Chinese territory. [[Zhang Shuting]], chief designer of the emergency and rescue system, has said that emergency landing sites have been identified in Australia, [[Southwest Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Europe]], the United States and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200510/14/eng20051014_214371.html|title=Shenzhou-6 able to return in emergency at any time: chief designer|date=2005-10-14|publisher=People's Daily|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diplomatic mission nearest to the landing site will be given the task to head any rescue mission if necessary. The Chinese government had advised Australia that emergency landing sites have been identified in [[New South Wales]], Queensland, the [[Northern Territory]] and Western Australia. [[Emergency Management Australia]], the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] agency that co-ordinates the response to major contingencies, has said they are ready to deal with any emergencies that arise during spaceflights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/in-case-of-cosmic-crisis-just-crash-near-australia/2005/10/11/1128796528933.html|title=Crisis?

A copy of this key has not been made available to Australian officials, but it was reported that an unnamed Chinese [[military attaché]] at the Chinese embassy in [[Canberra]] had one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csuchen.de/news/viewarticle.php?id=116153 |title=Secrets for Chinese eyes only if space capsule falls to earth |date=2005-10-15 |publisher=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=2006-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928191204/http://www.csuchen.de/news/viewarticle.php?id=116153 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Project management ====
As with previous Shenzhou series, Chinese military is heavily involved, and in official Chinese documents, project managers are referred as project commanders instead:
* General project manager / commander: [[Chen Bingde]]
* 1st vice general project manager / commander: [[Lieutenant General]] Hu Shixiang (胡世祥), vice director-general of [[General Armaments Department]]
* Vice general project manager / commander: [[Zhang Qingwei]]
* Vice general project manager / commander: [[Jiang Mianheng]]
* Vice general project manager / commander: [[Sun Laiyan]]
* General engineer: [[Wang Yongzhi]]
* Vice general engineer: Zhou Jianping (周建平), who was born in [[Wangcheng County]], 1957. He obtained his M.S .from [[Dalian University of Technology]], his Ph.D from National University of Defense Technology, where he became a professor. From 1993 thru 1995, he studies in the United States. He would later become the general engineer for [[Shenzhou 7]].
* Director of [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]: [[Major General]] Zhang Yulin (张育林)
* Vice director of [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]: [[Major General]] Cui Jijun (崔吉俊)
* General engineer of ground support at [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]: Wang Jingan (王金安)

== Upgrades ==
The Chinese space officials have said that the Long March 2F rocket featured a "fire security system" on the escape tower. Speculation on what this means ranges from better fail-safes to stop accidental firings, to the addition of a [[fire extinguisher]]. The ''[[Wen Wei Po]]'' newspaper have reported that the rocket appeared the same as that used for ''Shenzhou 5'' except that a "transition segment" was visible at the top of the ''Shenzhou 6'' stack, attached to one end of the orbital module.

China Aerospace Science and Technology, the major manufacturer of both the Shenzhou spacecraft and the Long March rocket have said that although the flight featured a second astronaut and was much longer than ''Shenzhou 5'', the rocket and spacecraft did not weigh much more due to optimisation of its systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/21/content_410892.htm|title=Space mission set: two to orbit in Shenzhou-VI|date=2005-01-21|publisher=[[China Daily]]|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 200&amp;nbsp;kg (about 440&amp;nbsp;lb) more was needed for the second astronaut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/250050/china_prepares_for_shenzhou_vi_space_flight_13_october_/|title=China Prepares for Shenzhou VI Space Flight 13 October – Agency|date=2005-09-24|publisher=[[Zhongguo Tongxun She]]|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the amenities on board for the crew was hot food, sleeping bags and essential sanitary equipment. The sleeping bag was hooked to a wall of the orbital module and the crew had alternating sleep periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/12/content_3609268.htm|title=How do astronauts eat, sleep in spaceship?|date=2005-10-12|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2006-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131807/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/12/content_3609268.htm|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[shock absorber]]s in the crew seats were redesigned so as to provide more safety to the crew in case the braking rockets fail to fire just before touchdown. The flight telemetry recorder on the spacecraft had its memory increased to about 1 [[gigabyte]], and the [[read/write speed]] was now 10 times as fast as the computers carried on previous flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200510/12/eng20051012_213999.html|title=The look of Shenzhou-VI manned spaceship|date=2005-10-13|publisher=People's Daily|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also about half the size of that carried on ''Shenzhou 5''. Overall, 95% of the Shenzhou 6 space capsule is indigenously designed/produced in China, the highest rate in comparison to the previous ones.

The menu included [[pineapple]]-filled [[mooncake]]s, [[green vegetable]]s, [[braised]] [[bamboo shoot]]s, [[rice]], and [[bean congee]]. In total there was 40&amp;nbsp;kg (about 88&amp;nbsp;lb) of food on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-10/12/content_484381.htm|title=Fly me to the mooncakes|date=2005-10-12|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A somewhat strange aspect of the mission reported in the Chinese press was the fixation on the purity of drinking water for the astronauts, where it was claimed that their water reportedly comes from a mine {{convert|1.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} underground and was disinfected with an [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[silver]] solution. It has thus been said by the press that they are drinking the "purest water in China".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200510/12/eng20051012_213941.html|title=Astronauts aboard Shenzhou-6 drink "purest" water from deep underground|date=2005-10-12|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been reported that, on ''Shenzhou 5'', astronaut [[Yang Liwei]] suffered from a "minor heartache" after his launch. It is thought that this refers to [[space adaptation syndrome]] experienced by about one third of astronauts during the first few days of a spaceflight. The ''[[People's Daily]]'' said that the interior design of the spacecraft has been changed to hopefully lessen the likelihood of [[nausea]] and other symptoms.

== Experiments ==
It was announced in July 2005 that ''Shenzhou 6'' would carry one experiment involving the [[spermatozoon|sperm]] of [[pig]]s from Rongchang County, [[Chongqing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indcoup.blogspot.com/2005/07/pigs-in-space.html|title=China Space Flight to Test Cosmic Radiation on Pig Sperm|date=2005-07-18|publisher=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]|accessdate=2006-09-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on October 11 it was revealed by Liu Luxiang, director of the Centre for Space Breeding at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, that there were no plans for animal or plant seeds on the flight. He said the focus of ''Shenzhou 6'' was the physical reactions of the crew to the space environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200510/11/eng20051011_213771.html|title=Official: Shenzhou VI not to carry plant seeds|date=2005-10-11|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seemingly contradicted a year and a half after the flight when [[sweet potato]]es started being sold for [[Valentine's Day]] that had been grown from seeds reportedly taken on the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6353403.stm|title=Lift-off for Chinese space potato|date=2007-02-12|accessdate=2007-02-13 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris Jones who writes for SpaceDaily.com has speculated that the lack of any other announced experiments suggested that the mission could be oriented more toward the military. The crew could have operated a large surveillance film camera, supplementing the unmanned recoverable satellite program.

== Tracking ==
[[File:YuanWang2c.JPG|thumb|250px|''Yuanwang 2'' in [[Waitematā Harbour]], [[Auckland]], New Zealand on October 27, 2005. The ship was resupplying after being at sea to support the flight]]

There are 20 land-based tracking stations in the Chinese space telemetry network. These are supplemented by four ''[[Yuanwang]]''-series tracking ships. The [[Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center]] global map showed their positions to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-10/12/content_3607832.htm|title=Beijing Aerospace Command, Control Center|date=2005-10-12|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yuanwang 1'' in the [[Yellow Sea]]
* ''Yuanwang 2'' about 1500&amp;nbsp;km (about 900 statute miles) southwest of [[French Polynesia]]
* ''Yuanwang 3'' off the [[Namibia]]n coast
* ''Yuanwang 4'' off the coast of Western Australia in the Indian Ocean

Only one other land-based tracking station is outside China — at [[Swakopmund]] in [[Namibia]].

Shortly after the ''Shenzhou 5'' flight in 2003, the Pacific nation of [[Kiribati]] established [[Diplomatic recognition|diplomatic ties]] with the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), leading the People's Republic of China (PRC) to cut off diplomatic ties under its [[One-China policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/01/content_286035.htm|title=Diplomatic dispute won't hurt space mission|publisher=China Daily|date=2003-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035942/http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/01/content_286035.htm|archivedate=2012-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the PRC has dismantled a [[Telemetry|tracking]] station that had been built on [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]], the capital island of Kiribati, to track spaceflights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/china/kiribati.htm|title=South Tarawa Island, Republic of Kiribati|accessdate=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Musorgsky 1874 b.jpg|thumb|185px|Mussorgsky in 1874]]
'''''Songs and Dances of Death''''' ({{lang-ru|'''Песни и пляски смерти'''}}, ''Pesni i plyaski smerti'') is a [[song cycle]] for voice (usually [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] or [[bass-baritone]]) and [[piano]] by [[Modest Mussorgsky|Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky]], written in the mid-1870s, to poems by [[Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov]], a relative of the composer.

Each song deals with death in a poetic manner although the depictions are [[realism (art)|realistic]] in that they reflect experiences not uncommon in 19th century Russia: child death, death in youth, drunken [[poverty|misadventure]] and [[war]].

The song cycle is considered Mussorgsky's masterpiece in the genre.

==Songs==
''Songs and Dances of Death'' consists of four individual songs, as follows:

1. ''[[Lullaby]]'' (''Колыбельная'') (14 April 1875) (in [[F-sharp minor]]–[[A minor]])
:A mother cradles her sick infant, who grows more feverish. [[Death (personification)|Death]] appears, disguised as a babysitter, and rocks the infant to eternal sleep.
2. ''[[Serenade]]'' (''Серенада'') (11 May 1875) (in [[E minor]]–[[E-flat minor]])
:The figure of Death waits outside the window of a dying woman, in the manner of a wooing lover.
3. ''[[Tropak|Trepak]]'' (''Трепак'') (17 February 1875) (in [[D minor]])
:A drunken peasant stumbles outside into the snow and becomes caught in a blizzard. The figure of Death invites him to dance a folk-dance called the Trepak. As he freezes to death, he dreams of summer fields and [[doves as symbols|doves]].
4. ''The [[Field Marshal]]'' (''Полководец'') (5 June 1877) (in [[E-flat minor]]–[[D minor]])
:The figure of Death is depicted as an officer commanding the dead troops of both armies after a dreadful battle. As the dead troops parade before him, he asserts his enduring remembrance of them all.

==Recordings==

The ''Songs and Dances of Death'' have been recorded by numerous vocalists, including [[Vladimir Rosing]], [[George London (bass-baritone)|George London]],&lt;ref&gt;George London in Concert, VAI Audio VAIA 1030.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferruccio Furlanetto]],&lt;ref&gt;Rachmaninoff Mussorgsky Songs Ferruccio Furlanetto, Igor Tchetuev.

MELODIYA.  MEL 46131-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions by others==
*1882, [[Alexander Glazunov]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]
:The songs were first orchestrated by Glazunov (Nos. 1 and 3) and Rimsky-Korsakov (Nos. 2 and 4) shortly after Mussorgsky's death. They were published in 1882. Mussorgsky had intended to orchestrate the cycle himself but never realised the ambition. In the Glazunov/Rimsky-Korsakov orchestration, 'Trepak' is first.
*1962, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]
:Shostakovich orchestrated the whole cycle for the dedicatee, [[soprano]] [[Galina Vishnevskaya]].  Seven years later, noting that he wanted to continue Mussorgsky's "too short" set of songs, he wrote his [[Symphony No. 14 (Shostakovich)|Fourteenth Symphony]] for soprano, bass and chamber orchestra, adding to the musical gallery of death's appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Volkov, Solomon, ''St. Petersburg: A Cultural History'' (New York: The Free Press, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 1995), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shostakovich orchestration had a substantial influence on many of his later works, and has since been adapted for [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] and [[baritone]] voices.
*1983, [[Edison Denisov]], recorded by [[Yevgeny Nesterenko]] in 1985
*1984, [[Kalevi Aho]]
*1994, [[Ramon Lazkano]] (premiered by Dmitri Hvorostovsky)
*2007, [[Alexander Raskatov|Aleksandr Raskatov]]
*2012, [[Peter Breiner]] in a version for orchestra only, recorded by him and the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]] on [[Naxos]].

The report on ''Standards of Conduct in the International Civil Service'' by the [[International Civil Service Advisory Board]] ([[ICSAB]]), which preceded the ICSC, was highly recognized. Still in 1995, it was referred to as "a classic which still today guides the international official".&lt;ref name="Lemoine1995-p43"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Lemoine|title=The International Civil Servant: An Endangered Species|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOP23OImbC8C&amp;pg=PA43|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=0-7923-3444-2|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ICSC ''Framework for Human Resources Management'', standards for [[ethics|ethical]] conduct "promote common values and define the behaviour and performance expected of international civil servants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilo.org/public/english/ethics/documents/index.htm|title=The ILO's Ethics Office: Key documents|publisher=ILO|date=26 February 2015|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2001 ===
The revised ''Standards of conduct for the international civil service'' of 2001 (“2001 standards”), were drafted under the guidance of Mohsen Bel Hadj Amor, chairman of the ICSC, adopted by the ICSC in 2001 and approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in its resolution 56/244 of 24 December 2001.

The standards of conduct for the international civil service are reflected in the Secretary-General’s bulletin on ''Status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdu.unlb.org/UNStandardsofconduct/PolicyDocuments.aspx|title=UN Standards of Conduct Policy Documents|date=2016|publisher=UN Conduct and Discipline Unit|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bulletin was published with the express purpose of ensuring that all United Nations staff were made aware of the 2001 standards.&lt;ref name="ulb-p2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdu.unlb.org/Portals/0/PdfFiles/PolicyDocB.pdf#page=2|title=ST/SGB/2002/13, Secretary-General’s bulletin: Status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members, p.&amp;nbsp;2|date=2002|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this bulletin, the standards are intended to assist staff members and executive heads of the organizations to understand better the obligations placed on staff conduct by the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]] and the UN Staff Regulations and Rules.&lt;ref name="ulb-p5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdu.unlb.org/Portals/0/PdfFiles/PolicyDocB.pdf#page=5|title=ST/SGB/2002/13, Secretary-General’s bulletin: Status, basic rights and duties of United Nations staff members, p.&amp;nbsp;5|date=2002|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noted that: "The standards of conduct do not have the force of law as they provide a discussion of expected standards to help staff understand their role as international civil servants rather than a set of binding rules."&lt;ref name="ulb-p5"/&gt;

=== 2013 ===
The 2013 edition of the Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service were drafted under the guidance of [[Kingston Papie Rhodes]], chairman of the ICSC, and approved by the UN General Assembly in its resolution 67/257. Rhodes wrote in his foreword to the 2013 standards:
:"Adapted to meet the new challenges of the twenty-first century, the new standards reflect the way in which the world has changed in recent decades and embody the values promoted by the organizations of the United Nations system. These values, which concern [[fundamental human rights]], [[social justice]], the [[dignity]] of the human person and respect for the equal rights of men and women, should inspire and guide international civil servants in their professional activities as well as in their personal conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icsc.un.org/resources/pdfs/general/standardsE.pdf|title=Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service|date=2013|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Staff Regulations of 1 January 2014, in Article 100, state:
:1. In the performance of their duties, the Secretary General and the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any Government or from any other authority external to the Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect on their  position  as  international officials responsible only to the Organization.
:2. Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to respect the exclusively international character of the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the staff and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their responsibilities.

== Microbial syntrophy ==
Syntrophy plays an important role in a large number of microbial processes.

The defining feature of&amp;nbsp;[[ruminant]]s, such as cows and goats, is a stomach called a&amp;nbsp;[[rumen]].&amp;nbsp;The rumen contains billions of microbes, many of which are syntrophic. One excellent example of this syntrophy is&amp;nbsp;[[interspecies hydrogen transfer]]. Some anaerobic fermenting microbes in the rumen (and other gastrointestinal tracts) are capable of degrading organic matter to short chain fatty acids, and hydrogen.&amp;nbsp;The accumulating hydrogen inhibits the microbe's ability to continue degrading organic matter, but syntrophic hydrogen-consuming microbes allow continued growth by metabolizing the waste products.&amp;nbsp;In addition, fermentative bacteria gain maximum energy yield when protons are used as electron acceptor with concurrent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;production.&amp;nbsp;Hydrogen-consuming organisms include methanogens, sulfate-reducers, acetogens, and others.&amp;nbsp;Some fermentation products, such as fatty acids longer than two carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon atom, and branched-chain and aromatic fatty acids, cannot directly be used in methanogenesis. In acetogenesis process, these products are oxidized to acetate and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;by obligated proton reducing bacteria in syntrophic relationship with methanogenic archaea as low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;partial pressure is essential for acetogenic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable (ΔG &lt; 0).&amp;nbsp;(Stams et al., 2005)

The number of bacterial cells that live on or in the human body, for example throughout the alimentary canal and on the skin, is in the region of 10 times the total number of human cells in it.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/microbes-human-body-video_n_4536675.html Crazy Way Microbes Colonize, Control The Human Body] interview with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; These microbes are [[Endosymbiont|vital]], for instance for the digestive and the immune system to function.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;[http://microbiologyonline.org.uk/about-microbiology/microbes-and-the-human-body Microbes and the human body] The Microbiology Society online&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the many organisms that feed on [[faeces]] or dung. A [[cow]] diet consists mainly of grass, the [[cellulose]] of which is transformed into [[lipid]]s by [[micro-organisms]] in the cow's [[large intestine]]. These micro-organisms cannot use the lipids because of lack of [[oxygen]] in the intestine, so the cow does not take up all lipids produced. When the processed grass leaves the intestine as dung and comes into open air, many organisms, such as the [[dung beetle]], feed on it.

Yet another example is the community of micro-organisms in soil that live off leaf litter. Leaves typically last one year and are then replaced by new ones. These micro-organisms mineralize the discarded leaves and release nutrients that are taken up by the plant. Such relationships are called reciprocal syntrophy because the plant lives off the products of micro-organisms. Many&amp;nbsp;[[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]&amp;nbsp;relationships are based on syntrophy.

=== Biodegradation of pollutants ===

Syntrophic microbial food webs can play an integral role in the breakdown of organic pollutants such as oils, aromatic compounds, and amino acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Environmental contamination with oil is of high ecological importance, but can be mediated through syntrophic degradation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Alkanes]]&amp;nbsp;are hydrocarbon chains that are the major chemical component of crude oils, and have been experimentally verified to be broken down by syntrophic microbial food webs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaghan|first=A.

This breakdown is crucial in the processes of&amp;nbsp;[[bioremediation]]&amp;nbsp;and global carbon cycling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Syntrophic microbial communities are key players in the breakdown of&amp;nbsp;[[aromatic compounds]], which are common pollutants.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferry|first=J. G.|last2=Wolfe|first2=R. S.|date=February 1976|title=Anaerobic degradation of benzoate to methane by a microbial consortium|journal=Archives of Microbiology|volume=107|issue=1|pages=33–40|issn=0302-8933|pmid=1252087|doi=10.1007/bf00427864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of aromatic [[Benzoic acid|benzoate]] to [[methane]] produces many intermediate compounds such as [[formate]], [[acetate]], CO2 and H2.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The build up of these products makes benzoate degradation progressively less favourable. These intermediates can then be taken up and metabolized syntrophically by [[methanogens]] to make the whole process more thermodynamically favourable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Studies have shown that bacterial degradation of&amp;nbsp;[[amino acids]]&amp;nbsp;can be significantly enhanced through the process of syntrophy.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zindel|first=U.|last2=Freudenberg|first2=W.|last3=Rieth|first3=M.|last4=Andreesen|first4=J.

These scavengers, like&amp;nbsp;''[[Methanospirillum]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Acetobacterium]],''&amp;nbsp;metabolize the H2 waste produced during amino acid breakdown, preventing a toxic build-up.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another way to improve amino acid breakdown is through interspecies electron transfer mediated by formate. Species like ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'' employ this method.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Metabolic mechanism==
The main motive behind a syntrophic relation between two bacterial organisms is generalized as a relationship where each participant's metabolic activity cannot independently overcome the thermodynamic pressure of the reaction under standard conditions even when a cosubstrate or nutrient is added into the environment. Therefore, the cooperation of the other participant is required to reduce the intermediate pool size.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
The ''Methanobacillus omelianskii'' culture is a classic example in demonstrating how two separate unfavourable reactions can be carried out by syntrophic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Morris|first1= Brandon E.L.|last2 = Henneberger|first2 = Ruth|last3 = Huber|first3 = Harald|last4 = Moissl-Eichinger|first4 = Christine|date = 2013|title = Microbial syntrophy: interaction for the common good|journal = FEMS Microbiol Rev|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 384–406|doi = 10.1111/1574-6976.12019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strain S and strain M.o.H of ''Methanobacillus omelianskii'' oxidize ethanol into acetate and methane by a process called [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]]. Individuals of strain S are observed as obligate anaerobic bacteria that use ethanol as an [[electron donor]], whereas organisms of strain M.o.H are [[methanogens]] that oxidize hydrogen gas to produce methane.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McInerney|first1=Michael J.|last2=Struchtemeyer|first2=Christopher G.|last3=Sieber|first3=Jessica|last4=Mouttaki|first4=Housna|last5=Stams|first5=Alfons J.

:'''Strain M.o.H.:''' 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (ΔG°' = -131 kJ)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Schink|first = B.|date = 1997-06-01|title = Energetics of syntrophic cooperation in methanogenic degradation.|url = http://mmbr.asm.org/content/61/2/262|journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|language = en|volume = 61|issue = 2|pages = 262–280|issn = 1092-2172|pmc = 232610|pmid = 9184013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=Harold L.|last2=Horn|first2=Marcus A.|last3=Wüst|first3=Pia K.|title=Intermediary ecosystem metabolism as a main driver of methanogenesis in acidic wetland soil|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2009.00050.x/full|website=Environmental Microbiology Reports|pages=307–318|language=en|doi=10.1111/j.1758-2229.2009.00050.x|date=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Complex organic compounds such as ethanol, propionate, butyrate, and lactate cannot be directly used as substrates for methanogenesis by methanogens. On the other hand, [[fermentation]] of these organic compounds cannot occur in fermenting microorganisms unless the hydrogen concentration is reduced to a low level by the methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stams|first1=Alfons J. M.|last2=De Bok|first2=Frank A. M.|last3=Plugge|first3=Caroline M.|last4=Van Eekert|first4=Miriam H.

'''''The Dead Bird''''' is a children's book by [[Margaret Wise Brown]]. Brown's text copyright was 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Margaret Wise|authorlink=Margaret Wise Brown|title=The Dead Bird|year=1958|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-020758-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not published until 1958 (by Addison-Wesley Publishing) with illustrations by [[Remy Charlip]]; this was after Brown's 1952 death. The story was reissued in 2016 with new illustrations by [[Christian Robinson]].&lt;ref name="Gershowitz"&gt;The Dead Bird.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">'''Trading Blows'', or'' Trading licks'', or '''- blows, - shots'', etc., is an endurance test in which the participants (usually two [[boy]]s or young men) take turns, alternating between administering a blow to an opponent and assuming the agreed exposed position (e.g. bending over an object or grabbing the ankles) to endure the next one, using the same implement (e.g. a [[fraternity paddle]]), until only the winner can still bring himself to endure the gradually increasing pain in the progressively tormented target part of their anatomy (usually the posterior, in which case it is a form of [[spanking]], or the cheeks), which in the interest of fairness should be either bared or only covered by a common uniform. As the blows are not given by the same person but by the parties themselves, the strongest-armed one actually has an unfair (but not always decisive) physical advantage.

Such rather [[macho]] displays of willpower, restraining the instinct to avoid pain, can serve various purposes, including:
*a [[physical punishment]], especially for quarreling, possibly the origin of the practice (this ritualized alternative to a more disabling or even lethal [[duel]] should also make its participants realize the futility of physical aggression)
*a motivation test, especially as part of an initiation process, such as [[hazing]]
*an obedience test, as in certain [[Paddle (spanking)|paddle game]]s (possibly really an excuse for the rather sadistic amusement of the seniors)
*a duel, either personal or as champions representing similar, especially rivaling, groups; in certain fraternities, refusing such a challenge may result in exclusion from the membership, even for an alumnus
*as a game, either to 'proudly' display one's tenacity (often to impress some audience) or in the pursuit of a sadist and/or masochistic, erotic or pain-addicted, kick.
*as a [[sexual fetish]]

Another game with the same name is often played among boys or young men, where two people agree on a place to hit the other (e.g. the shoulder or chest) and the two take turns trading punches until one person cannot stand the pain any longer. The first person to give up is the loser.

'''Tugstumur Khan''' (1342 - 1388), the brother of [[Biligtü Khan Ayushiridara|Ayurshirdara Khan]] and son of [[Toghon Temür|Togoontumur Khan]], was a [[Khan (title)#Ruling Khans|Khanate ruler]] in the late [[14th century]]. He was [[murder]]ed by poison after a ten year rule.

==Career==
Tugstumur Khan ascended the [[throne]] in 1378 during a tumultuous period between [[Mongolia]] and [[China]]. Tugstumur took the title Uskhal and instituted negotiations and [[military exercise]]s to foster unity among the Mongolian provinces. Intent on increasing the size of his military, Tugstumur Uskhal recruited soldiers from [[Karakhorum]] and [[Incheon]] to prepare for operations in China.

The Chinese government also escalated their military preparations. In 1380 the Chinese sent soldiers to maneuver along the border and to penetrate into Mongolia. Under the guidance of general Mu-In, Chinese divisions invaded Mongolia. Light [[cavalry]] successfully occupied Karakhorum, ravaged several provinces, and took many Mongolians prisoner. At that time, Tugstumur Khan had based his center of operations in Incheon. He ordered Mongolian commanders Ulzibukh and Narbukh to attack Luleen in the eastern part of China’s Khebei province, where they [[assassination|assassinated]] China’s Lyu-Guan, a military commander of the Min state.

In 1381, the Min State retaliated. Under the leadership of commander Cyuie-Da, Chinese forces penetrated Chiphen. During the following six years (1382-1387), Mongolia and China rested from wartime antagonism and retribution, and the Min state maneuvered into position. In 1384 the [[Goryeo|Gaoli]] state submitted to the [[Min Empire]] and severed their [[diplomatic relations]] with Mongolia. Nagachug, a relative of Mukhulai (son-in-law or aristocrats), controlled numerous forces and occupied the land to intimidate the Gaoli state and maneuver into their territory.

The Min state was wary of possible unity between Tugstumur Khan and Nagachug. Min was concerned that such a unity could potentially overcome Min military forces. Therefore, Min decided to focus his efforts on the annihilation of Nagachug's armies. By 1387, the Min state had concentrated its forces in Lyaodun to destroy commander Nagachug’s military forces in the Yuan state.  In 1384, two thousand Chinese soldiers under the command of Phen Shen fought against Nagachug’s armies; both sides suffered severe casualties. However, Chinese forces had succeeded in gaining better [[battlefield]] position, and Nagachug’s armies, finding themselves in a hopeless situation, [[Surrender (military)|surrendered]].

Subsequently, the Min state began to position its main forces against Tugstumur Khan. By the spring of 1388, Mongolia and Min engaged in a campaign that ended Tumgstumur's ambitions for control of Min China. Suffering a terrible defeat, Tugstumur Khan, his eldest son, associated dignitaries, and a few surviving soldiers were forced to retreat toward Kharkhorum. Tugstumur's second son was captured along with Tugstumur's leading [[Minister (government)|minister]] and lords. In all, the Chinese took nearly three thousand people prisoner and over one hundred fifty thousand head of cattle as [[war prize]]s.

When Tugstumur Khan reached the [[Tuul River]], he was attacked by Esunder, lord of the Argbukh origin. Conscious of the weakness in his military force, Tugstumur Khan set out to unite with the armies of commander Markhas. Unfortunately, a three-day snowstorm barred Tugstumur Khan's advance. Ultimately, Esunder dispatched a courier to capture Tugstumur Khan. The courier [[poisoning|poisoned]] Tugstumur Khan in 1388.

'''Unsinkable Sam''' (also known as '''Oskar''' or '''Oscar''') is the nickname of a real or fictitious cat, reportedly in service as a [[ship's cat]] during [[World War II]] both in the [[Kriegsmarine]] and the [[Royal Navy]], surviving the sinking of three ships in total.

==History==
The cat's original name is unknown.  The name "Oscar" was given by the crew of the  British destroyer [[HMS Cossack (F03)|HMS ''Cossack'']] that rescued him from the sea following the sinking of the German battleship  [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].  "Oscar" was derived from the [[International Code of Signals]] for the letter 'O', which is code for "[[Man overboard|Man '''O'''verboard]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butkus|first1=Venantas|title=The fame of ships’ cats|url=http://jura.diena.lt/en/news/other/the-fame-of-ships-cats-362825|website=jura.diena.lt|accessdate=25 June 2017|date=8 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011130314/http://jura.diena.lt/en/news/other/the-fame-of-ships-cats-362825|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the German spelling, "Oskar", was sometimes used since he was a "German" cat).

===Bismarck===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-04-1-26, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'']]

The black and white patched cat was supposedly owned by an unknown crewman of the German battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] &lt;ref name="100 cats"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and was on board the ship on 18 May 1941 when she set sail on [[Operation Rheinübung |Operation ''Rheinübung'']] (German for  Rhine Exercise), ''Bismarck'''s only mission. ''Bismarck'' was [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|sunk after a fierce sea-battle]] on 27 May, from which only 115 from her crew of over 2,100 survived. Hours later, Oscar was found floating on a board and picked from the water by the British destroyer [[HMS Cossack (F03)|HMS ''Cossack'']].&lt;ref name=pie&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piekałkiewicz|first1=Janusz|title=Sea War 1939-1945|date=1987|publisher=Blandford|isbn=0713716657|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15197891|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142}} Unaware of what his name had been on ''Bismarck'', the crew of ''Cossack'' named their new mascot "Oscar".&lt;ref name=pie/&gt;{{rp|142}}

===HMS Cossack===
[[File:HMS Cossack.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Cossack'']]

The cat served on board ''Cossack'' for the next few months as the ship carried out convoy escort duties in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and north [[Atlantic Ocean]]. On 24 October 1941, ''Cossack'' was escorting a convoy from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Great Britain]] when she was severely damaged by a [[torpedo]] fired by the {{GS|U-563||6}}.&lt;ref name=pie/&gt;{{rp|170}} Crew were transferred to the destroyer {{HMS|Legion|G74|6}}, and an attempt was made to tow the badly listing ''Cossack'' back to Gibraltar. However, worsening weather conditions meant the task became impossible and had to be abandoned. On 27 October, a day after the tow was slipped, ''Cossack'' sank to the west of Gibraltar. The initial explosion had blown off one third of the forward section of the ship, killing 159 of the crew, but Oscar survived this too and was brought to the shore establishment in Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=pie/&gt;{{rp|170}}

===HMS Ark Royal===
[[File:HMS Ark Royal sinking.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Ark Royal'' sinking.]]

Now nicknamed "Unsinkable Sam", the cat was soon transferred to the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}, which coincidentally had been instrumental in the destruction of ''Bismarck'' (along with ''Cossack''). However, Sam was to find no more luck there, and when returning from [[Malta]] on 14 November 1941 this ship too was torpedoed, this time by {{GS|U-81|1941|2}}. Attempts were also made to tow ''Ark Royal'' to Gibraltar, but the unstoppable inflow of water made the task futile. The carrier rolled over and sank 30 miles from Gibraltar. The slow rate at which the ship sank meant that all but one of the crew could be saved. The survivors, including Sam, who had been found clinging to a floating plank by a [[motor launch]]&lt;ref name=iwm&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; were transferred to [[HMS Lightning (G55)|HMS ''Lightning'']] and the same [[HMS Legion (G74)|HMS ''Legion'']] which had rescued the crew of ''Cossack''. ''Legion'' would itself be sunk in 1942, and ''Lightning'' in 1943.

The loss of ''Ark Royal'' proved the end of Sam's shipborne career. He was transferred first to the offices of the [[Governor of Gibraltar]] and then sent back to the United Kingdom, where he saw out the remainder of the war living in a seaman's home in [[Belfast]] called the "Home for Sailors".&lt;ref name=pie/&gt;{{rp|173}} Sam died in 1955.{{cn|date=June 2017}} A pastel portrait of Sam (titled ''Oscar, the Bismarck's Cat'') by the artist Georgina Shaw-Baker is in the possession of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in Greenwich.&lt;ref name=iwm/&gt;

==Existence==
Some authorities question whether Oskar/Sam's biography might be a "[[Nautical fiction|sea story]]", because – for example – there are pictures of two different cats identified as Oskar/Sam. The sinking of ''Bismarck'' and rescue of a limited number of survivors took place in desperate conditions; British ships were ordered not to stop as there was believed to be a [[U-boat]] in the area, and many survivors were left to die of exposure. Pointedly, there is no mention of this incident in [[Ludovic Kennedy]]'s detailed account of the sinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Ludovic|title=Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the Bismarck|date=2001|publisher=Cassell &amp; Co|isbn=0304355267|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45828404|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that information later gleaned from sailors regarding the cat's true service were [[wiktionary:apocryphal|apocryphal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Georgina Shaw|title=Item #PAJ2744: ''Oscar, Cat From the German Battleship Bismarck'' – Private Collections of the National Maritime Museum|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/203480.html|website=Royal Museums Greenwich|location=London, UK|format=Framed drawing in pastel, 785 × 610 mm|quote=Some doubt has been cast on Oscar's origins on the ''Bismarck'' both for practical reasons, including there being no survivor account of him there, and because two contradictory photos exist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[machine learning|In machine learning]], the '''vanishing gradient problem''' is a difficulty found in training [[artificial neural network]]s with [[Stochastic gradient descent|gradient-based learning methods]] and [[backpropagation]]. In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the [[partial derivative]] of the [[error function]] with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network from further training. As one example of the problem cause, traditional [[activation function]]s such as the [[hyperbolic tangent]] function have gradients in the range {{math|(0, 1)}}, and backpropagation computes gradients by the [[chain rule]]. This has the effect of multiplying {{mvar|n}} of these small numbers to compute gradients of the "front" layers in an {{mvar|n}}-layer network, meaning that the gradient (error signal) decreases exponentially with {{mvar|n}} while the front layers train very slowly.

Back-propagation allowed researchers to train [[Supervised learning|supervised]] deep artificial neural networks from scratch, initially with little success. [[Sepp Hochreiter|Hochreiter]]'s diploma thesis of 1991&lt;ref&gt;[[Sepp Hochreiter|S. Hochreiter]]. Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen Netzen. Diploma thesis, Institut f. Informatik, Technische Univ. Munich, 1991. Advisor: [[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sepp Hochreiter|S. Hochreiter]], Y. Bengio, P. Frasconi, and [[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J.

IEEE Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; formally identified the reason for this failure in the "vanishing gradient problem", which not only affects [[Deep learning|many-layered]] [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward networks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goh|first=Garrett B.|last2=Hodas|first2=Nathan O.|last3=Vishnu|first3=Abhinav|date=2017-06-15|title=Deep learning for computational chemistry|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.24764/abstract|journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry|language=en|volume=38|issue=16|pages=1291–1307|doi=10.1002/jcc.24764|pmid=28272810|arxiv=1701.04503}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[recurrent neural network|recurrent network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Pascanu|first=Razvan|last2=Mikolov|first2=Tomas|last3=Bengio|first3=Yoshua|date=2012-11-21|title=On the difficulty of training Recurrent Neural Networks|eprint=1211.5063|class=cs.LG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are trained by unfolding them into very deep feedforward networks, where a new layer is created for each time step of an input sequence processed by the network.

When activation functions are used whose derivatives can take on larger values, one risks encountering the related '''exploding gradient problem'''.

=== Multi-level hierarchy ===
To overcome this problem, several methods were proposed. One is [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]'s  multi-level hierarchy of networks (1992) pre-trained one level at a time through [[unsupervised learning]], fine-tuned through [[backpropagation]].&lt;ref name="SCHMID1992"&gt;J. Schmidhuber., "Learning complex, extended sequences using the principle of history compression," ''Neural Computation'', 4, pp. 234–242, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Here each level learns a compressed representation of the observations that is fed to the next level.

==== Related approach ====
Similar ideas have been used in feed-forward neural network for unsupervised pre-training to structure a neural network, making it first learn generally useful [[feature detection (nervous system)|feature detectors]]. Then the network is trained further by supervised [[back-propagation]] to classify labeled data. The [[deep belief network]] model by Hinton et al. (2006) involves learning the distribution of a high level representation using successive layers of binary or real-valued  [[latent variable]]s. It uses a [[restricted Boltzmann machine]] to model each new layer of higher level features. Each new layer guarantees an increase on the [[Lower bound|lower-bound]] of the [[log likelihood]] of the data, thus improving the model, if trained properly. Once sufficiently many layers have been learned the deep architecture may be used as a [[generative model]] by reproducing the data when sampling down the model (an "ancestral pass") from the top level feature activations.&lt;ref name="hinton2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Osindero|first2=S.|last3=Teh|first3=Y.|year=2006|title=A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/fastnc.pdf|journal=[[Neural Computation (journal)|Neural Computation]]|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1527–1554|doi=10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527|pmid=16764513|last1=Hinton|first1=G. E.|authorlink1=Geoffrey Hinton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hinton reports that his models are effective feature extractors over high-dimensional, structured data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2009|title=Deep belief networks|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks|journal=Scholarpedia|volume=4|issue=5|pages=5947|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.5947|pmc=|pmid=|last1=Hinton|first1=G.|bibcode=2009SchpJ...4.5947H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work played a key role in reintroducing interest in deep neural network research and consequently led to the developments of [[Deep learning]], although deep belief network is no longer the primary deep learning technique.

Another technique particularly used for [[recurrent neural network]]s is the [[long short-term memory]] (LSTM) network of 1997 by [[Sepp Hochreiter|Hochreiter]] &amp; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber|Schmidhuber]].&lt;ref name=lstm&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hochreiter | first1 = Sepp | authorlink = Sepp Hochreiter | authorlink2 = Jürgen Schmidhuber | last2 = Schmidhuber | first2 = Jürgen | year = 1997 | title = Long Short-Term Memory | url = | journal = Neural Computation | volume = 9 | issue = 8| pages = 1735–1780 | doi=10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735 | pmid=9377276}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, deep multidimensional LSTM networks demonstrated the power of deep learning with many nonlinear layers, by winning three [[ICDAR]] 2009 competitions in connected [[handwriting recognition]], without any prior knowledge about the three different languages to be learned.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Alex; and Schmidhuber, Jürgen; ''Offline Handwriting Recognition with Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks'', in Bengio, Yoshua; Schuurmans, Dale; Lafferty, John; Williams, Chris K.

===Faster hardware===
Hardware advances have meant that from 1991 to 2015, computer power (especially as delivered by [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPUs]]) has increased around a million-fold, making standard backpropagation feasible for networks several layers deeper than when the vanishing gradient problem was recognized. Schmidhuber notes that this "is basically what is winning many of the image recognition competitions now", but that it "does not really
overcome the problem in a fundamental way"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidhuber |first=Jürgen |title=Deep learning in neural networks: An overview |journal=Neural Networks |volume=61 |year=2015 |pages=85–117 |arxiv=1404.7828 |doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003|pmid=25462637 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since the original models tackling the vanishing gradient problem by Hinton et al. (2006) were trained in a [[Xeon|Xeon processor]], not GPUs.&lt;ref name="hinton2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Osindero|first2=S.|last3=Teh|first3=Y.|year=2006|title=A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets|url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/fastnc.pdf|journal=[[Neural Computation (journal)|Neural Computation]]|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1527–1554|doi=10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527|pmid=16764513|last1=Hinton|first1=G. E.|authorlink1=Geoffrey Hinton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residual networks ===
One of the newest and most effective ways to resolve the vanishing gradient problem is with residual neural networks, ResNets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.init.ai/residual-neural-networks-are-an-exciting-area-of-deep-learning-research-acf14f4912e9|title=Residual neural networks are an exciting area of deep learning research|date=28 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with recurrent neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/servite/2010/rnnlm_mikolov.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted prior to ResNets that a deeper network would actually have higher ''training'' error than the shallow network. This intuitively can be understood as data disappearing through too many layers of the network, meaning output from a shallow layer was diminished through the greater number of layers in the deeper network, yielding a worse result. Going with this intuitive hypothesis, Microsoft research found that splitting a deep network into three layer chunks and passing the input into each chunk straight through to the next chunk, along with the residual-output of the chunk minus the input to the chunk that is reintroduced, helped eliminate much of this disappearing signal problem.{{clarify |date=October 2018 |reason= needs to be explained carefully}} No extra parameters or changes to the learning algorithm were needed. ResNets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32|title=ResNets, HighwayNets, and DenseNets, Oh My! – Chatbot’s Life|date=14 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; yielded lower training error (and test error) than their shallower counterparts simply by reintroducing outputs from shallower layers in the network to compensate for the vanishing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |title=Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition|eprint=1512.03385|author1=He|first1=Kaiming|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiangyu|last3=Ren|first3=Shaoqing|last4=Sun|first4=Jian|year=2015|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that ResNets are an ensemble of relatively shallow Nets and do not resolve the vanishing gradient problem by preserving gradient flow throughout the entire depth of the network – rather, they avoid the problem simply by constructing ensembles of many short networks together. (Ensemble by Construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Veit|first=Andreas|last2=Wilber|first2=Michael|last3=Belongie|first3=Serge|date=2016-05-20|title=Residual Networks Behave Like Ensembles of Relatively Shallow Networks|eprint=1605.06431|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Other activation functions ===
[[Rectifier (neural networks)|Rectifiers]] such as ReLU suffer less from the vanishing gradient problem, because they only saturate in one direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glorot|first=Xavier|last2=Bordes|first2=Antoine|last3=Bengio|first3=Yoshua|date=2011-06-14|title=Deep Sparse Rectifier Neural Networks|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/glorot11a.html|journal=PMLR|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Behnke relied only on the sign of the gradient ([[Rprop]]) when training his [[Neural Abstraction Pyramid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/books/LNCS2766.pdf|title=Hierarchical Neural Networks for Image Interpretation.|publisher=Springer|year=2003|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=2766|author=Sven Behnke}}&lt;/ref&gt; to solve problems like image reconstruction and face localization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Neural networks can also be optimized by using a universal search algorithm on the space of neural network's weights, e.g.,  [[random guess]] or more systematically [[genetic algorithm]]. This approach is not based on gradient and avoids the vanishing gradient problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/fundamentaldeeplearningproblem.html|title=Sepp Hochreiter's Fundamental Deep Learning Problem (1991)|website=people.idsia.ch|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Unek''' (1929-February 21, 1957) was an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[police]] [[constable]] and [[mass murder]]er who killed a total of 57 people in two separate [[spree killer|spree killings]] three years apart.

==Murder sprees==
Unek worked as Police Constable or Police soldier in the Belgian Congo. His first murder spree occurred near [[Ituri Interim Administration|Mahagi]], [[Belgian Congo]] on January 1, 1954, where he killed 21 people and wounded many more with an [[axe]] in less than an hour and a half, before escaping and finally ending up in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Tanganyika Territory]], where he assumed a false identity, found work and began a new life.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' (March 28, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently because of social misunderstandings with his boss,&lt;ref&gt;Madulu, Ndalahwa F.: [http://www.tzonline.org/pdf/changinglifestyles.pdf Changing Lifestyles in Farming Societies of Sukumaland: Kwimba District, Tanzania]; [[Afrika-Studiecentrum, Leiden]] (1998) (p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; Unek went on a second rampage which began in the early hours of February 11, 1957. Armed with a stolen [[Lee-Enfield|Enfield-type]] police rifle, 50 rounds of ammunition, and an axe, he started killing people in the area of [[Shinyanga Region|Malampaka]], a village about 40 miles southeast of [[Mwanza]]. He broke into several houses and shot anyone he saw inside.

Within twelve hours, Unek shot dead ten men, eight women, and eight children, murdered five more men with the axe, stabbed another one, burned two women and a child by trapping them in their house and setting it on fire, and strangled a 15-year-old girl, thus killing a total of 36 people.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;African killer still at large, ''[[The Times]]'' (February 16, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/41193/supplements/5818|title= Supplement to the London Gazette|publisher=''[[London Gazette]]''|date=October 4, 1957|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1957/02/17/archives/berserk-slayer-of-36-sought.html Berserk Slayer of 36 Sought], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (February 17, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; He then changed out of his [[police]] [[uniform]] into clothes stolen from one of his victims and fled. Among the dead was reportedly his own wife, whom he killed in their hut before setting it on fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/freepress19570301-1.2.42|title=A place where no vulture fly|publisher=''[[The Singapore Free Press]]''|date=March 1, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the wife of a police sergeant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5ukxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wuIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6378,2802102&amp;dq= 32nd slaying], ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'' (February 14, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manhunt and death==
For nine days, Unek was sought by [[Wasukuma]] tribesmen, police, and eventually a company of the [[King's African Rifles]] in Tanganyika's greatest manhunt up to that time.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Page/straitstimes19570221-1.1.3|title=Mass Killer Caught|publisher=''[[The Straits Times]]''|date=February 21, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the extensive search operation, including dogs and aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/reinhart-brot/clipnumber/25516/ Constable Runs Amok In Africa, Kills 32], ''[[Corpus Christi Caller-Times|Corpus Christi Times]]'' (February 14, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; and a posted reward of $350,&lt;ref&gt;Murders 32, ''[[Greensburg Daily News]]'' (February 13, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; Unek eluded his pursuers until he finally showed up at the house of Iyumbu ben Ikumbu, who lived only two miles away from Malampaka, in search for food. When Iyumbu reported the incident to police, he was asked to keep Unek with him and notify them, should the killer come again to his home. Unek, still armed, reappeared at about 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the next day. Iyumbu, sending his wife to police, gave Unek food and engaged in a conversation with him for nearly two hours until help arrived. At that point, Iyumbu ran out of his house whereupon a [[Superintendent (police)|Police Superintendent]] threw a [[smoke bomb]], setting the house on fire. Unek, severely injured when attempting to evade capture, later succumbed to his wounds in hospital.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/reinhart-brot/clipnumber/25517/ Greatest Murderer In Criminal History], ''[[Lethbridge Herald]]'' (March 30, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; Iyumbu later received a financial reward of £125,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wK0qAAAAMAAJ Reward for Courage], ''East Africa and Rhodesia'', Volume 33; London, (March 21, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[British Empire Medal]] for his bravery leading to the capture of the constable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h64qAAAAMAAJ George Medal for African Constable], ''East Africa And Rhodesia'', Volume 34; London, (October 24, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E7gDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23 A Royal Reward], ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' (January 9, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
As response to the murders, a fund was created to help the descendants of those killed&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;id=wK0qAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22mad+police%22#search_anchor News Items in Brief]; East Africa and Rhodesia, Volume 33; London, (April 25, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; and a maternity clinic was built as a memorial for Unek's victims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=8a0hUJyoIuaP4gSLxICwBA&amp;hl=de&amp;id=AgILAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Constable+William%22 Annual Report of the Provincial Commissioners for the year 1958]; Government Printer, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
