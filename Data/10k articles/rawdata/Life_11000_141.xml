{{medical citations needed|date=October 2014}}
'''Anti-aging supplements''' are a set of products that often include powdered supplements, skin creams, [[vitamin]]s, and [[facial mask]]s. They are designed to reduce or diminish the effects of [[aging]]. Many products seek to hide the effects of aging while others claim to alter the body's chemical balances to slow the physical effects of aging. A comprehensive grading scale for anti-aging of the [[skin]] has been validated and categorizes skin aging as: laxity (sagging), rhytids ([[wrinkle]]s), and the various categories of [[photoaging]], including [[erythema]] (redness), dyspigmentation (brown discolorations), [[solar elastosis]] (yellowing), [[keratoses]] (abnormal growths), and poor texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alexiades-Armenakas MR | title = The spectrum of laser skin resurfacing: Nonablative, fractional, and ablative laser resurfacing | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | date = 2008 | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 719–737| pmid = 18423256 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2008.01.003 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite great demand, many such products and treatments have not been proven to give lasting or major positive effects. One study found that the best performing creams reduced wrinkles by less than 10% over 12 weeks which is not noticeable to the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/cosmetics/wrinkle-creams/wrinkle-creams-1-07/overview/0107_cream_ov_1.htm |title=Wrinkle creams - Consumer Reports Health |publisher=Consumerreports.org |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that cheap moisturizers were as effective as high-priced anti-wrinkle creams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/reviews-ns/anti-wrinkle-eye-creams/index.jsp |title=Anti-wrinkle eye creams - Archive - Which?

Traditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4433343.stm |title=Drawing a line under men's wrinkles |publisher=BBC News Magazine |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skepticism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
The belief in the benefits of anti-aging creams, along with their use, should be met with skepticism.  Nearly every brand and type delivers information about the product being “scientifically tested” or “scientifically proven” however, the results of these studies are rarely made available to consumers.  This suggests that the legitimacy of these studies and subsequent results are highly questionable.

Aging is a natural process which is accompanied by normal physical, chemical, and biological changes in the body.  These changes include facial and body wrinkling of the skin and this process is common to all human beings.  To believe so easily that a cream could prevent and/or reduce the process of skin aging all on its own does not fit with how the world really works.  If this problem had such a simple solution, individuals (including our ancestors) would likely have perfect complexions free of age-related problems.  Similarly, if the solution to anti-aging was so easy for us to attain, there would be no need for hundreds or thousands of products on the commercial market which provide similar claims yet produce products with differing ingredients.

Theoretically, cosmetics promise to alter or “enhance” function, however they do not change any cellular or biochemical reactions or processes within the skin.  Secondly, these products and chemicals are unregulated by any governing body, thus allowing potentially dangerous or harmful ingredients to be added with the promise of results.  Before blindly accepting that certain chemicals cause anti-aging results, it is necessary to do research to determine the safety of these products.

== Ingredients ==

As well as more conventional moisturizing ingredients, anti-aging creams usually contain anti-aging ingredients such as:

* [[Retinoid]]s (for instance, in the form of [[retinyl palmitate]]). In various formulations it has been shown to reduce fine lines and pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/143/5/606 |title=Archderm.ama-assn.org |doi=10.1001/archderm.143.5.606 |publisher=Archderm.ama-assn.org |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Epidermal growth factor]], a 53 amino acid protein. In various research, epidermal growth factor has been shown to reduce fine lines, wrinkles and sagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Controlled-release of epidermal growth factor from cationized gelatin hydrogel enhances corneal epithelial wound healing| journal = Journal of Controlled Release |date=April 2007 | pages = 169–176|doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.12.011 |volume=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=none| journal = Journal of Burn Care and Rehabilitation |date=March–April 2002 | pages = 116–125}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=none| journal = Journal of Dermatologic Surgery and Oncology |date=July 1992 | pages = 604–606 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.1992.tb03514.x |volume=18}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has healing (wounds and burns) and anti-inflammatory properties when applied to skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=none| journal = [[Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology]] |date=January–April 1999 | pages = 79–84}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Fatty acid]]s are often added and derived from naturally occurring substances such as sandalwood, barley, and Phellodendron bark, which are designed to maintain skin moisture and seal in other moisturizing agents within the cream.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Alpha hydroxy acid]]s (AHAs) and [[beta hydroxy acid]]s or other [[chemical peels]]. These help to dissolve the intracellular "glue" that holds the dead cells together on the skin. The use of this type of product on a daily basis gradually enhances the [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]] of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. This exposes newer skin cells and can help improve appearance.  AHAs may irritate some skin, causing redness and flaking.
* [[Peptides]], such as [[acetyl hexapeptide-3]] (Argireline), Matryxil, and [[Copper peptide GHK-Cu|copper peptides]].
* [[Coenzyme Q10]] --&gt; MitoQ
* [[Anti-oxidants]] are substances that may protect cells from the damage caused by [[free radical]]s.
* [[Sunscreens]]. A high level of [[Ultraviolet A|UVA]] protection is recommended as UVA radiation is associated with aging effects such as wrinkles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skincancer.org/sunscreens-explained.html |title=Sunscreens Explained |publisher=SkinCancer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vitamin C]]

The effects of these ingredients depend on their concentration and mode of application. Many skin care companies recommend using a treatment program which may combine these ingredients. For example, AHAs can make the skin more vulnerable to damage from the sun, so the increased use of sunscreens is often recommended.

'''William Claude Rains''' (10 November 1889{{Spaced ndash}}30 May 1967) was an English–American film and stage actor whose career spanned several decades. After his American film debut as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Dr. Jack Griffin]] in ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933) he appeared in classic films such as ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938), ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[Kings Row]]'' (both 1942), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962).

He was a [[Tony Award]] winning actor and was a four-time nominee for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Rains was considered to be "one of the screen's great character stars"&lt;ref name="McFarlane"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarlane|first=Brian|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/546482/|title=Rains, Claude (1889-1967)|publisher=BFI screenoline|accessdate=30 December 2015}} From McFarlane's ''Encyclopedia of British Film'', London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p.545&lt;/ref&gt; who was, according to the ''All-Movie Guide'', "at his best when playing cultured villains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Hal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/58546/Claude-Rains/biography|title=Claude Rains|publisher=The New York Times/All-Movie Guide|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lengthy career, he was greatly admired by many of his contemporaries, such as [[Bette Davis]], [[Vincent Sherman]], [[Ronald Neame]] and [[Albert Dekker]], all of whom became close family friends. Rains also inspired many younger actors, such as [[John Gielgud]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Richard Chamberlain]].

==Early life==
William Claude Rains was born on 10 November 1889 in [[Camberwell]], [[London]]. His parents were Emily Eliza ([[née]] Cox) and the stage actor [[Fred Rains|Frederick William Rains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_mUJebJ4uwC&amp;pg=PA181 |title=International Stars at War|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in the slums of London, and, in his own words, on "the wrong side of the river Thames"&lt;ref name="Soister pg.1"&gt;Soistee pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Rains was one of twelve children, all but three dying of malnutrition when still infants. His mother took in boarders in order to support the family. According to his daughter, Jessica Rains, he grew up with "a very serious [[Cockney accent]] and a [[speech impediment]]"&lt;ref name="Harmetz p. 147"&gt;Harmetz p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; which took the form of a stutter, causing him to call himself "Willie Wains"; she speaks of this in an interview on the 2004 DVD release of [[Universal Studio]]'s [[Phantom of the Opera I]], recorded in 2000. His accent was so strong that his daughter could not understand a word he said when he used it to sing old Cockney songs to her or purposely used it to playfully annoy her. Rains left school after the second grade to sell papers so that he could bring the pennies and halfpennies home for his mother. He sang in the Palm Street Church choir, which also brought him a few pence to take home.
[[File:Captain Claude Rains.jpg|thumb|left|Rains in his captain's uniform during the First World War]]

Because his father was an actor, the young Rains would spend time in theatres and was surrounded by actors and stagehands. It was here where he could watch actors up close as well as the day-to-day running of a theatre. Rains made his stage debut at the age of 10 in the play ''Sweet Nell of Old Drury''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meredy.com/clauderains/cr-bio.html |publisher=meredy.com |title=The Sublime Claude Rains |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], so that he could run around onstage as part of the production. He then slowly worked his way up in the theatre, becoming a [[call boy (theatre)|call boy]] (telling actors when they were due on stage) at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] and later prompter, stage manager, understudy, and then moving on from smaller parts with good reviews to larger, better parts. [[File:Actor, Claude Rains aged 23.jpg|thumb|right|A 23-year-old Rains in one of his early theatre roles, 1912]]

Rains decided to go to America in 1913 due to the opportunities that were being offered in the New York theatres; but with the outbreak of World War{{nbsp}}I the following year, he returned to England to serve in the [[London Scottish Regiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonscottishregt.org|title=Welcome to The London Scottish Regiment Website|author=Default Admin User|work=londonscottishregt.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412093636/http://www.londonscottishregt.org/|archivedate=12 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside fellow actors [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Ronald Colman]], and [[Herbert Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|date=2013|title=Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914|publisher=William Collins|isbn=978-0-007-51974-3|page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, he was involved in a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas attack]] which resulted in his losing 90 percent of the vision in his right eye permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/claude-rains/26063/remembering-claude-rains|title=Remembering Claude Rains|work=Den of Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, he had risen from the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]] to that of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].

After the war ended, Rains remained in England, where he continued to develop his acting talents. These talents were recognised by Sir [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], the founder of the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]. Tree told Rains that in order to succeed as an actor he would have to get rid of his Cockney accent and speech impediment. With this in mind, Tree paid for the [[elocution]] books and lessons that Rains needed to help him change his voice. Rains eventually shed his accent and speech impediment after practicing every day. His daughter Jessica, when describing her father's voice, said, "The interesting thing to me was that he became a different person. He became a very elegant man, with a really extraordinary [[Mid-Atlantic accent]]. It was 'his' voice, nobody else spoke like that, half American, half English and a little Cockney thrown in." Jessica Rains speaks of this in the interview on [[Universal Studio]]'s 2004 DVD release of [[Phantom of the Opera]], recorded in 2000. Soon after changing his accent he became recognised as one of the leading stage actors in London. At the age of 29, he played the role of Clarkis in his one (and only) silent film, a British film titled ''[[Build Thy House]]'' (1920).

During his early years, Rains also taught at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts]] (RADA), where [[John Gielgud]] and [[Charles Laughton]] were some of his students. In an interview for [[Turner Classic Movies]], Gielgud fondly remembered Rains: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I learnt a great deal about acting from this gentleman. Claude Rains was one of my teachers at RADA. In fact he was one of the best and most popular teachers there. He was extremely attractive and needless to say, all the girls in my class were hopelessly in love with him. He had piercing dark eyes and a beautifully throaty voice, although he had, like [[Marlene Dietrich]], some trouble with the letter 'R'. He lacked inches and wore lifts to his shoes to increase his height. Stocky but handsome, Rains had broad shoulders and a mop of thick brown hair which he brushed over one eye. But by the time I first met him in the 1920s he was already much in demand as a character actor in London. I found him enormously helpful and encouraging to work with. I was always trying to copy him in my first years as an actor, until I decided to imitate [[Noël Coward]] instead.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
Rains began his career in London theatre, achieving success in the title role of [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater's]] play ''Ulysses S. Grant'', the follow-up to the same playwright's ''[[Abraham Lincoln (play)|Abraham Lincoln]]''. He also portrayed Faulkland in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''The Rivals'', presented at London's Lyric Theatre in 1925. Rains returned to New York in 1927 to appear in what would be nearly 20 Broadway roles. He moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the late 1920s to act in leading roles in such plays as [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' and the dramatisations of ''[[The Constant Nymph (novel)|The Constant Nymph]]'' and [[Pearl S. Buck]]'s novel ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (as a Chinese farmer).

Although he had played the single supporting role in the silent, ''[[Build Thy House]]'' (1920),&lt;ref name="McFarlane"/&gt; Rains came relatively late to film acting and while working for the [[Theatre Guild]], he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. His screen test for ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'' (1932) for a New York representative of [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] was a failure but, according to some accounts, led to his being cast in the title role of [[James Whale]]'s ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933) after his screen test and unique voice was inadvertently overheard from the next room.&lt;ref name="Harmetz p. 147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wut4jYBtUdsC&amp;pg=PA102 ''Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946''], Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2007. p.102&lt;/ref&gt; His agent, Harold Freedman, was a family friend of [[Carl Laemmle]], who controlled [[Universal Studios]] at the time, and 
had been acquainted with Rains in London and was keen to cast him in the role.&lt;ref name="Skal48"&gt;Skal and Rains [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&amp;pg=PT48 ''Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice''], p.48-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wut4jYBtUdsC&amp;pg=PA79 ''Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946''], p.79&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rains' daughter, this was the only film of his he ever saw. He also did not go to see the [[Dailies|rushes]] of the day's filming "because he told me, every time he went he was horrified by his huge face on the huge screen, that he just never went back again."

Rains signed a long term contract with [[Warner Bros.]] on 27 November 1935 with Warner able to exercise the right to loan him to other studios and Rains having a potential income of up to $750,000 over 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Skal, with Jessica Rains [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&amp;pg=PT62 ''Claude Rains: An Actor's Voice''], Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2008, p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; He played the villainous role of [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938). [[Roddy McDowall]] once asked Rains if he had intentionally lampooned Bette Davis in his performance as Prince John, and Rains' only reply was "an enigmatic smile." Rains later revealed to his daughter that he'd enjoyed playing the prince as a [[homosexual]], by using subtle mannerisms. Rains later credited the film's co-director [[Michael Curtiz]] with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or "what not to do in front of a camera."&lt;ref&gt;Harmetz p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; On loan to [[Columbia Pictures]], he portrayed a corrupt U.S. senator in ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939) for which he received his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination as Best Supporting Actor. For his home studio, Warner Bros, he played the murderer, Dr. Alexander Tower, in ''[[Kings Row]]'' (1942) and the cynical police chief Captain Renault in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (also 1942). On loan again, Rains played the [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|title character]] in Universal's remake of ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1943).

In her 1987 memoir, ''This 'N That'', [[Bette Davis]] revealed that Rains (with whom she shared the screen four times in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]'', ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', ''[[Mr. Skeffington]]'', and ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'') was her favorite co-star.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Herskowitz 1987, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Rains became the first actor to receive a million-dollar salary when he portrayed [[Julius Caesar]] in a large budget but unsuccessful version of Shaw's ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945), filmed in [[UK|Britain]]. Shaw apparently chose him for the part, although Rains intensely disliked [[Gabriel Pascal]], the film's director and producer.&lt;ref&gt;David Shipman ''The Great Movie Stars: 1, The Golden Years'', London: Macdonald, 1989,  p.487&lt;/ref&gt; Rains followed it with [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946) as a refugee [[Nazi]] agent opposite [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]]. Back in Britain, he appeared in [[David Lean]]'s ''[[The Passionate Friends]]'' (1949).

[[File:Claude Rains in Notorious trailer.jpg|thumb|Rains in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946)]]

His only singing and dancing role was in a 1957 television musical version of [[Robert Browning]]'s ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'', with [[Van Johnson]] as the Piper. The [[NBC]] colour special, broadcast as a film rather than a live or videotaped programme, was highly successful with the public. Sold into [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] after its first telecast, it was repeated annually by many local US TV stations.

Rains remained active as a character actor in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in films and as a guest in television series. Two of his late screen roles were as Dryden, a cynical British diplomat in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) and [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] in ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965), his last film. In CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', he portrayed Alexander Langford, an attorney in a ghost town, in the episode "Incident of Judgement Day" (1963)

He additionally made several audio recordings, narrating some [[Bible]] stories for children on [[Capitol Records]], and reciting [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[Enoch Arden (Strauss)|setting for narrator and piano]] of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson's]] poem ''[[Enoch Arden]]'', with the piano solos performed by [[Glenn Gould]]. He starred in ''The Jeffersonian Heritage'', a 1952 series of 13 half-hour radio programmes recorded by the [[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]] and syndicated for commercial broadcast on a sustaining (i.e., commercial-free) basis.&lt;ref&gt;"The Jeffersonian Heritage," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 8 September 1952, 36 (trade advertisement).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Jessica Rains remembered her father's work ethic:
{{quote|He was interested in the process (of film). He loved acting.  When he came to California to do a film, I had to "hear him his lines" as he drove me to school every morning, 10 miles. He knew everybody's part. He knew the whole script before he came out (to film). I don't think many people did that.}}

Bette Davis in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]] said about Rains:
{{quote|Well of course he petrified me, the first time I played with him was in [[Carlota of Mexico|Carlotta]] (''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]''), and I had to make an entrance [into] the King of France's domain for a rehearsal and he's playing the King of France ([[Napoleon III]]) in rehearsal. As all of us "other era people," we don't just run through lines and say "turn the camera", we rehearse beforehand...Anyway Claude and I couldn't and he was the King of France who loathed Carlotta and I was a kid and petrified of Mr Rains, so I thought he hated ''me,'' I didn't know he was playing the character. I thought he thinks I just stink! What am I going to do? Eventually we worked together quite a lot and became really great friends, really great friends.}}
Davis later went on to describe him: "Claude was witty, amusing and beautiful, really beautiful, thoroughly enchanting to be with and brilliant." She also praised his performances: "He was marvelous in ''[[Deception (1946 film)|Deception]]'' and was worth the whole thing as the picture wasn't terribly good, but he was so marvelous and the restaurant scene where he's talking about all the food...brilliant and of course in [[Mr Skeffington|Skeffington]] he was absolutely brilliant as the husband, just brilliant."

[[Richard Chamberlain]] worked with Rains in what would be his second to last film, ''[[Twilight of Honor]]''. When interviewed for [[Turner Classic Movies]], Chamberlain said,{{quote|Claude Rains has to be considered one of the finest actors of the 20th century. As soon as you hear that marvelous, unmistakable voice of honey mixed with gravel, he becomes instantly recognisable. And that scornful right eyebrow which could freeze an adversary faster than and more effectively than any physical threat. He stood at a mere 5'6", yet his enormous talent and immense stage presence made him a giant among his colleagues. During a stage and film career that spanned six decades, Rains encompassed some of the most memorable and exciting characters ever created by an actor. Villains were a Rains specialty, particularly those of a suave and sarcastic nature and yet when the role called for it; Rains could be remarkably moving and even add a touch of pathos without losing any of his effectiveness.}}

In ''[[Twilight of Honor]]'' Rains played a retired lawyer acting as a mentor to Chamberlain's character. Reminiscing about his work with Rains, Chamberlain said: {{quote|He was in his 70s then and in failing health, yet he was charming and totally professional on the set. It was clear to us that he loved practicing his craft, he dazzled us all. Claude was an extremely private man, he never discussed his humble beginnings, his six marriages. But get him into a conversation about acting and he opened up with delightful anecdotes and fascinating stories about his long life as a thespian.

One day on the set I mentioned to him that 'Notorious' was one of my favorite films and Claude related with amusement that the filming of a particular scene with [[Ingrid Bergman]], Rains was a very small man and Bergman was quite tall, so in order to shoot them in close up together (in the key scene) the resourceful [[Alfred Hitchcock]] had a ramp installed, so as Rains approaches Bergman on camera he appears taller than his co-star. Claude found this ramp business a bit embarrassing and very funny. I got another taste of Claude's witty nature shooting a scene in his final film which he had a long piece of dialogue, generally he had no problem remembering his lines despite getting along in years.

However, there was one particularly long scene shot late at night where he was having a lot of trouble with the dialogue and kept making excuses and finally he paused and said with a sheepish look "[[Alibi Ike]], good old Alibi Ike" ("Alibi Ike" being an expression based on a 1935 film of the same name, in which the lead character has a penchant for making up excuses)&amp;nbsp;–of course in the finished film he played the scene flawlessly, as he always did. Claude Rains truly a class act on and off screen.}}

Many years later, after Rains had gone to [[Hollywood]] and become a well-known film actor, [[John Gielgud]] is reputed to have commented, "He was a great influence on me. I don't know what happened to him. I think he failed and went to America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000024/quotes|title=John Gielgud - Quotes - IMDb|work=imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gielgud later went on to recollect a time when he was in New York and in the audience during an event that included a focus on [[Bette Davis]].

{{quote|A number of clips from many of her most successful films were shown and I was particularly delighted, when, as soon as Claude Rains appeared in the close-up of one of the clips, the whole audience burst into a great wave of applause.}}Bette Davis often cited Rains as one of her favorite actors and colleagues. Gielgud commented that he once wrote that "The London stage suffered a great loss when Claude Rains deserted it for motion pictures", but he later went on to say, "but when I see him now on the screen and remember him, I must admit that the London stage's loss was the cinema's gain. And the striking virtuosity that I witnessed as a young actor is now there for audiences everywhere to see for all time. I'm so glad of that."

==Personal life and death==
Rains became a [[naturalized citizen of the United States]] in 1939. He married six times, and was divorced from the first five of his wives: [[Isabel Jeans]] (married 1913–1915); Marie Hemingway (to whom Rains was married for less than a year in 1920); Beatrix Thomson (1924–8 April 1935); Frances Propper (9 April 1935 – 1956); and the classical pianist [[Agi Jambor]] (4 November 1959 – 1960). In 1960, he married Rosemary Clark Schrode, to whom he was married until her death on 31 December 1964. His only child, Jennifer, was born on 24 January 1938, the daughter of Frances Propper. As an actress, she is known as Jessica Rains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k54Y1HLqWDQC&amp;pg=PT104 Skal and Rains], p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

He acquired the {{Convert|380|acre|km2|adj=on}} Stock Grange Farm, built in 1747 in [[West Bradford Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|West Bradford Township]], [[Pennsylvania]] (just outside [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania|Coatesville]]), in 1941. The farm became one of the "great prides" of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/movie-tv-memorabilia/photos/claude-rains-scrapbook-devoted-to-his-farm-stock-grange-total-12-items-/a/7006-49362.s|title=Claude Rains' Scrapbook Devoted to His Farm, Stock - Lot #49362 - Heritage Auctions|website=Heritage Auctions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he became a "gentleman farmer" and could relax and enjoy farming life with his then wife (Frances) churning the butter, their daughter collecting the eggs, with Rains himself ploughing the fields and cultivating the vegetable garden. He spent much of his time between film takes reading up on agricultural techniques to try when he got home. He sold the farm when his marriage to Propper ended in 1956, the building now, as then, is still referred to by locals as "Rains' Place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20101114/NEWS/311149969|title=Thinking about Claude Rains and the pastoral Stock Grange Farm|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rains spent his final years in [[Sandwich, New Hampshire|Sandwich]], [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duckler|first=Ray|title=A Star's Last Act: The great Claude Rains spent his final years in New Hampshire|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/4419930-95/a-stars-last-act|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=Concord Monitor|date=31 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130913193332/http://www.concordmonitor.com/news/4419930-95/a-stars-last-act|archivedate=13 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years, Rains decided to write his memoirs and engaged the help of journalist Jonathan Root to assist him. Rains' declining health delayed their completion and with Root's death in March 1967 the project was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/20/entertainment/et-book20|title=Rains was never a minor character|first=Richard|last=Schickel|date=20 November 2008|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died from an abdominal hemorrhage in [[Laconia, New Hampshire|Laconia]] on 30{{nbsp}}May 1967, aged 77. His daughter said, "And, just like most actors, he died waiting for his agent to call."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=T. Soister|first=John|date=19 July 2017|title=Claude Rains: A Comprehensive Illustrated to His Work in Film, Stage, Radio, Television and Recordings|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EYuACgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;q=claude%20rains%20records}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at the Red Hill Cemetery in [[Moultonborough, New Hampshire|Moultonborough]], [[New Hampshire]]. He designed his own tombstone which reads "All things once, Are things forever, Soul, once living, lives forever".

In 2010, many of Rains' personal effects were put into an auction at [[Heritage Auctions]], including his 1951 Tony award, rare posters, letters and photographs. Also included in the auction were many volumes of his private leather-bound scrapbooks which contained many of his press cuttings and reviews from the beginning of his career. The majority of the items were used to help David J. Skal write his book on Rains ''An Actor's Voice''. In 2011, the ivory military uniform (complete with medals) he wore as Captain Renault in ''Casablanca'' was put up for auction when noted actress and film historian [[Debbie Reynolds]] sold her collection of Hollywood costumes and memorabilia which she had amassed as a result of the [[Film memorabilia#1970 MGM auction|1970 MGM auction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icollector.com/Claude-Rains-Captain-Louis-Renault-ivory-military-suit-from-Casablanca_i10657974|title=Claude Rains "Captain Louis Renault" ivory military suit from Casablanca|website=iCollector.com Online Auctions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
In 1951, Rains won a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] for ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' as well as the [[Delia Austrian medal]] for the same production. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] on four occasions: for ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1943), ''[[Mr. Skeffington]]'' (1944) and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). Rains was awarded a Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], at 6400 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] on February 8, 1960.

In the television series ''[[Heroes (TV Series)|Heroes]]'' the character portrayed by [[Christopher Eccleston]]  does not reveal his real name and uses the alias [[Claude (Heroes)|'Claude Rains']] due to his ability to turn himself, any personal objects he touches, and other people [[Invisibility|invisible]]; his alias is an obvious homage to Rains who played ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.

==Notable theatre performances==

Rains starred in multiple plays and productions over the course of his career, playing a variety of leading and supporting parts. As his film career began to flourish, he found less time to perform in the theatre in both England and America.

'''Combat Stress''' is a registered charity in the [[United Kingdom]] offering therapeutic and clinical community and residential treatment to former members of the [[British Armed Forces]] who are suffering from a range of [[mental health]] conditions; including [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref name="charity comm"&gt;{{EW charity|206002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.CombatStress.org.uk/|title=Combat Stress|publisher=Combat Stress|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7039700.stm|website=news.BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Combating the stress of civilian life|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Combat Stress makes available treatment for all Veterans who are suffering with mental illness free of charge.

On average, it takes 13 years for a Veteran to first contact with Combat Stress for advice, help, and treatment; however for those who served in Iraq ([[Gulf War I]] and [[Gulf War II]]) and Afghanistan, the time period is much lower.

The charity was formed in [[1919 in the United Kingdom|1919]], as the Ex-Servicemen's Welfare Society, following [[World War I]]; when the effects of [[shell shock]] were becoming known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Combat Stress|url=https://www.CombatStress.org.uk/about-us/history-of-combat-stress/|publisher=Combat Stress|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History before 1919==
===World War I===
{{See also|World War I}}
Soldiers (and other frontline personnel) returning home from World War I suffered greatly from the horrors of war that they had witnessed.  Many returning veterans suffered from what was then known as [[shell shock]]; now known as [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

{{main|Combat stress reaction}}

In [[1915 in the United Kingdom|1915]], the [[British Army]] in [[France]] was instructed{{by whom|date=January 2018}} that:
{{cquote|''Shell-shock and shell concussion cases should have the letter 'W' prefixed to the report of the casualty, if it were due to the enemy; in that case the patient would be entitled to rank as 'wounded' and to wear on his arm a '[[wound stripe]]'. If, however, the man’s breakdown did not follow a shell explosion, it was not thought to be ‘due to the enemy’, and he was to [be] labelled 'shell-shock' or 'S' (for sickness) and was not entitled to a wound stripe or a pension.''&lt;ref name="shephard"&gt;[[Ben Shephard (English historian)|Shephard, Ben]]. ''A War of Nerves: Soldiers and Psychiatrists, 1914-1994''. London, Jonathan Cape, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August [[1916 in the United Kingdom|1916]], [[Charles Samuel Myers|Charles Myers]] was made Consulting Psychologist to the Army.  He hammered home the notion that it was necessary to create special centres near the line using treatment based on:
*Promptness of action;
*Suitable environment;
*Psychotherapeutic measures.
He also used [[hypnosis]] with limited success.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In December 1916, [[Gordon Morgan Holmes|Gordon Holmes]] was put in charge of the northern, and more important, part of the western front.  He had much more of the tough attitudes of the Army, and suited the prevailing military mindset, and so his view prevailed.  By June [[1917 in the United Kingdom|1917]], all British cases of 'shell-shock' were evacuated to a nearby neurological centre, and were labelled as NYDN – 'not yet diagnosed nervous'.  "But, because of the Adjutant-General's distrust of doctors, no patient could receive that specialist attention until Form AF 3436 had been sent off to the man’s unit and filled in by his commanding officer."&lt;ref name="shephard"/&gt;  This created significant delays, but demonstrated that between 4-10% of shell-shock W cases were 'commotional' (due to physical causes), and the rest were 'emotional'.  This killed off shell-shock as a valid disease, and it was abolished in September [[1918 in the United Kingdom|1918]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

During the war, 306 British soldiers were executed for cowardice; many of whom were victims of shell shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwone/shot_at_dawn_01.shtml|title=Shot at Dawn: Cowards, Traitors or Victims?|website=BBC.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC History]]|first=Peter|last=Taylor-Whiffen|date=1 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 7 November [[2006 in the United Kingdom|2006]], the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] gave them all a posthumous conditional pardon.  The [[Shot at Dawn Memorial]] at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] in [[Staffordshire]] commemorates these men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fenton|first=Ben|date=16 August 2006|title=Pardoned: the 306 soldiers shot at dawn for 'cowardice'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1526437/Pardoned-the-306-soldiers-shot-at-dawn-for-cowardice.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present work==
Combat Stress was formed at a time when there was little known about [[mental health]] problems affecting ex-Service men and women who had returned home after serving in war and conflict zones.

Currently, the organisation is helping almost 6,000 people who are Veterans aged from 19 to 97.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us: Combat Stress|url=https://www.CombatStress.org.uk/about-us/|publisher=Combat Stress|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Combat Stress are currently treating 971 Veterans who served in [[Afghanistan]] and 1,185 who served in [[Iraq]].

Support is currently being given to those who suffer from:
*[[Clinical depression]]
*Raised [[anxiety]] states
*[[Substance abuse]] (drug and alcohol)
*[[Post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD)
This support is delivered throughout England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; through three treatment centres (Hollybush House, Ayr, Ayrshire, Scotland; Audley Court, Newport, Shropshire, England; and Tyrwhitt House, Leatherhead, Surrey, England), along with community outreach teams.

==Services==
The services provided:
*Regional Welfare officers 
*Treatments for PTSD which include:

{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}
'''Computational Heuristic Intelligence'''&lt;ref&gt;Newell, A. (1981) [http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA106557 THE HEURISTIC OF GEORGE POLYA AND ITS RELATION TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE] Department of Computer Science, Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;/ref&gt;(CHI) refers to specialized programming techniques in [[computational intelligence]] (also called [[artificial intelligence]], or AI). These techniques have the express goal of avoiding [[complexity]] issues, also called [[NP-hard]] problems, by using human-like techniques. They are best summarized as the use of exemplar-based methods ([[heuristics]]), rather than rule-based methods ([[algorithms]]). Hence the term is distinct from the more conventional computational ''algorithmic'' intelligence, or [[GOFAI]]. An example of a CHI technique is the [[encoding specificity principle]] of Tulving and Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E., &amp; Thomson, D.M. (1973).  [http://gureckislab.org/courses/fall15/lhc/readings/TulvingThompson1973.pdf Encoding specificity and retrieval processes in episodic memory]. Psychological Review, 80, 352–373,&lt;/ref&gt; In general, CHI principles are problem solving techniques used by people, rather than programmed into machines. It is by drawing attention to this key distinction that the use of this term is justified in a field already replete with confusing neologisms. Note that the legal systems of all modern human societies employ both heuristics (generalisations of cases) from individual trial records as well as legislated statutes (rules) as regulatory guides.

Another recent approach to the avoidance of complexity issues is to employ [[feedback]] control rather than [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] modeling as a problem-solving paradigm. This approach has been called [[computational cybernetics]], because (a) the term 'computational' is associated with conventional computer programming techniques which represent a strategic, compiled, or feedforward model of the problem, and (b) the term 'cybernetic' is associated with conventional system operation techniques which represent a tactical, interpreted, or feedback model of the problem. Of course, real programs and real problems both contain both feedforward and feedback components. A real example which illustrates this point is that of human cognition, which clearly involves both perceptual ([[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]], feedback, sensor-oriented) and conceptual ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]], feedforward, motor-oriented) information flows and hierarchies.

Death by '''crushing''' or '''pressing''' is a method of [[capital punishment|execution]] that has a history during which the techniques used varied greatly from place to place, generally involving the placement of intense weight upon a person with the intent to kill. This form of execution is no longer sanctioned by any governing body.

A common method of death throughout South and South-East Asia for over 4,000 years was crushing by elephants. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] used this method on occasion.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Roman mythology==
In [[Roman mythology]], [[Tarpeia]] was a [[Rome|Roman]] maiden who betrayed the city of Rome to the [[Sabine]]s in exchange for what she thought would be a reward of jewelry. She was instead crushed to death and her body cast from the [[Tarpeian Rock]] which now bears her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders |first=H.|title=Roman historical sources and institutions|publisher=Macmillan |year=1904|pages=1&amp;ndash;47|url=https://archive.org/stream/romanhistorical02sandgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crushing under common law==
{{main|Peine forte et dure}}

'''''Peine forte et dure''''' ([[Law French]] for "forceful and hard punishment") was a method of [[torture]] formerly used in the [[common law]] legal system, in which a [[defendant]] who refused to [[plea]]d ("stood mute") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered, or as the weight of the stones on the chest became too great for the condemned to breathe, fatal [[Asphyxia#Compressive asphyxia|suffocation]] would occur.

The common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own [[jurisdiction]]. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], ''[[The History of English Law]]'', v. 2, pp. 650–651 (Cambridge; 1968; {{ISBN|0-521-07062-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, a [[criminal justice]] system that punished only those who volunteered for punishment was unworkable; this was the means chosen to coerce them.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1769), vol. 4, pp. *319-324&lt;/ref&gt;

Many defendants charged with capital offences nonetheless refused to plead, since thereby they would escape forfeiture of property, and their heirs would still inherit their estate; but if the defendant pleaded guilty and was executed, their heirs would inherit nothing, their property [[escheat]]ing to the Crown. ''Peine forte et dure'' was abolished in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1772, and the last known use of the practice was in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html Drug Control and Asset Seizures: a review of the history of forfeiture in England and colonial America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970428075512/http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html |date=28 April 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty. This was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty. Today, in all common law jurisdictions, standing mute is treated by the courts as equivalent to a plea of not guilty.

The elaborate procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness in an oft-quoted description: "he will lie upon his back, with his head covered and his feet, and one arm will be drawn to one quarter of the house with a cord, and the other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner it will be done with his legs; and let there be laid upon his body iron and stone, as much as he can bear, or more ..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veURAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=%22laid+in+some+low+dark+house%22#PPA218,M1 Curiosities of Cowell's "Interpreter"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pressing to death" might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London&lt;ref&gt;[http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ed89c430-0517-4065-b717-0243fd11b368 The enterprising and tenacious Guy Miège: four dictionaries from 1677 to 1688]&lt;/ref&gt; says the following about the English practice:&lt;ref&gt;Miege, G.:"[https://books.google.no/books?id=b3gZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:Pu8Sknlj31oC&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VAMaUeXcJ8jR4QSm1YGoCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The present state of Great-Britain and Ireland]" London 1715, p.294&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote| For such as stand Mute at their Trial, and refuse to answer Guilty, or Not Guilty, Pressing to Death is the proper Punishment. In such a Case the Prisoner is laid in a low dark Room in the Prison, all naked but his Privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground his Arms and Legs stretched with Cords, and fastned to the several Quarters of the Room. This done, he has a great Weight of Iron and Stone laid upon him. His Diet, till he dies, is of three Morsels of Barley bread without Drink the next Day; and if he lives beyond it, he has nothing daily, but as much foul Water as he can drink three several Time , and that without any Bread: Which grievous Death some resolute Offenders have chosen, to save their Estates to their Children. But, in case of High Treason, the Criminal's Estate is forfeited to the Sovereign, as in all capital Crimes, notwithstanding his being pressed to Death.}}

[[File:Giles Corey restored.jpg|thumb|Giles Corey was pressed to death during the Salem Witch Trials in the 1690s.]]
The most famous case in the United Kingdom was that of [[Roman Catholic]] [[martyr]] [[Margaret Clitherow|St Margaret Clitherow]], who (in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence) was pressed to death on March 25, 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic (then outlawed) [[priest]]s in her house. She died within fifteen minutes under a weight of at least 700 pounds (320&amp;nbsp;kg). Several hardened criminals, including William Spigott (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted a half hour under 400 pounds (180&amp;nbsp;kg) before pleading to the indictment. Others, such as Major Strangways (1658) and John Weekes (1731), refused to plead, even under 400 pounds (180&amp;nbsp;kg), and were killed when bystanders, out of mercy, sat on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html |title=Mackenzie, The Practise of Peine Forte et Dure in 16th and 17th Century England |access-date=29 May 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801195952/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html |archive-date=1 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only death by ''peine forte et dure'' in American history was [[Giles Corey]], who was pressed to death on September 19, 1692, during the [[Salem witch trials]], after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were "More weight", and he was thought to be dead as the weight was applied. This is referred to in Arthur Miller's political drama ''[[The Crucible]]'' (1953), where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead "aye or nay" to the charge of witchcraft. In the [[The Crucible (1996 film)|1996 film version of this play]], the screenplay also written by Arthur Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.

In medieval Europe, the slow crushing of body parts in screw-operated "bone vises" of iron was a common method of torture, and a tremendous variety of cruel instruments were used to savagely crush the head, the knee, the hand, and, most commonly, either the thumb or the naked foot. Such instruments were finely threaded and variously provided with spiked inner surfaces or heated red-hot before their application to the limb to be tortured.

Some research has looked into genetics when considering ''déjà vu''. Although there is not currently a gene associated with ''déjà vu'', the LGII gene on [[chromosome 10]] is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy and, though by no means a certainty, ''déjà vu'', along with [[jamais vu]], occurs often enough during seizures (such as [[simple partial seizure]]s) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brynie|first=Faith|title=Brain Sense: The Science of the Senses and How We Process the World Around Us|year=2009|publisher=Amacom|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Certain drugs increase the chances of ''déjà vu'' occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of ''déjà vu''. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that ''déjà vu'' occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.

==Explanations==

=== Memory-based explanation ===
Research has associated ''déjà vu'' experiences with good memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adachi | first1 = N. | last2 = Adachi | first2 = T. | last3 = Kimura | first3 = M. | last4 = Akanuma | first4 = N. | last5 = Takekawa | first5 = Y. | last6 = Kato | first6 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Demographic and psychological features of déjà vu experiences in a nonclinical Japanese population | url = | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 242–247 | doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000061149.26296.dc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity between a ''déjà-vu''-eliciting stimulus and an existing, or non-existing but different, memory trace may lead to the sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.&lt;ref name="Brown20042"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleary2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cleary AM|year=2008|title=Recognition memory, familiarity and déjà vu experiences |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=5|pages=353–357 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00605.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, encountering something that evokes the implicit associations of an experience or sensation that ''cannot be remembered'' may lead to ''déjà vu''.

In an effort to reproduce the sensation experimentally, Banister and [[Oliver Zangwill|Zangwill]] (1941)&lt;ref name="Banister1941a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced olfactory paramnesia |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]]|volume=32|pages=155–175 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01018.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banister1941b"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced visual paramnesias |journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=32|pages=30–51 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[hypnosis]] to give participants posthypnotic amnesia for material they had already seen. When this was later re-encountered, the restricted activation caused thereafter by the posthypnotic amnesia resulted in 3 of the 10 participants reporting what the authors termed "paramnesias".

Memory-based explanations may lead to the development of a number of non-invasive experimental methods by which a long sought-after analogue of ''déjà vu'' can be reliably produced that would allow it to be tested under well-controlled experimental conditions. Cleary suggests that ''déjà vu'' may be a form of familiarity-based recognition (recognition that is based on a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past) and that laboratory methods of probing familiarity-based recognition hold promise for probing ''déjà vu'' in laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="Cleary2008"/&gt;

A 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''déjà vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''déjà vu'' experience.&lt;ref name="Cleary et al., 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleary et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to déjà vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969–975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.

Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''déjà vu'' is the occurrence of "[[cryptomnesia]]", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as "''déjà vu''". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''déjà vu'') involves achieving a good "match" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we "know" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|work=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''déjà vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and déjà  vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|pages=403–424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How Déjà Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dream-based explanation===
One theory of ''déjà vu'' attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something that is currently being seen or experienced to that of having dreamt about a similar situation or place and then forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dream Directory: The Comprehensive Guide to Analysis and Interpretation |last=Lohff |first=David C. |year=2004 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=0-7624-1962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spontaneity of these types of ''déjà vu'' "moments"  can catch many people off-guard, especially when they get the sensation from visiting a specific place they have never been to before, to the point where they are in a temporary state of shock and disbelief.

===''Jamais vu''===
{{Main|Jamais vu }}

''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning "never seen") is a term in psychology which is used to describe any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.

Often described as the opposite of ''déjà vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

Theoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.&lt;ref name="moulin"/&gt; If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very "reality of reality", are termed depersonalisation (or [[surreality]]) feelings.

The feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word.&lt;ref name="moulin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

'''Eduard Roschmann''' (25 November 1908 – 8 August 1977) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Obersturmführer]]''{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=152, 382}} and [[commandant]] of the [[Riga ghetto]] during 1943. He was responsible for numerous murders and other atrocities. As a result of a fictionalised portrayal in the novel ''[[The Odessa File]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]] and [[The Odessa File (film)|its subsequent film adaptation]], Roschmann came to be known as the "Butcher of Riga".{{sfnp|Schneider|1995|p=78}}

== Early life and career ==
Roschmann was born on 25 November 1908, in [[Graz|Graz-Eggenberg]], in [[Austria]].{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}}

Roschmann was once a lawyer in [[Graz]], [[Austria]].{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=75}}  He was the son of a brewery manager.{{sfnp|Angrick|Klein|2012|p=479}} He was reputed to have come from the [[Styria]] region of Austria, from a good family.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947}}  From 1927 to 1934, Roschmann was a member of the [[Fatherland's Front]], which in turn was part of the Austrian home guard ("[[Heimatschutz]]"). From 1927 to 1934, Roschmann was associated with an organisation called the "Steyr Homeland Protection Force." Roschmann spent six semesters at a university. By 1931, he was a brewery employee, joining the civil service in 1935. In 1938, he joined the [[Nazi Party]], and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] the following year. In January 1941, he was assigned to the [[Sicherheitspolizei|Security Police]].{{sfnp|Angrick|Klein|2012|p=479}}

[[File:Riga ghetto map.jpg|thumb|Map of the Riga ghetto, as published in a Nazi-controlled newspaper in Riga in 1941.]]

Within the SS Roschmann was assigned to the Security Service (''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]''), often referred to by its German initials SD. Following the German occupation of [[Latvia]] in the [[Second World War]], the SD established a presence in Latvia with the objective of killing all the Jews in the country.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To this end, the SD established the [[Riga ghetto]].

=== Structure of the Riga ghetto ===
The Riga ghetto did not exist prior to the occupation of Latvia by the German armed forces. Jews in general lived throughout Riga before then. The ghetto itself was a creation of the SD. Surrounded by barbed wire fences, with armed guards, it was in effect a large and overcrowded prison. Furthermore, while it is common to see the Riga ghetto referred to as a single location, in fact it was only a unified prison for a very short time in autumn of 1941. After that it was split into three ghettos.

The first ghetto was the Latvian ghetto, sometimes called the "Big Ghetto", which was only in existence for 35 days, from late October to 30 November 1941. Men, women and children were forced into the ghetto, where at least for a short time they lived as families. On 30 November and on 8 December 1941, 24,000 Jews were force-marched out of the ghetto and shot at the nearby forest of [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]]. Except for [[Babi Yar]], this was the biggest two-day massacre in the genocides until the construction of the [[death camp]]s in 1942.{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|p=239}} A few thousand Latvian Jews, mostly men, who were not murdered at Rumbula, were confined to a much smaller area of the former Latvia ghetto. This became known as the men's ghetto; about 500 Latvian Jewish women, who were also not selected for murder, were similarly confined to an adjacent but separated smaller ghetto, known as the women's ghetto.

A few days after the 8 December massacre, train-loads of Jews from Germany, Austria and [[Czechoslovakia]] began to arrive in Riga, where, with some important exceptions, they were housed in a portion of the former Latvian ghetto, which then became known as the German ghetto.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=162}}

=== Participation in Dünamünde Action ===
{{Main|Dünamünde Action}}
In March 1942, the German authorities in charge of the Riga ghetto and the nearby [[Jungfernhof concentration camp]] murdered about 3,740 German, Austrian and Czech Jews who had been deported to Latvia. The victims were mostly the elderly, the sick and infirm and children. These people were tricked into believing they would be transported to a new and better camp facility at an area near Riga called Dünamünde. In fact no such facility existed, and the intent was to transport the victims to mass graves in the woods north of Riga and shoot them.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=47}}{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|pp=34–7}}

According to a survivor, Edith Wolff, Roschmann was one of a group of SS men who selected the persons for "transport" to Dünamünde. (Others in the selection group included [[Rudolf Lange]], Kurt Krause, Max Gymnich, Kurt R. Migge, Richard Nickel and [[Rudolf Joachim Seck|Rudolf Seck]]). Wolff stated that only the "prominent people" made selections, and she was not sure whether Migge, Seck or Nickel had picked anyone.{{sfnp|Angrick|Klein|2012|p=330}}

=== Appointment as ghetto commandant ===
Starting in January 1943, Roschmann became commandant of the Riga ghetto.{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=152, 382}}{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=75}}  His immediate predecessor was [[Kurt Krause]]. Survivors described Krause as "sadistic",{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=75}}"bloody",{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=72}} "monster",{{sfnp|Schneider|1991|p=112}} and "psychopath".{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=72}}  Roschmann's methods differed from those of Krause. Unlike Krause, Roschmann did not execute offenders on the spot, but, in most cases, sent them to Riga's Central Prison. Whether this was a matter of having qualms about murder is not certain.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=75}} Being sent to the prison was likely to be, at best, only a brief reprieve, as conditions there were brutal.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|pp=85–7}}

At that time, Roschmann held the relatively low rank of [[Unterscharführer]].{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|pp=72–98, 134–7}} Differing ranks are supplied for Roschmann. According to Ezergailis and Kaufmann, Roschmann held the rank of SS-[[Unterscharführer]].{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=152, 382}}  According to Schneider, Roschmann was an SS-[[Obersturmführer]], a higher rank. Schneider mentions no promotion for Roschmann.

=== Murders and other crimes ===
Historians Angrick and Klein state that in addition to the mass killings the [[Holocaust]] in Latvia also consisted of a great number of individual murders.{{sfnp|Angrick|Klein|2012|pp=389–90}}

{{quote|text=... the reading provided by witness accounts ... makes it clear that the genocide in occupied Riga consisted of an enormous number of individual murders in addition to the large-scale operations. The image of the Holocaust in Latvia conveyed in these reports is not that of a gigantic impersonal killing machine, even if the plans for shooting the Jews of Riga in winter 1941 conjure up a process of mass murder based on division of labour. The overall pattern in these accounts is dominated by individual murders committed out of a desire to kill, punish or deter.{{sfnp|Angrick|Klein|2012|pp=389–90}}}}

Angrick and Klein name Roschmann among others as responsible for these individual murders.{{sfnp|Angrick|Klein|2012|pp=389–90}} Historian Schneider, a survivor of the German ghetto, has stated that it is certain that Roschmann was a murderer, otherwise he never would have risen as high as he did in the SS.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=75}} One documented murder committed by Roschmann, with his subordinates assisted by [[Scharführer]]{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=380–83}} Max Gymnich and Kurt Migge, was that of Arthur Kaufmann, the 17-year-old son of Max Kaufmann, who later came to write one of the first histories of the Holocaust in Latvia. Roschmann personally issued the order for this particular murder.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=75}}{{sfnp|Press|2000|p=151}} Kaufmann himself described the murder, which occurred when both of them were housed outside the ghetto at the [[Sloka, Latvia|Sloka work camp]], where among other things they were tasked with peat cutting:
{{quote|text=On 20 May 1943 the Commandant of our ghetto, Roschmann, came to Sloka together with his adjutant Gymnich and the SD man Migge. They inspected the entire work camp, and on this occasion they discovered that my son and the Mordchelewitz brothers were hoarding fat. Because all the members of the work crew were working, nobody was present at this inspection. A short time later the three of them were taken away, and the murderers immediately placed my son and the Mordechelewitz brothers off to the side next to their vehicle. They were ordered to take off their shoes, and from this moment on the "guilty ones" knew they were going to be shot. The Mordechelewitz brothers tried to escape. The guards ran after them and shot them. By contrast, my son behaved like a hero. He was much too proud to beg for mercy. He was killed immediately with a shot to the back of the neck. When everyone came back from work in the evening, the mood was very low. My son had been the work crew's favourite, and his death was deeply mourned.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=97}}}}

Food for ghetto occupants was strictly rationed and generally inadequate. It was common for Jews assigned to work details to obtain and attempt to smuggle extra food into the ghetto. For this and other reasons, all returning work details were subject to search, although this was actually carried out only on a sporadic basis. When searches did occur, those smuggling food were forced to abandon it before it could be found on their person, which was a serious offence.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947}} Roschmann and his aide, Max Gymnich, accompanied by a trained attack dog, involved themselves in the details of the searches for contraband food, which included inspections of kitchens in the ghetto, again forcing people to discard food they had smuggled in, even when they were about to eat it.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947}} Survivor Nina Ungar related a similar incident at the Olaine [[peat bog]] work camp where Roschmann found 3 eggs on one of the Latvian Jews and had him shot immediately.{{sfnp|Schneider|1991|p=112}} Kaufmann describes an incident, possibly the same one referred to by Ungar, where Roschmann, during a visit to the Olaine work camp with Gymnich in 1943, found a singer named Karp with 5 eggs and had him shot immediately.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=158}}

Roschmann, together with Krause, who, although no longer ghetto commandant, was close at hand as the commandant of the [[Salaspils concentration camp]], investigated a resistance plot among the Jews to store weapons at an old power magazine in Riga known as the Pulverturm. As a result, several hundred inmates were executed, whom Kaufmann described as "our best young people."{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947}}

While ghetto commandant, Roschmann became involved with the work detail known as the Army Motor Park (''Heereskraftpark'').{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|pp=135–7}} This was considered a favourable work assignment for Jews, as it involved skilled labour (vehicle mechanics) necessary for the German army, thus providing some protection from liquidation, and it also gave a number of opportunities to "organise" (that is, to buy, barter for or steal) contraband food and other items. The Jews on the work detail benefited from the fact that the German in charge, Private First Class (''Obergefreiter'') Walter Eggers, was corrupt and wanted to use the Jews under his command to become rich. Consequently, better treatment could be had, at least for a time, by paying Eggers bribes. Roschmann heard rumours about the "good life",{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=136}} and attempted to prevent it by putting some of the workers into one of the prisons or transferring them to Kaiserwald concentration camp.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|pp=135–7}}

Roschmann himself was not above accepting bribes, or at least pretending to accept bribes. In one instance, a shoemaker whose two children had been incarcerated in the Riga prisons as a result of Roschmann's investigation, attempted to secure their release by paying Roschmann a large number of gold coins. Roschmann took the coins, but did not release the children.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=145}}

=== Actions outside of the ghetto ===
Roschmann was later transferred to the Lenta work camp, a forced-labour facility in the Riga area where Jews were housed at the workplace.{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=152, 382}} Originally this facility had been located on Washington (Ludendorff) Square in Riga and had been known as the "Gestapo" work detail.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|pp=133–5}}  Lenta was considered a favoured work assignment. The original German commandant, Fritz Scherwitz, had determined to make a lot of money involving the work of highly skilled Jews in the tailoring trade. Scherwitz made efforts to protect Jews in the Lenta work detail. This changed when Roschmann became the Lenta commandant. According to Kaufmann:
{{quote|text=Under the rule of this Commander Roschmann the camp's inmates experienced especially difficult times. This was why various inmates * * * escaped to Dobele in Kurzeme. * * * As a collective punishment, the lovely grey suits were striped with white oil paint, the men had a stripe shaved down the middle of their heads, and the women all had their hair cut off. Others were arrested, sent to prison and murdered there.{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|pp=135–7}}}}

Roschmann participated in the efforts of [[Sonderaktion 1005|Sonderkommando 1005]] to conceal the evidence of the Nazi crimes in Latvia by exhuming and burning the bodies of the victims of the numerous mass shootings in the Riga area.{{sfnp|Angrick|Klein|2012|p=479}} In the fall of 1943, Roschmann was made the chief of ''Kommando Stützpunkt'', a work detail of prisoners which was given the task of digging up and burning the bodies of the tens of thousands of people whom the Nazis had shot and buried in the forests of Latvia. About every two weeks the men on the work detail were shot and replaced with a new set of inmates.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=76}}{{sfnp|Schneider|1991|p=62}} Men for this commando were selected both from [[Kaiserwald concentration camp]] and from the few remaining people in the [[Riga ghetto]].

Historian Ezergailis states that one Hasselbach, an SS officer, was the commander of the Stützpunkt commando, and does not mention Roschmann.{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=289, 361}} As his source, Ezergailis cites a witness, Franz Leopold Schlesinger, who testified in the trial in West Germany of [[Viktors Arajs]] in the late 1970s, almost 35 years later. Schlesinger in turn appears to have only "thought" Hasselbach was the commander.{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=289, 361}}

Roschmann is sometimes described as the commandant of the Kaiserwald concentration camp, which was located on the north side of Riga. Kaufmann however gives the Kaiserwald commandant as an SS man named [[Albert Sauer|Sauer]] who held the rank of [[Obersturmbannführer]].{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=113}}

Jack Ratz, a Latvian Jewish survivor, came face to face with Roschmann in Lenta at the age of 17. According to Jack:
{{quote|text=Since I worked in the kitchen I became a "chemist". I took horse fat, beef fat, and bacon, melted them together with onions, and created a smear on bread. One day Roschmann came into the barracks with his dog. The dog smelled something unusual and pulled his master over to my locker where I had hidden my food. The SS officer forced me to empty all the food from my locker and called the doctor in from the next building to taste the food to find out why it had such unusual smell.
The doctor, who was my friend because I had often supplied him extra food, gave me a wink as he tasted the food and reported that the odor came from onions. But the Nazi wanted to know how it came about that I had so much food and fats in my locker, since the food allowance was only enough for one or two days, at most. I told him that the food was not only my own, but I was also holding rations for my father and his friend.
He then ordered the chief of police, a German Jew, to bring my father to the kitchen. My father was forced to run down a few flights of stairs so that the Nazi should not have a long wait. When asked what he did with his ration of food, my father unhesitatingly replied, "Me? All my food goes to my son." The Nazi walked out, and that time I emerged the winner with my life. Once again I was rescued from the firing squad, this time by my father's quick thinking.}}

== Character ==
According to Gertrude Schneider, a historian and a survivor of the Riga ghetto, Roschmann was clearly a murderer, but was not uniformly cruel. She records an instance where Krause, Roschmann's predecessor as commandant, had executed Johann Weiss, a lawyer from Vienna, and a [[First World War]] veteran, for having hidden money in his glove. A year later, when Roschmann was commandant, his widow and daughter requested of him that he allow them the Jewish custom of visiting the grave. Roschmann allowed the request.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=45}}

Schneider, in describing this incident, characterised Roschmann as "that most peculiar SS man."{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=45}} According to Schneider, Roschmann would order food abandoned during searches for contraband to be sent to the ghetto hospital.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=79}}  Schneider particularly objected to Roschmann's modern image as the so-called "butcher of Riga". Up to the time of the publication of Forsyth's book in 1972, [[Herberts Cukurs]], a famous Latvian pilot, had been the person known as "the Butcher of Riga" as a result of his actions during the occupation of Latvia from 1941 to 1944.:{{sfnp|Press|2000|p=127}}{{sfnp|Künzle|Shimron|2004|pp=320–351}}{{sfnp|Lumans|2006|p=240}}{{sfnp|Eksteins|2000|p=150}}{{sfnp|Michelson|2004|pp=103}}
{{quote|text=[I]t would be a mockery to single out Roschmann as "butcher" and ignore all the others. Roschmann ... probably preened himself in front of his SS cronies when citing ''The Odessa File'' as proof of his ruthless efficiency three decades earlier. Actually, however, he was hardly a "mass murderer." The atrocities mentioned in ''The Odessa File'' occurred long before he came on the scene. What he actually did in the ghetto was far less exciting: he would spend hours on end just standing in front of the ''Kommandantur'', not knowing what to do with himself. From time to time he would sneak a look inside the hospital, but mostly he would walk around aimlessly, growing fatter by the day, more or less ignored by everyone.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|pp=75–6}}}}

Other accounts assign a more malignant role to Roschmann. Historian Bernard Press, a Latvian Jew who was able to hide outside of Riga and avoid confinement in the ghetto, describes Krause, Gymnich and Roschmann as having engaged in random shootings of human beings.{{sfnp|Press|2000|p=119}} Press describes an incident where a woman was condemned to death for "illegal correspondence" with a friend in Germany. Roschmann had her confined in the Central Prison, where she was not in fact executed but released based on the recommendation of Krause, who had previously wanted the woman to become his mistress.{{sfnp|Press|2000|pp=137–8}}

Max Michelson described Roschman, [[Rudolf Lange]] and Kurt Krause as all being "notorious sadists."{{sfnp|Michelson|2004|p=112}} Michelson, a Riga ghetto survivor, described Roschmann:
{{quote|text=When Krause was replaced by Roschmann in early 1943, we were happy finally to be rid of this madman. Roschmann, a lawyer, was indeed more deliberate, less likely to react by killing his victims on the spur of the moment. Roschmann, however, was a careful and meticulous investigator who would incarcerate and interrogate suspects and implicate and arrest many more people than Krause had. As a result, our situation did not improve, and the number of people killed under Roschmann was even larger than under Krause.{{sfnp|Michelson|2004|p=112}}}}

Max Kaufmann, a survivor of Latvian ghetto, compared Roschmann to Krause, coming to a similar conclusion as Max Michelson:
{{quote|text=Krause, a psychopath and a sadist, acted suddenly and spontaneously, handing down his verdicts without a detailed explanation of the situation and executing them immediately. Roschmann, the jurist, deliberated for a long time, investigated thoroughly, and thus pulled down more and more people to their destruction{{sfnp|Kaufmann|1947|p=72}}}}

== Flight from Latvia ==
&lt;!--German Wikipedia material starts here--&gt;
In October 1944, out of fear of the approaching Soviet armies, the SS personnel of the concentration camp system in Latvia fled the country by sea from Riga or [[Liepāja]] to [[Danzig]], taking with them several thousand concentration camp inmates, many of whom did not survive the voyage.{{sfnp|Ezergailis|1996|pp=361–364}}

== Escape to Argentina ==
{{See also|Ratlines (history)}}
[[File:Roschmann Argentine identification.jpg|thumb|False Argentine identification issued to Roschmann in the name of "Federico Wegener".]]
In 1945, Roschmann was arrested in Graz but later released.{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}} &lt;!--German Wikipedia material starts here--&gt;Roschmann concealed himself as an ordinary prisoner of war, and in so doing obtained a release from custody in 1947. After that however he became imprudent and visited his wife in Graz. He was recognised with the assistance of former concentration camp inmates and arrested by the [[Royal Military Police|British military police]]. Roschmann was sent to [[Dachau concentration camp]] which had been converted to an imprisonment camp for accused war criminals. Roschmann succeeded in escaping from this custody.
&lt;!--German Wikipedia material ends here.--&gt;
In 1948 Roschmann was able to flee Germany. He travelled first to [[Genoa]] in [[Italy]], and from there to [[Argentina]] by ship, on a pass supplied by the [[International Red Cross]]. Roschmann was assisted in this effort by [[Alois Hudal]], a strongly pro-Nazi [[bishop]] of the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfnp|Goñi|2002|pp=243, 250}} Roschmann arrived in Argentina either on 10 February 1948{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}} or 2 October 1948{{sfnp|Goñi|2002|pp=243, 250}} (2/10/1948 or 10/2/1948, depending on [[Date and time notation by country|date notation]] used). He founded a wood import-export firm in [[Buenos Aires]].{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}} &lt;!--German Wikipedia material starts here.--&gt; In 1955 in Argentina Roschmann married, although he was not divorced from his first wife.&lt;!--German Wikipedia material ends here--&gt; His second wife left him in 1958; the marriage was later declared null and void.&lt;ref name="forum.axishistory.com"&gt;[http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=18536 Axis History forum]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, under the name "Frederico Wagner" (sometimes seen as "Federico Wegener") he became a citizen of Argentina.{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}}

== Criminal charges ==
In 1959 a warrant was issued in Germany for him on a charge of bigamy.&lt;ref name="forum.axishistory.com"/&gt; In 1960, the criminal court in Graz issued a warrant for the arrest of Roschmann on charges of murder and severe violations of human rights in connection with the killing of at least 3,000 Jews between 1938 and 1945, overseeing forced labourers at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and the murder of at least 800 children under the age of 10.{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}} However, the post-war Austrian legal system was ineffective in securing the return for trial of Austrians who had fled Europe, and no action was ever taken against Roschmann based on this charge. In 1963, the district court in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]] issued a warrant for the arrest of Roschmann. This would eventually prove a more serious threat to Roschmann.{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}}

== Extradition negotiations ==
In October 1976, the embassy of West Germany in Argentina initiated a request for the [[extradition]] of Roschmann to Germany to face charges of multiple murders of Jews during the Second World War. This was based on the request of the West German prosecutor's office in Hamburg.{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}} The request was repeated in May 1977.&lt;ref name = StateCable&gt;[http://foia.state.gov/documents/Argentina/0000A26C.pdf Declassified State Department cable, dated 7 July 1977, ¶12, on pages 5–6] (available at U.S. State Dept. Freedom of Information Act website.)&lt;/ref&gt;  On 5 July 1977, the office of the President of Argentina issued a communiqué, which was published in the Argentine press, that the government of Argentina would consider the request even though there was no [[extradition treaty]] with West Germany.&lt;ref name = StateCable/&gt;  The communiqué was reported to be a surprise to both the Argentine Foreign Ministry and the West German embassy.&lt;ref name = StateCable/&gt;  The Argentine Foreign Embassy had not received a request that Roschmann be arrested. Roschmann was in fact still not under arrest at the time the communiqué was issued.&lt;ref name = StateCable/&gt;

At that time, a number of Germans had been arrested by the Argentine government, then under military control, and were facing charges before military tribunals. The Argentine government had also failed to account for the death of a West German citizen in unusual circumstances, apparently related to the conduct of the so-called [[Dirty War]] then being conducted by the Argentine government against alleged terrorists within the country. This was regarded by the West German government as a breach of international treaty obligations.&lt;ref name = StateCable/&gt;  In addition, the prominent Argentine journalist, [[Jacobo Timmerman]], a Jew, had been arrested at that time and held incommunicado under circumstances which raised concern that he had been "subjected to ill-treatment" while in custody.&lt;ref name = StateCable/&gt;

Roschmann then fled to [[Paraguay]].{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}}

The U.S. Embassy in Argentina sent a cable to the State Department which reported the situation and contained the following comment:
{{quote|text=The public and undiplomatic handling of the Argentine announcement concerning Roschmann raised speculation that it was a political move designed to placate the West Germans of human rights complaints and throw off charges of anti-Semitic attitudes within the government.  ... [T]he timing of the announcement on the extradition case appears to be an effort to appease an irate West German government. It has also been noted that the publicity surrounding the announcement will give Roschmann adequate time to prepare for avoiding arrest.&lt;ref name = StateCable/&gt;}}

== Apparent death ==
Roschmann may have died in [[Asuncion]], [[Paraguay]] on 8 August 1977.{{sfnp|Rathkolb|2004|p=232–7, 264}}
The body initially went unclaimed, and questions were raised as to whether the dead man was, in fact, Roschmann.&lt;ref name = FreeLanceStar&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19770812&amp;id=c-oQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-ooDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3764,1408981 Associated Press story reprinted in ''The Free Lance Star'', 12 August 1977, page 8 (headline: "Mystery Body may be 'Butcher of Riga'").]&lt;/ref&gt;  The body bore papers in the name of "Federico Wegener", a known Roschmann [[Pseudonym|alias]], and was missing two toes on one foot and three on the other, consistent with Roschmann's known war injuries.&lt;ref name = FreeLanceStar/&gt;  Emilio Wolf, a [[delicatessen]] owner in Asuncion who had been a prisoner under Roschmann, positively identified the body as Roschmann's. Simon Wiesenthal, however, was sceptical of the identification, noting that Roschmann had been spotted in [[Bolivia]] only one month earlier. "I wonder who died for him?" he said.&lt;ref name = FreeLanceStar/&gt;

== Fictional portrayal ==
A fictionalised version of Roschmann was given in [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s novel ''[[The Odessa File]]''. A [[The Odessa File (film)|film version]] of the novel was released in 1974, where Roschmann was played by Austrian actor [[Maximilian Schell]].&lt;ref name = OdessaFilm&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0071935|title=The Odessa File}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book and the film, Roschmann is portrayed as a ruthlessly efficient killer. Nazi hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]] was portrayed in the film by actor [[Shmuel Rodensky]]. Wiesenthal himself also functioned as a "documentary advisor".&lt;ref name = OdessaFilm/&gt;  Historian Schneider sharply disputes this fictionalised image of Roschmann. She describes this fiction novel as "lurid" and containing "many inaccuracies".{{sfnp|Schneider|1995|p=78}} Among the inaccuracies of Forsyth's fictional version of Roschmann are:
* Roschmann never murdered a [[Wehrmacht]] captain at the Latvian port of Liepāja to force his way onto an evacuation ship.{{sfnp|Wiesenthal|1990|p=991}}
* No mention is made of [[Rudolf Lange]], whom Schneider describes as the real Butcher of Riga.
* Krause is portrayed as Roschmann's deputy, rather than as his predecessor.{{sfnp|Schneider|1979|p=75}}
* [[Alois Hudal]] is incorrectly identified as the "German apostolic nuncio" and a cardinal.&lt;ref name = SanFilippo&gt;[http://www.stiftung-sozialgeschichte.de/index.php?selection=17&amp;zeigebeitrag=14&amp;printview=printtemplate.htm&amp;PHPSESSID=109f842c82321c361142b294ffd836f7#anmerkung San Filippo, Matteo, ''Ratlines and Unholy Trinities''], Siftung für Sozialgeschichte des 20.Jahrhundrets (footnotes omitted from direct quotes).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Roschmann is described as having been sheltered in a "big" Franciscan house in Genoa which apparently never existed.&lt;ref name = SanFilippo/&gt;
* [[ODESSA]] is portrayed as having purchased 7,000 Argentinian passports for people like Roschmann. No explanation is given for why, if this were so, Roschmann would need a travel document from the International Red Cross.&lt;ref name = SanFilippo/&gt;
* The head of ODESSA is identified as former SS General [[Richard Glücks]], who in fact committed suicide in 1945.

Researcher Matteo San Filippo, who studied the issue of the discrepancies between the fictional and the real Roschmann, gives the following analysis: 
"We cannot blame Forsyth for being inaccurate. He was writing a thriller, not an historical essay. The incidents were based on fact and the overall impression was not inaccurate (for example, some religious houses did shelter the wanted, just not in Genoa. Roschmann did murder many people, but not a Wehrmacht captain. ODESSA did supply faked travel documents of different kinds. And so on)."&lt;ref name = SanFilippo/&gt;

The role of Wiesenthal in the genesis of the novel is more interesting. Later, the Nazi hunter confessed that he wanted to influence the writer. In fact, Wiesenthal was using the thriller to force Roschmann out into the open, which is what actually happened.
Wiesenthal himself, in his 1990 book ''Justice Not Vengeance'', admitted that he had suggested, in response to Forsyth's inquiry, that Forsyth's book, and the later film, include fictional statements about Roschmann, and that he, Wiesenthal, had done so for the purpose of casting the light on Roschmann and forcing his arrest.&lt;ref name = NYT_JNV&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/13/books/nazi-hunting-trials-than-never-grow-cold.html Sanders, Robert, "Nazi Hunting: Trails that Never Grow Cold", ''New York Times'', May 13, 1990] review of Wiesenthal, Simon, ''Justice Not Vengeance'', New York: Grove Weidenfeld 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Roschmann was eventually identified and denounced by a man who had just watched ''The Odessa File'' at the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Helen (21 May 2011) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/8524091/Frederick-Forsyth-I-had-expected-women-to-hate-him.-But-no....html ''Frederick Forsyth: 'I had expected women to hate him.

'''Eulalia Ramos Sánchez''' (known as  '''Eulalia Buroz''' or '''Eulalia Chamberlain'''; 1795 - 7 April 1817) was a heroine of the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Miranda (state)|Miranda]], she was the daughter of Don Ignacio Ramos and Doña María Alejandra González Henriquez. She married Juan José Vásquez. In 1814, she moved to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. She stayed a while in Haiti before moving to [[Cumaná]] where she learned that her husband had been executed on the orders of the Spanish General Monteverde. She then married the English Colonel, [[Charles Chamberlain (English military officer)|Charles Chamberlain]], who was attached to the Staff of General Bolivar. Chamberlain had been severely wounded in the battle of Unare Barracks, and took refuge with Eulalia in Venezuela in [[Barcelona, Anzoátegui]].

On 7 April 1817 the Royalist Army took Barcelona. The town's entire population took refuge in the Convent of San Francisco. After Chamberlain died in combat, Ramos attempted to move his body before being captured and beaten by a Spanish officer. He proposed that she gives up the independence cause in exchange for remaining alive, but she quickly took his gun and shot him in the chest, killing him instantly, while shouting "Viva la Patria -- mueran los tiranos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eulalia Ramos de Chamberlain|url=http://bicentenarioenlacapital.gdc.gob.ve/content/site/module/pages/op/displaypage/page_id/196/format/html/|publisher=Gobierno Bolivariano de Venezuela|accessdate=15 February 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately, the other Spaniards pounce on her, killing her with their bayonets, while the army fell into the hands of the royalist forces.

The '''GenI process'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1011107944|title=The Source of the Universe|last=Genreith|first=Siegfried|publisher=Books on Demand|others=|year=2017|isbn=9783848223572|location=Norderstedt|pages=44|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|iː|n|aɪ}} for Generic Intelligence) models team decision making by launching a chaotic competition between so-called ideas, where one idea after another dwindles out until exactly one remains. The decision statistics are completely determined by the process start configuration and match those known from [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurements]]. The random process accomplishes this in a natural way without any fine adjustment. Therefore, it is also of interest for the interpretation of physical processes.

In mathematical terms, the GenI process describes a time-discrete [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;X: [0,1] \times \mathbb{N}_0 \rightarrow 2^E&lt;/math&gt; in the state space of the [[Set (mathematics)|finite subsets]] of a [[countable set]] ''E'', together with a mapping &lt;math&gt;2^E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;  of the [[power set]] on ''E'' into an [[Vector space|n-dimensional complex vector space]]. In principle, it can be classified as a [[Markov chain]] of first order, with variable [[Markov chain|transition probabilities]] &lt;math&gt;P(X_{n+1} \mid X_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

There are two expressions of the GenI process, for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;.

== GenI process on eigenvector swarms ==

=== Background ===
The GenI [[Stochastic process|random process]] determines changes in the complex vector space from the random behavior of independent individuals within a [[Swarm behaviour|swarm]]-like construct. The swarm has a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] state &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j e_j \in \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, that controls the individual activities via a target function. The [[Amplitude|amplitudes]] &lt;math&gt;\beta_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; are also called ideas (cf "Generalized Quantum Modeling" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabora|first=Liane|last2=Kitto|first2=Kirsty|date=2017|title=Toward a Quantum Theory of Humor|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphy.2016.00053/full|journal=Frontiers in Physics|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fphy.2016.00053|issn=2296-424X}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The swarm takes one of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstates]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma e_j&lt;/math&gt;  after a finite number of steps, with the well-defined [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;\frac {\vert{\beta_j}\vert^2} {\sum_k {\vert \beta_k \vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The individuals follow defined rules and are allowed to make mistakes, based on the processes in simulated shoals of fish&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COUZIN|first=IAIN D.|last2=KRAUSE|first2=JENS|last3=JAMES|first3=RICHARD|last4=RUXTON|first4=GRAEME D.|last5=FRANKS|first5=NIGEL R.|authorlink5=Nigel R.

The GenI [[algorithm]] starts a [[Chaotics|chaotic]] [[decision-making]] process as a [[competition]] of ideas, such as running in a team that has to choose from a limited number of solutions to a given task. In the course of the process, a selection mechanism leads to ideas becoming extinct one after the other until finally just one survives that represents the solution to the problem.

==== Terminology ====
[[File:The_GenI_Process.jpg|alt=The GenI Process|thumb|The GenI Process: A GenI swarm constantly sucks null rings from its environment and burns them randomly. The GenI process sets a gradient towards reducing the excitation. The swarm’s state finally arrives at one of the given options.]]
Let ''E'' be a countable set and &lt;math&gt;\tilde E := \{ S \subset E : \vert S \vert &lt; \infty \} \subset 2^E&lt;/math&gt; the set of finite subsets of ''E''. Next &lt;math&gt;B = (e_1, \ldots, e_n)&lt;/math&gt; the [[canonical basis]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde B :=
\{i^k e_j : k = 0 \ldots 3, j = 1 \ldots n \}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

A given &lt;math&gt;\rho : E  \rightarrow \tilde B&lt;/math&gt; maps each element of ''E'' into &lt;math&gt;\tilde B&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall e \in \tilde B : \vert \rho^{-1} (\{e\}) \vert = \infty&lt;/math&gt;. For a set &lt;math&gt;S \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt;  the complex vector &lt;math&gt;\rho(S) := \sum_{s \in S} \rho(s)
= \sum_j \beta_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes its state with complex '''amplitudes''' &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;. Each such set ''S'' is called an Eigenvector-swarm or '''E-swarm'''.

A [[Ordered pair|pair]] &lt;math&gt;s, t \in E&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\rho(s) + \rho(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is a '''null pair'''. A [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null ring''' generated by &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists j : \rho(s_k) = i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt;.

A set &lt;math&gt;N \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null set''', if &lt;math&gt;\rho(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal null set &lt;math&gt;N \subset S&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of ''S'' and &lt;math&gt;S \setminus N&lt;/math&gt; the '''entropy free residual swarm'''.

The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_j (S) := 2 \frac {\vert \beta_j \vert \sqrt{\sum_{k \neq j} \vert \beta_k \vert^2}}
{\sum_{k=1}^n \vert \beta_k\vert^2} \in [0; 1]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the '''excitation''' of the swarm in index ''j''.

==== Algorithm ====
Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(l)} = S_D^{(l)} + N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; be a series of swarms (as an instantiation of &lt;math&gt;X(\omega, l)&lt;/math&gt;) with the respective separation into a maximal null swarm &lt;math&gt;N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; and the entropy free residual swarm &lt;math&gt;S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho(S^{(l)}) =\sum_{k=1}^{n} \beta_k^{(l)} e_k&lt;/math&gt; the respective state and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_j^{(l)} := \varepsilon_j(S^{(l)})&lt;/math&gt; the excitations.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and start with a given swarm &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': If &lt;math&gt;\forall j : \varepsilon_j^{(l)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then finish the process. 
# '''Step''': Each element &lt;math&gt;s  \in S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; generates an additional null ring within the swarm.
# '''Step''': Each null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; (including the newly generated) with &lt;math&gt;\rho( r)= i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho( t)= - i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt; gets selected with probability &lt;math&gt;p= \varepsilon_j^{(l) 2}&lt;/math&gt; (and "burned" in the next step). 
# '''Step''': For each selected null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, ''t'' leaves the swarm with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{r\})} {\varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{r\}) + \varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{t\})}&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise ''t'' stays and ''r'' leaves the swarm.
# '''Step''': The resulting swarm is &lt;math&gt;S^{(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow l+1&lt;/math&gt; and start over with step 2.

==== Interpretation ====
[[File:Competition_of_ideas_within_an_GenI_swarm.jpg|alt=Competition of ideas within an GenI swarm|thumb|Competition of ideas within an GenI swarm: Graph a shows the evolution of absolute amplitudes during a GenI process operating in a four options environment. Due to its intrinsically chaotic behavior, it is impossible to predict the GenI process evolution at any point. The option with the lowest initial chance finally wins.
Chart b shows the according evolution of entropy rising dramatically at the end for the winning idea. Figure c displays the native paths of each idea in the complex plane.

]]
As soon as the excitation disappears in each index, the process naturally comes to rest in step 4 (except for the hard abort condition in step 2), since no null pair is "burned" and the state of the swarm no longer changes. The role of the excitation here reminds of the dynamics of a grain of sand in the formation of the [[Ernst Chladni|Chladnic sound figures]]. On the other hand, excitation as a target in step 5 leads to a systematic distortion from 50% likelihood for an individual to remain. This leads here to an improved tendency to reduce the excitation. The following interpretation is obvious based on biological swarm behavior&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;: Each individual tends to follow the rule "reduce the excitation". It remains free in its decision to do nothing (step 4), to follow the rule, or to disregard it (step 5).

=== Simulation ===
The reference implementation under JAVA&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=WSG|title=BZuS: simulation software and test data for the GenI model (Java sources)|date=2018-01-17|url=https://github.com/genreith/BZuS|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows an excellent convergence of the process. The table shows an example of the result of 1000 simulation runs (each simulation run aborts after more than 500 iterations or for swarm sizes&gt; 10 million for performance reasons):

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)} = S&lt;/math&gt; be a given E-swarm with &lt;math&gt;\rho(S) = \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j a_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_j =
\vert \beta_j \vert&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\vert S \vert = \sqrt{\sum b_j^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;S : \mathbb{N}_0 \times [0; 1] \rightarrow \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; be a GenI process with  &lt;math&gt;\rho ( S^{(m)}(\omega))=\sum \beta_j^{(m)}(\omega) a_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;P \left(\tilde S^{(m)} \underset{m \rightarrow \infty}\longrightarrow \gamma a_j
\right) =P \left(\sum_{k \ne j} b_k^{(m) 2} \underset{m \rightarrow
\infty}\longrightarrow 0 \right) = \frac{b_j^2}{\vert {S} \vert^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== GenI process on Pauli swarms ==
The P(auli) process represents a special version of the GenI process for binary YES-NO decisions. It determines a time discrete [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;X: [0;1] \times \mathbb{N}_0 \mapsto 2^E&lt;/math&gt; in the state space of finite subsets of a countable set E, together with a map &lt;math&gt;\rho : 2^E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; from the power set on E into the [[Complex number|complex]] [[Matrix ring|matrix algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt;, a perspective vector &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; and a basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Background ===
[[File:Competition within a GenI-swarm.jpg|alt=Competition within a GenI-swarm|thumb|Competition within a GenI-swarm: The diagrams a-c demonstrate the Pauli process (as a special expression of the GenI process) evolution using a fixed perspective p = (1;1) under an external environment defined by the observable p3.
Diagrams d-f show another test case under the internal environment defined by the swarm itself. Graphs a/d show the evolution of absolute amplitudes. Charts b/e show the according evolution of entropy for each type according to the swarm member images in {p0, ... , p3}. Null pairs for P-swarm do not relate to environment options as is true for E-swarms. Figures c/f display the native paths of each idea in the complex plane.]]
The GenI random process determines changes in the complex vector space out of the random behavior of independent individuals within a swarm-like construct. The swarm ''S'' has an image &lt;math&gt; \rho(S) \in  \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; in the complex matrix algebra. Together with a perspective &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the state of the swarm is determined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \rho(S) v&lt;/math&gt;. A basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;  is called the environment and represents the options under which the swarm makes a decision. This can also be the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of &lt;math&gt; \rho(S) \in  \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; itself and so create a [[self-reference]]. The environment, perspective and state of the swarm control the individual activities via a target variable (excitation). The amplitudes &lt;math&gt;\beta_j a_j&lt;/math&gt; in the decomposition are also referred to as ideas with respect to the environment (see regarding "Generalized Quantum Modeling" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). The swarm takes one of the eigenstates &lt;math&gt;\gamma a_j&lt;/math&gt;  after a finite number of steps, with the well-defined probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\vert{\beta_j}\vert^2}  {{\vert \beta_1 \vert}^2 + {\vert \beta_2 \vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The individuals follow defined rules and are allowed to make mistakes, based on the processes in simulated shoals of fish&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The GenI algorithm starts a chaotic decision-making process as a competition of ideas, such as running in a team that has two possible solutions to a given task. In the course of the process, a selection mechanism leads to the survival of only one of the two ideas that represents the solution to the problem. The model in principal allows a moving environment.

The special properties of the P-process also allow interpretations of physical processes (see in particular [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s ur-alternatives (archetypal objects) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Weizsäcker, Carl Friedrich, Freiherr von, 1912–2007.|Title=Aufbau der Physik|Publisher=C. Hanser|PublicationPlace=München|ISBN=3446141421|Date=1985|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which he outlined for the reconstruction of quantum mechanics).

=== Definition ===

==== Terminology ====
Let ''E'' be a countable set and &lt;math&gt;\tilde E := \{ S \subset E : \vert S \vert &lt; \infty \} \subset 2^E&lt;/math&gt; the set of finite subsets of ''E''. Next &lt;math&gt;P = (p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3)
\subset \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Pauli matrices]] and &lt;math&gt;\tilde P :=
\{i^k p_j : k = 0, \ldots, 3, j = 1, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; the image of the '''[[Pauli matrices|Pauli group]]''' in the complex matrix algebra as its irreducible representation. Such a subset &lt;math&gt;S \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; is called a Pauli-swarm or a '''P-swarm'''.

A given &lt;math&gt;\rho : E  \rightarrow \tilde P&lt;/math&gt; maps each element of ''E'' onto one element of the Pauli group, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall e \in \tilde P : \vert \rho^{-1} (\{e\}) \vert = \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

A basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''environment''', a non zero vector &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; a '''perspective'''.

For a swarm &lt;math&gt;S \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;\rho(S)  := \sum_{s \in S} \rho(s)&lt;/math&gt; its matrix image, &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \rho(S) v := \beta_1 a_1 + \beta_2 a_2&lt;/math&gt; its '''state''' with complex '''amplitudes''' &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt; at the given environment and perspective.

A [[Ordered pair|pair]] &lt;math&gt;s, t \in E&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\rho(s) + \rho(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is a '''null pair'''. A [[Tuple (mathematics)|tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null ring''' generated by &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists j : \rho(s_k) = i^k p_j&lt;/math&gt;.

A set &lt;math&gt;N \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; is called '''null set''', if &lt;math&gt;\rho(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal null set &lt;math&gt;N \subset S&lt;/math&gt; ist called the '''entropy''' of ''S'' and &lt;math&gt;S \setminus N&lt;/math&gt; its '''entropy freed residual swarm'''.

The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon (S) := 2 \frac {\vert \beta_1 \vert   \vert \beta_2 \vert}
{\vert \beta_1\vert^2 +  \vert \beta_2\vert^2} \in [0; 1]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the '''excitation''' of the swarm.

==== Algorithm ====
Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(l)} = S_D^{(l)} + N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; be a series of swarms (as an instance von &lt;math&gt;X(\omega, l)&lt;/math&gt;) with the respective separation in a maximal null swarm &lt;math&gt;N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; and the entropy freed residual swarm &lt;math&gt;S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tilde S^{(l)} =\beta_1^{(l)} a_1 + \beta_2^{(l)} a_2&lt;/math&gt; the respective states and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{(l)} := \varepsilon(S^{(l)})&lt;/math&gt; the excitations.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and start with a given swarm &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': If &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon^{(l)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then finish the process.
# '''Step''': Each element &lt;math&gt;s  \in S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; generates an additional null ring within the swarm.
# '''Step''': Each null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; (including the newly generated) gets selected with probability &lt;math&gt;p= \varepsilon^{(l) 2}&lt;/math&gt; (and gets "burned" in next step).
# '''Step''': For each selected null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, ''t'' leaves the swarm with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\varepsilon(S \setminus \{r\})} {\varepsilon(S \setminus \{r\}) + \varepsilon(S \setminus \{t\})}&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise ''t'' stays and ''r'' leaves the swarm.
# '''Step''': The resulting swarm is &lt;math&gt;S^{(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow l+1&lt;/math&gt; and start over with step 2.

=== Simulation ===
[[File:GenI swarms observations along target values from 0 to 1.jpg|alt=GenI swarms observations along target values from 0 to 1|thumb|GenI swarms observations along target values from 0 to 1: The sample comprises 1000 measurements each on 201 test points on P(auli)-swarms (a special expression of a Geni swarm). More than 97% of observed frequencies are in the 2 sigma interval around the target values expected from quantum measurements. The chi square test value 92.6 is much lower than the critical level 168 at 95% confidence and 200 degrees of freedom.]]
The reference implementation under JAVA&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; shows an excellent convergence of the process at any fixed environment and perspective according to the chart right hand.

The results support the '''statement of convergence (hypothesis)''':

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)} = S&lt;/math&gt; be a given P-swarm with &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \beta_1 a_1 + \beta_2 a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_j =
\vert \beta_j \vert&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\vert S \vert = \sqrt{b_1^2 + b_2^2}&lt;/math&gt;, at any fixed environment &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2)&lt;/math&gt;and perspective ''v''. 

Let &lt;math&gt;S : \mathbb{N}_0 \times [0; 1] \rightarrow \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; be a P-process with  &lt;math&gt;\tilde S^{(m)}(\omega)=\beta_1^{(m)}(\omega) a_1 + \beta_2^{(m)}(\omega) a_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;P \left(\tilde S^{(m)} \underset{m \rightarrow \infty}\longrightarrow \gamma a_j
\right) =P \left(\sum_{k \ne j} b_k^{(m) 2} \underset{m \rightarrow
\infty}\longrightarrow 0 \right) = \frac{b_j^2}{\vert {S} \vert^2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;j,k \in \{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Carew arms.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of Carew: ''Or, three lions passant in pale sable'']]

'''Sir George Carew''' (c. 1504 – 19 July 1545) was an English soldier, admiral and adventurer during the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] who died in the sinking of the [[Royal Navy]] flagship ''[[Mary Rose]]'' at the [[Battle of the Solent]] during an attempted French invasion in the [[Italian War of 1542–1546]]. Scion of a controversial and dramatic family, Carew had a wild youth and explored widely, being arrested several times of associating with rebellious vassals of the king. Carew successfully tamed this nature in his later years, during which he became a trusted advisor and military officer in the King's service.

==Origins==
He was the son and heir of Sir William Carew (died 1538) of [[Mohuns Ottery]] near [[Luppitt]] in [[Devon]] by his wife Joane Courtenay, second daughter of Sir William I Courtenay (died 1485) of [[Powderham Castle|Powderham]], [[Sheriff of Devon]] in 1488.&lt;ref&gt;Vivian, Heralds' Visitation of Devon, 1895, p.135, pedigree of Carew; p.246, pedigree of Courtenay&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of George Carew's birth is unknown, but it is thought{{By whom|date=March 2011}} to have occurred between 1497 and 1504.

==Childhood==
George and his brother [[Peter Carew (died 1575)|Peter Carew]] were sent to be educated in the household of their mother's cousin [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter]]. There they learned from adventurous relatives like their uncle [[Gawen Carew]] and kinsman [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]], the latter of whom was later arrested and executed for treason.

==Youth==
Carew trained in the law, but swiftly became bored and in 1526 was in [[Blois]], France, seeking service with [[Louise of Savoy]], the French Regent. This attempt to serve a foreign power came to nothing, and was pardoned by King Henry VIII in November of the same year. The King also overlooked his youthful indiscretions with the followers of [[Elizabeth Barton]] and encouraged responsible behaviour in the young man.

==Career==
Carew became interested in politics in the early 1530s and briefly sat in 1529 as a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/carew-george-1505-45 History of Parliament biography]&lt;/ref&gt; and later served as [[High Sheriff of Devon]] (for 1536 and 1542), during which period he was knighted. Carew was also married for the first time during the 1530s, to Thomasine Pollard, daughter of Sir [[Lewis Pollard (judge)|Lewis Pollard]] (c. 1465 – 1540), [[Justice of the Common Pleas]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38895?docPos=2 Carew, Sir George], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J. P. D. Cooper, Retrieved 10 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1537, Carew was given his first sea commission, serving in the [[English Channel]] under Sir [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland|John Dudley]] during operations against pirates. In the following year 1538 he inherited his father's estates and returned to Devon to serve as [[Justice of the Peace]]. In 1539 Carew's wife Thomasine Pollard died and he again entered the King's service, taking over the strategically vital fort of [[Rysbank]] in the [[Calais Pale]]. The fort's previous commander and Carew's kinsman [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]] had paid with his life for his machinations against the King. George Carew was disgusted with the poor state of readiness and repair in which he found the fort and set about effecting repairs and became involved in the administration of Calais under its [[Deputy of Calais|Deputy]] [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Government service==
Carew took pains during this period to distance himself from the [[Roman Catholic]] upbringing he had in the household of the Marquess of Exeter and openly supported [[Protestant]] groups who had fled to Calais after persecution elsewhere in Europe. His stance on this issue brought admiration from several contemporaries, including [[John Foxe]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Carew was with the deputation which met [[Anne of Cleves]] in December 1539 and the following year he was briefly arrested and questioned in relation to a plan to hand Rysbank over to the French, a plot in which Lisle was implicated but Carew apparently was not. In the late autumn of 1540 Carew remarried, to Mary Norris,  daughter of the courtier Sir [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norreys]] of Berkshire, and the couple settled at [[Polslo Priory]] near [[Exeter]]. Carew had taken his position seriously, and was rewarded with a second term as sheriff in 1542 and was appointed Steward of the possessions of the Marquis of Exeter, a role with annual salary of £30. Two years later in 1544 he was made lieutenant of the [[Gentlemen Pensioners]] and was awarded the large salary of £365 a year.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Apparently bored with Rysbank and political life, in the summer of 1543 Carew applied to join the army of [[John Wallop|Sir John Wallop]] in [[Flanders]] as a lieutenant general of horse. Although Carew was an accomplished jouster, he was tactically inexperienced and learned the military arts through his position on Wallop's army council. With his brother Peter, George Carew saw action in skirmishes outside the French-held towns of [[Thérouanne]] and [[siege of Landrecies|Landrecies]] during Wallop's campaigns against those towns. At Landrecis, Carew twice came close to disaster, almost being killed by a sniper's bullet during the summer and in November actually being captured after pursuing a fleeing band of French cavalry too far and finding himself isolated. He was soon freed however at the express request of King Henry VIII and was returned to the English army.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1544 Carew raised twenty soldiers to join Wallop's campaign against [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and  was also given a subordinate naval command under Dudley in the English Channel.

==Drowning in the ''Mary Rose''==
[[File:Cowdray engraving-full-lowres.jpg|thumb|300px|Battle of the Solent, at which Carew lost his life. "Cowdray engraving" c. 1545]]
In July 1545, with a French invasion expected, Carew was summoned to King Henry VIII's council of war aboard his flagship ''[[Great Harry]]'' in [[Portsmouth]]. There Carew was appointed Vice-Admiral in charge of the fleet in Portsmouth and presented with a golden whistle as symbol of  office.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; The French fleet landed on the [[Isle of Wight]] the same day and shortly afterwards sailed for Portsmouth. The French force greatly outnumbered the English, comprising 175 ships including 25 great [[galley]]s. Carew, as captain of the ''[[Mary Rose]]'', the vice-flagship of the English [[carrack]] fleet,&lt;ref name = Loades&gt;{{cite|first = David|last = [[David Loades|Loades]]|article = More documents for the last campaign of the ''Mary Rose''|title = The Naval Miscellany|volume = VIII|editor = Brian Vale|publisher = Routledge|year = 2017|ISBN = 978-1-138-21979-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; sailed to confront them and met with disaster.

Though it may never be known exactly why the ''Mary Rose'' sank in the entrance to Portsmouth harbour on 19 July 1545, it is believed that water entered open gunports after firing a broadside and the ship went down in minutes.&lt;ref name = Loades/&gt; The report that Carew's last words called out to his uncle Gawen Carew aboard an accompanying ship, that "I have the sort of knaves I cannot rule", may indicate command and discipline problems. Carew had only taken command of the ship that same day and his authority was far from established. The dangerous combination of winds, tides and shallows makes the [[Solent]] a particularly hazardous body of water. Modern studies have also indicated that the aging 700-ton warship was dangerously overloaded, with heavy bronze cannon that she was not designed to carry, and nearly 500 men aboard, many dressed in full armour.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;  Forensic examination of the crew's skulls, has revealed that the majority of the men aboard 'Mary Rose' the day she foundered were probably from Southern Europe, maybe mercenaries or prisoners of war.

Henry VIII watched from [[Southsea Castle]] as the ''Mary Rose'' heeled over and sank shortly after joining the battle, and heard the screams of her drowning crew, most of whom were trapped beneath a heavy anti-boarding net stretched across her [[weather deck]]. Of the 500 men aboard less than 25 survived and Carew was not among them. His body was never recovered. Despite the disaster, the French fleet failed to engage effectively with the English and turned away to perform minor raids elsewhere on the coast and  returned to France in August. Carew's widow was given a job in the royal household as a lady in waiting to the King's daughters princesses [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. She later married Sir [[Arthur Champernowne]], and died in 1570. When the ''Mary Rose'' was raised nearly 450 years later, pewter plates stamped with "G.C.", Carew's initials, were among the artifacts recovered from the wreck.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Marriages==
George Carew married twice, but left no children:
*Firstly to Thomasine Pollard (died 1539), daughter of Sir [[Lewis Pollard (judge)|Lewis Pollard]] (c. 1465 – 21 October 1526), [[Justice of the Common Pleas]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;
*Secondly, in late autumn of 1540, to Mary Norris (died 1570),  daughter of the courtier Sir [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norreys]] of Berkshire. She later married Sir [[Arthur Champernowne]].

Two types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was initially discovered and termed both lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) and human T-lymphotropic virus 3 (HTLV-III). HIV-1 is more [[virulence|virulent]] and more [[infectivity|infective]] than HIV-2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert PB, McKeague IW, Eisen G, Mullins C, Guéye-NDiaye A, Mboup S, Kanki PJ | title = Comparison of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infectivity from a prospective cohort study in Senegal | journal = Statistics in Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 573–593 | date = February 28, 2003 | pmid = 12590415 | doi = 10.1002/sim.1342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2, compared to HIV-1, implies that fewer of those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Due to its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reeves JD, Doms RW | title = Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 | journal = [[Journal of General Virology]] | volume = 83 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1253–65 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12029140 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-83-6-1253| url = http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/83/6/1253.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HIV-genome.png|thumb|upright=2.05|Structure of the RNA genome of HIV-1]]
The RNA genome consists of at least seven structural landmarks ([[Long terminal repeat|LTR]], [[Trans-activation response element (TAR)|TAR]], [[HIV Rev response element|RRE]], PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'', ''tat'', ''rev'', ''nef'', ''vif'', ''vpr'', ''vpu'', and sometimes a tenth ''tev'', which is a fusion of ''tat'', ''env'' and ''rev''), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, ''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'', contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles.&lt;ref name=compendia /&gt; For example, ''env'' codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41.

===Tropism===
{{Main|HIV tropism}}
[[File:HIV Mature and Immature.PNG|thumb|right|Diagram of the immature and mature forms of HIV]]
The term [[viral tropism]] refers to the cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as [[Helper T cell|CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cells]], [[macrophage]]s, and [[microglial cell]]s. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells' membrane and also with [[chemokine]] [[co-receptor]]s.&lt;ref name=Chan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrildt|first1=Kathryn Twigg|last2=Joseph|first2=Sarah Beth|last3=Swanstrom|first3=Ronald|title=The HIV-1 Env Protein: A Coat of Many Colors|journal=Current HIV/AIDS Reports|date=March 2012|issue=Current HIV/AIDS Reports|pages=53–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, macrophages play a key role in several critical aspects of HIV infection. They appear to be the first cells infected by HIV and perhaps the source of HIV production when CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; cells become depleted in the patient. Macrophages and microglial cells are the cells infected by HIV in the [[central nervous system]]. In the [[tonsil]]s and [[adenoids]] of HIV-infected patients, macrophages fuse into multinucleated [[giant cell]]s that produce huge amounts of virus.

T-tropic strains of HIV-1, or [[syncytia]]-inducing strains (SI; now called X4 viruses&lt;ref name="pmid9440686" /&gt;) replicate in primary CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cells as well as in macrophages and use the ''α''-chemokine receptor, [[CXCR4]], for entry.&lt;ref name=Coakley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Deng&gt;

Dual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of HIV-1 and thus are able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors for viral entry.

The ''α''-chemokine [[SDF-1 (biology)|SDF-1]], a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by [[Downregulation and upregulation|down-regulating]] the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of HIV target cells. M-tropic HIV-1 isolates that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of co-receptors alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection&lt;ref name="Coakley" /&gt; and HIV can also infect a subtype of [[myeloid dendritic cells]],&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knight SC, Macatonia SE, Patterson S | title = HIV I infection of dendritic cells | journal = [[International Review of Immunology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 163–75 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2152500 | doi = 10.3109/08830189009056627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which probably constitute a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]] that maintains infection when CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.

[[Sexual intercourse]] is the major mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV are present in the [[seminal fluid]], which enables the virus to be transmitted from a male to his [[sexual partner]]. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process{{Explain|reason=explain the selection process|date=August 2018}} leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway.&lt;ref name="Zhu1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu T, Mo H, Wang N, Nam DS, Cao Y, Koup RA, Ho DD | title = Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of HIV-1 patients with primary infection | journal = Science | volume = 261 | issue = 5125 | pages = 1179–81 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8356453 | doi = 10.1126/science.8356453 | bibcode = 1993Sci...261.1179Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wout"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van't Wout AB, Kootstra NA, Mulder-Kampinga GA, Albrecht-van Lent N, Scherpbier HJ, Veenstra J, Boer K, Coutinho RA, Miedema F, Schuitemaker H | title = Macrophage-tropic variants initiate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection after sexual, parenteral, and vertical transmission | journal = Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 94 | issue = 5 | pages = 2060–7 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7962552 | pmc = 294642 | doi = 10.1172/JCI117560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhu1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu T, Wang N, Carr A, Nam DS, Moor-Jankowski R, Cooper DA, Ho DD | title = Genetic characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in blood and genital secretions: evidence for viral compartmentalization and selection during sexual transmission | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 3098–107 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8627789 | pmc = 190172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4.&lt;ref name="Clevestig"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clevestig P, Maljkovic I, Casper C, Carlenor E, Lindgren S, Navér L, Bohlin AB, Fenyö EM, Leitner T, Ehrnst A | title = The X4 phenotype of HIV type 1 evolves from R5 in two children of mothers, carrying X4, and is not linked to transmission | journal = AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 371–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15929699 | doi = 10.1089/aid.2005.21.371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore JP | title = Coreceptors: implications for HIV pathogenesis and therapy | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5309 | pages = 51–2 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9122710 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5309.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS.

HIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1 and is restricted in its worldwide distribution to [[West Africa]]. The adoption of "accessory genes" by HIV-2 and its more [[Enzyme promiscuity|promiscuous]] pattern of co-receptor usage (including CD4-independence) may assist the virus in its adaptation to avoid innate restriction factors present in host cells. Adaptation to use normal cellular machinery to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host, but ultimately become a [[commensal]] organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants that are more successful at transmission will be selected.&lt;ref name="CheneyandMcKnight"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Cheney K, McKnight A |chapter=HIV-2 Tropism and Disease | year=2010 |title=Lentiviruses and Macrophages: Molecular and Cellular Interactions | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn=978-1-904455-60-8 }}{{page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replication and transcription====

The integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=Zheng /&gt; To actively produce the virus, certain cellular [[transcription factor]]s need to be present, the most important of which is [[NF-κB|NF-''κ''B]] (nuclear factor kappa&amp;nbsp;B), which is upregulated when T cells become activated.&lt;ref name=Hiscott&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiscott J, Kwon H, Génin P | title = Hostile takeovers: viral appropriation of the NF-kB pathway | journal = Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–151 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11160127 | pmc = 199181 | doi = 10.1172/JCI11918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that those cells most likely to be targeted, entered and subsequently killed by HIV are those actively fighting infection.

During viral replication, the integrated DNA [[provirus]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into RNA, some of which then undergo [[RNA splicing]] to produce mature [[messenger RNA]]s (mRNAs). These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the [[cytoplasm]], where they are [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] into the regulatory proteins [[Tat (HIV)|Tat]] (which encourages new virus production) and [[Rev (HIV)|Rev]]. As the newly produced Rev protein is produced it moves to the nucleus, where it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus.&lt;ref name=Pollard&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pollard VW, Malim MH | title = The HIV-1 Rev protein | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 491–532 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9891806 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.491 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1128/JVI.76.7.3089-3094.2002| title = Destiny of Unspliced Retroviral RNA: Ribosome and/or Virion?| journal = Journal of Virology| volume = 76| issue = 7| pages = 3089–94| year = 2002| last1 = Butsch | first1 = M.| last2 = Boris-Lawrie | first2 = K.| pmc = 136024| pmid = 11884533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recombination====
{{Further|Genetic recombination}}
Two RNA genomes are encapsidated in each HIV-1 particle (see [[Structure and genome of HIV]]). Upon infection and replication catalyzed by reverse transcriptase, recombination between the two genomes can occur.&lt;ref name="Hu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu WS, Temin HM | title = Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4985 | pages = 1227–33 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1700865 | doi = 10.1126/science.1700865 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1227H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charpentier"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charpentier C, Nora T, Tenaillon O, Clavel F, Hance AJ | title = Extensive recombination among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 quasispecies makes an important contribution to viral diversity in individual patients | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 80 | issue = 5 | pages = 2472–82 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16474154 | pmc = 1395372 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.80.5.2472-2482.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombination occurs as the single-strand, positive-sense RNA genomes are reverse transcribed to form DNA. During reverse transcription, the nascent DNA can switch multiple times between the two copies of the viral RNA. This form of recombination is known as copy-choice. Recombination events may occur throughout the genome. Anywhere from two to 20 recombination events per genome may occur at each replication cycle, and these events can rapidly shuffle the genetic information that is transmitted from parental to progeny genomes.&lt;ref name="Charpentier" /&gt;

Viral recombination produces genetic variation that likely contributes to the [[evolution]] of resistance to [[Management of HIV/AIDS|anti-retroviral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nora T, Charpentier C, Tenaillon O, Hoede C, Clavel F, Hance AJ | title = Contribution of recombination to the evolution of human immunodeficiency viruses expressing resistance to antiretroviral treatment | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 81 | issue = 14 | pages = 7620–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17494080 | pmc = 1933369 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00083-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen J, Powell D, Hu WS | title = High frequency of genetic recombination is a common feature of primate lentivirus replication | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 80 | issue = 19 | pages = 9651–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16973569 | pmc = 1617242 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00936-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonhoeffer ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Bonhoeffer&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonhoeffer S, Chappey C, Parkin NT, Whitcomb JM, Petropoulos CJ | title = Evidence for positive epistasis in HIV-1 | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue = 5701 | pages = 1547–50 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15567861 | doi = 10.1126/science.1101786 | bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1547B }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that template switching by reverse transcriptase acts as a repair process to deal with breaks in the single-stranded RNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin&lt;ref name=Hu /&gt; suggested that recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged single-stranded RNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized whether or not the two genomes differ genetically. On the view that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.&lt;ref name=Bonhoeffer /&gt;

HIV-1 infection causes [[chronic inflammation]] and production of [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Israël N, Gougerot-Pocidalo MA | title = Oxidative stress in human immunodeficiency virus infection | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 53 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 864–70 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9447238 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to [[oxidative damage]]s, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, as well as for viruses in general, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen species. Thus, Michod ''et al.''&lt;ref name="pmid18295550"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infection, Genetics and Evolution | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–85 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18295550 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 | url = http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.

====Assembly and release====
[[File:HIV on macrophage.png|thumb|right|HIV assembling on the [[Cell membrane|surface]] of an infected [[macrophage]]. The HIV virions have been marked with a green [[fluorescent tag]] and then viewed under a fluorescent microscope.]]
The final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the [[plasma membrane]] of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and is transported to the [[Golgi apparatus]] where it is [[Bond cleavage|cleaved]] by [[furin]] resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, [[gp41]] and [[gp120]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallenberger S, Bosch V, Angliker H, Shaw E, Klenk HD, Garten W | title = Inhibition of furin-mediated cleavage activation of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp160 | journal = Nature | volume = 360 | issue = 6402 | pages = 358–61 | date = November 26, 1992 | pmid = 1360148 | doi = 10.1038/360358a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.360..358H }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are transported to the plasma membrane of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the [[Group-specific antigen|gag]] polyproteins still need to be cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by antiretroviral drugs of the [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion.&lt;ref name=Gelderblom&gt;{{cite book | author= Gelderblom HR | year = 1997 | title = HIV sequence compendium | chapter = Fine structure of HIV and SIV |chapterurl=http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/COMPENDIUM/1997/partIII/Gelderblom.pdf | editor = Los Alamos National Laboratory | edition = | pages = 31–44 | publisher = [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.

===Spread within the body===
[[File:Virus infecting lymphocytes.gif|left|thumb|Animation demonstrating cell-free spread of HIV.]]
The classical process of infection of a cell by a virion can be called "cell-free spread" to distinguish it from a more recently recognized process called "cell-to-cell spread".&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang C, Zhou S, Groppelli E, Pellegrino P, Williams I, Borrow P, Chain BM, Jolly C | title = Hybrid Spreading Mechanisms and T Cell Activation Shape the Dynamics of HIV-1 Infection | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = e1004179 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25837979 | pmc = 4383537 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004179 | arxiv = 1503.08992 | bibcode = 2015PLSCB..11E4179Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cell-free spread (see figure), virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood or [[extracellular fluid]] and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt; HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread, for which two pathways have been described. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a [[Viral synapse|virological synapse]].&lt;ref name="Arthos" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jolly&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jolly C, Kashefi K, Hollinshead M, Sattentau QJ | title = HIV-1 cell to cell transfer across an Env-induced, actin-dependent synapse | journal = Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 199 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–293 | year = 2004| pmid = 14734528 | pmc = 2211771 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20030648 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, an [[Antigen-presenting cell|antigen-presenting cell (APC)]], such as a macrophage or dendritic cell, can transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions ''in trans'' (in the case of dendritic cells).&lt;ref name=Sattentau&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattentau Q | title = Avoiding the void: cell-to-cell spread of human viruses | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 815–826 | year = 2008| pmid = 18923409 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer is reported to be much more efficient than cell-free virus spread.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duncan CJ, Russell RA, Sattentau QJ | title = High multiplicity HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission from macrophages to CD4+ T cells limits antiretroviral efficacy | journal = AIDS | volume = 27 | issue = 14 | pages = 2201–2206 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24005480 | pmc = 4714465 | doi = 10.1097/QAD.0b013e3283632ec4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells, which minimizes fluid-phase [[diffusion]] of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell towards the contact zone.&lt;ref name="Jolly" /&gt; Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in [[lymphoid tissue]]s where CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are densely packed and likely to interact frequently.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt; Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=Sewald&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sewald X, Gonzalez DG, Haberman AM, Mothes W | title = In vivo imaging of virological synapses | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 3 | pages = 1320 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23271654 | pmc = 3784984 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms2338 | bibcode = 2012NatCo...3E1320S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The many spreading mechanisms available to HIV contribute to the virus' ongoing replication in spite of anti-retroviral therapies.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sigal&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigal A, Kim JT, Balazs AB, Dekel E, Mayo A, Milo R, Baltimore D | title = Cell-to-cell spread of HIV permits ongoing replication despite antiretroviral therapy | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7362 | pages = 95–98 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21849975 | doi = 10.1038/nature10347 | bibcode = 2011Natur.477...95S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic variability===
{{Further|Subtypes of HIV}}
[[File:HIV-SIV-phylogenetic-tree straight.svg|thumb|left|The [[phylogenetic tree]] of the SIV and HIV]]
HIV differs from many viruses in that it has very high [[genetic variability]]. This diversity is a result of its fast [[HIV#Replication cycle|replication cycle]], with the generation of about 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; virions every day, coupled with a high [[mutation rate]] of approximately 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; per [[Nucleobase|nucleotide base]] per cycle of replication and [[Genetic recombination|recombinogenic]] properties of reverse transcriptase.&lt;ref name=RobertsonDL&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson DL, Hahn BH, Sharp PM | title = Recombination in AIDS viruses | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–59 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7723052 | doi = 10.1007/BF00163230 | bibcode = 1995JMolE..40..249R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rambaut_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rambaut A, Posada D, Crandall KA, Holmes EC | title = The causes and consequences of HIV evolution | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 52–61 | pages = 52–61 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14708016 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1246 | url = http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/downloadPaper.php?id=242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17960579"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perelson AS, Ribeiro RM | title = Estimating drug efficacy and viral dynamic parameters: HIV and HCV | journal = Statistics in Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 23 | pages = 4647–57 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 17960579 | doi = 10.1002/sim.3116  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day.&lt;ref name=RobertsonDL /&gt; This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When [[Coinfection|simultaneous infection]] occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral [[DNA sequence]] that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes.&lt;ref name=RobertsonDL /&gt; This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.&lt;ref name=RobertsonDL /&gt;

The closely related [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) has evolved into many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the [[Chlorocebus|African green monkey]] (SIVagm) and [[sooty mangabey]] (SIVsmm) are thought to have a long evolutionary history with their hosts.

In contrast, when these strains infect species that have not adapted to SIV ("heterologous" or similar hosts such as [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus]] or [[Crab-eating macaque|cynomologus macaques]]), the animals develop AIDS and the virus generates [[genetic diversity]] similar to what is seen in human HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daniel MD, King NW, Letvin NL, Hunt RD, Sehgal PK, Desrosiers RC | title = A new type D retrovirus isolated from macaques with an immunodeficiency syndrome | journal = Science | volume = 223 | issue = 4636 | pages = 602–5 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6695172 | doi = 10.1126/science.6695172 | bibcode = 1984Sci...223..602D }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chimpanzee]] SIV (SIVcpz), the closest genetic relative of HIV-1, is associated with increased mortality and AIDS-like symptoms in its natural host.&lt;ref name=pmid19626114&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keele BF, Jones JH, Terio KA, Estes JD, Rudicell RS, Wilson ML, Li Y, Learn GH, Beasley TM, Schumacher-Stankey J, Wroblewski E, Mosser A, Raphael J, Kamenya S, Lonsdorf EV, Travis DA, Mlengeya T, Kinsel MJ, Else JG, Silvestri G, Goodall J, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Pusey AE, Hahn BH | title = Increased mortality and AIDS-like immunopathology in wild chimpanzees infected with SIVcpz | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7254 | pages = 515–519 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19626114 | pmc = 2872475 | doi = 10.1038/nature08200 | bibcode = 2009Natur.460..515K }}&lt;/ref&gt; SIVcpz appears to have been transmitted relatively recently to chimpanzee and human populations, so their hosts have not yet adapted to the virus.&lt;ref name=pmid19661993 /&gt; This virus has also lost a function of the ''[[Nef (protein)|nef]]'' gene that is present in most SIVs.

HIV-1 testing is initially done using an [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1.

Although IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, [[nucleic acid test]]ing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations.&lt;ref name="CDC2001" /&gt; In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.

The latest recommendations of the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) show that HIV testing must start with an [[immunoassay]] combination test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 [[Antibody|antibodies]] and p24 [[antigen]]. A negative result rules out HIV exposure, while a positive one must be followed by an HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay to detect which antibodies are present. This gives rise to four possible scenarios:
* 1. HIV-1 (+) &amp; HIV-2 (−): HIV-1 antibodies detected
* 2. HIV-1 (−) &amp; HIV-2 (+): HIV-2 antibodies detected
* 3. HIV-1 (+) &amp; HIV-2 (+): both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies detected
* 4. HIV-1 (−) or indeterminate &amp; HIV-2 (−): [[Nucleic acid test]] must be carried out to detect the acute infection of HIV-1 or its absence.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Reference Guide—Laboratory Testing for the Diagnosis of HIV Infection: Updated Recommendations|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/testingHIValgorithmQuickRef.pdf|website=cdc.gov|publisher=New York State Department of Health|access-date=April 13, 2017|pages=1–2|date=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|HIV/AIDS research}}HIV/AIDS research includes all [[medical research]] that attempts to prevent, treat, or cure [[HIV/AIDS]], as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.

Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral [[health interventions]], such as research into [[sex education]], and [[drug development]], such as research into [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]], [[HIV vaccine]]s, and [[antiretroviral drug|anti-retroviral drug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/education-materials/fact-sheets/21/58/fda-approved-hiv-medicines |title=HIV Treatment: FDA-Approved HIV Medicines |publisher=AIDSinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other medical research areas include the topics of [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], [[post-exposure prophylaxis]], [[circumcision and HIV]], and [[Biological clock (aging)|accelerated aging effects]].

HIV latency, and the consequent viral reservoir in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, dendritic cells, as well as macrophages, is the main barrier to eradication of the virus.&lt;ref name="HIV Latency" /&gt;

It is important to note that although HIV is highly virulent, transmission is greatly reduced when an HIV-infected person has a suppressed or undetectable [[viral load]] (&lt;50 copies/ml) due to prolonged and successful anti-retroviral treatment. Hence, it can be said to be almost impossible (but still non-zero) for an HIV-infected person who has an undetectable viral load to transmit the virus, even during unprotected sexual intercourse, as there would be a negligible amount of HIV present in the seminal fluid, vaginal secretions or blood, for transmission to occur.&lt;ref name=pmid19381076&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e32832b7dca |pmid=19381076 |title=Sexual transmission of HIV according to viral load and antiretroviral therapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=AIDS |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=1397–404 |year=2009 |last1=Attia |first1=Suzanna |last2=Egger |first2=Matthias |last3=Müller |first3=Monika |last4=Zwahlen |first4=Marcel |last5=Low |first5=Nicola }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18657710&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61115-0 |pmid=18657710 |title=Relation between HIV viral load and infectiousness: A model-based analysis |journal=The Lancet |volume=372 |issue=9635 |pages=314–20 |year=2008 |last1=Wilson |first1=David P |last2=Law |first2=Matthew G |last3=Grulich |first3=Andrew E |last4=Cooper |first4=David A |last5=Kaldor |first5=John M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean, however, that prolonged anti-retroviral treatment will result in a suppressed viral load.

At the same time, it is important to recognise that reaching an undetectable viral load is determined by many factors, including treatment adherence, HIV resistance to certain anti-retroviral drugs, stigma, and inadequate health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.preventionaccess.org/consensus |title=HIV Consensus Statement |date=November 19, 2017 |publisher=Prevention Access Campaign }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, two separate research groups led by American [[Robert Gallo]] and French investigators [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] and [[Luc Montagnier]] independently declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting AIDS patients, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallo RC, Sarin PS, Gelmann EP, Robert-Guroff M, Richardson E, Kalyanaraman VS, Mann D, Sidhu GD, Stahl RE, Zolla-Pazner S, Leibowitch J, Popovic M | title = Isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4599 | pages = 865–867 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6601823 | doi = 10.1126/science.6601823 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..865G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montagnier &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barré-Sinoussi F, Chermann JC, Rey F, Nugeyre MT, Chamaret S, Gruest J, Dauguet C, Axler-Blin C, Vézinet-Brun F, Rouzioux C, Rozenbaum W, Montagnier L | title = Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4599 | pages = 868–871 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6189183 | pmc = | doi = 10.1126/science.6189183 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..868B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/press.html|title=The 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine - Press Release|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in [[Virus structure|shape]] to other [[human T-lymphotropic virus]]es (HTLVs) his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a patient presenting with swelling of the [[lymph node]]s of the neck and [[asthenia|physical weakness]], two classic symptoms of primary HIV infection. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).&lt;ref name="Basavapathruni_2007" /&gt; As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986 LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Aldrich |editor1-first=Robert |title=Who's who in gay and lesbian history |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-22974-6 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KA7_1s6w-QC&amp;pg=PA154 |editor2-last=Wotherspoon |editor2-first=Garry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group working contemporaneously with the Montagnier and Gallo groups was that of Dr. Jay Levy at the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. He independently discovered the AIDS virus in 1983 and named it the AIDS associated retrovirus (ARV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Levy JA ''et al'' | year = 1984 | title = Isolation of lymphocytopathic retroviruses from San Francisco patients with AIDS | url = | journal = Science | volume = 225 | issue = 4664| pages = 840–842 | doi=10.1126/science.6206563| bibcode = 1984Sci...225..840L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This virus was very different from the virus reported by the Montagnier and Gallo groups. The ARV strains indicated, for the first time, the heterogeneity of HIV isolates and several of these remain classic examples of the AIDS virus found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Levy JA, Kaminsky LS, Morrow WJW, Steimer K, Luciw P, Dina D, Hoxie J, Oshiro L | year = 1985 | title = Infection by the retrovirus associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 103 | issue = 5| pages = 694–699 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-103-5-694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human [[primate]]s in West-central Africa, and are believed to have transferred to humans (a process known as [[zoonosis]]) in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Orgin2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = a006841 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22229120 | pmc = 3234451 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faria2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faria NR, Rambaut A, Suchard MA, Baele G, Bedford T, Ward MJ, Tatem AJ, Sousa JD, Arinaminpathy N, Pépin J, Posada D, Peeters M, Pybus OG, Lemey P | title = The early spread and epidemic ignition of HIV-1 in human populations | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6205 | pages = 56–61 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25278604| pmc = 4254776| doi = 10.1126/science.1256739 | bibcode = 2014Sci...346...56F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern [[Cameroon]] through the evolution of SIVcpz, a [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) that infects wild [[chimpanzee]]s (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies ''[[Central chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes troglodytes]]'').&lt;ref name="pmid9989410"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao F, Bailes E, Robertson DL, Chen Y, Rodenburg CM, Michael SF, Cummins LB, Arthur LO, Peeters M, Shaw GM, Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origin of HIV-1 in the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes | journal = Nature | volume = 397 | issue = 6718 | pages = 436–41 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9989410 | doi = 10.1038/17130 | bibcode = 1999Natur.397..436G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keele&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keele BF, Van Heuverswyn F, Li Y, Bailes E, Takehisa J, Santiago ML, Bibollet-Ruche F, Chen Y, Wain LV, Liegeois F, Loul S, Ngole EM, Bienvenue Y, Delaporte E, Brookfield JF, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Peeters M, Hahn BH | title = Chimpanzee reservoirs of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5786 | pages = 523–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16728595 | pmc = 2442710 | doi = 10.1126/science.1126531 | bibcode = 2006Sci...313..523K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIVsmm, a virus of the [[sooty mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys atys''), an [[Old World monkey]] living in littoral West Africa (from southern [[Senegal]] to western [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]]).&lt;ref name=Reeves /&gt; [[New World monkey]]s such as the [[Night monkey|owl monkey]] are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a [[fusion gene|genomic fusion]] of two viral resistance genes.&lt;ref name=Goodier&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodier JL, Kazazian HH | title = Retrotransposons revisited: the restraint and rehabilitation of parasites | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–35 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18854152 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.&lt;ref name="Sharp2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharp PM, Bailes E, Chaudhuri RR, Rodenburg CM, Santiago MO, Hahn BH | title = The origins of acquired immune deficiency syndrome viruses: where and when? | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 356 | issue = 1410 | pages = 867–76 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11405934 | pmc = 1088480 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2001.0863 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088480/pdf/TB010867.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910.&lt;ref name=Worobey2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Worobey M, Gemmel M, Teuwen DE, Haselkorn T, Kunstman K, Bunce M, Muyembe JJ, Kabongo JM, Kalengayi RM, Van Marck E, Gilbert MT, Wolinsky SM | title = Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7213 | pages = 661–4 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18833279 | pmc = 3682493 | doi = 10.1038/nature07390 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7213/full/nature07390.html | bibcode = 2008Natur.455..661W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of [[colonialism]] and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including different patterns of sexual contact (especially multiple, concurrent partnerships), the spread of [[prostitution]], and the concomitant high frequency of [[genital ulcer]] diseases (such as [[syphilis]]) in nascent colonial cities.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Sousa JD, Müller V, Lemey P, Vandamme AM | title = High GUD incidence in the early 20th century created a particularly permissive time window for the origin and initial spread of epidemic HIV strains | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = e9936 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20376191 | pmc = 2848574 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009936 | editor1-last = Martin | editor1-first = Darren P | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...5.9936S }}&lt;/ref&gt; While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased manyfold if one of the partners suffers from a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=Sousa2010 /&gt;

An alternative view—unsupported by evidence—holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single-use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread.&lt;ref name=Marx2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chitnis2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chitnis A, Rawls D, Moore J | title = Origin of HIV type 1 in colonial French equatorial Africa? | journal = AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–8 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10628811 | doi = 10.1089/088922200309548 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McNeil&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Donald McNeil, Jr.]]|title=Precursor to H.I.V. was in monkeys for millennia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/health/17aids.html |quote=Dr. Marx believes that the crucial event was the introduction into Africa of millions of inexpensive, mass-produced syringes in the 1950s. ... suspect that the growth of colonial cities is to blame.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">'''Hubert Eaton''' (June 3, 1881 – September 20, 1966) was an [[United States|American]] businessman.

Born in [[Liberty, Missouri]], Hubert Eaton and Charles Simms entered into a contract with Forest Lawn Cemetery in Tropico (now Glendale), California to manage the sales of burial property in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Laura. Forest Lawn: The first 100 years, Tropico Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Eaton conceived the "memorial-park" concept and Forest Lawn Cemetery was renamed Forest Lawn Memorial-Park.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Laura. Forest Lawn: The first 100 years, Tropico Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned Forest Lawn as a place for the living, having sweeping lawns and noble architecture, stained glass, and a place that uplifted the community rather than being a place of sorrow. Eaton became noted as, and referred to himself as, "The Builder" of [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries|Forest Lawn]] [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Glendale]]. During his life, he supervised the opening of [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Hollywood Hills]], Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cypress, and Forest Lawn Memorial Park Covina Hills in the greater [[Los Angeles, California]] area which became the funeral and/or interment locations for many [[movie star]]s and other celebrities. With several beautiful chapels throughout the Glendale cemetery's park-like setting, it has also served as the wedding location for well-known celebrities, including U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his first wife, actress [[Jane Wyman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://huberteaton.com/index.html Dr. Hubert L. Eaton, “My Tribute to My Friend”, Authored and Dedicated by  Charles  Elias  Disney]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eaton's international connections enabled him to attract an incredible number of important art works to his memorial parks.  He was well-known around the world as a collector and was respected at the highest levels of many governments.

Upon his death in 1966, Eaton was entombed in the "Memorial Court of Honor" in the Great Mausoleum in his Glendale cemetery. His friend [[Walt Disney]], himself too ill to attend, was an honorary pallbearer at Eaton's funeral. Disney would die weeks later and was cremated and interred at Glendale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6042 Find a Grave, Hubert Eaton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seeing-stars.com/Imagepages/EatonGravePhoto.shtml Photo of internement site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the [[Greater Los Angeles Area Council]] renamed a BSA camp after him, the Hubert Eaton Scout Reservation. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.glaacbsa.org/Hubert_Eaton Greater Los Angeles Area Council, Hubert Eaton Scout Reservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugh''', [[Count of Brienne]] and [[Lecce]] ({{circa|1240}} – 9 August 1296) was the second surviving son of Count [[Walter IV of Brienne]] and [[Marie of Lusignan, Countess of Brienne|Marie de Lusignan]] of [[Cyprus]].

==Life==
His father, [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], was murdered in 1244 in [[Cairo]], and was succeeded by his elder son, [[John, Count of Brienne|John]].

On the death of John (c. 1260), Hugh inherited the County of Brienne, in [[France]], and the family's claims in southern Italy, including the [[Principality of Taranto]] and the County of Lecce, which had been confiscated in 1205.

He claimed the regency of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (and, indirectly, a place in the succession) in 1264 as senior heir of [[Alice of Cyprus|Alice of Jerusalem]] and [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], being the son of their eldest daughter, but was passed over by the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|''Haute Cour'']] in favor of his cousin [[Hugh III of Cyprus|Hugh of Antioch]], and thereafter took little part in the affairs of [[Outremer]]. His first cousin King [[Hugh II of Cyprus]] died in 1267, and despite Hugh's rights as the senior heir, Hugh of Antioch, was crowned as Hugh III of Cyprus. When his second cousin's son [[Conradin]], King of Jerusalem, was killed in 1268, the succession again went to the junior cousin Hugh III.

Hugh decided to seek his fortune in [[Europe]] rather than [[Outremer]], and took service under [[Charles I of Naples]]. Charles made him Captain-General of [[Brindisi]], [[Otranto]] and [[Apulia]] and Lord of [[Conversano]], and he was an enthusiastic partisan of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] cause in Italy. For this service, his family's County of Lecce was restored to him. He was taken prisoner at the [[Battle of the Gulf of Naples]] in 1284 with [[Charles II of Naples]] and again at the [[Battle of the Counts]] in 1287, both times in sea battles against [[Roger of Lauria]]. On one of these occasions, he obtained his parole by leaving his only son [[Walter V of Brienne|Walter]] as a hostage. He was killed in [[Sicily]], at the [[Battle of Gagliano]], fighting Catalan [[Almogavars]], and was succeeded by Walter.

In 1291, he married [[Helena Angelina Komnene]], the widow of [[William de la Roche]], [[Duke of Athens]], and regent for her underage son [[Guy II de la Roche]]. He thus became ''[[bailli]]'' of the Duchy of Athens until Guy II's coming of age in 1296.{{sfn|Longnon|1969|pp=263–264}}

==Succession==
{{Main|Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem}}

==Marriage and issue==
Hugh's first wife was [[Isabella de la Roche]], heiress of Thebes. She bore him two children:
* [[Walter V of Brienne|Walter of Brienne]] (d. 1311), [[Duchy of Athens|Duke of Athens]], his heir.
* Agnes of Brienne, married John, Count of Joigny

His second wife was [[Helena Angelina Komnene]]. She bore him one daughter:
* [[Joanna of Brienne]], married [[Nicholas I Sanudo|Niccolo Sanudo]], [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Duke of Naxos]] (d. 1341).

A '''humanist celebrant''' or '''humanist officiant''' is a person who performs [[secular humanist]] [[celebrancy]] services for [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, child namings, coming of age ceremonies and other rituals.  Some humanist celebrants are accredited by humanist organisations, such as [[Humanists UK]], [[Humanist Society Scotland]] (HSS), and the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC).

==Availability==
Humanist ceremonies are conducted in every part of the world by humanist organisations, although the legal status of non-religious ceremonies of different kinds varies from place to place. In general, funeral ceremonies are not typically regulated by states, but many countries with a religious history have stricter guidelines on who can perform legal marriages. Naming ceremonies, similarly, can be held anywhere without legal implications. In countries where legal marriages can only be performed by religious institutions or the state (such as England), humanist weddings are often performed before or after a civil legal proceeding, but presented as the more meaningful or significant of the two events.

As of 2018, humanist celebrants can conduct legally binding marriage ceremonies in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2018/06/28/victory-court-of-appeal-in-belfast-rules-humanist-marriage-must-be-legally-recognised/|title=Victory!

===United Kingdom===
The charity [[Humanists UK]] (formerly the British Humanist Association) pioneered the practice of offering humanist ceremonies, and today organises a network of celebrants or officiants across [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/ceremonies|title=Humanist Ceremonies|date=26 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanistni.org/dynamic_content.php?id=106 Humanist Association of Northern Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071859/http://humanistni.org/dynamic_content.php?id=106 |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifishoulddie.co.uk/non-religious-alternatives-c38.html IfIShouldDie.co.uk: Humanist funerals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402083831/http://www.ifishoulddie.co.uk/non-religious-alternatives-c38.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar network exists in [[Scotland]], where, following a June 2005 ruling by the Registrar General, celebrants belonging to Humanist Society  Scotland have been permitted to conduct legal wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref name=scotland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism-scotland.org.uk/ceremonies/index.php|title=Humanist Society Scotland - Celebrate the one life we have|website=Humanist Society Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humanists UK celebrants in Northern Ireland were given the same rights in 2017 following a court case supported by Humanists UK.&lt;ref name=NIlegal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2017/06/09/success-couple-win-challenge-to-lack-of-legal-recognition-of-humanist-marriages-in-northern-ireland/|title=Success!

In England and Wales the current legal position is that a humanist wedding or partnership ceremony must be supplemented by obtaining a [[civil marriage]] or [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|partnership]] certificate through a [[Register Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/ceremonies/humanist-weddings|title=Humanist Weddings|date=21 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2014 it was reported that the [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Office]] was blocking the implementation of a change to give legal force to humanist weddings in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1496012.ece  Marie Woolf, "Humanist weddings blocked by No 10", ''Sunday Times'', 14 December 2014]. Retrieved 5 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; That same year in Scotland, when same-sex marriage was legalised, the [[First Minister of Scotland]] attended the legal humanist marriage of a same-sex couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2014/12/30/humanists-conducting-first-ever-sex-marriage-scotland/|title=Humanists conducting first ever same-sex marriage in Scotland|date=30 December 2014|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Humanists UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, humanist weddings became more popular in Scotland than [[Church of Scotland]] weddings, or those of any religious denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-33146226|title=Scottish humanists to overtake Kirk weddings|work=[[BBC Scotland]]|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanism.scot/what-we-do/news/more-than-4200-humanist-weddings-took-place-in-scotland-last-year/|title=More than 4200 Humanist weddings took place in Scotland last year|date=August 2016|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Humanist Society Scotland]]|first=Steven|last=Brocklehurst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanist Society Scotland's status as a trusted provider of marriages was written into [[Scots law]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanism.scot/what-we-do/humanitie/we-heart-humanist-weddings/|title=We 'Heart' Humanist Weddings|work=Humanist Society Scotland|accessdate=20 June 2017|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious [[funeral]]s are legal within the UK. Humanist celebrants are familiar with the procedures of [[cremation]] and [[burial]], and are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/ritesrituals/funerals.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Atheism: Funerals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Humanist Association has in the past described officiants as follows:&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Officiants are generally at least 35 years old, have experience of public speaking, and have probably had paid or voluntary experience in a caring/supporting profession – such as nursing, teaching, police or social work, for example. They must be able to cope with the emotional burden of regularly meeting and working with bereaved people - often in relation to particularly difficult or unexpected deaths, such as the death of a child in a road accident. Funeral directors are able to make arrangements with trained officiants in their local area.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Humanist funerals have reportedly been held in recent years for [[Claire Rayner]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/39258/agony-aunt-claire-rayner-dies-age-79  Jennifer Lipman, ''Agony aunt Claire Rayner dies at age 79'', Jewish Chronicle, 12 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Floyd]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/30/keith-floyd-humanist-funeral  Haroon Siddique, ''Mourners pay tribute to TV chef Keith Floyd at humanist funeral'', The Guardian, 30 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Keith-Floyd-funeral-latest/article-1380466-detail/article.html Bristol Evening Post, ''Keith Floyd funeral in Bristol'', 30 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Smith (comedian)|Linda Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/linda-smith-god-the-biggest-joke-of-all-468233.html|title=Linda Smith: God, the biggest joke of all|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronnie Barker]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4338658.stm  BBC, ''Family funeral for Ronnie Barker'', 13 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lynsey de Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29534264 BBC News, "Lynsey de Paul: Singer-songwriter's funeral held", 8 October 2014].  Accessed 3 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; among others. The humanist funeral for former [[First Minister of Wales]] [[Rhodri Morgan]] in 2017 was the first [[state funerals in the United Kingdom#ceremonial funeral|national funeral]] in the United Kingdom to be led by a humanist celebrant, former [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|AM]] [[Lorraine Barrett]], as well as the first national funeral held in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/2017/05/31/public-humanist-funeral-for-rhodri-morgan-at-national-assembly-for-wales/|title=Public humanist funeral for Rhodri Morgan at National Assembly for Wales|date=31 May 2017|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Humanists UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-40099436|work=[[BBC Wales News]]|title=Rhodri Morgan funeral to be held at the Senedd, Cardiff|date=31 May 2017|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrants also undertake [[humanist baby naming]]s as a non-religious alternative to ceremonies such as [[Infant baptism|christenings]]. The purpose is to recognise and celebrate the arrival of a child, and welcome him or her in the family and circle of friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/ceremonies/humanist-namings|title=Namings|date=21 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the [[Humanist Association of Ireland]] manages its own network of humanist ceremonies. Since 2012, these have been legally recognised, as in Scotland.&lt;ref name=scotland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanism.ie/campaigns/humanist-weddings/|title=Weddings - Humanist Association of Ireland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, humanist marriages accounted for 6% of all marriages in Ireland, making them six times more popular than the [[Church of Ireland]]'s weddings.&lt;ref name=NIlegal/&gt;

===United States and Canada===
Laws in each state of the United States vary about who has the right to perform wedding services, but humanist celebrants  are usually categorized as "clergy" and have the same rights and responsibilities as ordained clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roseministries.org/state_faq.php|title=Rose Ministries: Online Ordination, Become a Minister, Women Welcome|first=Rose|last=Ministries|website=roseministries.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanist celebrants will perform both opposite-sex and same-sex marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanistcanada.ca/content/humanist-weddings|title=404 - Page Not Found - Humanist Canada|website=humanistcanada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-03-humanists-stand-ready-to-perform-same-sex-marriage-ce|title=Humanists Stand Ready to Perform Same-Sex Marriage Ceremonies - American Humanist Association|date=3 March 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Humanist Society, an adjunct of the American Humanist Association, maintains a list of humanist celebrants.&lt;ref name=hs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanist-society.org/celebrants/|title=Celebrants - The Humanist Society|website=humanist-society.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanists conduct wedding ceremonies across Canada. These typically happen under the auspices of the national [[Humanist Canada]] group or through one of the province-level groups such as the [[British Columbia Humanist Association]].

Humanist weddings, funerals, and naming ceremonies are popular throughout Scandinavia, where humanist groups tend to be well-established. Humanist coming of age ceremonies are also popular in thesee countries, and in particular Norway, where humanists also conduct legally binding weddings. In Norway, coming of age ceremonies are a cultural norm dating back to when it was a legal requirement for young people to have a church-led confirmation ceremony. In an increasingly secular population, many Norwegians turn to the [[Human-Etisk Forbund|Norwegian Humanist Association]] (NHA) instead for a 'confirmation' that reflects their values. In 2017, 11,000 Norwegian young people registered for their ceremony with the NHA, representing nearly one in five young Norwegians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fritanke.no/nyheter/rekordpamelding-til-humanistisk-konfirmasjon-i-2018/19.10614|publisher=Norwegian Humanist Association|work=fritanke.no|date=10 April 2017|accessdate=24 January 2018|title=Rekordpåmelding til Humanistisk konfirmasjon i 2018 (Record Enrollment to Humanist Confirmation in 2018)|authors=Aslaug Olette Klausen and Kirsti Bergh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{see|Jugendweihe}}
Humanist groups providing ceremonies as part of [[Humanistischer Verband Deutschlands]] are well-established across Germany and are particularly prominent in many of Germany's cities, where majorities of residents are non-religious. As in Scandinavia, humanist coming-of-age ceremonies are very popular, due to secularisation and a pre-existing tradition of religious confirmation. ''[[Jugendweihe]]'' ceremonies have been on offer since at least 1852, although these days they are more likely to be referred to as ''Jugendfeier''  (youth celebration, as opposed to youth ordination). 8,500 young Germans took part in these ceremonies in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diesseits.de/menschen/interview/1427839200/kulturelle-bedeutung-jugendfeier-kaum-ueberschaetzen|title=Die kulturelle Bedeutung der Jugendfeier ist kaum zu überschätzen (The cultural significance of the youth celebration is hard to overestimate)|work=diesseits.de|accessdate=26 February 2018|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American estate planning parlance, an '''incentive trust''' is a [[Trust law|trust]] designed to encourage or discourage certain behaviors by using distributions of trust income or principal as an incentive.  A typical incentive trust might encourage a beneficiary to complete a degree, enter a profession, or abstain from harmful conduct such as substance abuse.  The beneficiary might be paid a certain amount of money from the trust upon graduating from college, or the trust might pay a dollar of income from the trust for every dollar the beneficiary earns.

Although incentive trusts have apparently become more common in the early 21st century, a 2007 survey found that less than one-third of wealthy Americans attach conditions to the distribution of their estates.[https://www.pnc.com/webapp/unsec/Requester?resource=/wcm/resources/file/ebd25008a977f13/PNC_WV_Inheritance_Rls.pdf] According to Joshua Tate, an assistant professor at [[Dedman School of Law|SMU Dedman School of Law]], incentive trusts pose a problem of inflexibility:  "because the settlor cannot foresee all potential eventualities or circumstances and take them into account in the trust, the terms of the trust can prove to be a burden for the beneficiaries."[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=873625]  Eileen Gallo, a noted psychotherapist, has argued that, although incentive trusts may be effective in changing behavior, they may in fact be damaging to the beneficiaries, in that they rely on external motivation to encourage activities that should be [[autotelic]] in nature.[http://www.fpanet.org/journal/articles/2004_Issues/jfp1204-art3.cfm]  The seeming popularity of incentive trusts, however, is reflected in the many websites created by estate planners to market them.

'''Ingeborg Eriksdotter''' ({{circa|1212}} &amp;ndash; {{circa|1254}}) was a Swedish princess and duchess, daughter of King [[Eric X of Sweden]], eldest sibling of King [[Eric XI of Sweden]], wife of [[Birger Jarl]], and mother of King [[Valdemar I of Sweden]].

== Biography ==
Ingeborg was born the eldest daughter of King [[Eric X of Sweden]] and his wife, [[Richeza of Denmark]]. She lived her youth in exile in [[Denmark]], after her brother had been deposed by his guardian and regent in 1229.

Ingeborg Eriksdotter's marital engagement took place in about 1234 in connection of her brother Eric XI resuming the Swedish throne from the 'usurper' [[Canute II of Sweden]], to have the mighty [[House of Bjellbo]] as their allies.

Princess Ingeborg bore a vast number of children to her husband dux [[Birger Jarl]]. In 1250, her brother died without heirs and her eldest son Valdemar was chosen to succeed Eric on the throne; her son was chosen because he was her son, and her husband was made regent during his minority. Ingeborg thereby became the King's Mother and first lady of the royal court.

Ingeborg is recorded to have inherited her brother Eric's private property upon his death, as his only living sibling. Even in her forties, she continued to give birth to children, and her death is believed to have occurred because of childbirth complications, possibly giving birth to twins.

===Children===
The following children survived to adulthood:

* [[Rikissa Birgersdotter]], born 1238, married first in 1251 [[Haakon Haakonsson the Young]], co-king of Norway, and second [[Henry I of Werle|Henry I, Prince of Werle]]
* [[Valdemar I of Sweden|Valdemar Birgersson]], born c 1238, King of Sweden 1250–1275, lord of parts of [[Gothenland]] until 1278
* [[Christina Birgersdotter]], married presumably several times, one of her husbands was Lord Sigge Guttormsson
* [[Magnus III of Sweden|Magnus Birgersson]], born 1240, Duke (of Södermanland), then King of Sweden 1275-90
* probably: [[Catherine Birgersdotter of Bjelbo|Catherine of Sweden]], born 1245, married [[Siegfried, Count of Anhalt]]
* [[Eric Birgersson]], born 1250, Duke
* probably: [[Ingeborg Birgersdotter of Småland|Ingeborg of Sweden]], born circa 1254, died 30 June 1302, married [[John I, Duke of Saxony|John I of Saxony, Duke of Lauenburg]] in 1270

'''John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl''' [[Order of the Thistle|KT]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (6 May 1729 &amp;ndash; 5 November 1774), known as '''John Murray''' until 1764, was a Scottish peer and [[Tory (political faction)|Tory]] politician.

==Background==
He was born 6 May 1729.
Murray was the eldest son of [[Lord George Murray (general)|Lord George Murray]], fifth son of [[John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl]]. [[James Murray (of Strowan)|James Murray]] and [[George Murray (MP)|George Murray]] were his younger brothers.

==Political career==
For some time he was captain in a company of Lord Loudoun's regiment of foot, afterwards the 54th. {{sfn|Henderson|1894}} Murray sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perthshire]] from 1761 to 1764.  On 8 January 1764, his uncle and father-in-law, the [[James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl|2nd Duke of Atholl]], died. Murray should have been heir to the dukedom, which was only able to descend through the male line; but he was ineligible since his father had fought in the [[Jacobite Rebellion of 1745|Jacobite Rising of 1745]] and had consequently been [[attainder|attainted in the blood]]. However, on 7 February 1764, the [[House of Lords]] deemed Murray the rightful heir to his uncle's title (notwithstanding the attainder of his father) and he succeeded him as 3rd Duke of Atholl. He was elected a [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] in 1766. 

His wife, on the death of her father, the second duke, succeeded to the sovereignty of the [[Isle of Man]], and to the ancient English [[barony of Strange]], of Knockyn, Wotton, Mohun, Burnel, Basset, and Lacy. For some time negotiations had been in progress with the English government for the union of the sovereignty with the English crown; and in 1765 an act of parliament was passed to give effect to a contract between the lords of the treasury and the Duke and Duchess of Atholl for the purchase of the sovereignty of Man and its dependencies for £70,000, the duke and duchess retaining their manorial rights, the patronage of the bishopric and other ecclesiastical benefices, the fisheries, minerals, &amp;c. The arrangement rendered them very unpopular in Man, and the [[42nd Regiment of Foot]], or Black Watch, under Lord John Murray, had to be stationed in the island to maintain order. The money received by the duke and duchess was directed to be laid out and invested in the purchase of lands of inheritance in Scotland, to be inalienably entailed on a certain series of heirs. The duke and duchess had also a grant of an annuity of £2,000 for their lives.{{sfn|Henderson|1894}}

Atholl was chosen a representative peer in succession to the [[Earl of Sutherland]], who died 21 August 1764, and he was reelected in 1768. 
In 1767, he was invested with the [[Order of the Thistle]]. {{sfn|Henderson|1894}}

He was [[Grandmaster (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Ancient Grand Lodge of England]] from 1771 until 1774, and Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland from 1773 to 1774.

He died at [[Dunkeld]] on 5 November 1774. {{sfn|Henderson|1894}}

==Family==
Atholl married his first cousin, [[Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Lady Charlotte]], daughter of [[James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl]], at [[Dunkeld]], on 23 October 1753. They had nine children:

* [[Lady Charlotte Murray]] (1754&amp;ndash;1808)
* [[John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl]] (1755&amp;ndash;1830)
* The Right Reverend [[Lord George Murray (bishop)|Lord George Murray]] (1761&amp;ndash;1803)
* Lord William Murray (1762&amp;ndash;1796)
* Lady Amelia Murray (1763&amp;ndash;1818)
* Lady Jane Murray (1764&amp;ndash;1846)
* [[Lord Henry Murray]] (1767&amp;ndash;1805)
* Lady Mary Murray (1769&amp;ndash;1814)
* The Very Reverend [[Lord Charles Murray-Aynsley]] (1771&amp;ndash;1808)

Atholl died in November 1774, aged 45, after drowning himself in the [[River Tay]] in a fit of delirium and was buried at Dunkeld.&lt;ref name=compeerage&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume I|year=1910|publisher=St Catherine's Press|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; His eldest son John succeeded him in the dukedom.

[[File:Laurence Sydney Brodribb Irving.jpg|thumb|right|Laurence Irving as depicted in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1912]]

'''Laurence Sydney Brodribb Irving''' (21 December 1871 – 29 May 1914)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Irving, Henry Brodribb}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a well known English [[dramatist]] and [[novelist]]. He died along with his wife in the [[RMS Empress of Ireland]] disaster.

==Life and career==
Born in [[London]], Laurence Irving was a son of the great [[Victorian era|Victorian]] actor manager, [[Sir Henry Irving]] and his wife Florence ([[Married and maiden names|née]] O'Callaghan), and brother to actor manager [[Harry Brodribb Irving]]. He was educated at [[Marlborough College]] and the College Rollin in [[Paris]], following which he was in Russia for three years studying for the [[Foreign Office]]. However, instead he took up acting, making his first appearance in 1893 in [[F. R. Benson]]'s theatrical company (not counting childhood performances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Music and the Drama: Irving's Vsit|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=28 Feb 1884|volume=1|issue=13|page=205|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n103/mode/1up|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  He went on to become a dramatist.&lt;ref&gt;''Vanity Fair'' magazine 'Men Of The Day' (1912)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the financial failure of one of Laurence's plays, his father was forced to sell the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]]. Irving was married to a fellow performer, actress Mabel Lucy Hackney (1880-1914).

Laurence and Mabel were on a tour of first Australia and then North America from 1912 to 1914. Their biggest success on the tour was Laurence's own play ''Typhoon'' which was a topical play set in the time of the Russo-Japanese War, with Laurence playing a Japanese officer.

Laurence and Mabel Irving later drowned in the [[RMS Empress of Ireland (1906)|RMS ''Empress of Ireland'']] disaster on 29 May 1914. Reports in the news accounts of the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] say that they got separated and Laurence was in a position of temporary safety, but he knew Mabel could not swim and he jumped back into the St. Lawrence River to rescue her. Their bodies were never found.

He is not to be confused with the son of his older brother [[Harry Brodribb Irving]], the set-designer [[Laurence Irving (set designer)|Laurence Irving]], who wrote the highly regarded and definitive biographies ''Henry Irving, the Actor and his World'' and ''The Successors.''

Spike-triggered neural characterization.  ''Journal of Vision'' 6:484–507&lt;/ref&gt; It has been successfully used to describe the response characteristics of neurons in early sensory pathways, especially the visual system.  The LNP model is generally implicit when using reverse correlation or the [[spike-triggered average]] to characterize neural responses with white-noise stimuli.

[[Image:LNPModelDiagram.png|right|thumb|300px|The Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson Cascade Model]]
There are three stages of the LNP cascade model.  The first stage consists of a linear filter, or linear [[receptive field]], which describes how the neuron integrates stimulus intensity over space and time.  The output of this filter then passes through a nonlinear function, which gives the neuron's instantaneous spike rate as its output.  Finally, the spike rate is used to generate spikes according to an inhomogeneous [[Poisson process]].

The linear filtering stage performs [[dimensionality reduction]], reducing the high-dimensional spatio-temporal stimulus space to a low-dimensional [[feature space]], within which the neuron computes its response.  The nonlinearity converts the filter output to a (non-negative) spike rate, and accounts for nonlinear phenomena such as spike threshold (or rectification) and response saturation.  The Poisson spike generator converts the continuous spike rate to a series of spike times, under the assumption that the probability of a spike depends only on the instantaneous spike rate.

== Mathematical formulation ==

===Single-filter LNP===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; denote the spatio-temporal stimulus vector at a particular instant, and
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; denote a linear filter (the neuron's linear receptive field), which is a vector with the same number of elements as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; denote the nonlinearity, a scalar function with non-negative output.  Then the LNP model specifies that, in the limit of small time bins, 
: &lt;math&gt;P(\textrm{spike}) \propto f(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;.
For finite-sized time bins, this can be stated precisely as the probability of observing ''y'' spikes in a single bin: 
: &lt;math&gt; P(y \textrm{~spikes}) = \frac{\left(\Delta \lambda\right)^y}{y!} e^{- \Delta \lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
: where &lt;math&gt; \lambda = f(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the bin size.

===Multi-filter LNP===
For neurons sensitive to multiple dimensions of the stimulus space, the linear stage of the LNP model can be generalized to a bank of linear filters, and the nonlinearity becomes a function of multiple inputs.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k_1}, \mathbf{k_2}, \ldots, \mathbf{k_n}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of linear filters that capture a neuron's stimulus dependence.  Then the multi-filter LNP model is described by
: &lt;math&gt;P(\textrm{spike}) \propto f(\mathbf{k_1}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{x},\; \mathbf{k_2}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{x},\; \ldots,\; \mathbf{k_n}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;P(\textrm{spike}) \propto f(K\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix whose columns are the filters &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k_i}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Estimation ==
The parameters of the LNP model consist of the linear filters &lt;math&gt;\{{k_i}\}&lt;/math&gt; and the nonlinearity &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  The estimation problem (also known as the problem of ''neural characterization'') is the problem of determining these parameters from data consisting of a time-varying stimulus and the set of observed spike times. Techniques for estimating the LNP model parameters include:
* moment-based techniques, such as the [[spike-triggered average]] or [[spike-triggered covariance]]&lt;ref name="chichilnisky01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simoncelli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schwartz06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brenner00"&gt;Brenner, N., Bialek, W., &amp; de Ruyter van Steveninck, R. R. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
* with information-maximization or [[maximum likelihood]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Paninski:2004"&gt;Paninski, L. (2004) Maximum likelihood estimation of cascade point-process neural encoding models. In ''Network: Computation in Neural Systems''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirbagheri:2012"&gt;Mirbagheri M.

== Related models ==
* The LNP model provides a simplified, mathematically tractable approximation to more biophysically detailed [[Biological neuron model|single-neuron models]] such as the [[integrate-and-fire]] or [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]].
* If the nonlinearity &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed invertible function, then the LNP model is a [[generalized linear model]].  In this case, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the inverse link function.
* An alternative to the LNP model for neural characterization is the [[Volterra series|Volterra kernel]] or [[Wiener kernel]] series expansion, which arises in classical nonlinear systems-identification theory.&lt;ref&gt;Marmarelis &amp; Marmerelis, 1978. ''Analysis of Physiological Systems: The White Noise Approach.'' London: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These models approximate a neuron's input-output characteristics using a polynomial expansion analogous to the [[Taylor series]], but do not explicitly specify the spike-generation process.

==First World War==
During the [[First World War]], members of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] were subject to British military discipline, which allowed execution by [[firing squad]] for crimes such as [[desertion]] or [[cowardice]].  During the war, 25 Canadian soldiers were executed for purely military offences.  Excluding the two who were found guilty of murder, [[Minister of Veterans Affairs (Canada)|Veteran Affairs Minister]] [[Ron Duhamel]] announced on December 11, 2001 that executed soldiers would have their names added to Canada's [[Books of Remembrance]] housed in [[Parliament Hill]].

On 16 August 2006, British Defence Secretary Des Browne announced that the government would issue full pardons for all 306 Commonwealth soldiers (including the twenty-three Canadians) who were executed under these circumstances during World War I.

=== Executed for Desertion ===

==== Sgt. William Alexander ====
William Alexander was born in the UK during 1880, and served for 8 years in the British Army before emigrating to Canada.  When the First World War started in August 1914, Alexander volunteered for service in the Canadian Army.  Given his previous military service, Alexander was made a Sergeant in the 10th Battalion.  After arriving in France during 1915, Sergeant Alexander fought with the battalion at the 2nd Battle of Ypres (April 1915), Festubert (May 1915) and Mount Sorrel (1916).

Following his recovery from an inflamed knee, Alexander rejoined his battalion in time for its involvement in the attack on Hill 70, which started at 04:25 on 15 August 1917. This attack was intended to act as a diversion and draw some of the German forces from the ongoing battles at Passchendaele. Because of the severe casualties suffered by the 10th Battalion, CQMS Alexander was ordered forward to take over as Platoon Sergeant of D Company; in readiness for this platoon to take part in a further attack. However, Alexander was nowhere to be found and a Corporal had to lead the Company.

Two days later, on 17 August 1917, the 10th Battalion was pulled out of the front line. It had suffered some 400 casualties.

It was not until 19 August 1917 that CQMS Alexander was found in the village used by the 10th Battalion as a billet before the attack on Hill 70. After admitting that he had gone sick, but not reported it to an officer, and the absence of any marks on his person, Alexander was arrested and charged with desertion.

Following his trial on 29 September 1917, Alexander (age 37) was executed by firing squad on 18 October 1917. His remains are located in Barlin Communal Cemetery Extension (Pas de Calais), Plot II, Row D, Grave 43.

An account of Alexander's execution was written by Canon Frederick Scott in his book ''The Great War as I Saw It''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19857/19857-h/19857-h.htm |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Great War as I Saw It, by F. G. Scott |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although Canon Scott does not name Alexander, the date of this execution, October 1917 and Scott's mention that the condemned soldier had no next of kin makes Alexander, rather than Private Thomas L. Moles, the subject.{{original research inline|date=May 2012}})

Alexander is listed in the Canadian Book of Remembrance on page 603.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/content/collections/books/bww1/ww1603.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609062052/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/content/collections/books/bww1/ww1603.jpg |archive-date=2011-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lance-Bombardier Frederick Arnold ====

Born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on 25 April 1890, '''Frederick Stanley Arnold''' initially served in the [[US Army]] before enlisting in the Canadian Field Artillery in September 1914.

Once stationed in France, Arnold fought at the [[Battle of Festubert]] and the [[Battle of Givenchy]], twice being admitted to hospital, once for simple illness, and then to be treated for [[shell shock]]. After his discharge, Arnold disappeared on 5 June 1916, and was arrested at a nearby port dressed in civilian clothes. He was court-martialled on 5 July 1916, and executed at 04:37 on 25 July 1916. He is buried in [[Boulogne Eastern Cemetery]], Plot VIII, Row A, Grave 137.

====Pte. Fortunat Auger====
Born in [[Montreal]] in December 1890, '''Fortunat Auger''' joined the CEF's [[The Royal Montreal Regiment|14th Battalion]] in September 1914.

Auger was present during both the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] and the [[Battle of Festubert]] in 1915. After the 14th Battalion was transferred  Following his battalion's move to [[Ploegsteert Wood]] that summer, Auger's conduct became increasingly belligerent.

He was twice charged with going [[AWOL]], before disappearing for two days in December and returning to find himself charged with [[desertion]]. His charge was lessened to AWOL once again, but he was sentenced to serve 12 months hard labour. His sentence was suspended a month later, and he was returned to his battalion, from which he immediately left. He was arrested three days later, on January 11, and sentenced to death for desertion.

The 25-year-old Private was executed by [[firing squad]] at 05:43 on 26 March 1916, and his remains were buried in [[Trois Arbres Cemetery]], Plot III, Row H, Grave 5.

====Pte. Harold Carter====

Born on 26 March 1894 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], '''Harold George Carter''' enlisted in the 59th Battalion in March 1915. In January 1916, he was charged with going [[AWOL]].

The Battalion was disbanded upon reaching England at the end of 1916, and its troops were used to re-man other units who had taken high casualty rates during the war. Carter was transferred to the [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada|73rd Battalion]], part of the 4th Canadian Division.

He was again found [[AWOL]], during the September [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]], and was found guilty of desertion and sentenced to death.  His sentence was commuted to 10 years' imprisonment. After serving six months, his [[suspended sentence|sentence was suspended]], and he was re-attached to his unit on March 16, 1917.

Within three weeks, Carter once again went [[AWOL]], this time just before the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], eluding [[military police]] for five days before being re-captured.  He was court-martialled and found guilty of [[desertion]]. Sentenced to death, Carter was executed by firing squad on 20 April 1917.

Carter's remains are today located in [[Villers Station Cemetery]], Plot X, Row A, Grave 7.

====Pte. Gustave Comté====
Born on 24 February 1895 in Montreal, Gustave Comté enlisted in the 57th Battalion in September 1915. Comte travelled with the battalion to France, but was transferred to the [[Royal 22e Régiment#History|22nd Battalion]] (aka "Van Doo", then part of the 5th Canadian Brigade CEF) because of their recent loss of infantry.

Private Comté went missing just before the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|attack on Vimy Ridge]] began, on April 4, 1917, as the 22nd began moving to the [[front line]]s through Gouy-Servins. He was found in [[Le Havre]] on 18 May, and a court martial sentenced him to death for desertion.

At 04:45 on 3 July 1917, Comté was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in [[Aix-Noulette Communal Cemetery|Aix-Noulette Communal Cemetery Extension]], Plot I, Row F, Grave 20.

====Pte. Arthur Dagesse====

Arthur Charles Dagesse was born in New Bedford MA in 1886. On 23 September 1914, one month after the outbreak of war, Dagesse enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) under the name Dagasse. His conduct as a soldier started badly and continued in poor fashion, with no fewer than fifteen convictions, thirteen for absence and two for drunkenness.

On 4 April 1917, just before his unit's participation in the Vimy Ridge attack, Dagesse went absent until his arrest in Paris on 29 April 1917. While awaiting trial for this offence, Dagesse escaped custody and remained absent for five months before being re-arrested in Paris on 4 October 1917. When he was arrested for the second time, Dagesse was wearing the uniform of a Sergeant in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC).

Following his court-martial on 26 February 1918, Dagasse was found guilty of two counts of desertion and sentenced to death.

At 06:37 on 15 March 1918, Dagesse (aged 33) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Lapugnoy Military Cemetery, Plot VIII, Row B, Grave 8.

====Pte. Léopold Delisle====

Léopold Delisle was born in Montreal in 1893. Following the outbreak of war, Delisle tried to enlist three times before he was finally accepted for overseas service in April 1915. One month later, Delisle sailed with the 22nd (French-Canadian) Battalion.

Delisle had a number of offences on his conduct sheet.

On 29 March 1918 Delisle's unit was ordered forward to attempt to stem the German advance on Arras, but when the roll call was made, Delisle was absent.  Delisle was arrested just outside Arras five days later. Delisle's court-martial found him guilty of desertion and sentenced him to be shot dead.

At 04:24 on 21 May 1918, Delisle (aged 25) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Bellacourt Military Cemetery, Plot II, Row J, Grave 6.

====Pte. Edward Fairburn====

Edward Fairburn was born in [[St. Catharines, Ontario]] on 21 September 1895. After enlisting in November 1915, Fairburn was sent to France as part of a reinforcement for the 18th (Western Ontario) Battalion.

After a period of service, Fairburn went missing during the week of 9–16 April 1917 and remained missing for 10 months before being arrested just north of Arras.

On 2 March 1918, Fairburn (aged 23) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Villers Station Cemetery, Plot XI, Row B, Grave 23, 11 kilometres northwest of Arras.

====Pte. Stephen Fowles====

Stephen McDermott Fowles was born on 13 June 1897 in Winnipeg. In February 1916 Fowles enlisted in the 107th Battalion, which sailed for England in September 1916. Fowles was later sent to France as part of a reinforcement of the 44th Canadian Infantry Battalion.

Within a year of his enlistment, Fowles was court-martialled for desertion and found guilty. His sentence of death was reduced during the confirmation process to 10 years' imprisonment, which was itself later reduced to a suspended sentence and Fowles was returned to his unit.

Despite these events, Fowles deserted and on 29 December 1917 was again sentenced to death. For a second time, the sentence was commuted to a suspended sentence. Given the need to combat the German offensive, Fowles was returned to his unit.

Shortly after rejoining his unit, Fowles deserted for a 3rd time and was not detained until he turned himself in on 2 May 1918. Fowles was court-martialled for desertion, found guilty and sentenced to death. At 03:50 on 19 June 1918, Fowles was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Villers Station Cemetery, Plot XIII, Row B, Grave 1.

====Pte. John Maurice Higgins====

John Maurice Higgins was born on 26 September 1891 in Charlottetown, before moving with his parents to Toronto.

Private Higgins took part in the heavy fighting at Mount Sorrel and went with his unit into the fighting at Courcelette in September 1916. During this battle, Higgins went absent, and was arrested by French Police 16 days later. This time, Private Higgins was charged with desertion.

Higgins escaped from custody while awaiting his court-martial and was  rearrested until five days later. After his court-martial, Higgins was found guilty of both counts of desertion and sentenced to death by firing squad.

At 07:11 on 7 December 1916, Higgins was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Quatre-Vents Cemetery, Plot I, Row B, Grave 2.

====Pte. Henry Hesey Kerr====

Henry Hesey Kerr was born in Montreal on 4 September 1891.

After his battalion had arrived in England, Kerr was punished for five periods of AWOL on 10 June 1915, 27 November 1915, 3 December 1915, 17 June 1916 and 3 January 1916, bring fined two days pay for each offence.

After entering France and joining the 7th (British Columbia) Battalion, Kerr's conduct continued to decline. After several more warnings about his conduct, Kerr rejoined his unit in October 1916 as it prepared to attack Regina Trench as part of the Somme Offensive. 

However, Kerr went absent after being warned he was required for duty in the front line. 24 hours later, Kerr was arrested when he was discovered in some billets located some miles behind the front lines.

On 7 November 1916, Kerr was charged with desertion. His court-martial found him guilty and sentenced him to death. At 06:45 on 21 November 1916, Kerr was executed by firing squad. Private Kerr's remains are now located in Quatre-Vents Military Cemetery, Plot III, Row A, Grave 9.

====Pte. Joseph LaLancette====

Joseph LaLancette was born on 1 September 1895 in London. After enlisting in Quebec City, LaLancette arrived in France as part of a reinforcement of the 22nd Battalion.

On 6 April 1917, just before the attack on Vimy Ridge, LaLancette went absent and was shortly arrested together with Gustave Comté. Both soldiers faced separate courts-martial, charged with desertion. Both LaLancette and Comté were found guilty and sentenced to death.

At 04:45 on 3 July 1917, LaLancette and Comté were executed by firing squad. LaLancette's remains are now located in Aix-Noulette Communal Cemetery Extension, Plot I, Row F, Grave 21.

====Pte. Côme Laliberté====

Côme Laliberté was born on 24 March 1893 in Lotbinière (Quebec). During March 1915 he enlisted in the 41st Battalion, travelling with them to England in June 1915. Before the end of 1915, Laliberté already had several entries on his conduct sheet.

On 21 June 1917, Ling again went absent and was arrested by the military police in Mazingarbe almost one year later. After his arrest, Ling gave a false name and had another soldier's paybook in his possession. At his court-martial for desertion, Ling was found guilty and sentenced to death by shooting.

On 12 August 1918, Ling (aged 22) was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Cerisy-Gailly Military Cemetery, Plot II, Row N. Grave 20.

====Pte. Harold Lodge====

Born 22 December 1897 in Toronto, '''Harold Edward James Lodge''' enlisted in the CEF in April 1915. Lodge was stationed in France, as part of the 19th Battalion.

Lodge took a quick leave of absence from his unit in November 1917, during preparations for the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], and was warned by an officer that if he tried again it would be considered desertion, yet nonetheless went [[AWOL]] again that same night.  He got his hands on a [[British Red Cross]] corporal's uniform, and hid in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] until his arrest.

He escaped detention, while awaiting his court-martial hearing in December.  However he was found by Military Police three weeks later, aboard a sailing ship about to leave France. Being returned to detention aboard a train, Pte. Lodge once again escaped, but was quickly apprehended.

His court martial finally took place on 23 February 1918, charged with four counts of desertion. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by shooting. On 13 March, he was executed by firing squad. His remains are located in Noeux-les-Mines Communal Cemetery Extension, Plot IV, Row B, Grave 5.

====Pte. Thomas Moles====

Thomas Lionel Moles was born in Brompton Reigh (Somerset) on 17 November 1891. He served for four years in the Somerset Light Infantry. After leaving the British Army, Moles emigrated to Canada, where in July 1915, Moles enlisted in the 54th (Kootenay British Columbia) Battalion. The 54th Battalion for England in 1915, entering France in August 1916.

Moles had a poor conduct sheet, with four convictions for AWOL and several convictions for drunkenness.

During October 1917, Moles was ordered to rejoin his company which was about to go into action. Instead of going forward, Moles went to a village in the rear areas. He was eventually arrested three weeks later, and charged with desertion.

At his court-martial, Moles was found guilty and sentenced to death. At 05:30 on 22 October 1917, Moles was executed by firing squad. His remains are located in Ypres Reservoir Cemetery, Plot I, Row H, Grave 76.

====Pte. Eugene Perry====

Born April 1, 1896 in [[Bouctouche, New Brunswick]], '''Pte. Eugene Perry''' enlisted in the 41st Battalion in October 1915. He was stationed in [[Belgium]] as part of the 22nd Battalion, and later fought at the [[Battle of the Somme]] before moving with the unit to the Vimy area.

On April 2, 1917, Perry was given a warning for missing duty on the [[front line]], and disappeared shortly afterwards.

He was arrested approximately 7 hours later at a nearby village. His court-martial found him guilty of desertion and sentenced him to death by firing squad. His remains are located in Ecoivres Military Cemetery, Plot VI, Row C, Grave 7.

====Pte. Edward James Reynolds====

Edward James Reynolds was born on 2 January 1896 in Toronto. During April 1915, Reynolds enlisted in the 35th Battalion. By November 1915, Reynolds was a member of the 3rd Battalion in the line near Ploegsteert.

On 25 July 1916, the Germans exploded a mine under a portion of the front line called "The Bluff". The 3rd Battalion was ordered forward to plug the resulting gap in the front line. However, Reynolds fell out from his platoon only to be found 2 days later at his battalion's transport lines. Reynolds claimed that he had been ordered back and got lost. This excuse was accepted.

During the following night (26 July 1916), Reynolds was ordered to accompany a ration party up to the front line. Again Reynolds fell out and went back to his battalion's transport lines. This time Reynolds was arrested and charged with desertion. He was found guilty by court-martial and sentenced to death.

At 05:27 on 23 August 1916, Reynolds was executed by firing squad. His remains are now located in Longuenesse Souvenir Cemetery, Plot IV, Row A, Grave 39.

====Pte. John William Roberts====
Born in Newfoundland on 5 August 1895, '''John William Roberts''' served in the [[Royal Navy Reserve]] for four years, before enlisting in the 2nd [[2nd Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles|Canadian Mounted Rifles]] in May 1915. At some point during this time he was imprisoned for 28 days, as punishment for going [[AWOL]] while still in Canada.

Four months later his unit was deployed to France. In January 1916 he was sent to a medical camp, and upon being released the following month, once again disappeared.  He wasn't found until June, when [[military police]] found him in civilian clothes.

His court-martial occurred in July, and Roberts was found guilty of desertion.  He was executed by firing squad at 04:36 on 30 July 1916, and his body is now interred in [[Boulogne Eastern Cemetery]], Plot VIII, Row A, Grave 154.

====Pte. Charles Welsh====

Born on 3 June 1887 in [[Chester, England]], '''Charles Welsh''' was an immigrant to Canada. In February 1915, he enlisted in the 52nd Battalion, which departed to England that summer. By the end of the year, he had been transferred to reinforce the 8th Battalion, who were fighting in Belgium.

Over the next two months, the 8th Battalion was involved in a number of bloody skirmishes surrounding [[Passchendaele Ridge|Passchendaele]], and at some point during this fighting - Welsh went missing for a third time.  He was found 8 weeks later, living in a cottage near [[Poperinghe]], charged, and sentenced once again to death by firing squad.  He was executed at 06:00 on 6 March 1918, and buried in the [[Mazingarbe Communal Cememtery]] Extension, Plot III, Row B, Grave 12.

====Pte. James Wilson====

Born in [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]] in June 1879, '''James H. Wilson''' spent nine years serving in the [[Connaught Rangers]] before emigrating to Canada before the war.

Wilson enlisted at the start of the war in August 1914, but was discharged the following February 3 after a series of infractions left him "undesirable for military service". He was re-instated a month later on 13 March, but had further infractions soon after.

He went [[AWOL]] again on 25 February 1916, and was not seen again until he turned himself into the army nearly three months later. He was court-martialled and charged with [[desertion]]. He was sentenced to death, and at 04:20 on 9 July, was executed by firing squad. His remains are today located in [[Poperinghe New Military Cemetery]], Plot II, Row H, Grave 2.

====Pte. Elsworth Young====

Born on 2 June 1895 in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], '''Elsworth Young''' enlisted  in the 25th Battalion during November 1914 at the age of 19.  He was stationed in France in September 1915, serving as a [[Batman (army)|batman]].

In September 1916, Young was ordered to report back to his company's Sergeant-Major, in order to be transferred to replace troops lost during the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]]. He failed to report on time, though he arrived in time for the evening's rollcall.

Several days later however, Young was arrested after being found miles behind the front lines, dressed in a [[Corporal]]'s uniform. He initially gave a false name and rank to the [[Military Police]] who arrested him. He was charged with desertion, court-martialled and sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad at 06:26 on 29 October 1916. His remains are today located in [[Bully-Grenay Communal Cemetery]], Plot II, Row B, Grave 14.

===Executed for Cowardice===

====Pte. Dimitro Sinicky====

Born in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] in 1895, '''Dimitro Sinicky''' (#830020) emigrated to Canada. His name is correctly spelled ''Dmytro Sinizki'' ({{Lang-uk|Дмитро́ Синицкий}}).

He voluntarily enlisted in Winnipeg's 144th Canadian Infantry during December 1915, and after shipping out to England, was one of a handful of troops used to reinforce the Ontarian 52nd Battalion after its losses at the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]]. His Attestation Paper indicates his religious affiliation was "Greek Catholic," meaning he was a Ukrainian by ethnicity.

In August 1917, Sinicky was part of a trench-raiding team when he refused to participate in a raid.  The following night he was forcibly brought along on the raid, but he simply sat down and refused to continue.  He was arrested, court-martialled and charged with [[cowardice]].  Sentenced to death by firing squad, Sinicky was executed at 06:11 on 9 October 1917. He is buried in Plot VI K 19 of the Ecoivres Military Cemetery, France.

===Executed for Murder===

====Trooper Alexander Butler====
Born in [[London, England]] on 11 June 1888, '''Alexander Butler''' served in the [[7th (Queen's Own) Hussars|7th Queen's Own Hussars]] for nearly seven years, before emigrating to Canada.

Following the outbreak of the war, Butler enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]], and was dispatched to France in May 1915, where he participated in  dismounted service at the [[Battle of Festubert]], [[Battle of Givenchy]] and the [[Battle of Messines (1914)|Battle of Messines]]. Butler fell off his horse twice, once resulting in a head injury, which led to increasingly belligerent behaviour.  The RCDs then saw mounted service in the forthcoming June 1916 Somme Offensive.

On 8 June 1916, while stationed behind the front lines of [[Hesdin]], Butler took his rifle and opened fire, shooting Trooper Mickleburgh dead with five shots in the chest before he was overpowered and arrested.

He was court-martialled 16 days later, and while the courts made mention of his mental instability, several doctors testified that the claims were exaggerated and he was competent to stand trial.  He was sentenced to death, and at 04:00 on 2 July 1916, was executed by firing squad. His remains are today located in [[Ribemont Communal Cemetery]] Extension, Plot IV, Row M, Grave 5.

====Benjamin De Fehr====
Born 29 March 1888 in [[Winkler, Manitoba]], '''Benjamin De Fehr''' enlisted as a driver in the [[Canadian Army Service Corps]] following the outbreak of war, and was duly transferred to England in 1916.

He had no incidents of poor conduct, until 19 August 1916, while serving in France with the [[1st Canadian Reserve Park]] in the rear areas near [[Hazebrouck]].  He used his rifle to shoot 43-year-old Regimental Sergeant-Major J.R. Scott in the back, killing him instantly.  De Fehr was overpowered and arrested immediately.

He was officially court-martialled on 22 August, and while he maintained that he had been drunk during the incident, several witnesses testified that he had been sober.  He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by firing squad.

De Fehr was executed three days later, and his remains are today located in Hazebrouck Communal Cemetery, Plot I, Row A, Grave 13, only three graves away from his victim, RSM Scott.

==Second World War==
In the Canadian army, only one soldier was executed for committing a military offense during the Second World War, Private [[Harold Joseph Pringle]] of The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. He was executed after VE-Day in Italy in 1945 for the crimes of desertion and accomplice to murder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8503">'''Maternal to zygotic transition''' ('''MZT''') is the stage in [[embryonic development]] during which development comes under the exclusive control of the [[Zygote|zygotic]] [[genome]]. This requires both [[Zygote|zygotic]] [[genome]] activation (ZGA) and degradation of maternal products. MZT is often thought to be synonymous with midblastula transition (MBT), but these processes are, in fact, distinct.&lt;ref name="baroux"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Baroux C, Autran D, Gillmor CS, etal |title=The Maternal to Zygotic Transition in Animals and Plants |journal=Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol |volume=73 |pages=89–100 |year=2008 |pmid=19204068 |doi=10.1101/sqb.2008.73.053}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the MBT roughly coincides with ZGA in many [[metazoans]],&lt;ref name="tadros"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tadros W, Lipshitz HD|lastauthoramp=yes |title=The maternal to zygotic transition: a play in two acts |journal=Development |volume=136 |pages=3033–42 |year=2009 |pmid=19700615 |doi=10.1242/dev.033183 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may share some common regulatory features. For example, both processes are proposed to be regulated by the [[NC ratio|nucleocytoplasmic ratio]].&lt;ref name="newport"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newport J, Kirschner M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=A major developmental transition in early ''Xenopus'' embryos: I. characterization and timing of cellular changes at the midblastula stage. |journal=Cell |volume=30 |pages=675–86 |year=1982 |pmid=6183003 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90272-0 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard DK, Schubiger G|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Activation of transcription in ''Drosophila'' embryos is a gradual process mediated by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio. |journal=Genes Dev |volume=10 |pages=1131–42 |year=1996 |doi=10.1101/gad.10.9.1131 |pmid=8654928 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MBT strictly refers to changes in the [[cell cycle]] and [[cell motility]] that occur just prior to [[gastrulation]].&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tadros"/&gt; In the early [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] stages of [[embryogenesis]], rapid divisions occur synchronously and there are no "gap" stages in the [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt; During these stages, there is also little to no [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[mRNA]] from the [[zygotic]] [[genome]],&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt; but zygotic transcription is not required for MBT to occur.&lt;ref name="baroux"/&gt; Cellular functions during early cleavage are carried out primarily by maternal products – [[protein]]s and [[messenger RNA|mRNAs]] contributed to the egg during [[oogenesis]].

|}
To begin [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[zygotic]] [[genes]], the [[embryo]] must first overcome the [[Gene silencing|silencing]] that has been established. The cause of this [[Gene silencing|silencing]] could be due to several factors: [[chromatin]] [[Histone-Modifying Enzymes|modifications]] leading to repression, lack of adequate [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] [[RNA Polymerase|machinery]], or lack of time in which significant [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] can occur due to the shortened cell cycles.&lt;ref name="schier"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schier AF |title=The Maternal-Zygotic Transition: Death and Birth of RNAs |journal=Science |volume=316 |pages=406–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17446392 |doi=10.1126/science.1140693 |issue=5823 | bibcode = 2007Sci...316..406S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the first method was provided by Newport and Kirschner's experiments showing that [[NC ratio|nucleocytoplasmic ratio]] plays a role in activating [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newport J, Kirschner M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=A major developmental transition in early ''Xenopus'' embryos: II. control of the onset of transcription. |journal=Cell |volume=30 |pages=687–96 |year=1982 |pmid= 7139712 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90273-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that a defined amount of repressor is packaged into the egg, and that the exponential amplification of [[DNA]] at each [[cell cycle]] results in titration of the repressor at the appropriate time. Indeed, in ''[[Xenopus]]'' [[embryos]] in which excess [[DNA]] is introduced, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] begins earlier.&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"/&gt; More recently, evidence has been shown that [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a subset of genes in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] is delayed by one [[cell cycle]] in [[haploid]] [[embryos]].&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu X, Li JM, Elemento O, Tavazoie S, Wieschaus EF |title=Coupling of zygotic transcription to mitotic control at the ''Drosophila'' mid-blastula transition. |journal=Development |volume=136 |pages=2101–2110 |year=2009 |pmid= 19465600 |doi=10.1242/dev.034421 |issue=12 |pmc=2685728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism of repression has also been addressed experimentally. Prioleau et al. show that by introducing [[TATA binding protein]] (TBP) into ''[[Xenopus]]'' oocytes, the block in transcription can be partially overcome.&lt;ref name="prioleau"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prioleau MN, Huet J, Sentenac A, Mechali M |title=Competition between chromatin and transcription complex assembly regulates gene expression during early development. |journal=Cell |volume=77 |pages=439–49 |year=1994 |pmid=8181062  |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90158-9 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that shortened [[cell cycle]]s can cause repression of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] is supported by the observation that [[mitosis]] causes transcription to cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shermoen AW, O'Farrell PH|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Progression of the cell cycle through mitosis leads to abortion of nascent transcripts. |journal=Cell |volume=67 |pages=303–10 |year=1991 |pmid=1680567 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90182-X |issue=2 |pmc=2755073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clearing of maternal transcripts==

To eliminate the contribution of maternal [[gene]] products to development, maternally-supplied [[Messenger RNA|mRNAs]] must be degraded in the [[embryo]]. Studies in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] have shown that sequences in the [[3' UTR]] of maternal transcripts mediate their degradation (reviewed by Tadros and Lipshitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tadros W, Lipshitz HD|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Setting the stage for development: mRNA translation and stability during ooccyte maturation and egg activation in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Dev Dyn |volume=232 |pages=593–608 |year=2005 |pmid=15704150 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20297 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These sequences are recognized by regulatory [[proteins]] that cause destabilization or degradation of the transcripts. Recent studies in both [[zebrafish]] and ''[[Xenopus]]'' have found evidence of a role for [[microRNAs]] in degradation of maternal transcripts. In [[zebrafish]], the [[microRNA]] miR-430 is expressed at the onset of [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and targets several hundred [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]] and degradation. Many of these targets are [[genes]] that are expressed maternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giraldez AJ, Mishima Y, Rihel J, Grocock RJ, Van Dongen S, Inoue K, Enright AJ, Schier AF |title=Zebrafish miR-430 promotes deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs. |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=75–9 |issue=5770 |year=2006 |pmid=16484454 |doi=10.1126/science.1122689|bibcode = 2006Sci...312...75G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Xenopus]]'', the miR-430 [[ortholog]] miR-427 has been shown to target maternal [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]]. Specifically, miR-427 targets include [[cell cycle]] regulators such as [[Cyclin A1]] and [[Cyclin B2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund E, Liu M, Hartley RS, Sheets MD, Dahlberg JE |title=Deadenylation of maternal mRNAs mediated by miR-427 in ''Xenopus laevis'' embryos. |journal=RNA |volume= 15|pages=2351–63 |pmid=19854872 |year=2009 |doi=10.1261/rna.1882009 |pmc=2779678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Monster Rancher Battle Card GB'''''|モンスターファームバトルカードGB|Monster Farm Battle Card GB}} is a handheld game released in 1999 for the [[Nintendo]] [[Game Boy Color]] system. It is the first game in Tecmo's ''Monster Rancher Battle Card'' series, featuring a [[Collectible card game|card game]] incorporating the popular characters from the ''[[Monster Rancher]]'' series. It was followed by ''Monster Rancher Battle Card: Episode II'' for the Sony [[PlayStation]] entertainment system which featured additional monsters.

==Gameplay==
Although the ''[[Monster Rancher]]'' series is known for the ability to import game content via CDs, ''Monster Rancher Battle Card GB'' has no equivalent functionality.  Instead, the player takes a short "personality test" to determine his starting deck and then can win additional cards by defeating opponents as well as new monster cards by defeating dungeon bosses.  While a code system is also in place, only a select few cards catering to a single monster along with some general support can be obtained through this method.

Each player's deck consists of three monster cards and an additional fifty attack/defense/support cards.  Monster cards start in play, have HP, and a type (either ground or air).  Attack are always specific to one monster breed, defense cards can be specific to one monster breed, and support cards.  To use these cards, a player usually has to pay an activation cost in the form of a resource called "guts".

The actual card game with both players, each with their three monsters on the field, flipping a coin to determine which player has the choice of going first or second.  Each player then draws five cards.  A player's turn consists of (in the following order):&lt;br /&gt;
A) A draw phase: The active player draws until he has five cards in hand)&lt;br /&gt;
B) A general phase: The active player can attack or use support cards.  At this time the defending player can use defense cards to counter an opponent's attack)&lt;br /&gt;
C) The discard phase: The active player can discard any number of cards from their hand.  Those discarded cards become "guts", which can be used to pay for attacks.

A monster is killed when its HP reaches 0.  A player loses when they have no monsters remaining or when they are unable to draw a card.

The game consists of a character traveling to dungeons to obtain sacred stones needed to generate new monster cards and fighting ranked battles to increase their level to unlock new dungeons.  Each dungeon contains multiple randomly generated floors, invisible guardians that automatically challenge the player, normal NPCs that the player can challenge, and a boss.  After achieving the maximum rank and completing all the dungeons, a new dungeon is discovered and after defeating its boss a player has the option of starting a new game+ during which his normal deck is locked until he reaches the final dungeon.  There's no actual story or objectives beyond unlocking content.

'''Mrs Woodham''' (formerly Smith; née Spencer&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;) was an [[entertainer]] known in both Dublin and London with the nickname "Buck Spencer".

She was born in the [[United Kingdom]] in or before 1743, apparently surnamed Spencer.&lt;ref name=burnim&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burnim|first1=Philip H.

Next, she performed at [[Marylebone Gardens]], in the early 1770s. She moved from London to [[Dublin]], Ireland. Woodham married a name with the surname Smith. She had a daughter. Mr. Smith died, and his widow married a man with the surname Woodham. Eventually, they divorced. She lived with her daughter's family. Mrs. Woodham was said to have died of [[suffocation]] and burns in a fire at Astley's theatre on 2 February 1803. She heard the alarm of fire and came to the door (or window) where egress awaited but returned for a dress or to secure the receipts of the house for the last two nights, which were in her charge. She died of smoke inhalation. Her body was burnt with little remaining for burial. Her surname, which appeared as "Woodham" in the ''Gentleman's Magazine'', was given in the ''Monthly Mirror'' as "Woodman", and it was noted that a similar actress named "Mrs Woodman" may have been the decedent.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Mark Humphreys, ‘Woodham, Mrs (d. 1803)’, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29921 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 {{subscription}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an actress "from England" called Mrs Woodham performing in Philadelphia in 1806 who was employed for her comical and musical skills.&lt;ref name=dr&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drell Reck|first1=Rene|title=The Career of Mrs. Anne Brunton Merry in the American Theatre|isbn=0807125121|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14403">'''Arlene Fraser''' was a 33-year-old woman from [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] in [[Moray]], Scotland, who vanished from her home on 28 April 1998 after her two children went to school. No trace of her was ever found, but her husband was convicted of her murder, upheld on appeal.

==Case==
Initially treated as a missing persons inquiry by [[Grampian Police]], the senior detective in the case [[Detective Chief Inspector]] Peter Simpson said six months after her disappearance "The only conclusion that's still left open to us, which I firmly believe has happened, is that something criminal has taken place here and that Arlene has been the victim of a crime. I am of the opinion that she's dead. There's no indication that she's living somewhere else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/201836.stm | work=BBC News | title=Police fear missing mother is dead | date=27 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time her husband Nat Fraser was on bail for the attempted murder of his wife for an incident that occurred before she disappeared, but at this point in the investigation police were satisfied with his [[alibi]]. This charge was later reduced to one of assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/636657.stm | work=BBC News | title=Arlene family 'sick' over dropped charge | date=9 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was jailed for 18 months when convicted nearly two years later. [[Defence counsel]] Neil Murray QC said part of the delay in bringing the case to court was that a number of challenges were made under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], claiming that Fraser could not get a fair trial because of publicity. Fraser was also charged with attempting to [[pervert the course of justice]] in relation to police inquiries into a beige [[Ford Fiesta]] which they believed to be involved in Arlene Fraser's disappearance. The car had been purchased by a friend of Nat Fraser, Hector Dick who also faced the same charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/662282.stm | work=BBC News | title=Arlene husband jailed | date=1 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick had been due to appear at Elgin [[Sheriff court|Sheriff Court]] in August 2000. However, the case was delayed and at the request of the defence moved, eventually being heard at [[Dingwall]] Sheriff Court at the start of 2001. On the fourth day of his trial Dick changed his plea, and pleaded guilty to a slightly lesser charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1108137.stm | work=BBC News | title=Arlene inquiry man pleads guilty | date=9 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently jailed for a year, during which period he attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself.

Fraser was released from prison in April 2001 after serving half his sentence but was jailed again four months later after admitting lying to receive almost £19,000 in legal aid funding. In June 2001, a third man Glenn Lucas was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to the case. Finally, on 26 April 2002, it was announced by the Crown Office that Fraser, Dick and Lucas had been indicted for the murder of Arlene Fraser, with each being charged with conspiring to murder Mrs Fraser, murdering her and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1954059.stm | work=BBC News | title=Husband charged with Arlene murder | date=26 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First trial==
During the trial in January 2003 it was announced that the Crown would not be proceeding with the charges against Dick and Lucas. [[Advocate Depute|Advocate depute]] Alan Turnbull QC, prosecuting, told the court that he intended to call Dick as a witness against Nat Fraser. The trial was then adjourned with the judge Lord Mackay explaining that there would be a delay before the trial could continue as Fraser's defence team would have a right to interview Dick and Lucas – something which could not be done while the two men were still facing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2656703.stm | work=BBC News | title=Arlene murder charges dropped | date=14 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick then appeared as a witness for the prosecution and admitted burning and crushing the Ford Fiesta police had been looking for because he feared that it might be linked to the disappearance of Arlene Fraser. He claimed in evidence that Fraser told him he had arranged for his estranged wife to be killed and then disposed of her body by grinding it up and burying it. He denied any involvement at all in the disappearance of Arlene.

As the trial progressed the Crown dropped three charges of attempting to defeat the ends of justice against Fraser, leaving him to face the sole charge of [[Murder|murde]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r "with others unknown". Fraser had lodged a special defence of alibi, claiming he was carrying out deliveries for his fruit and vegetable business on the day his wife vanished, a claim supported by an employee who was with him on the day.

On 29 January 2003, Nat Fraser was found guilty of the murder of his wife. Judge Lord Mackay described the 44-year-old as "evil" before sentencing him to life imprisonment, with a recommendation to serve a minimum of 25 years. Fraser collapsed as the judge passed sentence. His defence team immediately stated an intention to appeal. The case was described as the largest investigation Grampian Police had ever carried out but the absence of a body and any forensic evidence always hampered the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2707427.stm | work=BBC News | title=Arlene body search will go on | date=29 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal against conviction was lodged in December 2003, and in May the following year the [[The Court of Appeal for England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] granted leave for him to do so. On 19 October 2005 the [[BBC]] broadcast "Arlene Fraser Murder Trial: The Missing Evidence" which claimed that Dick had lied during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4355058.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doubts over Fraser trial evidence | date=19 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in March 2006 two inquiries were announced after claims that relevant evidence was not made available to the original trial. [[Lord Advocate]] Colin Boyd stated that it was "a matter of serious concern" that the information had not been given to lawyers for Fraser. A Crown Office statement said  "The lord advocate regards it as a matter of serious concern that this evidence was not made available to the defence prior to the trial. For that reason, the area procurator fiscal for Glasgow, Catherine Dyer, has now been asked to conduct a full investigation into this matter." Grampian Police asked the [[Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland]] (ACPOS) to investigate its handling of relevant information and evidence.That inquiry was to be carried out by a team from [[Strathclyde Police]], headed by [[Deputy chief constable|Deputy Chief Constable]] Ricky Gray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4797036.stm | work=BBC News | title=Probes ordered into Fraser case | date=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Fraser was released from prison pending the outcome of his appeal. Shortly after fresh allegations about the case appeared in the press, prompting Arlene's family to call for Fraser to be returned to prison, though this did not happen. The case went to appeal in November 2007 with claims that the prosecution in the original case had withheld evidence, and that police officers had lied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/7096198.stm | work=BBC News | title=Police 'lied' over Nat evidence | date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December, Fraser was returned to prison pending the outcome of the appeal which was announced on 6 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/06_05_08_natfrasernew.pdf | title=In Appeal by Nat Gordon Fraser against Her Majesty's Advocate|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Justice Clerk, Lord Gill, sitting with Lord Osborne and Lord Johnston refused the appeal. As he was led from court Fraser told waiting reporters "The fight will go on, as will the fight to get to the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/7361103.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fraser loses Arlene murder appeal | date=6 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year, he announced that he intended to apply for leave to appeal to the [[Privy council|Privy Council]] in London, the hearing to take place in the [[High Court]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused. A further appeal in November 2009 contended that earlier appeal hearings were not fair under human rights legislation. That appeal too was refused in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8487520.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fraser loses wife murder appeal | date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no further routes of appeal in the Scottish Courts, and in May 2010, Fraser announced an intention to appeal in the Supreme Court in London having been given special leave to do so. In May 2011, Fraser won his appeal. Allowing it, the Supreme Court judges said in their deliberations: "The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It remits the case to a differently constituted Appeal Court to consider whether to grant authority for a new prosecution and then, having considered that point, to quash the conviction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/24.html] 2011 SLT 515, [2011] UKSC 24, 2011 SCL 582&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown Office immediately said it would seek to bring fresh proceedings against Fraser, whilst in a statement, Arlene Fraser's family said: "Today's decision by the Supreme Court is bitterly disappointing. We accept today's decision. However, we fully support the Crown's intention to seek authority to bring fresh proceedings against Nat Fraser for Arlene's murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-13534802 | work=BBC News | title=Nat Fraser wins appeal to quash murder conviction | date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second trial==
In 2012, Fraser went on trial again in the High Court in Edinburgh, before judge [[Alastair Campbell, Lord Bracadale|Lord Bracadale]] with Advocate Depute [[Alex Prentice]] QC leading for the prosecution.  On 30 May, he was again found guilty by majority verdict of Arlene's murder and sentenced to a minimum seventeen years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-18247944 |title=Nat Fraser found guilty for second time of murdering wife Arlene in 1998 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Robertson |first2=Claire |last2=Smoth |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/nat-fraser-found-guilty-for-second-time-of-murdering-wife-arlene-1-2327016 |title=Arlene Fraser trial: Family fear Nat Fraser will prolong legal battle |publisher=Johnston PRess |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hector Dick again gave evidence against Fraser. John Scott QC, defending, said the case was "blighted by hindsight and assumption", and argued much of the Crown evidence was "unreliable". During cross examination, Scott suggested that Dick had been responsible for the murder of Arlene Fraser, an allegation he denied.

Following the verdict Lord Bracadale told Fraser: "The evidence indicated that at some point you arranged for someone to kill your wife, Arlene, and dispose of her body. Thus you instigated in cold blood the pre-meditated murder of your wife and mother of your children, then aged 10 and five years. The murder and disposal of the body must have been carried out with ruthless efficiency, for there is not a trace of Arlene Fraser from that day to this and her bereft family continue to live with no satisfactory knowledge of what happened to her remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-18247944 |title=Nat Fraser found guilty for second time of murdering wife Arlene in 1998| work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser and his supporters maintain that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice and that he did not murder his wife.

==Television documentary==
The second trial was the subject of a television documentary "''The Murder Trial"'', which was shown on [[Channel 4]] on 9 July 2013, only the second time that footage from a British murder trial was broadcast on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-murder-trial/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903095655/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-murder-trial/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1|title=The Murder Trial - Series 1 - Episode 1 - The Murder Trial|archivedate=3 September 2014|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=21 July 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary won the award for the best single documentary at the [[2014 British Academy Television Awards]].

==2013 appeal==
In October 2013 an appeal against conviction by Fraser was refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/media-site/latest-news-from-copfs/535-nat-fraser-appeal-refused|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000455/http://www.copfs.gov.uk/media-site/latest-news-from-copfs/535-nat-fraser-appeal-refused |title=Nat Fraser Appeal Refused |newspaper=Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Scotland |archivedate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17977">'''Glenn Kopitske''' (July 24, 1966 – July 31, 2003), was murdered by 17-year-old Gary Hirte in [[Wisconsin]].  Hirte initially admitted to killing Kopitske "to see if he could get away with it".  However, he later claimed to have experienced temporary insanity that resulted from his rage after a supposed homosexual encounter with Kopitske.

==The victim==

Glenn Kopitske was adopted by Shirley and Virgil Kopitske, a couple who had already buried two children.&lt;ref name='CrimeLib'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/gary_hirte/index.html |title=Gary Hirte and the Perfect Murder |last=McGraw |first=Seamus |work=The Crime Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820233717/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/young/gary_hirte/index.html |archivedate=2007-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After college at the [[University of Texas]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], where he tried his hand at [[stand-up comedy]], he returned to live near his parents in [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin]]. Diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] as a teenager,&lt;ref name='Stingl'&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Stingle |coauthors= |title=That's one insane defense strategy |date=2005-02-04 |publisher= |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=298777 |work=The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel |pages= |accessdate=2007-07-31 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124424/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=298777 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kopitske needed to be close to his parents but required some independence as well.

In 1996, Kopitske—who received a monthly federal check due to his psychological disability, and supported himself by working at [[Wal-Mart]] and substitute teaching in [[New London, Wisconsin|New London]]—took $500 and declared himself a candidate for the [[White House]], even though he was five years too young to qualify as a presidential candidate.&lt;ref name='CrimeLib' /&gt; He even invited citizens to a meet-and-greet luncheon.&lt;ref name='Suspect' /&gt; He did community theatre, appearing in a local theater production of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''.&lt;ref name='Suspect'&gt;{{cite news|first=Jessica |last=McBride |coauthors= |title=Eagle scout is murder suspect |date=2004-02-07 |publisher= |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=19381 |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-02 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134227/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=19381 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Glenn Kopitske had been dead for almost two days when his mother drove to his house on Saturday, August 2, after not being able to reach him by phone, and discovered his nude  body. Kopitske's back door was locked, which his mother said was unusual for him. Shirley Kopitske also noticed that her son's car keys, which he always kept on the kitchen table, were missing.

The summer heat had so affected Kopitske's body that authorities initially thought he had died of natural causes. Only on Monday, August 5, when a [[Clinical pathology|pathologist]] turned Kopitske's body over and noticed liquefied brain matter leaking from a wound in the back of the head did authorities realize that Kopitske had been shot to death, and that the marks on his chest and back were actually post-mortem stab wounds.

The physical search of the murder scene turned up no further evidence. During a canvas of the neighborhood, a neighbor claimed that a few nights earlier he had seen "an older car with square headlights and rectangular taillights" driving through the area, flashing a bright light at the three residences on the dead end street.&lt;ref name='CrimeLib' /&gt; It would be several months before investigators knew who had killed Kopitske, and why.

Two weeks after Kopitske's murder Hirte called his friend, Eric Wenzelow, and asked him if he knew about Kopitske's murder. Over two weeks earlier, Wenzelow had been with Hirte, cruising [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnegabo County]] at night, in Hirte's [[Dodge Dynasty]] shining a 500,000-candle-power spotlight around. Hirte called it "shining for deer".&lt;ref name='Stuff' /&gt; The game involved shining the light at deer, thus paralyzing them, and took them right past Kopitske's house.

"I did it," Hirte told Wenzelow during that call.

Wenzelow did not believe Hirte initially. So Hirte showed him the 8-inch long hunting knife he said he used to stab Kopitske in the back and chest, and the keys he said he'd taken from Kopitske's home.&lt;ref name='Friend'&gt;{{cite news|first=Meg |last=Jones |coauthors= |title=Friend didn't believe confession |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=297809 |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-02 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213434/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=297809 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003 Hirte met Olivia Thoma at the [[Waupaca County, Wisconsin|Waupaca County]] Fair, where she was chosen "Fairest of the Fair".  Over the course of their relationship, Hirte told Thoma how he had murdered Kopitske. Thoma became convinced that Hirte was telling the truth and, in January 2004, told local police about her suspicions, providing details about the murder that had not been reported in the media.

Hirte told Thoma that he had driven his father's car, which matched the description given by Kopitske's neighbor, to Kopitske's home and shot him in the back of the head with a [[12-gauge]] [[shotgun]], then stabbed him twice in the back and once in the heart.&lt;ref name='Suspect' /&gt;

On January 28, 2004, Thoma agreed to engage Hirte in a telephone conversation about the murder, while the police listened and recorded what was said.&lt;ref name='Stuff' /&gt; During that telephone call, Hirte told Thoma he'd killed Kopitske "to see if he could get away with it".&lt;ref name='NCTimes'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Wisconsin teen charged with committing homicide to see if he could outsmart police | date=2004-02-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2004/02/10/backpage/2_9_0421_55_08.txt | work =North Country Times | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannon2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=Michael|title=Abu Ghraib|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNMfQkNPbrIC&amp;pg=PA269|accessdate=19 September 2012|date=2005-03-30|publisher=Xulon Press|isbn=9781597810098|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his arrest, Hirte would confess to a very different motive.

==Arrest==
The following day, police interviewed Hirte's friends at school, including Wenzelow, who told them about driving past Kopitske's house with Hirte in July while they were "shining for deer", and how Hirte had told him about the murder and showed him the knife.

Hirte was called to the principal's office and arrested. Hirte admitted telling friends that he had killed Kopitske but claimed to have been making it up. He later hired [[Gerald Boyle]], who had previously defended [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], as his defense attorney.

The same day, police arrived at the Hirtes' home with a search warrant. In Hirte's room, they found Kopitske's keys above the doorsill. They also found a [[12-gauge]] [[shotgun]] in the basement.

On August 30, 2004, Hirte was charged with [[first-degree murder]]. He was held in [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnebago County]] jail on $400,000 bond.&lt;ref name='Newsweek' /&gt; He pleaded not guilty, and later changed his plea to [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect]]. If he were found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, Hirte would be able to petition every six months for release.&lt;ref name='GayPanic'&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title="Gay Panic" Led to Murder after Attack |date=2005-02-01 |publisher= |url=http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/02/020105panic.htm |work=365Gay.Com |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-02 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410214110/http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/02/020105panic.htm |archivedate=2007-04-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyers suggested that [[DNA]] evidence suggested the theory that Hirte killed Kopitske just to see if he could get away with it was not true.&lt;ref name='Plea'&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=Former Eagle Scout Changes Plea in Murder Case| date=2004-10-04| publisher=| url=http://www.wisn.com/news/2836008/detail.html| work=WISN| pages=| accessdate=2007-08-02| language=| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063539/http://www.wisn.com/news/2836008/detail.html| archivedate=2007-09-28| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The murder==
Police alleged, based in part on Hirte's recorded comments to Thoma, that on the night of Kopitske's murder, Hirte parked his car at the end of the dead-end road, and retrieved a [[12-gauge]] [[shotgun]] from the trunk of the car.

Kopitske was asleep, but likely woke up and got out of bed after Hirte entered the house. Upon seeing Hirte and his [[shotgun]], Kopitske pleaded with Hirte not to shoot him. Hirte then said he ordered Kopitske to lie down on the floor.&lt;ref name='ABCNews'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Teen Killer Has No Remorse | date=2005-01-17 | publisher=ABC News | url =http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Health/story?id=591736 | work =Primetime | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forensics]] tests show that Hirte then pressed the muzzle of the [[shotgun]] in to the back of Kopitske's head and then fired.&lt;ref name='CrimeLib' /&gt; Hirte said he then stabbed Kopitske twice. The second time, the knife plunged in so deep that Hirte had to use two hands to pull it out.&lt;ref name='ABCNews' /&gt; Before leaving, Hirte spotted Kopitske's keys on the table, and slipped them into his pocket.

==The motive==
On January 31, 2005 Hirte's attorney said that Hirte had [[homosexual]] urges that intensified when he drank alcohol. Those urges, Boyle said, led to a sexual encounter between Hirte and Kopitske, after which Hirte's rage over the encounter led him to return to Kopitske's house and kill him.&lt;ref name='Bombshell'&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Defense Attorney Drops Bombshell in Honor Student's Murder Trial |date=2005-01-31 |publisher= |url=http://www.wisn.com/news/4146869/detail.html |work=WISN |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-02 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063550/http://www.wisn.com/news/4146869/detail.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle said that Hirte could not explain the murder for months, until a [[forensic]] report suggested a possible sexual element to the crime.&lt;ref name='ABCNews' /&gt; Hirte then "broke down" and told the story of what he said happened between him and Kopitske.

"One of the torments he had", Boyle told the jury about Hirte, was that "he didn't understand his own sexuality".&lt;ref name='Friend' /&gt;

Hirte said that hours before the murder he had been sitting on top of his car, underneath a bridge, drinking alcohol and listening to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. He'd finished six [[malt liquor]]s and 15 shots of [[vodka]] when Kopitske drove up in his car.&lt;ref name='ABCNews' /&gt; Hirte said Kopitske flirted with him, and the two agreed to  return to Kopitske's house where Hirte performed [[oral sex]] on Kopitske.&lt;ref name='Bombshell' /&gt; According to Hirte, their encounter was consensual.&lt;ref name='ABCNews' /&gt;

Hirte testified that afterward he returned to his car and fell asleep. When he awoke, he was sober and enraged about having had sex with another man. Hirte said he felt "just grossed out beyond belief, disappointed ... [at] the proof of my imperfection that I had done these things". He said he believed a [[homosexual]] act was "not as bad as [[rape|raping]] or [[torture|torturing]] someone" but was worse than murder.

Expert witness for the defense, John Liccione, said that Hirte was in the middle of a [[psychotic depressive reaction]], though he had no history of mental problems. Assistant District Attorney Michelle, emphasized that the sexual encounter did not come up until trial, asked Liccionne during cross examination if Hirte would rather have had his parents believe that he was a cold-blooded killer or a homosexual. Licionne answered that it would be very difficult for a teenager in a religious family to admit homosexual feelings or activities.&lt;ref name='Stingl' /&gt;

Hirte's parents believed their son's story about a sexual encounter with Kopitske, and that he would have been willing to risk life imprisonment to keep that secret to himself.&lt;ref name='ABCNews' /&gt; Kopitske's parents said later that there was no way the sexual encounter Hirte talked about had happened.&lt;ref name='Yell'&gt;{{cite news | first=Jerry | last=Burke | coauthors= | title=Kopitske's Wanted to Yell During Hirte Trial | date= | publisher= | url=http://www.wbay.com/Global/story.asp?S=2913395&amp;nav=51s7W52h | work=WBAY | pages= | accessdate=2007-08-02 | language= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705201858/http://www.wbay.com/Global/story.asp?S=2913395&amp;nav=51s7W52h | archive-date=2007-07-05 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

District Attorney Bill Lennon doubted that the sexual encounter happened,&lt;ref name='ABCNews' /&gt; and said that no forensic evidence suggested a sexual encounter.&lt;ref name='Nichols'&gt;{{cite news | first=Mike | last=Nichols | coauthors= | title=This killing notable for a lack of remorse | date=2005-03-19 | publisher= | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20050319/ai_n13460576 | work =Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | language = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hussain Saeed Alnahdi''' was a 24-year-old [[University of Wisconsin–Stout]] student from [[Sharurah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], majoring in Business Administration, who was murdered in [[Menomonie, Wisconsin|Menomonie]], in [[Dunn County, Wisconsin|Dunn County]], Wisconsin, United States, in 2016.&lt;ref name="Garza"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/01/saudi-student-assaulted-wisconsin-dies-his-injuries/93101338/ |title=Saudi student is beaten, killed in Wisconsin |first1=Jesse |last1=Garza |first2=Karen |last2=Herzog |work=[[USA Today]] |date=1 November 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/01/saudi-college-student-in-wisconsin-dies-after-assault/ |title= Saudi college student in Wisconsin dies after assault |work=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] |first=Derek |last=Hawkins |date=1 November 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/us/killing-of-saudi-university-student-shakes-wisconsin-city.html |title=Killing of Saudi Student Shakes Wisconsin College Town |work=[[The New York Times|New York Times]] |first=Christine |last=Hauser |date=3 November 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SameeAli"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/saudi-student-s-brutal-killing-shakes-small-wisconsin-town-n677461 |title=A Saudi Student's Brutal Killing Shakes a Small Wisconsin Town |first=Safia |last=Samee Ali |work=[[NBC News]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helling"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.com/crime/wisconsin-college-saudi-student-saeed-alnahdi-killed/ |title=A Small Town Seeks Answers After Beloved College Student’s Beating Death Outside Pizzeria |first=Steve |last=Helling |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mūsá ibn Ja‘far al-Kāzim''' ({{lang-ar|موسى بن جعفر الكاظم}}), also called '''Abūl-Hasan''', '''Abū Abd Allah''', '''Abū Ibrāhīm''', and '''al-Kāzim''' (the one who controls his anger), was the seventh [[Shiite]] [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imam]] after his father [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. He is regarded by [[Sunni]]s as a renowned scholar, and was a contemporary of the Abbasid caliphs [[Al-Mansur]], [[Al-Hadi]], [[Al-Mahdi]] and [[Harun al-Rashid]]. He was imprisoned several times; finally dying in [[Baghdad]] in the Sindi ibn Shahak prison. [[Ali al-Rida|Ali al-Ridha]], the eighth Imām, and [[Fātimah bint Mūsā|Fatemah Masume]] were among his children.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Publications"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Talee |title=A Brief History of the Fourteen Infallibles |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (September 25, 2014) |isbn=978-1502474438 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_o7CoQEACAAJ&amp;dq=A+Brief+History+of+The+Fourteen+Infallibles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfmJ2Q0N3eAhXBYlAKHZfEDUgQ6AEIJzAA |pages=135–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi2"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p = 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"&gt;{{harvnb|Tabatabai|1975|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Donaldson |first1=Dwight M. |title=Shi'Ite Religion: A History of Islam in Persia and Irak |publisher=Ams Pr Inc (June 1, 1980) |isbn=978-0404189594 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcmPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+Shiite+Religion:+A+History+of+Islam+in+Persia+and+Iraq&amp;dq=The+Shiite+Religion:+A+History+of+Islam+in+Persia+and+Iraq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj08_7f1d3eAhWLaFAKHWVDBWMQ6AEIJzAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and early life==
Musa al-Kadhim was born during the conflict between the [[Abbasid]]s and [[Umayyad]]s, and was four years old when [[As-Saffah]], the first Abbasid Caliph, took the throne. His mother, Hamidah, was a former slave from either [[Berber people|Berbery]] or [[Andalusia]]. Al-Kadhim was brought up in a large family, with nine sisters and six brothers. His oldest brother [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Ismail]] predeceased his father Ja'far al-Sadiq, who held the position of Imam. According to [[Twelver]] Shiites, Musa was chosen by divine order and decree of his father as the next Imam.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

According to some sources, al-Kadhim was religiously minded as a child. [[Muhammad Baqir Majlisi]] relates an incident where [[Abū Ḥanīfa]] called on [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] to ask his advice. While there, he encountered al-Kadhim, who was then five years old. Hanifa asked al-Kadhim the question meant for his father, saying: "Boy, from whom does disobedience (issue)? Does it issue from Allah or from the servant?" Al-Kadhim answered, saying: "Either it issues from God and not from the servant at all, so God does not punish the servant for what he does not do; or it issues from the servant and God, and God is a stronger partner. Therefore, the stronger partner has no right to punish the weak for a sin in which they are equal; or it issues from the servant and not from God. So if He wills to pardon (him), (He will pardon him), and if He wills to punish (him), (He will punish him); and God is He whose help is sought." Upon hearing this, Hanifa left, saying that the answer had been good enough for him.{{efn|See Al-Murteda, Amali, vol. 1, pp. 105-106, and Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 4, p. 1049}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]], in Kadhimiya]] 
In another incident, [[Abū Ḥanīfa]] complained to al-Sadiq, saying: "I have seen your son, Musa, pray while the people were passing (walking) before him. He did not prevent them from that."{{efn|Muslims are instructed to say their prayer toward a point called [[Qibla]], a point that symbolizes the unity of God. So it is not appropriate traditionally to walk in front of someone who is directing his face toward Qibla.}} The Imam ordered his son to be brought before him, and asked him whether it was true. Al-Khadhim replied "Yes, father, the [[God in Islam|One]] to Whom I pray is nearer to me than them;{{efn|Meaning "people walking before me does not prevent me from facing God, as God is not at [[Qibla]] or in [[Kaaba]] as people might imagine, but He is with me".}} [[God in Islam|Allah]], the Great and Almighty, says: ''[[God in Islam|We]] are nearer to him than the jugular vein.''"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#50:16 Quran, 50:16]}} On hearing this response, the Imam rose, hugged his son, and said; "May my father and mother be your ransom, O he in whom secrets have been deposited!"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dungersi |first1=Mohamed Raza |title=A Brief Biography of Imam Musa bin Jafar (a.s.): al-Kadhim |publisher=Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania, 1996 |isbn=9789976956931 |page=4-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Brief_Biography_of_Imam_Musa_bin_Jafar.html?id=uYlkAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imamate==

Musa al-Kadhim was said to be a gentle and tolerant man. He was called al-Kadhim because he was kind, forgiving and generous toward the people who treated him in a bad manner or were unfriendly towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Illahi |first1=Mahboob |title=Doctrine of Terror: Saudi Salafi Religion |publisher=FriesenPress (October 2, 2018) |isbn=978-1525526466 |page=175 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Doctrine-Terror-Saudi-Salafi-Religion/dp/1525526472/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1542524188&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9781525526473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi2" /&gt; [[Ibn Khallikan]] said "that when a man had spoken ill of him he sent him a purse of money."&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; One such incident concerned a man who cursed al-Kadhim's grandfather, Imam [[Ali]]. The Imam's followers intended to kill the man, but al-Kadhim prevented them. He went to the man's farm in the outskirts of [[Medina]]. He approached him, but the man shouted at him not to walk on his plants. The Imam paid no attention and when he reached him, sat beside him and treated him kindly, asking how much had the man paid to sow his land. "One hundred dinars," said the man. "How much do you hope to acquire from it?" asked the Imam. "I do not know the unknown," said the man. "I only asked you about what you hope it would bring you," insisted the Imam. The man answered "two hundred dinars", and the Imam gave him three hundred dinars, saying "This three hundred dinars is for you and your plants are as they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alkadumi |first1=Kamel |title=The Balancing Theory of Sayyid Hussain Isma'Eel Al-Sadr |publisher=AuthorHouse (October 1, 2014) |isbn=978-1496943491 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aedswEACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Balancing+Theory+of+Sayyid+Hussain+Isma%27Eel+Al-Sadr&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_6IHLsN3eAhWQbVAKHUarC4UQ6AEILDAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi2 129"/&gt;

The Imam then headed for the mosque of the prophet, where he saw that the man was already sitting there. When he saw the Imam, the man stood up and called out the verse: "Allah knows best where to put his (prophetic) mission."&lt;ref name="Alkadumi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alkadumi |first1=Kamel |title=The Balancing Theory of Sayyid Hussain Isma'Eel Al-Sadr |publisher=AuthorHouse (October 1, 2014) |isbn=978-1496943491 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aedswEACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Balancing+Theory+of+Sayyid+Hussain+Isma%27Eel+Al-Sadr&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_6IHLsN3eAhWQbVAKHUarC4UQ6AEILDAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#6:124 Quran, 6:124]}}
His companions were surprised at this change, but the man recited to them the noble deeds of the Imam and invoked Allah for him. Hence, the Imam turned to his companions and said: "Which was better – what you wanted or what I wanted? I have put right his attitude to the extent you have now become acquainted with."&lt;ref name="Amini"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Amini |first1=Ayatullah Ibrahim |title=Imamate and The Imams |url=https://www.al-islam.org/imamate-and-imams-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/seventh-imam-musa-al-kadhim |publisher=Ansariyan Publications - Qum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alkadumi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi2 129"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Musa al-Kadhim was also called Abdu' al-Salih (the Holy Servant) because his interests lay in religious rather than political matters. He was known to distribute money to the town of Medina&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; despite his family being poor.&lt;ref name="Alkadumi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shiite Imams frequently had to deal with persecution, and sometimes resorted to the practice of [[taqiyya]], a form of religious dissimulation, for protection. When Jafar al-Sadiq was poisoned, the Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] wanted to end the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imamah]], and so he wrote to the governor of [[Medina]] to behead the person that al-Sadiq had named as his successor in his last testament. When he read the testament, however, the governor of Medina saw that the Imam had chosen four people rather than one: the [[caliph]] himself, the governor of Medina, the Imam's older son [[Abdullah al-Aftah]], and Musa, his younger son. As a result, Mansur was unable to end the imamate. However, unlike his father who had been able to teach freely in Medina, Musa al-Kadhim lived with tight restrictions set by Abbasid caliphs, such as al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brief History of Fourteen Infallibles |url=https://www.al-islam.org/brief-history-fourteen-infallibles/eighth-infallible-sixth-imam |publisher=World Organization for Islamic Services (WOFIS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tabatabai|1975|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Musa al-Kadhim never accepted Harun's government, because he believed al- Rashid sought to destroy Islam by erasing the truth and effacing justice. Therefore, he forbade his Shi'ites from cooperating with Harun, excluding those who through their jobs could help the believers and save them from oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Illahi |first1=Mahboob |title=Doctrine of Terror: Saudi Salafi Religion |publisher=FriesenPress (October 2, 2018) |isbn=978-1525526466 |page=176-177|url=https://www.amazon.com/Doctrine-Terror-Saudi-Salafi-Religion/dp/1525526472/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1542524188&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9781525526473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharif al-Qarashi2 2000, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]], an opponent of the Imam, said that al-Kadhim had the qualities of a true Imam, and that he was better suited to inherit the Caliphate from [[Muhammad]] than al-Rashid. When his son [[al-Ma'mun]] asked him why he magnified the Imam, he said that Musa al-Kadhim was "the Imam of the people, the proof of Allah's mercy to His creation and His [[caliph]] among His servants". "I am", Harun said, "outwardly the Imam of the masses by force and through oppression, while Musa ibn Ja'far is the Imam in truth." However, he said that he would not deliver the Caliphate to the Imam: "by Allah, if you yourself attempt to take such caliphate from me, I shall take it away from you even if that means gouging your eyes, for power is blind." He advised his son to get true knowledge from the Imam, saying: "This (Musa al-Kadhim) is the inheritor of the knowledge of the Prophets ... If you desire sound knowledge, you will find it with this."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards when al-Ma'mun inherited the Caliphate from al-Rashid, he insisted on giving it to Musa al-Kadhim's son, [[Ali al-Ridha]], the eighth Shiite Imam, arguing that he found "no person on the face of earth more learned than this man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharif Al-qarashi |first1=Baqir |title=The Life of Imam Musa Bin Ja'far Al-Kazim |page=81|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2017 |isbn=9781546508021 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJBmswEACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Life+of+Imam+Musa+Bin+Ja%27far+al-Kazim&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijyZSn2d3eAhVMa1AKHbrkAJ0Q6AEIJzAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division===
After the death of al-Kadhim's father, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Imam the majority of Shiites followed Musa al-Kadhim, while another group followed [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Isma'il]], al-Sadiq's older son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=writer |first1=writer |title=ISMAʿILISM |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ismailism-1 |publisher=December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imam Jafar al-Sadiq tried hard to clarify that his son Musa will be the next Imam after his death because the Shi'a maintain that the infallibility of the Imam is a basic rule in the Imamate. “The theologians have defined the Imamate, saying: "Surely the Imamate is a grace from Allah, Who grants it to the most perfect and best of His servants to Him”&lt;ref&gt;Sharif al-Qarashi p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; This latter group separated afterwards from the majority of Shiites and became known as [[Ismaili]]s. Smaller groups accepted either [[Abdullah al-Aftah]] or [[Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq (Al-Dibaj)|Muhammad]], other sons of Ja'far al-Sadiq, as the Imam. Finally, another group considered Ja'far al-Sadiq to be the last Imam. After the death of Musa al-Kadhim, the majority followed his son, [[Ali al-Ridha]], while the rest believed that al-Kadhim was the last Imam. This latter group became known as the [[Waqifite Shia|Waqifiyah]].{{efn|Among the sects which separated from the majority of Shiites only [[Zaidiyyah]] and [[Ismaili]] continue to exist till now.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai 1975 68–69"&gt;{{harvnb|Tabatabai|1975|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}&lt;ref name="Tabatabai 1975 68–69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corbin |first1=Henry |title=History Of Islamic Philosophy |publisher=Kegan Paul International, 1993 |isbn=9780710304162 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_Islamic_Philosophy.html?id=DH8EAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological disputes==

===With Harun al-Rashid ===
One of the stories about the Imam concerns an incident where [[Harun al-Rashid]] and the Imam were together before the tomb of [[Muhammad]] in [[Medina]], when, to show his family ties to Muhammad, al-Rashid had said, "Salutation unto thee, O Prophet of God, unto thee who art my cousin!" In response, the Imam said, "Salutation unto thee, o my dear father!" which made al-Rashid furious. "Abul-Hasan, such glory as thine is truly to be vaunted of" said al-Rashid.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; Later, al-Rashid found the opportunity to question him, asking why he had permitted people to ascribe him to Muhammad and to call him: "O Sons of [[Muhammad|Allah's Apostle]]", while he was actually the son of [[Ali]], and that one is ascribed to his father, and that [[Fatimah]], his mother, was a container, and that Muhammad was his grandfather on the side of his mother. The Imam replied, asking "If the Prophet was raised from the dead and proposed to your daughter, would you respond to him?" "Rather I would through that pride myself on the Arabs, the non-Arabs, and [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]]," answered al-Rashid. "But he would not propose (to my daughter) and I would not marry (her) to him," said the Imam, "because he begot me and did not beget you." Al-Rashid, however, was not satisfied with this answer, insisting that "the progeny belongs to the male and not to the female", and that the Imams were Muhammad's daughter's children.{{efn|The argument here is whether women count when reckoning ancestry.}}&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|pp=200–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imam quoted from the Quran, stating that in the Quran, God had said: "and of his descendants, David and Solomon, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], [[Joseph]], [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]]; and thus do We reward those who do good. And [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] and [[John the Baptist]], and [[Jesus]] and [[Elijah|Elias]]: All in the company of the righteous"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#6:84 Quran, 6:84,85]}} "Who is Jesus's father, O Commander of the faithful?" asked the Imam. "Jesus had no father," said al-Rashid. The Imam argued that God had ascribed Jesus to the descendants of the prophets through [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]; "similarly, we have been ascribed to the descendants of the Prophet through our mother [[Fatimah]]," said the Imam.&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202"/&gt; Nevertheless, al-Rashid asked the Imam to give him more evidence and proof, so he put forward another quote from the Quran, reciting the verse: "But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come, let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars."{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#3:61 Quran, 3:61]}} Then he said: "None claims that the Prophet made someone enter under [[Ahl al-Kisa|the cloak]] when he challenged the Christians to a contest of prayer to God ([[Event of Mubahala|mubahala]]) except [[Ali]], [[Fatimah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|al-Hasan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|al-Husayn]]. Therefore the explanation of the verse is: Our sons are al-Hasan and al-Husayn; our women is [[Fatimah]]; ourselves is [[Ali]]."{{efn|For more information see the [[Event of Mubahala]]}}&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202"/&gt;

===With Bishr al-Hafi===
Another incident concerns [[Bishr the Barefoot|Bishr al-Hafi]], who led a [[Bacchic]] life. Once in the midst of the noise, music, alcoholic drink and frivolity, Musa al-Kadhim happened to pass by his house in Baghdad. Al-Kadhim saw a slave girl coming out of the house carrying some sweepings. He turned to the slave and asked her: "Is the owner of this house free or a servant?" "He is free," she replied. "You are right," responded Musa al-Kadhim, "if he was a servant, he would fear his Lord."&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi130"/&gt; The slave girl came into the house while al-Hafi was still at the wine table: "What delayed you?" asked al-Hafi. She informed him of what had happened between her and the Imam. It is said that al-Hafi rushed to the door barefooted but the Imam had already left, so he left in search of the Imam, and when he found him, asked him to repeat his words. Al-Hafi was so taken aback by the Imam's words that he fell on the ground and began to cry. "No, I am a slave, I am a slave." From then on, he would walk without shoes and people would call him Bishr al-Hafi (The barefooted one). When asked why he did not wear shoes, he would say that he was guided while he was barefoot, so he would remain in that condition till death.&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi130"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With a monk===
A final incident concerned Al-Abbas (born Hilal al-Shami), who said to Musa al-Kadhim that people admired those who ate simple food, wore coarse clothes, and showed reverence. For that reason, the Imam reminded him of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]], who had been a prophet; however, Joseph had worn silk mantles decorated with gold, and sat on the thrones of the Pharaohs. "The people were in no need of his clothes, but they were in need of his justice," said the Imam. "An [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imam]] is required to be just and fair; when he says something, he says the truth; when he promises something, he fulfills his promise; when he passes a judgement, he judges equitably. Allah has not forbidden wearing a particular type of clothes or eating a particular type of food earned through a lawful way; rather He has forbidden the unlawful, little or much." Then he recited the verse: "Say: Who has forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the agreeable things of the sustenance."{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#7:32 Quran, 7:32]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonments and death==

===First imprisonment===
Musa al-Kadhim was imprisoned multiple times during his lifetime. The first time, Caliph [[al-Mahdi]] had him arrested and brought to [[Baghdad]]. According to [[Ibn Khallikan]], "This Caliph had a dream in which [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]] appeared to him and said, 'O Muhammad, were ye ready therefore, if ye had been put in authority, to commit evil in the earth, and to violate the ties of blood?{{'"}}{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#47:22 Quran, 47:22]}} [[Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi']] says: "He sent for me at night and that put me in great dread. I went to him and found him chanting the above verse and no man had a finer voice than he. He said to me, 'Bring me Musa ibn Ja'far.' I did so and he embraced him, seated him by his side and said to him, 'Abul-Hasan, I have just seen in a dream the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abu Talib, and he has recited to me such and such a verse; give me the assurance that you will not revolt against me or against any of my children.' He answered, 'By Allah, I am incapable of revolting.' 'You say the truth!' replied the Caliph, 'give him three thousand pieces of gold and restore him to his family in [[Medina]].' I arranged the affair of his departure that very night, lest some obstacle might turn up, and before morning the man was on his journey."{{efn|[[Ibn Khallikan]], ''Deaths of Eminent Men'', trans. de Slane}}&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

===Second imprisonment===
Al-Kadhim's second imprisonment was a result of his argument with al-Rashid over descent from Muhammad. Al-Khuzai, the head of the palace guards, narrated a dream the Caliph supposedly had, which made him release the Imam: "A messenger came to me from al-Rashid," he said, "at an hour in which I never before received his visits; he pulled me from the place where I was and would not even allow me to change my clothes. This put me in great fear. When I arrived at the palace, I found the Caliph sitting up in his bed. I saluted him, but he kept silent for some time; so my mind was much troubled and my fears greatly augmented. At length he said, 'Do you know why I sent for you at such an hour?' I answered, 'By Allah, I do not, [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]].' 'Know,' said he, 'that I just had a dream in which it seemed to me as if an [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] came to me with a javelin in his hand and said to me: "Let Musa ibn Ja'far be set at liberty this very hour, otherwise I shall slay thee with this javelin." Do you therefore go and get him set free.' I replied, 'Commander of the Faithful, shall I then liberate Musa the son of Ja'far?' 'Yes,' said he, 'go and set Musa ibn Ja'far at liberty. Give him thirty thousand [[dirhem]]s and say to him in my name, if you would like to remain with us you will obtain from me whatever you desire, but if you prefer going to [[Medina]] you have permission to do so.' I went to the prison and found the Imam waiting for me. 'Whilst I was asleep,' he said, 'behold the Apostle of God came to me and said, O Musa, thou hast been imprisoned unjustly; so recite the words I am going to repeat to thee, for assuredly thou shalt not pass all this night in prison.{{'"}}{{efn|This narration continues as follows:I replied, "For
thee I should give up father and mother, what must I say?" 
"Repeat these words," said he: 
"o thou who hearest every voice! 
o thou who lettest no opportunity escape! 
o thou who clothest the bones with flesh 
and who wilt raise them up after death! 
I invoke thee by thy holy name, and by that 
great and awful name which is treasured up 
and closely hidden, by that name which no 
created thing shall ever know I 
o thou who art so mild and whose patience 
is never equalled! 
o thou whose favours never cease and can 
not be numbered, set me free!" 
So you see what happened.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;}}{{efn|See [[Al-Masudi]], [[The Meadows of Gold|Muruju'l-Dhahab]], vi, p. 308; and [[Ibn Khallikan]], ''Deaths of Eminent Men'', trans. de Slane}}&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

===Final imprisonment===
Al-Fakhri states the reason for his final imprisonment was that "there were some of the relatives of Musa ibn Ja'far who were envious of him and carried false reports about him to al-Rashid, saying, 'The people are paying him the [[Khums]], or one-fifth of their property, on accepting the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamah]], and he is about to come forth against you.' They brought this report to al-Rashid so frequently that it made him anxious and agitated. In that year al-Rashid went on the pilgrimage, and when he arrived in Medina, he arrested Musa ibn Ja'far, and brought him to Baghdad in a litter, and imprisoned him under the care of al-Sindi ibn Sha'hik."{{efn|See Al-Fakhri (Ibnu'l-Tiktil'ni), in the Adab al-Sultaniyya, Chrestomathie Arabe, Silvestre de Sacy, i, text, p. 7, and translation, p. 6.}}&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;
 
Al-Fakhri adds "Al-Rashid was at [[Rakka Eyalet|Rakka]] when he sent orders that the Imam should be put to death. They then brought a number of reputable men to [[Karkh]] to act as coroners and to testify publicly that he had died a natural death. He, then, was buried in the cemetery of Quraish on the south side of Baghdad." The implication made by the Shi'a is that he was poisoned. The place he was buried was a cemetery, but soon this place became the focus of pilgrimage to the grave of the Imam. A town grew around the graveyard. The name of the town became [[Kadhimiya]] (the town of the Imam Kadhim). A reputed school of theology was founded in this town; the school is still a source of learning for many students from all over the world.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

Man's reason is not perfect unless it has various qualities: unbelief and evil from him are safe. Reason and good from him are hoped. The surplus of his money is spent. The surplus of his speech is prevented. His share of the world is only daily bread. ... Abasement along with Allah is more beloved to him than exaltedness along with other than Him. Humbleness is more beloved to him than high rank. He regards as much the little good from other than him and as little his own good.

For off-the-field marketing activities, Suh signed with The Agency Sports Management &amp; Marketing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theagencysports.com The Agency Sports Management &amp; Marketing]. Theagencysports.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt; where Russ Spielman served as lead agent. At the [[NFL Combine]], Suh bench pressed 225&amp;nbsp;lbs 32 times and had a 35½ inch vertical leap, the highest for a defensive tackle since [[Al Lucas (American football)|Al Lucas]] (36&amp;nbsp;in) in 2000.

Before the NFL draft, Suh signed with Maximum Sports Management and agent Roosevelt Barnes. This caused moderate concern for many teams who were hoping to draft him, as this was the same agent who represented [[Michael Crabtree]]. Crabtree was the longest [[2009 NFL Draft]] first round contract hold out, waiting over six weeks into the NFL season before signing with the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Crabtree had even threatened to re-enter the [[2010 NFL Draft]].

Despite the concerns, Suh was selected second overall in the [[2010 NFL Draft]] by the Detroit Lions, becoming the first defensive lineman selected by the team in the first round since [[Luther Elliss]] in [[1995 NFL Draft|1995]]. Suh was the highest selected Cornhusker defender since [[Neil Smith (American football)|Neil Smith]] in [[1988 NFL Draft|1988]].

====2010 season: Rookie year====
On August 3, Suh agreed to a five-year, $68 million contract with the Lions, including $40 million guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-04/detroit-lions-sign-no-2-overall-draft-pick-ndamukong-suh-to-5-year-deal.html Detroit Lions Sign No. 2 Overall Draft Pick Ndamukong Suh to 5-Year Deal] Bloomberg August 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, Suh had his first sack against [[Chicago Bears]] [[quarterback]] [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20100916/OPINION03/9160367/Lions-defensive-line-must-growl-now|title=Lions defensive line must growl now|date=September 16, 2010|last=Wojnowski|first=Bob|work=The Detroit News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, during a game against the [[2010 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], he recorded his only career interception to date off of [[Sam Bradford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/nfl/2010/10/nfl_local_ties_week_5_suhs_pic.html |title=Ndamukong Suh's interception adds to Detroit Lions' 44–6 rout of St. Louis |date=October 12, 2010 |first=Aaron |last=Fentress |work=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suh scored the one [[touchdown]] of his NFL career against the [[Washington Redskins]] on October 31, 2010, on a recovery of a [[Rex Grossman]] [[fumble]].

After an injury to Lions kicker [[Jason Hanson]], the Lions had Suh attempt an [[extra point]] on November 7, 2010, against the [[New York Jets]]. However, Suh missed the extra point when the ball hit the right upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301107008 |title=New York Jets vs. Detroit Lions – Recap |date=November 7, 2010 |work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His rookie year saw the beginning of what would take Suh to a league record amount of fines for on-the-field behavior.&lt;ref name="fine_list_2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2014/12/29/ndamukong-suh-fine-history/21025507/ | publisher=Detroit Free Press | date=December 29, 2014 | accessdate=October 30, 2015 | title=Lions star Ndamukong Suh: A history in discipline | first=Dave | last=Birkett}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fined $7,500 in a preseason game against the [[Cleveland Browns]] for a facemask of [[Jake Delhomme]], fined $5,000 for using an opponent as leverage on a field goal in a week 9 game against the Jets, and fined $15,000 in a week 13 game against the Bears for unnecessary roughness against quarterback Jay Cutler.

====2011 season====
[[File:Ndamukong Suh NFL.JPG|thumb|Suh in 2011.]]

During the third quarter of the Lions' [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] against the [[Green Bay Packers]] on November 24, 2011, Suh pushed Packers' offensive lineman [[Evan Dietrich-Smith]]'s head into the ground three times, then stomped on his arm.  All of this took place after the whistle was blown. Suh was penalized for unnecessary roughness and ejected from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/48903/case-closed-on-ndamukong-suh|title=Case closed on Ndamukong Suh|author=Kevin Seifert|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-24|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting penalty gave the Packers an automatic first down. The Packers would score a touchdown two plays later, giving them a 14–0 lead and an eventual 27–15 victory.

Initially, Suh denied stomping on Dietrich-Smith, saying he was only trying to get his balance back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/34877/verbatim-ndamukong-suh|title=Verbatim: Ndamukong Suh|author=Kevin Seifert|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-26|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on Friday morning, the Lions issued a statement calling Suh's actions "unacceptable".  Within hours, Suh wrote on his Facebook page that he'd "made a mistake" a day before and intended to learn from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7278879/ndamukong-suh-detroit-lions-apologizes-stomp-says-learned-situation Ndamukong Suh apologizes for stomp]. [[ESPN]], 2011-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] NFL [[rules analyst]] and former vice president of officiating [[Mike Pereira]] said that based on his knowledge of league discipline, "the question won’t be if the NFL will suspend Suh, but when—and for how many games".  He drew parallels between Suh's actions and those of [[Albert Haynesworth]], who drew a five-game suspension—the longest suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history—for stomping on [[Andre Gurode]]'s head in 2006.&lt;ref name=Pereira/&gt;

On November 29, the NFL suspended Suh for two games without pay which was $165,294 in lost wages.&lt;ref name="fine_list_2014" /&gt; In announcing the decision, [[Roger Goodell]] noted that it was the fifth time Suh had been disciplined for on-field conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Ndamukong-Suh-Detroit-Lions-NFL-suspension-two-games-for-stomping-incident-112911|title=Lions' Suh appealing 2-game suspension|author=Jay Glazer|authorlink=Jay Glazer|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-29|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suh appealed the decision, and the NFL held an expedited hearing before former [[Oakland Raiders]] coach [[Art Shell]], so that a decision could be handed down before the Lions' next game, on December 4, against the [[New Orleans Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7293935/ndamukong-suh-detroit-lions-suspended-two-games-pay|title=Source: Ndamukong Suh appeals ban|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-29|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The appeal was turned down on December 2, forcing Suh to sit out the game against the Saints and the December 11 game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7307624/detroit-lions-ndamukong-suh-appeal-denied-miss-two-games Ndamukong Suh's appeal denied].

http://www.detroitlions.com/news/lions-insider/article-1/Stafford-Suh-and-Delmas-named-Pro-Bowl-alternates/76971202-e7e6-41e4-9545-75656672329f|work=detroitlions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the 2011 season with 4 sacks, a pass defended, and 26 tackles.

====2012 season====
During a Thanksgiving game on November 22, 2012, Suh was involved in a play in which he kicked [[Houston Texans]] quarterback [[Matt Schaub]] in the groin. The incident resulted in a $30,000 fine from the league, nearly double the mandated fine for a second offense of "striking/kicking/kneeing" an opponent.&lt;ref name=McIntyre&gt;{{cite web|last=McIntyre|first=Brian|title=NFL fines Ndamukong Suh $30,000 for kick to Matt Schaub’s groin|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/nfl-fines-ndamukong-suh-30-000-kick-matt-213759804--nfl.html|date=November 28, 2012|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation the size of the fine was recognition by the league of Suh's history of questionable on-field hits, while others viewed it as a "wishy-washy" and "cop-out" action by the league in issuing a large fine without a suspension.&lt;ref name=McIntyre/&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Ndamukong Suh fined $30K in wishy-washy decision by NFL|url=http://nfl.si.com/2012/11/28/ndamukong-suh-fined-30k-in-wishy-washy-decision-by-nfl/|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=December 30, 2012|date=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] said that "intent is something that’s very difficult for us to ever try to make a judgment on".&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt; Suh denied the kick was intentional, stating his foot inadvertently hit Schaub as he was being dragged to the ground.&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt; Suh finished 2012 with 8 sacks, 2 passes defended, and 25 tackles in 16 games (15 starts).

====2013 season====
In the Lions' Week 1 victory over the [[Minnesota Vikings]], 34–24, Suh low blocked [[John Sullivan (American football)|John Sullivan]] during a [[DeAndre Levy]] "[[Interception returned for touchdown|pick 6]]"; the resulting [[Personal foul (football)|personal foul]] nullified Levy's touchdown. Two days after the game, Suh was fined $100,000 for the hit—which, not counting lost pay for suspensions, is the largest fine ever issued to a player for on-the-field actions. He appealed the fine but the ruling was later upheld by the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ndamukong Suh loses appeal of $100,000 fine|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/12/ndamukong-suh-loses-appeal-of-100000-fine/|work=NBC|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Lions' Week 6 victory over the [[Cleveland Browns]], Suh tackled Browns QB [[Brandon Weeden]] in a questionable manner. Though not called for a penalty during the game, Suh was fined $31,500 by the NFL, but fine was later rescinded.&lt;ref name="fine_rescinded"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/detroit-lions/post/_/id/14299/detroit-lions-catch-massive-break-with-reinstatement-of-ndamukong-suh | title=Detroit Lions catch massive break with Ndamukong Suh's appeal win | accessdate=October 30, 2015 | date=December 30, 2014 | publisher=ESPN | first=Michael | last=Rothstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a Thanksgiving game against the Packers on November 28, 2013, Suh sacked [[Matt Flynn]] in the end zone, forcing a safety for the first time of his career. On November 29, 2013, Suh was fined $7,875 for performing a throat slash gesture during a game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].

====2014 season====
Suh racked up 53 tackles and 8.5 sacks in the 2014 season. In Week 17, against the [[Green Bay Packers]], Suh stepped on quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]]' calf. Suh received a one-game suspension, seemingly barring him from the Wild Card playoff game the following week against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]; but on appeal, arbitrator [[Ted Cottrell]] reversed the suspension, opting instead for another fine worth $70,000. Suh played in the Wild Card matchup against the Cowboys and sacked [[Tony Romo]] twice.

=== Miami Dolphins ===
====2015 season====
On March 11, 2015, the [[Miami Dolphins]] announced that they had signed Suh to a six-year, $114 million contract with $60 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, passing [[Houston Texans]] defensive end [[J. J. Watt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000477761/article/ndamukong-suh-miami-dolphins-strike-mega-deal |title=Ndamukong Suh, Miami Dolphins strike mega deal |work=[[National Football League]] |first=Kevin |last=Patra |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/03/11/ndamukong-suh-miami-dolphins-contract/70149468/ Suh signs with Dolphins, cites money as the reason] ''Detroit Free Press'', March 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=James|title=Ndamukong Suh signs record deal|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12462569/miami-dolphins-make-ndamukong-suh-top-paid-nfl-defensive-player|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a game against the Washington Redskins on September 13, 2015, as Redskins' running back [[Alfred Morris (American football)|Alfred Morris]] was still lying on the ground following a tackle, Suh appeared to knock Morris's helmet off with his leg. The next day, the NFL announced that they would not discipline him, as "Suh's action was not deemed a kick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patra|first1=Kevin|title=Ndamukong Suh won't be punished for Morris incident|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000530418/article/ndamukong-suh-wont-be-punished-for-morris-incident|website=NFL.com|publisher=NFL|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suh started all 16 games in 2015, finishing the season with 61 tackles, six sacks, and five passes defended. He was ranked 40th on the [[NFL Top 100 Players of 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-top100-2016/0ap3000000669661/Top-100-Players-of-2016-No-40-Ndamukong-Suh NFL Top 100 Players of 2016 - No. 40 Ndamukong Suh]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016 season====
In 2016, Suh started all 16 games with 72 tackles, 5 sacks, and 6 passes defended. He was ranked 55th by his peers on the [[NFL Top 100 Players of 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-top100-2017/0ap3000000810430/Top-100-Players-of-2017-No-55-Ndamukong-Suh NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 - No. 55 Ndamukong Suh]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2017 season====
During [[Thursday Night Football]] against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in Week 8, Suh committed two unnecessary roughness penalties, including one moment where he attempted to choke [[Ryan Mallett]] and shove him out of reach. Suh claimed that his choke on Mallett was a self-defense, thinking that Mallett tried to attack him firsthand. The Dolphins were shut out as they lost 40-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch: Dolphins' Ndamukong Suh Grabs Ravens Ryan Mallett's Throat|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/10/26/ndamukong-suh-grabs-ryan-mallett-throat|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nardone|first1=Joseph|title=Dolphins ready to release defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh|url=https://clutchpoints.com/dolphins-ready-release-defensive-lineman-ndamukong-suh/|publisher=Clutch Sports|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2018, Suh was released, to free up a large amount of salary cap, after serving three seasons with the Dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miami Dolphins release Ndamukong Suh, Julius Thomas|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000921289/article/miami-dolphins-cut-ndamukong-suh-julius-thomas|publisher=NFL|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Los Angeles Rams ===
On March 26, 2018, Suh signed a one-year, $14 million contract with the [[Los Angeles Rams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergman|first1=Jeremy|title=Rams signing DT Ndamukong Suh to 1-year, $14M deal|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000923212/article/rams-signing-dt-ndamukong-suh-to-1year-14m-deal|website=NFL.com|date=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style of play===
Suh has been criticized in the media by other players and by the NFL for his aggressive style of play and has been fined a total of $216,875 by the league for four violations in the first four years in his career. In a poll of fellow players conducted by the ''[[Sporting News]]'', Suh was named "the dirtiest player" in the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsportsdetroit.com/11/08/11/Suh-voted-dirtiest-player-by-his-peers/landing_lions.html?blockID=599388&amp;feedID=3862 Suh voted 'dirtiest player' by his peers].

==Personal life==
In 2015, [[Forbes]] estimated Suh's annual income at $38.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forbes Profile |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/ndamukong-suh/ |year=2015 |accessdate=April 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donation and endowment===
On April 17, 2010, at the annual Husker Spring Game, Suh announced a $2.6 million donation to the University of Nebraska. Two million dollars of his gift will go to Nebraska Athletics for its Strength and Conditioning Program, and the remaining $600,000 will create an endowed scholarship for the UNL College of Engineering, from which he graduated in 2009 with a degree in [[construction management]].&lt;ref name="SuhDonation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=204930543|work=huskers.com |title=Ndamukong Suh to Donate $2.6 Million to the University of Nebraska |date=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His gift is the largest single charitable contribution by any former player and occurred before Suh was taken with the second overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft.

{{Fantasy}}
An '''orc''' {{IPAc-en|ɔr|k}}{{cn|date=December 2018}} (also spelled '''ork''') is a fictional humanoid creature that is part of a fantasy [[race (fantasy)|race]] akin to [[goblin]]s. 

While the overall concept of orcs draws on a variety of pre-existing mythology, the main conception of the creatures stems from the fantasy writings of [[J.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;Tolkien]], in particular ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In Tolkien's works, orcs are a brutish, aggressive, repulsive and generally malevolent species, existing in stark contrast with the benevolent [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish race]] and generally serving an evil power. Tolkien's concept of orcs has subsequently been adapted and imported into other works of fantasy fiction as well as role-playing and strategy games (such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', ''[[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer]]'', and ''[[Warcraft]]''), broadening the recognition of the creatures in popular culture.

Earlier references to creatures etymologically or conceptually similar to orcs can be found in Anglo-Saxon sources; including ''[[Beowulf]]'' and 16th-century Italian folk tales, in particular those of [[Giambattista Basile]]. 

==Appearance==
[[File:Savage Orc by farmerownia.jpg|thumb|Savage orc]]
In popular culture (including [[fantasy]] fiction and games), orcs are variously portrayed but tend towards the descriptions originally set down by Tolkien. They are of approximately human shape (with bowed legs and long arms) and of varying size. Orcs are generally ugly and filthy, with prominent fangs and facial features tending toward the grotesque (generally a mixture of the [[ape]]-like and [[pig]]-like). Their skin is typically a shade of green, grey, black, brown, or sometimes red or sandy tan (Tolkien, in contrast, described some as "sallow", some as "black"—not necessarily a reference to skin colour—and one as "black-skinned").{{CN|date=January 2018}}

Orcs are aggressive scavengers and opportunistic carnivores (with a taste for both in-species cannibalism and human flesh). While possessing a low cunning and crude culture of their own, they are generally portrayed as a subject race used as soldiers (or battle fodder) by beings of greater power and intelligence.  There are exceptions, as orcs sometimes have cunning leaders of their own species, such as [[Azog]] from the ''Lord of the Rings'' universe.  Violent by nature, they will fight ferociously if compelled or directed by a guiding will, but tend towards more chaotic behaviour (including cowardice) if left to their own devices. They often use [[wild boar|boars]], [[gray wolf|wolves]], [[warg]]s, and other unusual beasts for battle transport.

==Etymology==
The modern use of the [[English language|English]] term ''orc'' to denote a race of evil, humanoid creatures has its inception with J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien's earliest [[Elvish language|Elvish]] dictionaries include the entry ''Ork (orq-)'' "monster", "ogre", "demon", together with ''orqindi'' and "ogresse". Tolkien sometimes used the plural form ''orqui'' in his early texts.&lt;ref&gt;''Parmavilatkayat'' volume XII: "Qenya Lexicon Qenya Dictionary": 'Ork' ('orq-' monster, ogre, demon. "orqindi" ogresse. [The original reading of the second entry was &gt;'orqinan' ogresse.&lt; Perhaps the intended meaning of the earlier form was 'region of ogres'; cf. 'kalimban', 'Hisinan'. 'The Poetic and Mythologic Words of Eldarissa' gives 'ork' 'ogre, giant' and 'orqin' 'ogress', which may be a feminine form. ...]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien sometimes, particularly in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', used the word ''[[goblin]]'' instead of orc to describe the creatures. He notes that "orc" is "usually translated" as "goblin". In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', "goblin" is also used as an alternative to "orc", particularly in chapters describing events from a hobbit's perspective. Thus, the Uruk-hai of Isengard and the Mordor orc-captain Grishnakh are described as both "orcs" and "goblins" in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Later in his life, Tolkien expressed an intention to change the spelling to ''ork'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|X|p. 414, 422}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the only place where that spelling occurred in his lifetime was in the published version of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', in the poem ''Bombadil Goes Boating'': "I'll call the orks on you: that'll send you running!" In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', published posthumously, "orcs" was retained.

===Old English===
[[Old English]] glossaries record the word ''orc'' corresponding with Latin [[Orcus]] (deity of the Underworld), and synonymous with ''þyrs''/''ðyrs'' "ogre" (cognate to {{lang-on|[[Jötunn|þurs]]}}), as well as "hell devil". The ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'' defines ''ork'' in the very closely related [[Old Dutch]] language as a ''[[wikt:verslinden#Dutch|verslindend]] monster'' ("devouring monster"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=WNT&amp;id=M049874&amp;lemmodern=ork |title=Ork |website=Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal |date=2007 |language=nl |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and points at a possible origin in the Old Dutch ''nork'' "petulant, crabbed, evil person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gtb.inl.nl/iWDB/search?actie=article&amp;wdb=WNT&amp;id=M041453 |title=Nork |website=Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal |date=2007 |language=nl |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{lang-la|Orcus}} is glossed as "{{lang-oe|Orc, þyrs, oððe hel-deofol}}"&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Variant printed redactions: "orcus &amp;nbsp; [orc].. þrys l heldeofol" in First Cleopatra glossary (D 459/31) in {{Harvnb|Pfeifer|1974|p=37n}}&lt;/ref&gt; as given in the first [[Cleopatra Glossaries|Cleopatra Glossary]] (10th century), and on this entry [[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]] wrote, "Orcus was the name for Pluto, the god of the infernal regions, hence we can easily understand the explanation of ''[[hell|hel]]-[[devil|deofol]]''.  ''Orc'', in Anglo-Saxon, like ''[[Jötunn|thyrs]]'', means a spectre, or goblin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|title=A second volume of vocabularies|publisher=privately printed|year=1873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aY1FAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=pa63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pheifer|first=J.

[[File:Beowulf - orcneas.jpg|thumb|"orcneas," as they appear in the ''Beowulf'']]
Probably the lone literary example is from ''[[Beowulf]]'', and its poet found use of the ''orc-'' stem in ''orcneas'', one of the tribes of creatures named alongside [[elf|elves]] and [[Jötunn|ettin]]s (giants) that have been condemned by God:

The compound ''orcneas'' is designated "evil spirits" above, but its accurate meaning is uncertain. [[Frederick Klaeber|Klaeber]] suggested it consisted of ''orc'' &lt; L. ''orcus''  "the underworld" + ''neas'' "corpses" and that the translation "evils spirits" failed to do justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klaeber|1950|p=183}}: Orcneas: "evil spirits" does not bring out all the meaning. Orcneas is compounded of orc (from the Lat. orcus "the underworld" or Hades) and neas "corpses." Necromancy was practised among the ancient German!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Note that Klaeber here takes ''orcus'' to be the world and not the god, as does {{Harvnb|Bosworth|Toller|1898|p=764}}: "orc, es; m. The infernal regions (orcus)", though the latter seems to predicate on synthesizing the compound "Orcþyrs" by altering the reading of the Cleopatra glossaries as given by Wright's Voc. ii. that he sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lexicography has been complicated by the Bosworth-Toller dictionary's conjecture that ''orcneas'' devolved from the form ''*orcen'' possibly meaning  "(?) a sea-monster," possibly related to {{lang-is|orkn (örkn)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosworth|first1=Joseph|last2=Toller|first2=T.

===Early modern use===
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' refers to ''orke'', used in 1656 in a way that is reminiscent of giants and ogres. It is presumed that 'orke'/'ogre' came into English via continental [[Fairy tale|fairy-tale]]s, especially from the 17th-century French writer [[Charles Perrault]], who borrowed most of his stories and developed his "[[ogre]]" from the 16th-century Italian writers [[Giambattista Basile]], [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] (who has been credited with introducing the literary form of the fairy tale) and Basile, who wrote in the [[Neapolitan language|Naples dialect]] and claimed simply to be passing on oral folktales from his region that he had collected. In at least a dozen or more tales, Basile used ''huorco'', ''huerco'' or ''uerco'', the Neapolitan form of ''orco'' [Italian] "giant", "monster", to describe a large, hairy, tusked, mannish beast who could speak, that lived away in a dark forest or garden and that might capture and eat humans, or be indifferent or even benevolent—all depending on the tale.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;See especially Basile's tales ''[[Peruonto]]'' and ''Lo Cuento dell'Uerco''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the Italian term ''orco'' is derived directly from the Latin Orcus, and is correctly translated into English as "ogre". In early Roman mythology, [[Orcus]] was a god of the underworld, and in medieval times, by association with death and the underworld, the term "orcus" also began to see use for other monstrous creatures and incorporated into the medieval bestiary. In particular, the Italian ''orco'' implies an anthropomorphic creature with bestial aspects, often demonic, suggestive of the Anglo-Saxon ogre. Because of this, Italian translations of the terms "orc" or "ork", as found in Beowulf, as well as the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien and Markus Heitz, remain problematic, and are variously rendered—at the discretion of the translator—as ''orco'' (ogre), ''mezz'orco'' (half-ogre) or ''orchetto'' (small ogre).

The first English use of "orke", in 1656 (forty-one years before Perrault published his ''[[Mother Goose]]'' tales), comes from ''Don Zara'', a fairy tale by Samuel Holland. It is a pastiche and a parody of fantastical Spanish romances such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and presumably is populated by beasts and monsters in common to them.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Straparola was translated into Spanish in 1583. Independent of this, there is in Spain to this day the folktale of the "huerco" or "güercu", which is a harbinger of impending death; a shade in the form of the person about to die.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- From under the OED entry "orc":
* '''1605''' &lt;u&gt;J. SYLVESTER&lt;/u&gt; tr. G. de S. Du Bartas ''Deuine Weekes &amp; Wks.'' (II. i. 337) "Insatiate Orque, that euen at one repast, Almost all creatures in the World would waste." [seeming "orca" usage]
* '''1656''' &lt;u&gt;S. HOLLAND&lt;/u&gt; ''Don Zara'' (I. i. 6) "Who at one stroke didst pare away three heads from off the shoulders of an Orke, begotten by an Incubus." [seeming "ogre" usage]
* '''1854''' ''Putnam's Monthly Mag.'' (Oct. 380/1) "The elves and the nickers, the orcs and the giants." [usage unclear]
* '''1865''' &lt;u&gt;[[Charles Kingsley|C. KINGSLEY]]&lt;/u&gt; ''Hereward'' (I. i. 71) "But beyond, things unspeakable—dragons, giants, rocs, orcs, witch-whales ..." [usage unclear] --&gt; 
A monster called ''Orcus'' is mentioned in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]'' (Book II, Canto XII, line xlvii).

The word ultimately comes from Latin ''[[Orcus]]'', the demonic Roman god of death, who should not be confused with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], the god of the underworld, and has transformed by several stages from the meanings "underworld", "hell", "devil", "evil creature" to "ogre". Tolkien and the lexicons he used attributed the origin of the doubtful Old English ''orc'' to "Orcus" and in one of his [[Constructed language|invented languages]], the word for orc also had the form ''orco''.

Words derived from or related to the Italian term ''orco'' exist in other countries: in addition to Italian dialectal ''uerco'', ''huerco'', and ''huorco'' and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''güercu'', there is also [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] ''ork'', "a house gnome" or "a mountain spirit" that acts as a protector of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sphinx-suche.de/lexmonst/ork.htm |title=Ork |website=sphinx-suche.de |date=2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916051451/http://www.sphinx-suche.de/lexmonst/ork.htm |archivedate=16 September 2014 |language=de |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien explicitly denied any intended connection between his orcs and the [[killer whale]] ''Orcinus orca'' and other cetaceans, that are also referred to as orcs.&lt;ref&gt;Preface to {{cite book|last=Tolkien|first=J. R. R.|title=The Hobbit|publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1966 |page=8 |format=snippet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7vyAAAAMAAJ}}: "Orc is the hobbits' form of the name given at that time to these creatures, and it is not connected at all with our orc, ork, applied to sea-animals of dolphin-kind"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"orc: Cetacean of the genus ''Orca''" {{OED|orc}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a borrowing from Latin ''orca'', as used by [[Pliny the Elder]], that refers to some kind of whale, quite likely ''Orcinus orca'' and which also appears in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' during a description of the Great Flood.

==In literature and folklore==
===Tolkien===
[[File:Orque-Terre du Milieu.jpg|thumb|Tolkien's orc]]
{{Main|Orc (Middle-earth)}}

The humanoid, non-maritime race of orcs that exists in [[Middle-earth]] is the invention of J. R. R. Tolkien, albeit one which he stated in a [[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|letter]]&lt;!-- #25 --&gt; was influenced by [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]''. The word is usually capitalised in Tolkien's writing, but not necessarily in other works.

Within Tolkien's invented languages, the Elvish words for orc are derived from a root ''ruk'' referring to fear and horror, from which is derived an expanded form of the root ''uruk''. A noun ''*uruku'' is produced from the extended root. This eventually turns into [[Quenya]] ''urco'', plural ''urqui''. A related word ''*urkō'' produces [[Sindarin]] ''orch'', plural ''yrch''. The Quenya words are said to be less specific in meaning than the Sindarin, meaning 'bogey'. For the specific creatures called ''yrch'' by the Sindar, the Quenya word ''orco'', with plurals ''orcor'' and ''orqui'', was created.

These orcs had similar names in the other languages of [[Middle-earth]]: in Orkish ''uruk'' (restricted to the larger soldier-orcs); in the language of the Drúedain ''gorgûn''; in [[Khuzdul]] ''rukhs'', plural ''rakhâs''; and in the language of Rohan and in the [[Westron|Common Speech]], ''orc''.

====Description====
In Tolkien's writings, Orcs are of human shape, of varying size. They are depicted as ugly and filthy, with a taste for human flesh. They are fanged, bow-legged and long-armed and some have dark skin as if burned. In a private letter, Tolkien describes them as "squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Letters|p. 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are portrayed as miserable, crafty, and vicious beings.

They fight ferociously as long as a guiding "will" (such as [[Morgoth]] or [[Sauron]]) compels or directs them. Tolkien sometimes describes Orcs as mainly being battle fodder.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;See "The Battles of the [[Fords of Isen]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Orcs are used as soldiers by both the greater and lesser villains of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', such as [[Sauron]] and [[Saruman]].

Orcs eat all manner of flesh, including the flesh of Men.  From descriptions and events relating to the Orcs, it seems likely that they indulge in [[cannibalism]]: in Chapter II of ''[[The Two Towers]]'', [[Grishnákh]], an Orc from [[Mordor]], claims that the [[Isengard]] Orcs eat Orc-flesh, but whether that is true, or a canard spoken in malice, is uncertain. What does seem certain is that the Isengard Orcs resented that description.{{fact|date=November 2014}} In that chapter [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] is flung stale bread and an explicitly vague "strip of raw dried flesh... the flesh of he dared not guess what creature" by an Orc after a fight occurred in which the [[Uruk-hai]] killed several Orcs.

====Origins====
Orc origins are first described in ''The Tale of [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]]'' as &lt;!--

******************************************************************************
Spelled "Melko", not "Melkor", in the original quote. Please do not "correct".
******************************************************************************

--&gt;"foul broodlings of [[Morgoth#Character development and history|Melkor]]&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="Melko"&gt;In Tolkien's mythology, the name of the Vala of evil was originally ''Melko''; it was later altered to ''Melkor'', a form that did not appear until the late 1930s.&lt;/ref&gt; who fared abroad doing his evil work". In ''The Fall of Gondolin'' Tolkien wrote that "all that race were bred by Melko of the subterranean heats and slime. Their hearts were of granite and their bodies deformed; foul their faces which smiled not, but their laugh that of the clash of metal, and to nothing were they more fain than to aid in the basest of the purposes of Melko."

In ''The Silmarillion'', Tolkien conceived the Orcs to be [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] who had been enslaved and tortured by [[Morgoth]] and broken and twisted into his evil soldiers. In other versions of their origin, including those from Tolkien's notes, the Orcs are depicted as the parodies or false-creations of Morgoth, animated solely by his evil will or perhaps, by his own diffused essence, and made intentionally to mock or spite [[Eru Ilúvatar]]'s creations—the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] and [[Edain]].

See '''[[Orc (Middle-earth)#The origin of Orcs|The origin of Orcs]]''' for a full list of possible Orc origins proposed by Tolkien.

====Language of the orcs====
{{main|Black Speech}}

In [[The Lord of the Rings]], the orcs spoke [[Black Speech]], the language of [[Mordor]].  In ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', [[Gandalf]] recites a poem about the [[Rings of Power]] which includes the lines {{-"}}''One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them''{{-"}} for Frodo at Bag End. Later, in the protection of the elven stronghold of Rivendell, [[Gandalf]] himself feels safe enough to recite these lines in the original language, Black Speech: {{-"}}''Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatûl''{{-"}}.

Some of these words contain similar pieces, such as ''atul'', and ''úk'', that are repeated, in Durbatulúk and Tharakutulúk. From this it can be shown that ''úk'' at some point in a word means "all" and ''atul'' means "them". The language contains many [[compound word]]s.

====Influence of Old English====


Tolkien referred to the [[Old English]] origins of the word "orc", observing that "the word is, as far as I am concerned, actually derived from Old English ''orc'' 'demon', but only because of its phonetic suitability"&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Letters|#144}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "I originally took the word from Old English ''orc'' (''[[Beowulf]]'' 112 ''orc-neas'' and the gloss ''orc'' = ''þyrs'' ('ogre'), ''heldeofol'' ('hell-devil')). This is supposed not to be connected with [[modern English]] ''orc'', ''ork'', a name applied to various sea-beasts of the dolphin order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolkien.ro/text/JRR%20Tolkien%20-%20Guide%20to%20the%20Names%20in%20The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings.pdf |first=J. R. R |last=Tolkien |title=Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings |website=tolkien.ro |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien also observed a connection with the [[Latin]] word ''[[orcus]]'', noting that "the word used in translation of [[Quenya|Q]] ''urko'', [[Sindarin|S]] ''orch'' is Orc. But that is because of the similarity of the ancient English word ''orc'', 'evil spirit or bogey', to the Elvish words. There is possibly no connection between them. The English word is now generally supposed to be derived from [[Latin]] ''[[orcus]]'' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|XI|p. 391}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that, "''Orc'' I derived from Anglo-Saxon, a word meaning demon, usually supposed to be derived from the Latin ''Orcus''&amp;nbsp;– hell. But I doubt this, though the matter is too involved to set out here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.clara.net/andywrobertson/wolfemountains.html |first=Gene |last=Wolfe |title=The Best Introduction to the Mountains |year=2001 |website=andywrobertson.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823185012/http://home.clara.net/andywrobertson/wolfemountains.html |archivedate=23 August 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''orcné'', attested in the plural word ''orcnéas'', is a ''[[hapax legomenon]]'' in the poem ''Beowulf''. It is generally supposed to contain an element ''-né'', cognate to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''naus'' and Old Norse ''nár'', both meaning 'corpse'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=J. R. R. Tolkien, scholar and storyteller: Essays in Memoriam |editor-first1=Mary |editor-last1=Salu |editor-first2=Robert T. |editor-last2=Farrell |year=1979 |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=291 |isbn=978-0-80141-038-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual Old English word for corpse is ''líc'', but ''-né'' appears in ''nebbed'' 'corpse bed',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |title=Moot passages in Beowulf |first=Patricia Kathleen |last=Brehaut |year=1961 |publisher=Stanford University |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''dryhtné'' 'dead body of a warrior', where ''dryht'' is the name of a military unit that can be vaguely translated as 'band' or 'host'. In, If ''*orcné'' is to be glossed as ''orcus'' 'corpse',  the meaning may be "corpse from Orcus (i.e. the underworld)", or "devil-corpse", understood as some sort of walking dead creature. This etymology is plausible, but it remains conjectural. ''Orc'' appears in two other locations in the poem ''Beowulf'', but refers to cups of [[precious metal]] found in a treasure-hoard.

The Old English word ''þyrs'', given as a gloss for Latin ''orcus'', is [[cognate]] to [[Old Norse]] ''þurs'' '[[Giant (mythology)|giant]]', '[[ogre]]', both originating from the unattested [[Proto-Germanic language|Common Germanic]] term ''[[thurisaz]]'', which in [[Norse mythology]] refers to one of the monstrous descendants of the giant [[Ymir]]. But it is to be noted in connection with Tolkien's reference to a gloss ''orc''=''þyrs'', that while there is an entry in an 11th-century English glossary which implies such an equivalence, [Latin] ''orcus'' [Old English] ''orc þyrs oððe heldeofol'', this is in fact a [[conflation]] of two glosses in an earlier glossary of the 7th century, found in two different places: [Latin] ''orcus'' [Old English] ''orc'' and [Latin] ''orcus'' [Old English] ''þyrs oððe heldiubol''". The first of these two glosses is in a section devoted to household implements and 'orcus' is, in that place, a corruption of Latin ''urceus'' 'jug', 'pitcher', or of ''orca'' 'pot', 'jar'. The word 'orc' in the first gloss has the meaning 'cup': it is descended from an early Germanic borrowing from ''urceus'', related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''aurkeis'' 'cup', both related to Modern English ''ark'' 'vessel', 'container'.  In the second gloss, the Latin ''orcus'' is equated to Old English 'giant', 'hell-devil', but not to any already-existing Old English word 'orc', as Tolkien mistakenly thought.{{CN|date=October 2018}}

===Blake===
{{main|Orc (Blake)}}
Orc is a proper name for one of the characters in the [[William Blake's mythology|complex mythology]] of [[William Blake]]. Unlike the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Tolkien's humanoid monster]], his Orc is a positive figure, the embodiment of rebellion, and stands opposed to [[Urizen]], the embodiment of [[tradition]].

In Blake's illuminated book ''[[America a Prophecy]]'', Orc is described by his mythic opponent, "Albion's Angel" as the "Lover of Wild Rebellion, and transgressor of God's Law". He symbolizes the spirit of rebellion and freedom, which provoked the [[French Revolution]].

===Nicholls===
{{main|Orcs: First Blood}}
In contemporary literature, a series of books written by [[Stan Nicholls]] focuses on the conflicts between a group of orcs and humans, but through the unconventional view of the orcs. The trilogy, first printed in the United Kingdom by Victor Gollancz Ltd, has become an international bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/n/stan-nicholls/|title=Stan Nicholls |website=Fantasticfiction.co.uk|accessdate=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few series where orcs are featured as the main characters.

===Pratchett===
In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series, Orcs are a race that is close to extinction. They were originally bred (or made) from men and not goblins, as was commonly believed, in order to be used as weapons in a Great War, 'encouraged' by whips and beatings.

To date only one living Orc, called Nutt, has been shown as a primary character, although it has been indicated that there are others that exist in the wilds of far [[Uberwald]].  The brutal reputation and legends of Orcs reflects the traditional fantasy concept of soulless killers. Nutt was originally kept ignorant of his species, and believed as others suggested, that he was simply an unusually tall goblin. He is depicted as being a sensitive and intelligent creature, and by extension members of his species are portrayed as the victims of victors' propaganda.

===Heitz===
Orcs play an important role in [[Markus Heitz]]' Dwarves quartet, ''The Dwarves'', ''The War of the Dwarves,'' ''Revenge of the Dwarves'' and ''The Fate of the Dwarves'', collectively known as the ''Dwarves saga''.

===Mythology===
{{see also|Ork (folklore)|Bauk (mythology)}}
The ork is a [[demon]] of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] [[alpine folklore]]. As a [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]], the ork was a well-behaved [[kobold]]/[[house spirit]] in [[wine cellar]]s. He may be connected to the figure Orkise in the medieval poem ''Virginal'', about [[Dietrich von Bern]]'s battle with a vaguely similar being.

==Other fantasy works==
Since the publication of Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'', orcs have become a fixture of [[fantasy]] fiction and [[role-playing game]]s, where the orcs and goblins are usually considered to be distinct races of [[goblinoid]]s. They were once often depicted with pig-like faces, although they were never described as such by Tolkien. In the 1980s, another orc archetype was introduced by the table-top miniature [[Wargaming|war games]] ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battle]]'', a heavily muscled, green-skinned barbarian with exaggerated tusks, brow, and lower jaw, whose personality is not so much evil as crudely thuggish, often to a comical degree. This style of orc has since become popular in a vast number of fantasy settings and games, including a signature of the ''[[Warcraft]]'' series of computer games and spin-offs.

===''Warhammer''===
{{Main|Orc (Warhammer)|Ork (Warhammer 40,000)}}
[[File:For the love of waaagh by grundalug.jpg|thumb|''For the Love of Waaagh'', an [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)|Ork from ''Warhammer 40,000'']].]]
[[Games Workshop]]'s ''Warhammer Fantasy'' and ''Warhammer 40,000'' games feature Orcs ('Orks' in ''Warhammer 40,000''). The latter setting is unique for featuring Orks in a [[science fiction]] environment that are capable of building crude, but functional vehicles, firearms and even spaceships. Anatomically, Warhammer Orcs are no taller than humans, unless when they are standing upright instead of slouching, but are substantially broader, with ape-like short legs and long arms. They have massive heads that come directly forward on their necks, giving them a stooping appearance. They have tough thick green skin that is highly resistant to pain. Warhammer Orcs lack intelligence, but can be cunning at times. They are warlike and their society is geared towards constant warfare. Their constant need to fight is an expression of Orc culture: Orcs do not form alliances except for temporary alliances with each other. In combat they can transform even the most common object into a lethal killing instrument. Orcs tend to ally with Goblins, who are called [[Gretchin]] in ''Warhammer 40,000'', and [[Snotlings]], but when allied, the Orcs act as bullies towards their smaller Goblinoid ([[Orkoid]] in ''Warhammer 40,000'') cousins, using them as servants, [[Human shield|Human (Goblin) shields]], or an emergency food source. They worship a pair of gods known as [[Gork and Mork]] (other gods were included in earlier editions of the game, but are no longer included), one of which is described as brutally cunning and the other as cunningly brutal, though the orcs themselves do not seem to know which is which. In ''Warhammer 40,000'', orks develop from a fungus-like beginning. They are spread by spores which are emitted constantly during an ork's lifetime and are all expelled when it dies.

===''Warcraft''===
[[File:Orc grunt by Lucas Salcedo.jpg|thumb|''Orc Grunt'', an Orc from ''[[Warcraft]]''.]]
Orcs are one of the most important races in the ''[[Warcraft]]'' [[computer game]] series. Originally presented as a race of typically savage monsters, more recent Warcraft games have revised their image into that of "savage but noble" warriors and shamans. Orcs originally hailed from the world of [[List of Warcraft locations|Draenor]] until the majority of the clans were tricked into serving a force of world-destroying demons, named the Burning Legion. Under the Legion's influence, the Orcish Horde slaughtered their onetime allies the Draenei and then were mystically transported to [[Warcraft#Azeroth|Azeroth]] to conquer it in the Legion's name. After two devastating wars, the orcs were finally defeated by the Human Alliance and rounded up into [[internment]] camps. They remained there until a young orc who had been raised by humans named Thrall (birth name Go'el), rallied them together and freed the bulk of the Horde from the influence of the demons. Thrall then founded a new Horde on the principles of strength and honor, hoping to reclaim the orcs' noble heritage.

''Warcraft'' orcs are humanoid, but prodigiously muscled, with broad noses and distinctive tusked mouths. There are many tribes of Orc, each one being specialized: Frostwolves serves as cavalry with their dire wolves, while the Shadowmoon clan provides powerful shamans. The Orcs originally had brown skin, but demonic corruption turned it green, and further demonic influence can turn it red. Male Orcs are significantly larger than humans, around {{convert|6.5|ft}} tall when standing straight, however most male Orcs have a hunched back. Females, which first appeared as playable characters in ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', are slightly larger than a human female and while much more slender than their male counterparts, are nonetheless well-muscled. The tusks of female orcs are very small, and are arguably more exaggerated canines than tusks. Orc warriors wear little armor but have horned helmets and carry wielding axes. ''Warcraft'' is one of the few settings in which orcs are not inherently evil and, after significant plot developments in the latest ''Warcraft'' games, can even be heroic. One could consider the orcs to be unfairly treated by humans and not only misunderstood, but vilified. The humans' enmity and prejudice towards the Orcs can be traced back to the first and second invasions and could be partially justified, as it was orcs under the control of the Burning Legion that invaded. Despite the best efforts of reformist orcs (such as Thrall) to usher in an era of peace between humans and orcs, humankind's suspicions towards the orcs are further exacerbated by the bellicose and expansionist attitudes of parts of orc society, such as the Warsong Clan, who encroach upon the ancestral territories of the Night Elves, the allies of the humans. Thrall's orcs have occasionally formed successful alliances with humans.

Their political standpoint in the ''Warcraft'' universe is set as being the leading race of the Horde, an association of races created to promote mutual survival. The [[troll]]s, a similar race in the game, partially live in the same area as the orcs and are also scattered around Azeroth, where most live in the wilderness.

In [[Heroes of the Storm]], [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game, players can control several Orc heroes from ''Warcraft'' universe such as Thrall, Garrosh, Gul'dan, and Rehgar.

===''The Harrow Saga''===
In the fantasy series The Harrow, author Philip Mazza includes a race of orcs  or the ''Gulguthra'' in the ancient tongue. The ''Gulguthra'' are members of the Brood, or ''En' Rauko,'' an evil race of creatures that occupy a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalypse fantasy world]]. Early in ''The Harrow: From Under a Tree'', Mazza describes the race of brood through the eyes of two Balor Guild felines, Lil' Man and Chumsey: " . . . The cats were now able to clearly see the worm brood below as they gathered throughout the city: Cu Sith or Black Dogs, great black beasts, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever lived, with eyes that shined white in darkness; Fachens, hideous muscular creatures, man-like in stature, these were monsters known for their despicable acts and a desire to inflict severe pain and suffering on their enemies; Trolls, dim-witted brutish hulks, ugly with a rubbery moss-green hide and quite evil, they fed on anything they come across; Firbolgs, a deformed race of man, possessing surprising strength with bent legs and arms and hunched backs, they were dark-skinned with long hair kept back and thick black beards, and it was said they were remnants of primitive man; Orcs or the ''Gulguthra'' in the ancient tongue, large creatures slightly stooped in posture, a low jutting forehead and a snout instead of a nose, and coarse hair covering ray-green skin, with eyes a reddish tint and well developed canine teeth and short pointed ears . . ." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Harrow: From Under a Tree|last=Mazza|first=Philip|publisher=Omni Publishers of NY|year=2014|isbn=978-0997710908|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===''Earthdawn'' / ''Shadowrun''===
In the fantasy role-playing games ''[[Earthdawn]]'' and ''[[Shadowrun]]'', orks are neither good nor evil. In ''Earthdawn'' they have their own place among the other name-giving races: humans, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]], elves, [[Obsidiman|obsidimen]], [[T'skrang]], trolls and [[windling]]s.

In ''Shadowrun'', the orks are one subspecies of ''Homo sapiens'' among others living on post-2011 Earth. They emerged during the Unexplained Genetic Expression in 2021, as either young humans transformed into orks, or babies that were born as orks from human parents. They are categorized as ''Homo sapiens robustus'' and are considered to be metahumans, like trolls, elves, and dwarfs. They are able to interbreed with humans and other fellow metahumans. Despite this, their offspring (like the offspring of all inter-racial metahuman matings in Shadowrun) is of the race of only one of their parents. Being an ork is due to the expression of a gene, and thus half-breeds do not exist. They grow much faster than humans, reach maturity at 12, and give birth to a litter of about four children, though six to eight are not uncommon. Their average life-expectancy is about 35 to 40 years. They are physically larger and stronger than humans and their mental capacities are considered slightly inferior, though they are still not as dull as the average troll.

===''Magic: The Gathering''===
In the [[collectible card game]] ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', Orcs were originally portrayed as cowardly warriors who rely on the smaller, less intelligent Goblins when waging warfare. Very few creatures of the Orc type have been printed: most of them appeared in the ''[[Fallen Empires (Magic: The Gathering)|Fallen Empires]]'' and ''[[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)|Ice Age]]'' expansion sets. While Orcs were reprinted in more recent core sets, they never appeared in any subsequent expansion sets until ''[[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)#Coldsnap|Coldsnap]]'', which introduced more Orc cards, along with a legendary Orc Shaman: Sek'kuar, Deathkeeper. In the recent set Khans of Tarkir, 7 new Orc cards have been introduced, including a legendary Orc Warrior: Zurgo Helmsmasher. With this new set, they seem to be changing the portrayal of Orcs from cowardly warriors to extremely formidable warriors that are very powerful, but highly reckless in battle.

===''Might and Magic''===
Within the universe of the ''[[Might and Magic]]'' franchise, orcs are portrayed as orange, green, or brown. In ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', they are associated with the Barbarian faction.

In Ashan, the orcs are orange, extremely muscular humanoids, that were created by wizards (by fusing demon blood with human flesh) to be used as shock troops against a demon invasion. In ''[[Dark Messiah of Might and Magic|Dark Messiah]]'', a player spends a significant amount of time facing members of the Redskull Clan, a group of orcs living on an island that is important to the plot. They are led by a shaman (which is implied by a conversation between two orcs to be a popularly elected position) and make references to worshiping an unnamed fire goddess. In ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic V: Tribes of the East|Tribes of the East]]'', the mainland orcs are modelled after the [[Mongols]], are led by a [[Khan (title)|khan]] and worship a personified [[Tengri|Father Sky]].

===''Heroscape''===
{{Main|Heroscape}}
In Hasbro's ''Heroscape'' line of game products, Orcs come from the pre-historic planet Grut and are thus known as Grut Orcs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/games/kid-games/heroscape/default.cfm?page=Inside/CharacterDetail&amp;char_id=2&amp;set_id=3&amp;set_type=2 |title=Blade Gruts |website=Hasbro.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614145310/http://www.hasbro.com/games/kid-games/heroscape/default.cfm?page=Inside%2FCharacterDetail&amp;char_id=2&amp;set_id=3&amp;set_type=2 |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are blue-skinned, with prominent tusks or horns protruding from their chins or cheeks.

===''Elder Scrolls''===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
In [[Tamriel]], orcs are humanoids distantly related to their contemporary elves and are noted for their unshakable courage in battle, and barbaric history. Although now integrated into Imperial culture, Orcs still retain their barbaric nature, with many citizens of Tamriel reluctant to accept them as true members of society.  They have large under-teeth that protrude from the bottom jaw out from their mouths. One of the taller races of the ''Elder Scrolls'' series, they are, contrary to other renditions, not muscle-bound and war-like, but are still significantly bulkier than most other races. They are distinguishable by their green skin. The orcs, or Orsimer (meaning 'the Pariah Folk' in the elven language), are a strain of descendants of the original elven race. The Orsimer were followers of the god Trinimac, but transformed from gold-skinned elves to green-skinned orcs when Trinimac was transformed into the Daedric Prince Malacath by Boethiah, the Daedric Prince of deceit and treachery. The Orcs now worship Malacath as their chief god. Originally a society of marauders prone to pillaging human settlements in the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell, the orcs suffered a series of crushing defeats from the humans throughout the centuries; eventually, relations between orcs and humans improved considerably and the orcs have become respected members of the Empire's society (they get along with humans better than Tamriel's elves do, as the elves are susceptible to attempts at conquering the humans). However, most citizens of Tamriel are reluctant to accept Orcs into society, due to their barbaric history. Another unique quality about the Orcs in the ''Elder Scrolls'' is that they are talented smiths and excellent rank-and-file soldiers, traits that are generally attributed to dwarves. It is said that Orc troops in heavy armor are among the fiercest warriors in Tamriel, and they are known for their Berserker Rage. Though a constant in the ''Elder Scrolls'' series is the cultural assimilation of various fantasy races into whichever area they happen to live, there also exist isolated strongholds of Orcs dedicated to preserving the 'old ways' of their cultural heritage.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to futures studies:

'''[[Futures studies]]''' (also called '''futurology''') &amp;ndash; study of postulating possible, probable, and preferable [[future]]s and the worldviews and myths that underlie them. There is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or science. In general, it can be considered as a branch of the [[social science]]s and parallel to the field of [[history]]. History studies the past, futures studies considers the future. Futures studies (colloquially called "'''futures'''" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to determine the likelihood of future events and trends.

{{Paleontology}}
The [[Yixian Formation]] ({{zh|s=义县组|t=義縣組|p=Yìxiàn zǔ}}) is a [[geological formation]] in [[Jinzhou]], [[Liaoning]], [[People's Republic of China]], that spans about 5 million years during the [[early Cretaceous]] period (early [[Aptian]] stage). It is known for its [[fossil]]s, listed below.

The Yixian Formation is divided into the following subunits: (ages from Chang et al., 2009&lt;ref name="age2009yixian"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = S.

==Military==
Armstrong enlisted in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] on May 4, 1916. He was appointed lieutenant in the 65th Battery of the [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery|Canadian Field Artillery]]. He was later transferred to the 14th Brigade.&lt;ref name=McGill&gt;{{cite book|title=McGill Honor Roll: 1914&amp;ndash;1918|page=102|url=http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/exhibits/mcgillremembers/Binder1.pdf|accessdate=January 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128115439/http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/exhibits/mcgillremembers/Binder1.pdf|archivedate=January 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]], Armstrong served as an engineer.

In 1918 he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] at a ceremony in [[Buckingham Palace]] for distinguished action under enemy fire.&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt;

==Town manager and consulting==
In 1919, Armstrong became the first Town Manager of [[Woodstock, New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Personal Mentions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LQ9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq|work=Good Roads|date=August 13, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 he married Muriel Smith of Woodstock. They would have two children.&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt; That same year he went to work for the Citizens Research Institute of Canada, where he was employed as a consultant for public and industrial groups, including hospitals.

==Kingston General Hospital==
In 1924, Kingston General Hospital suffered from a number of personnel and management problems. Based on the recommendation of Dr. Horace Brittain, the hospital's Board of Governors decided to appoint someone with an administrative background rather than a medical one to run the hospital. Brittain also recommended that Armstrong be interviewed for the position. In March 1925, Armstrong was appointed Superintendent of Kingston General Hospital.&lt;ref name=Archeion /&gt;

Armstrong was able to balanced the hospital's budget while maintaining and adding new services. He led the hospital through the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]. Due to decreasing patient incomes during the Depression, Armstrong developed the Community Cooperative Group Hospital Plan, Ontario's first public health insurance plan.&lt;ref name=Archeion /&gt;&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt; To help offset the reduction of rates caused by the Depression, In 1932, Armstrong and the entire hospital staff donated five percent of the salaries to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Lyndon|title=1932: Entire KGH Staff Donates Part of Salaries to Hospital Fund|work=The Whig-Standard|date=January 14, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he introduced a ten-year plan to expand the hospital. The expansion included the construction of the Victory Wing, which included the first cancer clinic in Ontario, a dietary wing, the Walter T. Connell Wing, and a children’s hospital. Armstrong retired from KGH in 1957, but stayed on as a consultant until the construction projects were completed.&lt;ref name=Archeion /&gt;

While at KGH, Armstrong was president of the [[Ontario Hospital Association]] and the Canadian Hospital Association, as well as was a fellow of the American College of Hospital Administrators.&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt;

==Later life and death==
After his retirement, Armstrong became a member of the Board of Governors of Kingston General Hospital. In 1976 KHG's outpatient building, the Fraser Armstrong Patient Centre, was named in his honor.&lt;ref name=Archeion /&gt; He also worked as a representative of the [[Montreal Trust Company]].&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt;

In September 1983, Armstrong moved into a retirement home in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. He died on October 11, 1983 from burns he suffered in a fire at the retirement home. He was 94 years old.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Fraser Armstrong: Fire Victim Was Former Hospital Executive|work=The Whig-Standard|date=October 14, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coroner Announces Inquest in Death of Fraser Armstrong|work=The Whig-Standard|date=November 14, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard James Evans''' (11 October 1914 – 29 May 1943) was a [[South Africa]]n [[cricketer]] who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[Border cricket team|Border]] from 1934 to 1940. 

Richard Evans was a leg-spin and googly bowler who had a very high career strike-rate: a wicket every 31.48 deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/13/13392/13392.html| title = Richard Evans| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an outstanding season in 1937-38 when he was 23. In the first match, against [[Western Province cricket team|Western Province]], he took 5 for 72 and 4 for 92, and Border won by seven wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16469.html | title = Western Province v Border 1937-38| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in Border’s innings victory over [[Eastern Province cricket team|Eastern Province]] he took 4 for 50 and 6 for 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16476.html | title = Eastern Province v Border 1937-38| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the victory over [[Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]], he took 5 for 27 and 2 for 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16513.html| title = Border v Orange Free State 1937-38| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a week after that, in the loss to [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal]], he took 2 for 29 and 8 for 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16515.html| title = Border v Transvaal 1937-38| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the season with 36 wickets in five matches off 867 balls at a bowling average of 13.11 and a strike-rate of a wicket every 24.08 balls. Only [[Norman Gordon]] of Transvaal, with 39 wickets off 1798 balls, took more wickets in the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/2/Currie_Cup_1937-38/Bowling_by_Average.html | title = Bowling by average, Currie Cup 1937-38| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate =16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, Evans's considerable promise was unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Duffus]], "The Past South African Season", ''[[The Cricketer]]'', 30 April 1938, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He played only two more first-class matches before the [[Second World War]], in which he died at sea off [[Cape Town]], aged 28.

'''Rosamond Pinchot''' (October 26, 1904 &amp;ndash; January 24, 1938) was an American [[socialite]], stage and film [[actress]].

==Early life and career==
Born in [[New York City]], Pinchot was the daughter of [[Amos Pinchot]], a wealthy lawyer and a key figure in the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] and Gertrude Minturn Pinchot, the daughter of shipping magnate [[Robert Bowne Minturn, Jr.]]. She had a younger brother, Gifford (nicknamed Long Giff). Her uncle was Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]] and her cousin was [[Edie Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gaston|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE WEDDINGS OF A DAY; Marriage of Miss Gertrude Minturn to Mr. Pinchot.

She graduated from [[Miss Chapin's School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/miss-chapins-school-nyc/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her parents divorced in 1918. After the divorce, Pinchot and her brother lived with their mother in her townhouse in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gaston|2009|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, Amos Pinchot married magazine writer [[Ruth Pickering Pinchot|Ruth Pickering]] with whom he would have two more children: [[Mary Pinchot Meyer|Mary Eno]] and Antoinette "Tony" Pinchot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=enxRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BmgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3869,464003&amp;dq=amos+pinchot+divorce&amp;hl=en|title=Amos Pinchot Married To Magazine Writer|date=August 10, 1919|work=The Gazette Times|page=3|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/2011/11/14/gIQAazbbMN_story.html|title=Antoinette Pinchot Bradlee, former wife of prominent Washington Post executive editor Benjamin C.

==Career==
At the age of nineteen, Pinchot was discovered by [[Max Reinhardt]] while traveling on an ocean liner with her mother. Reinhardt cast her as a nun who runs away from a convent in the Broadway production of [[Karl Vollmoller]]'s ''[[The Miracle (play)|The Miracle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gaston|2009|pp=7, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinchot's appearance in the play caused a sensation and led to her receiving considerable attention from the press who named her "the loveliest woman in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burleigh|first=Nina |title=A Very Private Woman: The Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer|year=2009|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=0-307-57417-2|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/05/AR2008060503611.html|title=A Complicated Pedigree|last=See|first=Carolyn|date=June 6, 2008|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt later cast her in productions of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and [[Franz Werfel]]'s ''[[The Eternal Road (opera)|The Eternal Road]]''. She made her only film appearance in the 1935 adaptation of ''[[The Three Musketeers (1935 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'', as Queen Anne.

==Personal life==
Pinchot married William "Big Bill" Gaston (who was previously married to [[Kay Francis]]), on January 26, 1928. The couple had two children, William Alexander Gaston and James Pinchot Gaston.&lt;ref name=kayfrancis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kear|first1=Lynn |last2=Rossman|first2=John |title=Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-2366-8|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gaston|2009|pp=43, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Pinchot and Gaston separated.

'''Dame Sidney Jane Browne''', [[Order of the British Empire|GBE]], [[Royal Red Cross|RRC]] (5 January 1850 – 13 August 1941) was the first appointed Matron-in-Chief of the newly formed [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]]. After she retired from the QAIMNS she was appointed as Matron-in-Chief of the [[Territorial Force Nursing Service]]. Browne was appointed [[Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire]] (GBE) in 1918.

In 1922 she became the first President of the [[Royal College of Nursing]] a post she held till 1925&lt;ref name=BJN86&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rcnarchive.rcn.org.uk/data/VOLUME086-1938/page020-volume60-12thjanuarymay1918.pdf|title=Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service - New Matron-in-Chief|journal=The British Journal of Nursing|volume=60|pages=20|date=12 January 1918|accessdate=2009-06-21}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Browne told her nurses, 'Put a high ideal before you, and do your future service in a greater strength than your own, and your life will be for the betterment of the world.' &lt;ref name=RCNwebsite&gt; {{cite web | title=RCN Presidents Exhibition =| url =https://www.rcn.org.uk/centenary/projects/presidents-exhibition|accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Browne lived in Cheltenham with her friend Hilda Hoole from 1927.  Browne died on 13 August 1941, with her funeral taking place at St Stephen’s Church Cheltenham.

In December 2017 a [[blue plaque]] was unveiled at her former home, 11 Tivoli Road, by the [[Cheltenham Civic Society]] and the [[Royal College of Nursing]]. &lt;ref name=GloucestershireLive&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/cheltenham-nursing-pioneer-dame-sidney-898368 |title=Cheltenham nursing pioneer Dame Sidney Brown to get blue plaque |publisher=Gloucestershirelive|date=9 December 2017|accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Sidney Browne was born in [[Bexley]].&lt;ref name="Susan McGann"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49193|title=Browne, Dame Sidney Jane (1850–1941)|last=McGann|first=Susan|date=2004|website=www.oxforddnb.com|publisher=Oxford University Press|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in a medical family, with a surgeon father and two brothers who were doctors.

== Nursing Career ==
Browne attended a series of lectures given by the pioneering district nurse [[Florence Lees]] which prompted her interest in nursing as a career. 

In 1878 she briefly started nursing at the Guest Hospital, [[Dudley]] and later that year entered training at the District Hospital [[West Bromwich]] 1878-1882.  In 1882 Browne worked as Staff Nurse at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] for a year, where she was influenced by the matron, Ethel Manson (later Mrs [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]]).  Browne was one of the first nurses registered with the [[British Nurses' Association]] on 7 March 1890, the precursor of the [[State Register of Nurses]]. &lt;ref name= KCLNurses&gt;{{Cite web |title =  Browne, Sidney Jane | url =  http://www.kingscollections.org/nurses/a-c/browne-sidney-jane | accessdate = 19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 Browne joined the [[Army Nursing Service]], where she was posted to the [[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]], [[Netley]]
and in 1884 had her first overseas posting during the [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|Egyptian War]]. For her work in the [[Sudan War]]s she received the Khedive's Star and the Egyptian medal and bar (1885). Browne's postings took her to [[Malta]] (1887-1890), [[Ireland]] ([[Curragh Camp]]), [[Woolwich]] ([[Herbert Hospital]]) and [[Aldershot]], rising steadily through the ranks. &lt;ref name=KCLNurses/&gt;

Browne was posted to active service in the [[South African War]] from October 1899 where over the next three years she was superintending sister at three different base hospitals, for which she received the [[Royal Red Cross]].  Significant reforms of medical services led to the establishment of an army nursing service.  In 1902 Browne was returned to England for her next post as the first [[Matron-in Chief]] of the newly created [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) - now [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps]] - where she introduced rigorous training procedures.  She retired from the Army in 1906 at age 55, which gave her the time to be an active campaigner for the state registration of nurses. &lt;ref name="Susan McGann"/&gt;

Browne was still concerned about the lack of trained nurses available to the Army and with [[Elisabeth Haldane]] established the [[Territorial Force Nursing Service]], a civilian trained nursing reserve, in 1908, for which she became Matron-in-Chief from 1910. With the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Browne was responsible for the mobilisation of the [[Territorial Force Nursing Service]], and its expansion from 3,000 to 7,000 nurses.  Browne travelled across Britain and abroad inspecting living and working conditions of her nursing staff. &lt;ref name="Susan McGann"/&gt;

In 1916 Browne, who had long supported the nursing state registration bill, agreed that the time was right for a College of Nursing to be established.  Both Browne and [[Sarah Swift]] had worked as [[Matron-in-Chief]] during the [[First World War]], and both became actively involved in what was to become the [[Royal College of Nursing]].    Browne was a member of the first [[Royal College of Nursing]] Council from 1917 until her retirement in 1927 and was the first Honorary Treasurer of the College as well as the inaugural President.  &lt;ref name="Susan McGann"/&gt;

At an investiture on 31 July 1919 Browne was recognised for her work in the [[First World War]] when she was appointed [[Dame Grand Cross]] (military division) of the [[Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (GBE).  She received many honours for her work including an honorary degree in 1925 from [[Leeds University]], the freedom of [[West Bromwich]]; and in July 1927, she was awarded the [[International Florence Nightingale Medal]] by the [[League of Red Cross Societies]].  &lt;ref name="Susan McGann"/&gt;

'''Suicide tourism''', or '''euthanasia tourism''', is the practice of potential suicide candidates travelling to a jurisdiction to commit [[assisted suicide]] or [[suicide]]. In some jurisdictions, assisted suicide is legal.

==Status in various countries==

===Cambodia===
An American expatriate who set up websites offering to help people make arrangements to kill themselves in Cambodia shut the sites down in 2005, saying he hoped to avoid problems with the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-11-04-suicide-tourism_x.htm "Suicide-tourism websites shut down,"] ''USA Today'' (04-11-2005). Retrieved 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Mexico}}
A drug known as liquid [[pentobarbital]] is used by owners to euthanize pets. When given to humans, the drug can give them a painless death in under one hour. The pet shops across Mexico have such drugs. As a result, tourists from across the globe seeking to terminate their own lives were reported to be flying out to Mexico.&lt;ref name="reuters-mx"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN0329945820080603?sp=true|title=Euthanasia tourists snap up pet shop drug in Mexico|last=Emmott|first=Robin |author2=Hernández, Magdiel |author3=Bremer, Catherine |author4=Chiacu, Doina|date=2008-06-03|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-09-25|location=Nuevo Laredo, Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Julie-Anne, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/nitschke-diy-kit-upsets-british/story-e6frg6nf-1225700242552 "Nitschke DIY kit upsets British"], ''[[The Australian]]'', April 20, 2009. They asked Dr. [[Philip Nitschke]] about it. "As revealed in The Australian last month, Exit members are obtaining Nembutal from an online mail order supplier in Mexico. Others travel to Mexico and smuggle the drug home in their luggage. The kits, which will retail for $50, include a syringe that allows users to extract half a millilitre of the solution. 'Clearly, sterility doesn't matter given that death is the desired outcome,' Dr Nitschke said. 'People want reassurance they've not just bought a bottle of water.'"
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationaltaskforce.org/iua49.htm "News briefs from home and abroad"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808220725/http://www.internationaltaskforce.org/iua49.htm |date=2009-08-08 }}, ''The International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide'', Year 2009, Volume 23, Number 3. "Australia's Dr. Death, Dr. Philip Nitschke, has been on the road proffering his latest invention, a do-it-yourself kit to test the quality and potency of the barbiturate Nembutal. ... So Nitschke tells the elderly and not-so-elderly that the drug is both available and cheap in Mexico. But not all Mexican vendors are reputable, so his euthanasia test kit is needed to make sure that people have the real thing and the potency is truly deadly. ..." [The Australian, 4/20/09]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Euthanasia in the Netherlands}}
Critics have claimed that the Dutch initiative for euthanasia will trigger a wave of "euthanasia tourism".{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} However, a clause insisting on a well-established relationship between doctor and patient is designed to prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020506202442/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/4-1-2002-15694.asp Mercy Killing Now Legal in Netherlands ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Switzerland}}

Regulations were proposed to limit possibilities of legal suicide assistance for foreigners in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Leidig &amp; Philip Sherwell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/4191761/Swiss-to-crack-down-on-suicide-tourism.html "Swiss to crack down on suicide tourism,"] ''Telegraph'' (14 March 2004). Retrieved 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The law primarily targeted [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]], one of two right-to-die groups in Switzerland assisting foreigners. The Swiss government rejected proposed stricter regulations in 2006, maintaining the ''status quo''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/2006/05/31/il/newzzENVLG88R-12.html Kein Gesetz gegen Sterbetourismus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720202604/http://www.nzz.ch/2006/05/31/il/newzzENVLG88R-12.html |date=2009-07-20 }} ''Neue Zürcher Zeitung''&lt;/ref&gt; as regulated by Paragraph 115 of Swiss Criminal Code.

Although the assisted suicide market is largely German, as of August 2015, approximately 300 [[UK|British]] citizens had travelled to [[Switzerland]] from the [[UK]] to die at one of Dignitas' rented apartments in [[Zurich]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/15/assisted-dying-britons-dignitas-rises-campaigners-change-law | work=Guardian | title= ‘One person a fortnight’ travels to Dignitas from Britain to end their lives | date=August 15, 2015 | accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of a few of these people are known, though most remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7697315.stm | work=BBC News | title=My brother chose to end his suffering | date=2008-10-29 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2008 the number of British members of Dignitas had risen to 725, a number exceeded only by Swiss and German membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7732640.stm | work=BBC News | title=More Britons seeking suicide help | date=2008-11-17 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the size and population density of [[Europe]], it is certain that there are Dignitas members in other European countries. Right-wing politicians in Switzerland have repeatedly criticized suicide assistance for foreigners, branding it ''suicide tourism'' (''Sterbetourismus'' in German).

In 2007, Dignitas launched an effort to gain legal permission for healthy foreigners, including married couples committed to suicide pacts, to end their lives in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob M. Appel, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/assisted-suicide-for-heal_b_236664.html "Next: Assisted Suicide for Healthy People,"] ''The Huffington Post'' (16 July 2009). Retrieved 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, British conductor [[Sir Edward Downes]] and his wife Joan died together at a suicide clinic outside Zürich "under   circumstances of their own choosing." Sir Edward was not terminally ill, but his wife was diagnosed with rapidly developing cancer.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887|    title=YOUthanasia| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |date=2009-08-02|    publisher=Criminal Brief| accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the PBS [[List of Frontline (PBS) episodes|Frontline]] TV program in the United States showed a documentary called "The Suicide Tourist" which told the story of Professor Craig Ewert, his family, and Dignitas, and their decision to commit assisted suicide in Switzerland after he was diagnosed and suffering with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] (Lou Gehrig's Disease).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/suicidetourist/ "The Suicide Tourist"], PBS Frontline, March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[referendum]] on 15 May 2011, voters in the [[Canton of Zurich]] have overwhelmingly rejected calls to ban assisted suicide or to outlaw the practice for non-residents. Out of more than 278,000 ballots cast, the initiative to ban assisted suicide was rejected by 85% of voters and the initiative to outlaw it for foreigners was turned down by 78%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/8515258/Zurich-votes-to-keep-suicide-tourism-alive.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Zurich votes to keep 'suicide tourism' alive | date=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zurich-voters-keep-suicide-tourism-alive/ "Zurich voters keep "suicide tourism" alive,"] ''CBS News'' (15 May 2011).

In 2009, the British Parliament said it would consider an amendment to a bill that would allow suicide tourism by not charging people with assisting suicide when they take their loved ones to another nation to kill themselves. Britain has a law banning assisted suicide, but it hasn't been enforced in those cases.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Ertelt, [http://www.lifenews.com/bio2802.html "British Parliament to Consider OKing Suicide Tourism, Pro-Life Groups Opposed,"] ''LifeNews.com'' (20 March 2009).

The '''Tamam Shud case''', also known as the '''Mystery of the Somerton Man''', is an [[Cold case (criminology)|unsolved case]] of an unidentified man found dead at 6:30&amp;nbsp;am, 1 December 1948, on [[Somerton Park, South Australia|Somerton]] beach, [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], just south of [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. It is named after the [[Persian language|Persian]] phrase ''tamám shud'', meaning "ended" or "finished", printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the [[Besom pocket|fob pocket]] of the man's trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', authored by 12th-century poet [[Omar Khayyám]]. ''Tamam'' was misspelt as ''Taman'' in many early reports and this error has often been repeated, leading to confusion about the name in the media.{{refn|group="note"|While the words that end ''[[The Rubaiyat]]'' are "Tamám Shud" ({{lang|fa|تمام شد}}), it has often been referred to as "Taman Shud" in the media, because of a spelling error in early newspaper coverage or police reports which has persisted.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In [[Persian language|Persian]], {{lang|fa|[[wikt:تمام#Persian|تمام]]}} ''tamám'' is a noun that means "the end" and {{lang|fa|[[wikt:شد#Persian|شد]]}} ''shud'' is an auxiliary verb indicating past tense, so ''tamam shud'' means "ended" or "finished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Abbott |first1=Derek |title=List of facts on the Taman Shud Case that are often misreported |url=https://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/wiki/index.php/List_of_facts_on_the_Taman_Shud_Case_that_are_often_misreported |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following a public appeal by police, the book from which the page had been torn was located. On the inside back cover, detectives were able to read – in indentations from handwriting – a local telephone number, another unidentified number and a text that resembled an encrypted message. The text has not been deciphered or interpreted in a way that satisfies authorities on the case.

The case has been considered, since the early stages of the police investigation, "one of Australia's most profound mysteries".&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;''The Advertiser'', [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36371416 "Tamam Shud"], 10 June 1949, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; There has been intense speculation ever since regarding the identity of the victim, the cause of his death and the events leading up to it. Public interest in the case remains significant for several reasons: the death occurred at a time of heightened international tensions following the beginning of the [[Cold War]]; the apparent involvement of a secret code; the possible use of an undetectable poison; and the inability of authorities to identify the dead man.

In addition to intense public interest in Australia during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Tamam Shud case also attracted international attention. [[South Australian Police]] consulted their counterparts overseas and distributed information about the dead man internationally, in an effort to identify him.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example; Guðmundsson, H.H. "Þekkir þú þennan mann?" ''Skakki turninn'', 12 October 2009, pp. 19–27.&lt;/ref&gt; International circulation of a photograph of the man and details of his fingerprints yielded no positive identification.&lt;ref name=Clemo/&gt; For example, in the United States, the [[FBI]] was unable to match the dead man's fingerprint with prints taken from files of domestic criminals. [[Scotland Yard]] was also asked to assist with the case, but could not offer any insights.&lt;ref name=Clive/&gt;

In recent years new evidence has emerged, including an old identification card possibly identifying the Somerton Man as one H. C. Reynolds&lt;ref&gt;Emily Watkins: [http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/is-british-seamans-identity-card-clue-to-solving-63-year-old-beach-body-mystery/news-story/b0f696e3e2a3d82a88cb5d1788f17f25 Is British seaman's identity card clue to solving 63-year-old beach body mystery?], 19 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and an ongoing DNA analysis of hair roots found on the plaster bust.&lt;ref&gt; Jessica Bineth: "[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-14/somerton-man-cold-case-could-be-one-step-closer-to-solved/9245512 Somerton Man: One of Australia's most baffling cold cases could be a step closer to being solved]", ABC News, 2 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of body==
[[File:SomertonManDeathSite.jpg|thumb|Location on [[Somerton Park, South Australia|Somerton]] beach where the corpse was found, marked by an 'X']]

On 1 December 1948 at 6:30&amp;nbsp;am, the police were contacted after the body of a man was discovered on Somerton beach near Glenelg, about 11 kilometres (6.8&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Adelaide, South Australia. The man was found lying in the sand across from the Crippled Children's Home, which was on the corner of The Esplanade and Bickford Terrace.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2011/08/the-body-on-somerton-beach/|title=The Body on Somerton Beach|first=Mike|last=Dash|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=12 August 2011|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was lying back with his head resting against the [[seawall]], with his legs extended and his feet crossed. It was believed he had died while sleeping.&lt;ref name=News/&gt; An unlit cigarette was on the right collar of his coat.&lt;ref name=Orr/&gt; A search of his pockets revealed an unused second-class rail ticket from Adelaide to [[Henley Beach, South Australia|Henley Beach]], a bus ticket from the city that could not be proved to have been used, a narrow aluminium American comb, a half-empty packet of [[Juicy Fruit]] chewing gum, an [[Army Club (cigarette)|Army Club]] cigarette packet containing seven cigarettes of a different brand, and a quarter-full box of [[Bryant and May|Bryant &amp; May matches]].&lt;ref name="Bus1"/&gt;

Witnesses who came forward said that on the evening of 30 November, they had seen an individual resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found.&lt;ref name=Orr/&gt;&lt;ref name="Top Ten Lists"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Secrets Taken to the Grave|url=http://www.mixtopten.com/top-10-secrets-taken-to-the-grave/|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple who saw him at around 7&amp;nbsp;pm noted that they saw him extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 8&amp;nbsp;pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man from the top of the steps that lead to the beach.&lt;ref name=Clemo&gt;Clemo, M. "[http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/tamanshud/sunday_mail_nov2004.pdf 'Poisoned' in SA – was he a Red Spy?]", ''Sunday Mail'' (Adelaide), 7 November 2004, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|p=9}} Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|p=2}}

Another witness came forward in 1959 and reported to the police that he and three others had seen a well-dressed man carrying another man on his shoulders along Somerton Beach the night before the body was found. A police report was made by Detective Don O'Doherty.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010}}

According to the pathologist, [[John Burton Cleland]], the man was of "Britisher" appearance and thought to be aged about 40–45; he was in "top physical condition".{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|pp=12–13}} He was "180 centimetres (5&amp;nbsp;ft 11 in) tall, with grey eyes, fair to ginger-coloured hair,&lt;ref name=CIB/&gt; slightly grey around the temples,&lt;ref name=News/&gt; with broad shoulders and a narrow waist, hands and nails that showed no signs of manual labour, big and little toes that met in a wedge shape, like those of a dancer or someone who wore boots with pointed toes; and pronounced high calf muscles consistent with people who regularly wore boots or shoes with high heels or performed ballet.&lt;ref name=Fife&gt;Fife-Yeomans, J. "The Man With No Name", ''The Weekend Australian Magazine'', 15-16 September 2001, p 30&lt;/ref&gt; He was dressed in a white shirt; a red, white and blue tie; brown trousers; socks and shoes; a brown knitted pullover and fashionable grey and brown double-breasted jacket of reportedly "American" tailoring.&lt;ref name=Jory&gt;Jory, R. (2000) "[http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/tamanshud/advertiser_dec2000.pdf The dead man who sparked many tales]", ''The Advertiser'', 1 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; All labels on his clothes had been removed,&lt;ref name=CIB/&gt;&lt;ref name="labelsremoved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2011/06/25/the-somerton-man-the-taman-shud-case/|title=Unsolved Death from 1948: The Somerton Man (The Taman Shud Case)|website=Sometimes Interesting|date=25 June 2011|access-date=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he had no hat (unusual for 1948) or wallet.&lt;ref name=News/&gt; The body was clean-shaven and&lt;ref name=News&gt;''The News'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129897161 Dead Man Found Lying on Somerton Beach]", 1 December 1948, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; carried no identification, which led police to believe he had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;''The News'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130240390 Five 'positive views' conflict]", 7 January 1949, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His teeth did not match the dental records of any known living person.&lt;ref name=BrittenTelegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Britten|first=Nick|title=Top 10 uncracked codes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8293375/Top-10-uncracked-codes.html|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=1 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|quote=There were no clues as to his identity and dental records and fingerprints matched no living person.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coroner Cleland remarked that if the body had been carried to its final resting place then "all the difficulties would disappear".{{sfnp|Feltus|2010}}
An autopsy was conducted, and the pathologist estimated the time of death at around 2 a.m. on 1 December.{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|pp=12–13}} &lt;blockquote&gt;The heart was of normal size, and normal in every way ...small vessels not commonly observed in the brain were easily discernible with congestion. There was congestion of the [[pharynx]], and the [[gullet]] was covered with whitening of superficial layers of the [[mucosa]] with a patch of [[ulceration]] in the middle of it. The stomach was deeply congested... There was congestion in the second half of the [[duodenum]]. There was blood mixed with the food in the stomach. Both kidneys were congested, and the liver contained a great excess of blood in its vessels. ...The spleen was strikingly large ... about 3 times normal size ... there was destruction of the centre of the liver [[lobules]] revealed under the microscope. ... acute [[gastritis]] hemorrhage, extensive congestion of the liver and spleen, and the congestion to the brain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The autopsy showed that the man's last meal was a [[pasty]] eaten three to four hours before death,&lt;ref name=Orr/&gt; but tests failed to reveal any foreign substance in the body. The pathologist Dr. Dwyer concluded: "I am quite convinced the death could not have been natural ... the poison I suggested was a [[barbiturate]] or a soluble [[hypnotic]]". Although poisoning remained a prime suspicion, the pasty was not believed to be the source of the poison.&lt;ref name=Clemo/&gt; Other than that, the coroner was unable to reach a conclusion as to the man's identity, cause of death, or whether the man seen alive at Somerton Beach on the evening of 30 November was the same man, as nobody had seen his face at that time.&lt;ref name=Jory/&gt; The body was then [[Embalming|embalmed]] on 10 December 1948 after the police were unable to get a positive identification. The police said this was the first time they knew that such action was needed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43795238 Somerton Body Embalmed]", 11 December 1948, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of suitcase==
[[File:SomertonManSuitcase.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Suitcase and effects, found at [[Adelaide railway station]]. From left to right are detectives Dave Bartlett, Lionel Leane, and Len Brown]]

On 14 January 1949, staff at the [[Adelaide railway station]] discovered a brown suitcase with its label removed, which had been checked into the station cloakroom after 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 30 November 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43800028 Somerton Mystery Clue]", 15 January 1949, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that the suitcase was owned by the man found on the beach. In the case were a red checked dressing gown; a size-seven, red felt pair of slippers; four pairs of underpants; pyjamas&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: please do not change this spelling.  It is correct for Australia (and most of the world.) --&gt;; shaving items; a light brown pair of trousers with sand in the [[cuff]]s; an electrician's screwdriver; a table knife cut down into a short sharp instrument; a pair of scissors with sharpened points; a small square of zinc thought to have been used as a protective sheath for the knife and scissors and a [[stencil]]ling brush, as used by [[Third mate|third officers]] on merchant ships for stencilling cargo.&lt;ref name=cotton&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43800320 Definite Clue in Somerton Mystery]", 18 January 1949, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the suitcase was a thread card of [[J. Barbour and Sons|Barbour]] brand orange waxed thread of "an unusual type" not available in Australia—it was the same as that used to repair the lining in a pocket of the trousers the dead man was wearing.&lt;ref name=cotton/&gt; All identification marks on the clothes had been removed but police found the name "T. Keane" on a tie, "Keane" on a laundry bag and "Kean" (without the last e) on a [[Vest|singlet]], along with three dry-cleaning marks; 1171/7, 4393/7 and 3053/7.&lt;ref&gt;''The News'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130244472 Marks May Be Clue To Beach Body]", 15 January 1949, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Mail'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55926571 Cotton May Be Clue To Mystery]", 15 January 1949, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Police believed that whoever removed the clothing tags either overlooked these three items or purposely left the "Keane" tags on the clothes, knowing Keane was not the dead man's name.&lt;ref name=cotton/&gt; With wartime rationing still enforced, clothing was difficult to acquire at that time. Although it was a very common practice to use name tags, it was also common when buying secondhand clothing to remove the tags of the previous owner/s. What was unusual was that there were no spare socks found in the case, and no correspondence, despite that the police found pencils and unused letter [[stationery]].

A search concluded that there was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt; and a nationwide circulation of the dry-cleaning marks also proved fruitless. In fact, all that could be garnered from the suitcase was that the front [[gusset]] and [[featherstitch]]ing on a coat found in the case indicated it had been manufactured in the United States. The coat had not been imported, indicating the man had been to the United States or bought the coat from someone of similar size who had been.&lt;ref name="CIB" /&gt;{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|p=23}}

Police checked incoming train records and believed the man had arrived at the [[Adelaide railway station]] by overnight train from either Melbourne,&lt;ref name=Maguire/&gt; Sydney or [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]].&lt;ref name=Clemo/&gt; They speculated he had showered and shaved at the adjacent City Baths (there was no Baths ticket on his body) before returning to the train station to purchase a ticket for the 10:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. train to Henley Beach, which, for whatever reason, he missed or did not catch.&lt;ref name=cotton/&gt; He immediately checked his suitcase at the station cloak room before leaving the station and catching a city bus to Glenelg.&lt;ref&gt;''The News'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130240390 Five 'Positive' Views Conflict]", 7 January 1949, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Although named the City Baths, the centre was not a [[public bathing]] facility but a public swimming pool. The railway station bathing facilities were adjacent to the station cloak room, which itself was adjacent to the station's southern exit onto North Terrace. The City Baths on [[King William Street, Adelaide|King William St.]] were accessed from the station's northern exit via a lane way.&lt;ref name="Bus1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fettes|first=James|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/portrait-may-hold-key-to-somerton-man-beach-mystery/story-fni0ffnk-1226674957043|title=Professor's 15-year search for answers seeks to crack the secret code to the death of the 'Somerton man' found on an Adelaide beach |work=[[Herald Sun]]|date=29 October 2013|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Fettes |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/portrait-may-hold-key-to-somerton-man-beach-mystery/story-fni0ffnk-1226674957043 |title=Professor's 15-year search for answers seeks to crack the secret code to the death of the 'Somerton man' found on an Adelaide beach |publisher=HeraldSun |date=29 October 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of the station's bathroom facilities being unavailable on the day he arrived.

==Inquest==
An inquest into the death, conducted by coroner Thomas Erskine Cleland, commenced a few days after the body was found but was adjourned until 17 June 1949.&lt;ref name="Cleeland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2809097 |title=15 Jun 1949 –  INQUEST TO OPEN ON BODY OF UNKNOWN MAN – ADELAIDE |work=[[The Canberra Times]] |via=[[Trove]] |access-date=27 June 2015 |date=15 June 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigating pathologist [[John Burton Cleland]] re-examined the body and made a number of discoveries. Cleland noted that the man's shoes were remarkably clean and appeared to have been recently polished, rather than being in the state expected of the shoes of a man who had apparently been wandering around Glenelg all day.&lt;ref name="Clive" /&gt; He added that this evidence fitted in with the theory that the body might have been brought to Somerton beach after the man's death, accounting for the lack of evidence of vomiting and convulsions, which are the two main effects of poison.&lt;ref name="Clive" /&gt;

Thomas Cleland speculated that as none of the witnesses could positively identify the man they saw the previous night as being the same person discovered the next morning, there remained the possibility the man had died elsewhere and had been dumped. He stressed that this was purely speculation as all the witnesses believed it was "definitely the same person" as the body was in the same place and lying in the same distinctive position. He also found there was no evidence as to who the deceased was.{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|pp=1–3}}

[[Cedric Stanton Hicks]], Professor of [[physiology]] and [[pharmacology]] at the University of Adelaide, testified that of a group of drugs, variants of a drug in that group he called "number 1" and in particular "number 2" were extremely toxic in a relatively small oral dose that would be extremely difficult if not impossible to identify even if it had been suspected in the first instance. He gave the coroner a piece of paper with the names of the two drugs which was entered as Exhibit C.18.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; The names were not released to the public until the 1980s as at the time they were "quite easily procurable by the ordinary individual" from a [[Pharmacy|chemist]] without the need to give a reason for the purchase. (The drugs were later publicly identified as [[digitalis]] and [[ouabain]], both of which are [[cardenolide]]-type [[cardiac glycoside]]s). He noted the only "fact" not found in relation to the body was evidence of vomiting. He then stated its absence was not unknown but that he could not make a "frank conclusion" without it. Hicks stated that if death had occurred seven hours after the man was last seen to move, it would imply a massive dose that could still have been undetectable. It was noted that the movement seen by witnesses at 7 p.m. could have been the last convulsion preceding death.{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|pp=42–44}}

Early in the inquiry, Cleland stated "I would be prepared to find that he died from poison, that the poison was probably a [[glucoside]] and that it was not accidentally administered; but I cannot say whether it was administered by the deceased himself or by some other person."{{sfnp|Cleland|1949|pp=1–3}} Despite these findings, he could not determine the cause of death of the Somerton Man,&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36677396 Possible Clue in Somerton Body Case]", 23 July 1949, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and after the inquest, a plaster cast was made of the man's head and shoulders.&lt;ref name="Cleeland" /&gt; The lack of success in determining the identity and cause of death of the Somerton Man had led authorities to call it an "unparalleled mystery" and believe that the cause of death might never be known.&lt;ref name="Mystery"&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36361680 'Unparalleled Mystery' Of Somerton Body Case]", 11 April 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to the ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''==

[[File:Actual-tamam-shud.jpg|thumb|The scrap of paper, with its distinctive font, found hidden in the dead man's trousers, torn from the last page of a rare New Zealand edition of ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'']]

Around the same time as the inquest, a tiny piece of rolled-up paper with the words "Tamam Shud" printed on it was found in a fob pocket sewn within the dead man's trouser pocket.&lt;ref name=Cryptic&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36371152 Cryptic Note on Body]", 9 June 1949, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Public library officials called in to translate the text identified it as a phrase meaning "ended" or "finished" found on the last page of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''.&lt;ref name=Cryptic/&gt; The paper's [[recto and verso|verso]] side was blank. Police conducted an Australia-wide search to find a copy of the book that had a similarly blank verso. A photograph of the scrap of paper was released to the press.&lt;ref name=Cryptic/&gt;

Following a public appeal by police, the copy of the ''Rubaiyat'' from which the page had been torn was located. A man showed police a 1941 edition of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald's]] (1859) translation of the ''Rubaiyat'', published by [[Whitcoulls|Whitcombe and Tombs]] in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand.{{refn|group="note"|This particular edition of the ''Rubaiyat'' has a different translation compared to most other FitzGerald translations. This, now rare, edition was published in New Zealand in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand Book News |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19411122.2.105.3?end_date=22-11-1941&amp;query=Book+news&amp;start_date=22-11-1941&amp;title=AS |work=Aukland Star |date=22 November 1941 |page=12 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Detective Sergeant]] Lionel Leane, who led the initial investigation, often protected the privacy of witnesses in public statements by using [[pseudonym]]s;{{sfnp|Feltus|2010}} Leane referred to the man who found the book by the pseudonym "Ronald Francis" and he has never been officially identified.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010}} "Francis" had not considered that the book might be connected to the case until he had seen an article in the previous day's newspaper. On the inside back cover of the book, detectives identified indentations from handwriting. These included a telephone number, an unidentified number, and a text that resembled an encrypted message. According to statements by police, the book was found in the rear footwell of a car, at about the same time that the body of the unidentified man had been found.

There is some uncertainty about the circumstances under which the book was found. One newspaper article refers to the book being found about a week or two before the body was found.&lt;ref name=Clue&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36677719 New Clue in Somerton Body Mystery]", 25 July 1949, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Former South Australian Police detective Gerry Feltus (who dealt with the matter as a cold case), reports that the book was found "just after that man was found on the beach at Somerton".{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|p=105}} The timing is significant as the man is presumed, based on the suitcase, to have arrived in Adelaide the day before he was found on the beach. If the book was found one or two weeks before, it suggests that the man had visited previously or had been in Adelaide for a longer period. Most accounts state that the book was found in an unlocked car parked in Jetty Road, [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]] – either in the rear floor well, or on the back seat.{{refn|group=note|However, a bus conductor named Leslie Francis Wytkin (or Wytkins) handed in a copy of the ''Rubaiyat'' to the Metropolitan Tramways Trust, at around the same time; it is not clear whether this was the same copy of the ''Rubaiyat'', or an extraneous find, and/or if Wytkin was "Francis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Possible Clue In Somerton Body Case |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/36677396/2653957 |work=The Advertiser |date=23 July 1949 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:SomertonManCode.jpg|thumb|right|The handwriting found in the back of a book of the [[Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám]]. The text is presumed to be some sort of code.]]

The theme of the ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' is that one should live life to the fullest and have no regrets when it ends. The poem's subject led police to theorise that the man had committed suicide by poison, although there was no other evidence to back the theory.&lt;ref name="Clue" /&gt; The book was missing the words "Tamám Shud" on the last page, which had a blank reverse, and microscopic tests indicated that the piece of paper was from the page torn from the book.&lt;ref name="Micro"&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36677872 Police Test Book For Somerton Body Clue]", 26 July 1949, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Also, In the back of the book were faint indentations representing five lines of text, in capital letters. The second line has been struck out – a fact that is considered significant, due to its similarities to the fourth line and the possibility that it represents an error in encryption.

In the book it is unclear whether the first line begins with an "M" or "W", but it is widely believed to be the letter W, owing to the distinctive difference when compared to the stricken letter M. There appears to be a deleted or underlined line of text that reads "MLIAOI". Although the last character in this line of text looks like an "L", it is fairly clear on closer inspection of the image that this is formed from an 'I' and the extension of the line used to delete or underline that line of text. Also, the other "L" has a curve to the bottom part of the character. There is also an "X" above the last 'O' in the code, and it is not known if this is significant to the code or not. Initially, the letters were thought to be words in a foreign language&lt;ref name=Clue/&gt; before it was realised it was a code. Code experts were called in at the time to decipher the lines but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Army/&gt; In 1978, following a request from ABC-TV journalist [[Stuart Littlemore]], [[Australian Department of Defence|Department of Defence]] cryptographers analysed the handwritten text. The cryptographers reported that it would be impossible to provide "a satisfactory answer": if the text was an encrypted message, its brevity meant that it had "insufficient symbols", from which a clear meaning could be extracted, and the text could be the "meaningless" product of a "disturbed mind".&lt;ref name=InsideStory&gt;''Inside Story'', presented by Stuart Littlemore, ABC TV, screened at 8&amp;nbsp;pm, Thursday, 24 August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unlisted telephone number was also found in the back of the book,&lt;ref name=Micro/&gt; belonging to a nurse named Jessica Ellen "Jo" Thomson (1921–2007) – born Jessie Harkness in the Sydney suburb of [[Marrickville]] – who lived in Moseley St, [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]], about {{convert|400|m|ft}} north of the location where the body was found.&lt;ref name=Canberra&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The Canberra Times | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2815851 | title=No Sydney Clue to Dead Man Found at Somerton, S.A. | date=28 July 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was interviewed by police, Thomson said that she did not know the dead man or why he would have her phone number and choose to visit her suburb on the night of his death. However, she also reported that, at some time in late 1948, an unidentified man had attempted to visit her and asked a next door neighbour about her.&lt;ref name="Army" /&gt; In his book on the case, Gerry Feltus stated that when he interviewed Thomson (2002), he found that she was either being "evasive" or she "just did not wish to talk about it". Feltus believed Thomson knew the Somerton man's identity.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|pp=178–179}} Thomson's daughter Kate, in a television interview (2014) with ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'', also said that she believed her mother knew the dead man.

In 1949, Jessica Thomson requested that police not keep a permanent record of her name or release her details to third parties, as it would be embarrassing and harmful to her reputation to be linked to such a case.&lt;ref name=Army/&gt; The police agreed – a decision that hampered later investigations.&lt;ref name=Clemo/&gt; In news media, books and other discussions of the case, Thomson was frequently referred to by various pseudonyms, including the nickname "Jestyn" and names such as "Teresa Johnson [[née]] Powell". Gerry Feltus (2010) claimed he was given permission by Thomson's family to disclose her names and that of her husband, Prosper Thomson.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|pp=178–179}} Nevertheless, the names Feltus used in his book were pseudonyms.&lt;ref name="60 Min"/&gt; Feltus also stated that her family did not know of her connection with the case, and he agreed not to disclose her identity or anything that might reveal it. Her real name was considered important as the possibility exists that it may be the [[Key (cryptography)|decryption key]] for the purported code.&lt;ref name=debelle/&gt;

When she was shown the plaster cast bust of the dead man by Detective Sergeant Leane, Thomson said she could not identify the person depicted.&lt;ref name=Lewes&gt;Lewes, J. (1978) "[http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/tamanshud/tvtimes_aug1978.pdf 30-Year-Old Death Riddle Probed In New Series]", ''TV Times'', 19–25 August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leane, he described her reaction upon seeing the cast as "completely taken aback, to the point of giving the appearance that she was about to faint".{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|p=178}} In an interview many years later, Paul Lawson – the technician who made the cast and was present when Thomson viewed it – noted that after looking at the bust she immediately looked away and would not look at it again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u571rcZHs-I&amp;feature=related|title=Jessica Thomson's reaction to the dead man's bust|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson also said that while she was working at [[Royal North Shore Hospital]] in Sydney during World War II,&lt;ref name=Army&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36678021 Army Officer Sought to Help Solve Somerton Body Case]", 27 July 1949, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; she had owned a copy of the ''Rubaiyat''. In 1945, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, she had given it to an army lieutenant named Alf Boxall, who was serving at the time in the [[Royal Australian Corps of Transport#Australian Army Transportation Corps (AATnC) and RAE(Tn)|Water Transport Section]] of the [[Royal Australian Engineers]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Boxall was born in London on 16 April 1906, enlisted in the Australian Army on 12 January 1942 and was not discharged until 12 April 1948.{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?serviceId=A&amp;veteranId=192049|title=World War II Nominal Roll, "Boxall, Alfred|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson told police that, after the war ended, she had moved to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] and married. She said that she had received a letter from Boxall and had replied, telling him that she was now married.&lt;ref name=Army/&gt; (Subsequent research suggests that her future husband, Prosper Thomson, was in the process of obtaining a divorce from his first wife in 1949, and that he did not marry Jessica Harkness until mid-1950.{{refn|group="note"|In July 1947, Jessica "Jestyn" Harkness gave birth to her son Robin in Melbourne, at which point she was not married.  Shortly afterwards she moved to Adelaide and was listed in telephone directories under the surname of her future husband, Prosper Thomson. They may or may not have been cohabiting. Accounts of conversations between Jessica Thomson and police suggest she told them that she was "married" or "recently married". There is no evidence that police knew in 1949 that she was not married.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|p=173}} However, the police may have been aware of her domestic arrangements; it was the kind of information that would normally have been of interest to them. After Prosper Thomson's divorce from his first wife had been finalised (in early 1950), Jessica and Prosper Thomson were married in May 1950.}} There is no evidence that Boxall had any contact with Harkness after 1945.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|pp=177–178}}

As a result of their conversations with Thomson, police suspected that Boxall was the dead man. However, in July 1949, he was found in [[Sydney]] and the final page of his copy of the ''Rubaiyat'' (reportedly a 1924 edition published in Sydney) was intact, with the words "Tamam Shud" still in place.&lt;ref name=Lewes/&gt;{{sfnp|Coghlan|2008|p=235}} Boxall was now working in the maintenance section at the [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]] Bus Depot (where he had worked before the war) and was unaware of any link between the dead man and himself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36678225 Ex-Officer Found – And His 'Rubaiyat']", 28 July 1949, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the front of the copy of the ''Rubaiyat'' that was given to Boxall, Jessica Harkness (as she was at the time) had signed herself "JEstyn" {{sic}} and written out verse 70:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before
I swore—but was I sober when I swore?
And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand
My thread-bare Penitence a-pieces tore.&lt;ref name=InsideStory/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spy theories==
There has been persistent speculation that the dead man was a spy, due to the circumstances and historical context of his death. One such theory concerns Alf Boxall, who was reportedly involved in intelligence work during and immediately after World War II. In a 1978 television interview [[Stuart Littlemore]] asks: "Mr Boxall, you had been working, hadn't you, in an intelligence unit, before you met this young woman [Jessica Harkness]. Did you talk to her about that at all?" In reply, Boxall says "no", and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies "not unless somebody else told her." When Littlemore suggests in the interview that there may have been an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?"&lt;ref name="InsideStory" /&gt; Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the [[2/1st North Australia Observer Unit|North Australia Observer Unit]] (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from [[Lance Corporal]] to [[Lieutenant]] within three months.&lt;ref name="Boxall"&gt;{{cite web|title=BOXALL ALFRED : Service Number – NX83331|url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/ItemDetail.aspx?Barcode=4620894|work=WW2 Military Records|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the body of the unknown man was buried in Adelaide's [[West Terrace Cemetery]], where The [[Salvation Army]] conducted the service. The South Australian Grandstand Bookmakers Association paid for the service to save the man from a pauper's burial.&lt;ref name=Pyatt&gt;Pyatt, D.

&lt;!-- The tomb is located at grave site number 106 on row 12 of an area of the cemetery called "Plan 3." The grave contains multiple burials (because of expired leases) with the Somerton man the most recent. The tomb is located at gravesite number 106 on row 12 of an area of the cemetary called "Plan 3." To find it is difficult, but it is easiest if one goes to Road 5 East and then walks about 40 paces along row 12. commented out text (some of it from an earlier version which was uncited) --&gt;

Years after the burial, flowers began appearing on the grave. Police questioned a woman seen leaving the cemetery but she claimed she knew nothing of the man.&lt;ref name=Jory/&gt; About the same time, Ina Harvey, the receptionist from the Strathmore Hotel opposite Adelaide railway station, revealed that a strange man had stayed in Room 21 or 23 for a few days around the time of the death, checking out on 30 November 1948. She recalled that he was English speaking and only carrying a small black case, not unlike one a musician or a doctor might carry. When an employee looked inside the case he told Harvey he had found an object inside the case he described as looking like a 'needle.'{{sfnp|Feltus|2010}}&lt;ref name=Jory/&gt;

On 22 November 1959 it was reported that an E.B. Collins, an inmate of New Zealand's [[Wanganui Prison]], claimed to know the identity of the dead man.&lt;ref name=CIB&gt;Officer in Charge, No. 3.

(the former nurse lived in Moseley Street which is the main road through Glenelg).&lt;ref name=Clemo/&gt; A 2014 analysis by computational linguist John Rehling strongly supports the theory that the letters consist of the initials of some English text, but finds no match for these in a large survey of literature, and concludes that the letters were likely written as a form of shorthand, not as a code, and that the original text can likely never be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nlpconfidential.blogspot.com/2014/07/murder-and-nlp-taman-shud-case-splash.html |title=Computational linguistic analysis of the Tamam Shud Cipher|publisher=John Rehling|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SomertonManStone.jpg|thumb|The simple burial site of the Unknown Man at the [[West Terrace Cemetery]] in [[Adelaide]]]]

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], in its documentary series ''Inside Story'', in 1978 produced a programme on the Tamam Shud case, entitled ''The Somerton Beach Mystery'', where reporter [[Stuart Littlemore]] investigated the case, including interviewing Boxall, who could add no new information on the case,&lt;ref name=Lewes/&gt; and Paul Lawson, who made the plaster cast of the body, and who refused to answer a question about whether anyone had positively identified the body.&lt;ref name=InsideStory/&gt;

In 1994 [[John Harber Phillips]], Chief Justice of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and Chairman of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, reviewed the case to determine the cause of death and concluded that "There seems little doubt it was [[Digoxin toxicity|digitalis]]."&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;Phillips, J.H. "So When That Angel of the Darker Drink", ''Criminal Law Journal'', vol. 18, no. 2, April 1994, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips supported his conclusion by pointing out that the organs were engorged, consistent with digitalis, the lack of evidence of natural disease and "the absence of anything seen macroscopically which could account for the death".&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;

Former South Australian Chief Superintendent Len Brown, who worked on the case in the 1940s, stated that he believed that the man was from a country in the [[Warsaw Pact]], which led to the police's inability to confirm the man's identity.&lt;ref name=Police/&gt;

==Reported identifications==
[[File:SomertonMan.jpg|thumb|right|A plaster cast of the unknown man's head and chest taken by the police in 1949]]

A number of possible identifications have been proposed over the years. An Adelaide newspaper, ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', on reporting the discovery of the body, gave the possible identification as "E.C. Johnson, about 45, of Arthur St, [[Payneham, South Australia|Payneham]]".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43793796 |title=Body Found on Beach. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=2 December 1948 |accessdate=21 August 2013 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, 3 December 1948, Johnson identified himself at a police station.&lt;ref name=News2&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The News |title=Dead Man Walks into Police H.Q. |date=2 December 1948 |page=2 |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129890443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43793990 Dead man still unidentified]", 3 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, another Adelaide newspaper, ''[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]'', published a photograph of the dead man on its front page,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129894292 Mystery of Body on Beach]", ''The News'', 3 December 1948, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; leading to additional calls from members of the public about the possible identity of the dead man. By 4 December, police had announced that the man's fingerprints were not on [[South Australia]]n police records, forcing them to look further afield.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43794087 Somerton Beach body mystery]", 4 December 1948, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December, ''The Advertiser'' reported that police were searching through military records after a man claimed to have had a drink with a man resembling the dead man at a hotel in [[Glenelg, South Australia|Glenelg]] on 13 November. During their drinking session, the mystery man supposedly produced a military pension card bearing the name "Solomonson".&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43794348 Still no clue to Somerton mystery]", 6 December 1948, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 1949, two people identified the body as that of 63-year-old former [[wood cutter]] Robert Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle'' (Adelaide), "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93332664 Somerton Mystery Still Unsolved]", 13 January 1949, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; A third person, James Mack, also viewed the body, initially could not identify it, but an hour later he contacted police to claim it was Walsh. Mack stated that the reason he did not confirm this at the viewing was a difference in the colour of the hair. Walsh had left Adelaide several months earlier to buy sheep in [[Queensland]] but had failed to return at Christmas as planned.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'' "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43799305 Body Again Identified as Woodcutter]" 11 January 1949 Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Police were skeptical, believing Walsh to be too old to be the dead man. However, the police did state that the body was consistent with that of a man who had been a wood cutter, although the state of the man's hands indicated he had not cut wood for at least 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43798696 Somerton body said to be that of wood cutter]", 7 January 1949, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; Any thoughts that a positive identification had been made were quashed, however, when Elizabeth Thompson, one of the people who had earlier positively identified the body as Walsh, retracted her statement after a second viewing of the body, where the absence of a particular scar on the body, as well as the size of the dead man's legs, led her to realise the body was not Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43799241 Identity of body still in doubt]", 10 January 1949, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

By early February 1949, there had been eight different "positive" identifications of the body,&lt;ref name=swede/&gt; including two [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] men who thought the body was of a friend of theirs,&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43802353 Two More 'Identify' Somerton Body]", 31 January 1949, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and others who thought it was a missing station worker, a worker on a steamship&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43800504 Somerton Body may be that of station hand]", 19 January 1949, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] man.&lt;ref name=swede&gt;'{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130240200 |title=Body again "identified" |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |volume=52 |issue=7,957 |location=Adelaide |date=4 February 1949 |accessdate=22 May 2017 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detectives from the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] initially believed the man was from there because of the similarity of the laundry marks to those used by several dry-cleaning firms in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Argus'' "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22699115 Mystery of dead man on beach: was he a Victorian?]" 25 January 1949 Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Following publication of the man's photograph in Victoria, 28 people claimed to know his identity. Victorian detectives disproved all the claims and said that "other investigations" indicated it was unlikely that he was a Victorian.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22703463 Body on Beach Mystery Deepens]" 9 February 1949 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A seaman by the name of Tommy Reade from the {{SS|Cycle|1938|6}}, in port at the time, was thought to be the dead man, but after some of his shipmates viewed the body at the morgue, they stated categorically that the corpse was not that of Tommy Reade.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|p=83}}

By November 1953, police announced they had recently received the 251st "solution" to the identity of the body from members of the public who claimed to have met or known him. But, they said that the "only clue of any value" remained the clothing the man wore.&lt;ref&gt;''Barrier Miner'', "[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50072099 Clue to S.A. Mystery]", 10 November 1953, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an Adelaide woman contacted [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Maciej Henneberg]] about an [[Identity document|identification card]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tomsbytwo.com/hc-reynolds/|title=hc reynolds|date=2 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an H. C. Reynolds that she had found in her father's possessions. The card, a document issued in the United States to foreign seamen during World War I, was given to Henneberg in October 2011 for comparison of the ID photograph to that of the Somerton man. While Henneberg found anatomical similarities in features such as the nose, lips and eyes, he believed they were not as reliable as the close similarity of the ear. The ear shapes shared by both men were a "very good" match, although Henneberg also found what he called a "unique identifier;" a mole on the cheek that was the same shape and in the same position in both photographs."Together with the similarity of the ear characteristics, this mole, in a forensic case, would allow me to make a rare statement positively identifying the Somerton man."&lt;ref name=ID&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/is-british-seamans-identity-card-clue-to-solving-63-year-old-beach-body-mystery/story-e6frea6u-1226200076344 Is British seaman's identity card clue to solving 63-year-old beach body mystery?] [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] 20 November 2011 Pg 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbott investigation==

In March 2009 a [[University of Adelaide]] team led by Professor [[Derek Abbott]] began an attempt to solve the case through cracking the code and proposing to exhume the body to test for DNA.&lt;ref name=Stateline&gt;''[[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] South Australia'', [http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2529870.htm "Somerton Beach Mystery Man", Transcript, Broadcast 27 March 2009.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040144/http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2529870.htm# |date=4 March 2016 }}. Retrieved 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His investigations have led to questions concerning the assumptions police had made on the case.  Abbott also tracked down the [[J. Barbour &amp; Sons|Barbour]] [[waxed cotton]] of the period and found packaging variations. This may provide clues to the country where it was purchased.&lt;ref name="debelle" /&gt;

Decryption of the "code" was being started from scratch.{{when|date=April 2016}} It had been determined the letter frequency was considerably different from letters written down randomly; the frequency was to be further tested to determine if the alcohol level of the writer could alter random distribution. The format of the code also appeared to follow the [[quatrain]] format of the ''Rubaiyat, ''supporting the theory that the code was a [[one-time pad]] [[encryption]] [[algorithm]]. Copies of the ''Rubaiyat, ''as well as the [[Talmud]] and Bible, were being compared to the code using computers to get a statistical base for letter frequencies. However, the code's short length meant the investigators would require the exact edition of the book used. With the original copy lost in the 1960s, researchers have been looking for a FitzGerald edition without success.&lt;ref name=debelle&gt;Penelope Debelle, ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' (SA Weekend Supplement) "[http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/tamanshud/advertiser_aug2009.pdf A Body, A Secret Pocket and a Mysterious Code]". 1 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that any lost relatives may have this feature.]]

An investigation had shown that the Somerton Man's autopsy reports of 1948 and 1949 are now missing and the [[Barr Smith Library]]'s collection of Cleland's notes do not contain anything on the case. [[Maciej Henneberg]], professor of [[anatomy]] at the [[University of Adelaide]], examined images of the Somerton man's ears and found that his cymba (upper ear hollow) is larger than his cavum (lower ear hollow), a feature possessed by only 1–2% of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] population.&lt;ref name=Stateline2&gt;''[[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] South Australia'', [http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2573273.htm "Somerton Beach Mystery Man", Transcript, Broadcast 15 May 2009.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216085006/http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2573273.htm# |date=16 February 2016 }}. Retrieved 3 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Derek Abbott consulted with dental experts who concluded that the Somerton Man had [[hypodontia]] (a rare genetic disorder) of both lateral [[incisor]]s, a feature present in only 2% of the general population. In June 2010, Abbott obtained a photograph of Jessica Thomson's eldest son Robin, which clearly showed that he – like the unknown man – had not only a larger cymba than cavum but also hypodontia. The chance that this was a coincidence has been estimated as between one in 10,000,000 and one in 20,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/wiki/index.php/Timeline_of_the_Taman_Shud_Case |title=Timeline of the Taman Shud Case|publisher=Professor [[Derek Abbott]]|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media have suggested that Robin Thomson, who was 16 months old in 1948 and died in 2009, may have been a child of either Alf Boxall or the Somerton Man and passed off as Prosper Thomson's son. DNA testing would confirm or eliminate this speculation.&lt;ref name=Stateline/&gt; Abbott believes an exhumation and an [[autosomal]] [[Genealogical DNA test|DNA]] test could link the Somerton man to a shortlist of surnames which, along with existing clues to the man's identity, would be the "final piece of the puzzle". However, in October 2011, Attorney General [[John Rau]] refused permission to exhume the body, stating: "There needs to be public interest reasons that go well beyond public curiosity or broad scientific interest."

Feltus said he was still contacted by people in Europe who believed the man was a missing relative but did not believe an exhumation and finding the man's family grouping would provide answers to relatives, as "during that period so many war criminals changed their names and came to different countries".&lt;ref&gt;Emily Watkins "We may never know" ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' 16 October 2011 Pg 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 Abbott released an artistic impression he commissioned of the Somerton man, believing this might finally lead to an identification. "All this time we've been publishing the autopsy photo, and it's hard to tell what something looks like from that", Prof Abbott said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/after-65-years-new-picture-could-reveal-unknown-man8217s-identity/story-fn5fsgyc-1226680221225 |title=After 65 years, new picture could reveal Unknown Man's identity &amp;#124; News.com.au |first= Emily|last=Watkins |publisher=news.com.au |date=16 July 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 feature in ''California Sunday'', Derek Abbott married Rachel, the daughter of Roma Egan and Robin Thomson, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=Graeme|title=The Lost Man|url=https://stories.californiasunday.com/2015-06-07/somerton-man/|website=California Sunday|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Abbott announced three "excellent" hairs "at the right development stage for extracting DNA" had been found on the plaster cast of the corpse, and had been submitted for analysis to the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide. Processing the results could reportedly take up to a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-14/somerton-man-cold-case-could-be-one-step-closer-to-solved/9245512|title=How the Somerton Man played cupid from the grave|date=14 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the University of Adelaide team obtained a high definition analysis of the [[mitochondrial DNA]] from the hair sample from Somerton Man. They found that he and his mother belonged to [[Haplogroup_H_(mtDNA)#H4,_H7_and_H13|haplogroup H4a1a1a]], which is possessed by only 1% of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831800-200-who-was-the-somerton-man-solving-australias-coldest-case/|title=Who was the Somerton Man?

==''60 Minutes'' investigation==

In November 2013 relatives of "Jestyn" gave interviews to the television current affairs program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref name="Castello"/&gt; Kate Thomson, the daughter of Jessica and Prosper Thomson, said that her mother was the woman interviewed by the police and that her mother had told her she had lied to them – Jessica did know the identity of the "Somerton Man" and his identity was also "known to a level higher than the police force".&lt;ref name="60 Min"/&gt; Her father had died in 1995 and mother had died in 2007. Kate Thomson suggested that her mother and the "Somerton Man" may both have been spies, noting that Jessica Thomson taught English to migrants, was interested in communism, and could speak [[Russian language|Russian]], although she would not disclose to her daughter where she had learned it, or why.&lt;ref name="60 Min"/&gt;

Robin Thomson's widow, Roma Egan, and their daughter Rachel Egan, also appeared on ''60 Minutes'' suggesting that the "Somerton Man" was Robin Thomson's father and, therefore, Rachel's grandfather. The Egans reported lodging a new application with the [[Attorney-General of South Australia]], [[John Rau]], to have the Somerton Man's body exhumed and DNA tested.&lt;ref name="60 Min"/&gt; Derek Abbott also subsequently wrote to Rau in support of the Egans, saying that exhumation for DNA testing would be consistent with [[Government of Australia|federal government]] policy of identifying soldiers in war graves, to bring closure to their families. Kate Thomson opposed the exhumation as being disrespectful to her brother.&lt;ref name="60 Min"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Somerton Man|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8759245|date=21 November 2013|series=''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128054745/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8759245|archivedate=28 November 2013}}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131207071734/http://progressive.netshow.ninemsn.com.au/media2/664969388001/2013/11/664969388001_2862632003001_8021586-20131124-210918-VIDEO-FULL.mp4?videoId=2862512071001&amp;lineUpId=&amp;pubId=664969388001&amp;playerId=2613830501001&amp;affiliateId= direct link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castello"&gt;{{cite news | last = Castello | first = Renato | date = 23 November 2013 | title = New twist in Somerton Man mystery as fresh claims emerge | work = [[Herald Sun]] | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/new-twist-in-somerton-man-mystery-as-fresh-claims-emerge/story-fnii5yv7-1226766905157 | accessdate = 26 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He buys a ticket for the 10:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. train to Henley Beach but does not use it. This ticket was the first sold of only three issued between 6:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 2 p.m. by this particular ticket clerk for the Henley Beach train.
* '''Between 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 10:50&amp;nbsp;am''': There is no satisfactory explanation for what The Somerton Man did during these hours.

He may have boarded at a later time elsewhere in the city as his ticket was the sixth of nine sold between the railway station and [[South Terrace, Adelaide|South Tce]]; however, he only had a 15-minute window from the earliest time he could have checked his suitcase (the luggage room was around 60 metres from the bus stop).

* '''1 December 2 a.m.''': Estimated time of death. The time was estimated by a "quick opinion" on the state of [[rigor mortis]] while the ambulance was in transit. As a suspected suicide, no attempt to determine the correct time was made. As poisons affect the progression of rigor, 2 a.m. is probably inaccurate.

* '''26 July''': The unlisted phone number discovered in the book is traced to a woman living in Glenelg (Jessica Thomson, previously Harkness). Shown the plaster cast by Paul Lawson, she did not identify that the man was Alf Boxall, or any other person. Lawson's diary entry for that day names her as "Mrs Thompson" and states that she had a "nice figure" and was "very acceptable" (referring to the level of attractiveness) which allows the possibility of an affair with the Somerton man. She was 27 years old in 1948. In a later interview Lawson described her behaviour as being very odd that day.&lt;!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4hAb1r0jUU--&gt; She appeared as if she was about to faint.{{sfnp|Feltus|2010|p=108}} Jessica Harkness requests that her real name be withheld because she didn't want her husband to know she knew Alf Boxall.

In June 1945 – three years before the death of the Somerton Man – a 34-year-old Singaporean named George Marshall (born Joseph Saul Haim Mashal) was found dead in Ashton Park, [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], Sydney, with an open copy of the ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' on his chest.&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;''The Daily Mirror'', "Copy of Omar Khayyam beside body", 13 August 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Ashton Park is directly adjacent to Clifton Gardens.

Following the death, the boy's mother, Roma Mangnoson, reported having been threatened by a masked man, who, while driving a battered cream car, almost ran her down outside her home in Cheapside Street, [[Largs North, South Australia|Largs North]].&lt;ref name="Clive" /&gt; Mrs Mangnoson stated that "the car stopped and a man with a khaki handkerchief over his face told her to 'keep away from the police or else.'"

J. M. Gower, secretary of the Largs North Progress Association received anonymous phone calls threatening that Mrs. Mangnoson would meet with an accident if he interfered while A. H. Curtis, the acting mayor of Port Adelaide received three anonymous phone calls threatening "an accident" if he "stuck his nose into the Mangnoson affair". Police suspect the calls may be a hoax and the caller may be the same person who also terrorised a woman in a nearby suburb who had recently lost her husband in tragic circumstances.&lt;ref name=Clive/&gt;

==Media reaction==

The two daily Adelaide newspapers, ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' and ''[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]'', covered the death in separate ways. ''The Advertiser'', then a morning broadsheet, first mentioned the case in a small article on page three of its edition of 2 December 1948. Entitled "Body found on Beach", it read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A body, believed to be of E.C. Johnson, about 45, of Arthur St, [[Payneham, South Australia|Payneham]], was found on Somerton Beach, opposite the Crippled Children's Home yesterday morning. The discovery was made by Mr J. Lyons, of Whyte Rd, Somerton. Detective H. Strangway and Constable J. Moss are enquiring.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The News'', an afternoon tabloid, featured their story of the man on its first page, giving more details of the dead man.&lt;ref name=News/&gt;

As one journalist wrote in June 1949, alluding to the line in the 'Rubaiyat'', "the Somerton Man seems to have made certain that the glass would be empty, save for speculation."&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt;
{{check quotation}}
An editorial called the case "one of Australia's most profound mysteries"&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt; and noted that if he died by poison so rare and obscure it could not be identified by toxicology experts, then surely the culprit's advanced knowledge of toxic substances pointed to something more serious than a mere domestic poisoning.&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt;

'''''The Discovery of the Future''''' is a 1902 [[philosophy|philosophical lecture]] by [[H. G. Wells]] that argues for the knowability of the future.  It was originally delivered to the [[Royal Institution]] on January 24, 1902. Before appearing in book form, it was published by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Richard Gregory]] in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' on February 6, 1902,&lt;ref&gt;Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, ''H.G. Wells: A Biography'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1973), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also published as part of the ''Annual Report'' of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001188090 |title= The Discovery of the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Wells begins by distinguishing between "two divergent types of mind," one that judges and attaches importance principally to what has happened in the past and one that judges and attaches importance principally to what will happen in the future.  To the former he attributes the adjectives "legal or submissive," "passive," and "oriental," and to the latter the adjectives "legislative, creative, organizing, or masterful," and "active," calling it "a more modern and much less abundant type of mind."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''The Discovery of the Future'' (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Observing that these two minds reach "divergent and incompatible consequences" in the spheres of morality and public affairs, Wells analyzes the reasons for which the past-oriented mind predominates and asserts that this is principally due to the evidently greater knowability of the personal past as compared to the future.  But he argues that the inference from this attitude that the future is essentially unknowable does not square with "modern science, that is to say the relentless systematic criticism of phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''The Discovery of the Future'' (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only has science made us knowledgeable about a distant, impersonal past, it also regards the ability successfully to predict to be a criterion of validity.  Though the unpredictability of human behavior complicates the problem, the fact that "as individuals increase in number they begin to average out" means that "an inductive knowledge of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human possibility."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''The Discovery of the Future'' (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), pp. 39; 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Confessing himself to be among "those who believe entirely in the forces behind the individual" rather than in individuals themselves as determining causes, Wells argues that there is "no reason why we should not aspire to, and discover and use, safe and servicable, generalizations upon countless issues in the human destiny."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''The Discovery of the Future'' (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; But personal prophecy and fortune-telling will never be possible; "the knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not individual."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''The Discovery of the Future'' (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells devotes the last part of his text to speculations about "the question what is to come after man," considering it "the most persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the whole world."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''The Discovery of the Future'' (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes with a statement of personal faith "in the coherency and purpose in the world and in the greatness of human destiny."&lt;ref&gt;H.G. Wells, ''The Discovery of the Future'' (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Wells's lecture followed on the heels of the great success of his recent book, ''Anticipations'' (1901), based on a series of articles commissioned in 1900 by W.L. Courtney for the ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'', but the original invitation to lecture to the Royal Institution had come in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, ''H.G. Wells: A Biography'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1973), pp. 161-62.  The full title of the volume was ''Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Graham Wallas]], Wells's delivery of his lecture was too rapid, but it was well received and contributed to the rapid integration of the 35-year-old Wells into the literary and intellectual elite of London in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 154-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Man With the Flower in His Mouth''''' ({{lang-it|'''L'Uomo dal Fiore in Bocca'''}} {{IPA-it|ˈlwɔːmo dal ˈfjoːre im ˈbokka|}}) is a 1922 play by the Italian playwright [[Luigi Pirandello]]. It is particularly noteworthy for becoming, in 1930, the first piece of [[television]] drama ever to be produced in Britain, when a version was screened by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] as part of their experimental transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man with the Flower in his Mouth|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlytv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/technology/technology2.html|title=TV Technology 2. Television on the Air|first=Richard G|last=Elen|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The play is a one-act "dialogue" derived, with small variations, from the novella ''La Morte Adosso'' (1923). The dialogue takes place in a bar, late at night, between a man who is dying of an [[epithelioma]]
(''il fiore in bocca'') and a peaceful businessman who has missed his train. In other words, between someone who intensely lives the little time left to him and someone who is rich with time to spend idly and irresponsibly, waiting for the morning train and entirely absorbed by the banal contretemps.

The exceptional nature of the moment, for the man who feels death upon him—to use Pirandello's phrase—and the normality of it, for the one who is absorbed in the usual affairs of life with its small daily commitments, mark the two ends of the dialectic which is animated in the grand soliloquy of the protagonist.

He lucidly analyses his last sensations on earth, evoking scenes of common life, particulars of a quotidianity which are receding from him irremediably and which, for this reason, make precious the memories of even the most trivial events. In the solemnity of his solitude, he seems to have gained unexpected awarenesses of the life that is leaving him and of death. With no sense of regret or repentance, he almost seems to bitterly enjoy his unrepeatable experience marked by the echo of the end, which allows him to dedicate himself with interest to observing the anonymous life of others, in order to grasp its sense.

==Adaptations==
===1930 television version===
The BBC had been experimenting with [[John Logie Baird]]'s primitive 30-line television technology since the previous year, running test transmissions both from Baird's own premises and from their own [[radio]] headquarters at [[Savoy Hill]]. In the summer of 1930 it was decided that a drama should be produced as a new test for and demonstration of the medium, and ''The Man With the Flower in His Mouth'' was selected for use because of its short length of around half an hour, its limited cast of only three characters and its confined setting.

The production was broadcast live on the afternoon of 14 July, from a set at the Baird company's headquarters, 133 Long Acre in [[London]]. The production starred [[Earle Grey]] as 'The Man', [[Gladys Young]] as 'The Woman' and [[Lionel Millard]] as 'The Customer'. It was directed by the BBC's head of [[radio drama]] at the time, [[Val Gielgud]], and produced by [[Lance Sieveking]]. The artwork was by [[C. R. Nevinson]].

Generally regarded as a successful experiment, the production was watched at the time by [[Ramsay MacDonald]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], with his family from their official residence at [[10 Downing Street]]. Baird had installed one of his prototype 'televisors' here two months previously, so that MacDonald could view the test transmissions he and the BBC were regularly broadcasting.

===1967 re-creation===
As the 1930 production was transmitted live, no record survives of it in the archives. However, in 1967, [[Bill Elliott (television)|Bill Elliott]], a technician working at [[Granada Television]] in [[Manchester]], decided to attempt a re-creation of an extract of the play, using a replica of one of the 30-line Baird Televisiors he had constructed himself, which acted as both camera and monitor.

The 30-line signal was sufficiently low-band for Elliott to be able to record the production onto a stereo audio [[tape recorder]], thus preserving it for posterity. Although Elliott did not re-create the entire play and used amateur student actors in the roles, he did secure the services of the original production's producer, Lance Sieveking. Sieveking not only returned to produce the production in an attempt to assure as much authenticity as possible, but he was also able to provide the original artwork used in the play which was used again, and the very same 78-rpm [[gramophone record]] which had provided the music in 1930, which was also re-used.

The 1967 production survives in Elliott's hands, and a small segment was seen in the 1985 Granada documentary series ''Television'', a history of the medium.

===2007 opera===
In February 2007 an opera based on the play was premiered in [[La Monnaie|De Munt]] in Brussels. The composer was [[Luc Brewaeys]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamonnaie.be/demunt-1.0/programma/productie.jsp?id=4612 Program page at ''De Munt'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vegetarianism''' {{IPAc-en|v|ɛ|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of  [[meat]] ([[red meat]], [[poultry]], [[seafood]], and the [[flesh]] of any other [[animal]]),&lt;!--NOTE: Specifying what is meant by "meat" is necessary because some people don't consider poultry or seafood to be "real meat", and may think of eating either as still being vegetarian, as has been extensively discussed on the talk page. The specifics regarding this are mentioned lower in the lead and body of the article.--&gt; and may also include abstention from [[by-product]]s of [[animal slaughter]].&lt;!--NOTE: See the sources and past talk page discussions for the addition of by-products of animal slaughter. As many vegetarians are unaware of certain animal-derived products hidden in their foods or do not care if they consume them, and others are vegetarians not for ethical reasons, it was decided that "may also abstain," or some variation of that, is neutral and more accurate wording for this information.--&gt;&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=508|title=What is a vegetarian?|publisher=[[Vegetarian Society]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318164124/https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=508|archive-date=March 18, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 18, 2018|quote={{pb}}A vegetarian is someone who lives on a diet of grains, pulses, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits, fungi, algae, yeast and/or some other non-animal-based foods (e.g. salt) with, or without, dairy products, honey and/or eggs.

Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons.  Many people [[ethics of eating meat|object to eating meat]] out of respect for [[sentient]] life. Such ethical motivations have been codified [[vegetarianism and religion|under various religious beliefs]], as well as [[animal rights]] advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, [[Environmental vegetarianism|environmental]], cultural, [[aesthetic]], [[Economic vegetarianism|economic]], or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]] diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an [[ovo-vegetarian]] diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a [[lacto-vegetarian]] diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A [[vegan]] diet excludes all [[animal product]]s, including eggs and dairy. Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as [[beeswax]], leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.

Packaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and [[marshmallow]]s, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions.&lt;ref name="navs-online.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=729|title=Fact Sheets: Things to look out for if you are a vegetarian/vegan|date=September 2015|publisher=Vegetarian Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318175347/https://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=729|archive-date=March 18, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients.&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org2"/&gt; Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients.

==Etymology==
The first discovered written use of the term "vegetarian" dates to 1839 and refers to what was previously described as a vegetable regimen or diet, for example in print in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, ''Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought'', Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uMnubkF5HjAC&amp;pg=PA12 12].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern dictionaries based on scientific linguistic principles have always explained its origin as an irregular compound of ''[[vegetable]]'' (in the adjectival sense of any plant still common today)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vegetable ]&lt;/ref&gt; and the suffix ''[[wikt:-arian|-arian]]'' (in the sense of "supporter, believer" as in ''[[wikt:humanitarian|humanitarian]]''), but there were amateur attempts, even by a Latin scholar not trained in linguistics, to find other origins of the word.&lt;ref name="VegetusMyth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegsource.com/john-davis/the-vegetus-myth.html|title=The Vegetus Myth|last=Davis|first=John|date=June 1, 2011|website=VegSource|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318213259/https://www.vegsource.com/john-davis/the-vegetus-myth.html|archive-date=March 18, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 18, 2018|quote=Vegetarian can equally be seen as derived from the late Latin '{{lang|la|vegetabile}}' – meaning plant – as in {{lang|la|Regnum Vegetabile}} / Plant Kingdom. Hence vegetable, vegetation – and vegetarian. Though others suggest that 'vegetable' itself is derived from 'vegetus'. But it's very unlikely that the originators went through all that either – they really did just join 'vegetable+arian', as the dictionaries have said all along.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term was popularized with the foundation of the [[Vegetarian Society]] in [[Manchester]] in 1847,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''OED'' vol. 19, second edition (1989), p. 476; ''Webster’s Third New International Dictionary'' p. 2537; ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', ''Oxford'', 1966, p. 972; ''The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology'' (1988), p. 1196; Colin Spencer, ''The Heretic's Feast. A History of Vegetarianism'', London 1993, p. 252. The ''OED'' writes that the word came into general use after the formation of the Vegetarian Society at Ramsgate in 1847, though it offers two examples of usage from 1839 and 1842: 
* 1839: "If I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian." (F. A. Kemble, ''Jrnl. Residence on Georgian Plantation'' (1863) 251)
* 1842: "To tell a healthy vegetarian that his diet is very uncongenial with the wants of his nature." (''Healthian'', Apr. 34)  The 1839 occurrence remains under discussion; the Oxford English Dictionary's 1839 source is in fact an 1863 publication: [[Fanny Kemble]], ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation 1838–1839''. The original manuscript has not been located.&lt;/ref&gt; although it may have appeared in print before 1847.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=veghistory&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ivu.org/history/vegetarian.html|title=History of Vegetarianism: Extracts from some journals 1842–48 – the earliest known uses of the word 'vegetarian'|last=Davis|first=John|publisher=[[International Vegetarian Union]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318223303/https://ivu.org/history/vegetarian.html|archive-date=March 18, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 18, 2018|quote=In 1841 the [Alcott House] was re-invented as '''A Concordium, or Industry Harmony College''' though the building remained 'Alcott House'.

There are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:

* [[Buddhist vegetarianism]]. Different Buddhist traditions have differing teachings on diet, which may also vary for ordained monks and nuns compared to others. Many interpret the [[Five Precepts|precept]] "not to kill" to require abstinence from meat, but not all. In Taiwan, ''su'' vegetarianism excludes not only all animal products but also vegetables in the [[allium]] family (which have the characteristic aroma of onion and garlic): onion, garlic, scallions, leeks, chives, or shallots.
* [[Fruitarianism]] and [[Jain vegetarianism]] permit only fruit, nuts, seeds, and other plant matter that can be gathered without harming the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S0002-8223(09)00700-7/fulltext|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|volume=109|issue=7|pages=1266–1282|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027|date=July 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2016|pmid=19562864|vauthors=Craig WJ, Mangels AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain vegetarianism also includes dairy.
* [[Macrobiotic diet]]s consist mostly of [[whole grain]]s and [[bean]]s.
* [[Lacto vegetarianism]] includes dairy products but not eggs.
* [[Ovo vegetarianism]] includes eggs but not dairy products.
* [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism]] (or lacto-ovo vegetarianism) includes animal products such as eggs, milk, and honey.
* [[Sattvic diet]] (also known as yogic diet), a [[plant-based diet]] which may also include dairy and honey, but excludes eggs, [[Lentil|red lentils]], [[durian]], mushrooms, [[allium]]s, [[blue cheese]]s, fermented foods or sauces, and alcoholic drinks. Coffee, [[Tea|black or green tea]], [[chocolate]], [[nutmeg]], and any other type of stimulant (including excessively [[pungent]] spices) are sometimes excluded, as well.
* [[Veganism]] excludes all animal flesh and by-products, such as milk, honey (not always),&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2008/07/the_great_vegan_honey_debate.html|title=The Great Vegan Honey Debate: Is honey the dairy of the insect world?|last=Engber|first=Daniel|date=July 30, 2008|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309213633/https://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2008/07/the_great_vegan_honey_debate.html|archive-date=March 9, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eggs, as well as items refined or manufactured through any such product, such as animal-tested [[baking soda]] or white sugar refined with [[bone char]].
** [[Raw veganism]] includes only fresh and uncooked fruit, nuts, seeds, and vegetables. Food must not be heated above {{Convert|118|F}} to be considered "raw". Usually, raw vegan food is only ever "cooked" with a [[food dehydrator]] at low temperatures.
Within the "[[wikt:ovo-|ovo-]]" groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] (with [[Balut (food)|balut]] being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.

Some vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing. For example, sugars that are whitened with [[bone char]], cheeses that use animal [[rennet]] ([[enzyme]]s from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the [[collagen]] inside animals' skin, bones, and [[connective tissue]]), some [[Sugarcane|cane sugar]] (but not [[Sugar beet|beet sugar]]) and beverages (such as apple juice and alcohol) clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and [[sturgeon]], while other vegetarians are unaware of, or do not mind, such ingredients.&lt;ref name="navs-online.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forrest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vegsoc.org2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vrg.org/&gt;

These diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:
* Macrobiotic diet consisting mostly of whole grains and beans, but may sometimes include fish.
* [[Pescetarianism]], which includes fish and possibly other forms of seafood.
* [[wikt:pollo|Pollo]]-pescetarianism, which includes poultry and fish, or "white meat" only.
* Pollotarianism, which includes chicken and possibly other poultry.

Semi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the [[Vegetarian Society]], which states that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.&lt;ref name="Vegsoc.org, fish"/&gt;

{{Quote box
|quote = On average, vegetarians consume a lower proportion of calories from fat (particularly saturated fatty acids), fewer overall calories, more fiber, potassium, and vitamin C, than do non-vegetarians. Vegetarians generally have a lower body mass index. These characteristics and other lifestyle factors associated with a vegetarian diet may contribute to the positive health outcomes that have been identified among vegetarians.

====Protein====
Protein intake in vegetarian diets is lower than in meat diets but can meet the daily requirements for most people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter Emery| first = Tom Sanders| title = Molecular Basis of Human Nutrition| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd|year=2002| page = 32| isbn = 978-0-7484-0753-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at [[Harvard University]] as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, [[New Zealand]] and various European countries,
confirmed vegetarian diets provide sufficient protein intake as long as a variety of plant sources are available and consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brenda Davis| first = Vesanto Melina| title = The New Becoming Vegetarian| publisher = Book Publishing Company|year=2003| pages = 57–58| isbn = 978-1-57067-144-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians.   Proteins are composed of [[amino acid]]s, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the [[essential amino acid]]s, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|ovo-lacto vegetarian]], several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including [[lupin bean]]s, [[Soybean|soy]],&lt;ref name="SND-soybeans"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4375/2 | title = Soybeans, mature seeds, raw | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hemp]]seed, [[Salvia hispanica|chia seed]],&lt;ref name="SND-chia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3061/2 | title = Seeds, chia seeds, dried | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[amaranth grain|amaranth]],&lt;ref name="SND-amaranth"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5676/2 | title = Amaranth, uncooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[buckwheat]],&lt;ref name="SND-buckwheat"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5681/2 | title = Buckwheat | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pumpkin seeds]]&lt;ref name="SND-pumpkin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3066/2 | title = Pumpkin Seeds | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]],&lt;ref name="SND-spirulina"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2765/2 | title = Spirulina | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pistachios]],&lt;ref name="SND-pistachio"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3135/2| title = Pistachio | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =October 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quinoa]].&lt;ref name="SND-quinoa"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/10352/2 | title = Quinoa, cooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. [[brown rice]] and [[bean]]s, or [[hummus]] and [[pita]], though [[protein combining]] in the same meal is not necessary{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young VR, Pellett PL | title = Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal = Am.

====Iron====
Vegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=782 |title=Vegetarian Society - Factsheet - Iron |publisher=Vegsoc.org |date=September 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/nutshell.htm#iron |title=Vegetarianism in a Nutshell |publisher=Vrg.org |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarian foods rich in iron include [[black turtle bean|black beans]], [[cashew]]s, [[hempseed]], [[kidney bean]]s, [[broccoli]], [[lentil]]s, [[oatmeal]], [[raisin]]s,  [[spinach]], [[cabbage]], lettuce, [[black-eyed pea]]s, [[soybean]]s, many [[breakfast cereal]]s, [[sunflower seed]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[tomato juice]], [[tempeh]], [[molasses]], [[thyme]], and [[whole-wheat bread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goveg.com/essential_nutrients.asp#iron |title=// Health Issues // Optimal Vegan Nutrition |publisher=Goveg.com |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron.&lt;ref name=Davey/&gt; Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waldmann A, Koschizke JW, Leitzmann C, Hahn A | title = Dietary Iron Intake and Iron Status of German Female Vegans: Results of the German Vegan Study | journal = Ann Nutr Metab | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–108 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14988640 | doi = 10.1159/000077045 | url = http://www.repo.uni-hannover.de/handle/123456789/2754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 58%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krajcovicová-Kudlácková M, Simoncic R, Béderová A, Grancicová E, Magálová T | title = Influence of vegetarian and mixed nutrition on selected haematological and biochemical parameters in children | journal = Nahrung | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 311–14 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9399258 | doi = 10.1002/food.19970410513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the [[American Dietetic Association]] states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency [[Anemia|anaemia]] is rare no matter the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craig WJ, Mangels AR | title = Position of the American Dietetic Association: vegetarian diets | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 109 | issue = 7 | pages = 1266–82 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19562864 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;====
According to the United States [[National Institutes of Health]], [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] is not generally present in plants and is naturally found in foods of animal origin.&lt;ref name="ODS_B12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitaminb12.asp |title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; |accessdate=November 13, 2009 |publisher=National Institutes of Health: Office of Dietary Supplements }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|Lacto-ovo vegetarians]] can obtain B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; from dairy products and eggs, and vegans can obtain it from [[fortified food]]s (including some soy products and some breakfast cereals) and dietary supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu3/toushin/05031802/002/009.pdf |format=PDF |title=Food and description |publisher=Mext.go.jp |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=（科学技術・学術政策局政策課資源室） |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu3/toushin/05031802.htm |title=五訂増補日本食品標準成分表：文部科学省 |publisher=Mext.go.jp |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110004688287/en/ |title=CiNii Articles - Vegans (pure vegetarians) and vitamin B_12 deficiency |publisher=Ci.nii.ac.jp |date=December 20, 2003 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vegan Society B12 factsheet"&gt;{{cite web| title=What Every Vegan Should Know About Vitamin B12|url=http://www.vegansociety.com/lifestyle/nutrition/b12.aspx|publisher=Vegan Society|date=October 31, 2001|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="donaldson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Donaldson MS | title = Metabolic vitamin B12 status on a mostly raw vegan diet with follow-up using tablets, nutritional yeast, or probiotic supplements | journal = Annals of Nutrition &amp; Metabolism | volume = 44 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 229–34 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11146329 | doi = 10.1159/000046689  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; can also be obtained from fortified [[yeast]] extract products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diet/Pages/Vitaminsandminerals.aspx |title=Vitamins and minerals - NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=February 18, 2015 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommended dietary allowance of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in the United States is, per day, 0.4 mcg (0–6 months), rising to 1.8 mcg (9–13 years), 2.4 mcg (14+ years), and 2.8 mcg (lactating female).&lt;ref name="ODS_B12"/&gt; While the body's daily requirement for vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is very small, deficiency of the vitamin is very serious leading to anemia and irreversible nerve damage.&lt;ref name="moz"&gt;{{Cite news| last= Mozafar| first= A.|year= 1997| title= Is there vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; in plants or not?

====Fatty acids====
Plant-based, or vegetarian, sources of [[Omega 3]] fatty acids include [[soy]], [[walnut]]s, pumpkin seeds, [[canola oil]], [[kiwifruit]], [[hempseed]], [[algae]], [[chia seed]], [[flaxseed]], echium seed and [[Leaf vegetable|leafy vegetables]] such as lettuce, [[spinach]], [[cabbage]] and [[portulaca oleracea|purslane]]. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. [[Olive]]s (and [[olive oil]]) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide [[alpha-linolenic acid]] which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosell MS, Lloyd-Wright Z, Appleby PN, Sanders TA, Allen NE, Key TJ | title = Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma in British meat-eating, vegetarian, and vegan men | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 327–34 | year = 2003 | pmid = 16087975 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn.82.2.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain [[algae]] such as [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] are good sources of [[gamma-linolenic acid]] (GLA), [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA), [[linoleic acid]] (LA), [[stearidonic acid]] (SDA), [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), and [[arachidonic acid]] (AA).&lt;ref name="uzbek"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Babadzhanov A |author2=Abdusamatova N |author3=Yusupova F |author4=Faizullaeva N |author5=Mezhlumyan LG |author6=Malikova MKh | title = Chemical Composition of Spirulina platensis Cultivated in Uzbekistan | journal = Chemistry of Natural Compounds | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 276–279 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1023/B:CONC.0000039141.98247.e8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biomass"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tokuşoglu Ö, Uunal MK | title = Biomass Nutrient Profiles of Three Microalgae: Spirulina platensis, Chlorella vulgaris, and Isochrisis galena | journal=Journal of Food Science | volume = 68 | issue = 4 | pages = 1144–1148 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb09615.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calcium====
[[Calcium]] intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned.&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting Calcium Recommendations  on a Vegan Diet|url=http://vegetariannutrition.net/docs/Calcium-Vegetarian-Nutrition.pdf|publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcium Fact Sheet|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet.&lt;ref name="Mangels"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mangels|first=Reed|title=Calcium in the Vegan Diet|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/calcium.php|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The calcium found in [[broccoli]], [[Chinese cabbage|bok choy]], and [[kale]] have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body.&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overview of Calcium"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]|title=Overview of Calcium|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56060/?report=reader|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overview of Calcium"/&gt;  Other  foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, [[Turnip|turnip greens]], mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and [[tahini]].&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mangels"/&gt; Though calcium can be found in [[Spinach]], [[swiss chard]], [[bean]]s and [[Beet|beet greens]], they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;  Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates.&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt;  See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages,&lt;ref name="Calcium Fact Sheet"/&gt; the Vegetarian Resource Group&lt;ref name="Mangels"/&gt; and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;ref name="Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics"/&gt;  for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.

There have been many [[comparative studies|comparative]] and [[statistics|statistical studies]] of the relationship between diet and longevity, including vegetarianism and [[longevity]].

A 1999 [[Meta-analysis|metastudy]] combined data from five studies from western countries.&lt;ref name="AJCN metastudy"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Key TJ, Fraser GE, Thorogood M, Appleby PN, Beral V, Reeves G, Burr ML, Chang-Claude J, Frentzel-Beyme R, Kuzma JW, Mann J, McPherson K | title = Mortality in vegetarians and non-vegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 516S–524S | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10479225 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/70/3/516S | accessdate = October 30, 2009 | doi=10.1079/phn19980006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metastudy reported [[mortality ratio]]s, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters had the base mortality rate of 1.0, while the number for [[veganism|vegans]] was very uncertain (anywhere between 0.7 and 1.44) due to too few data points. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the "lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: "...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from [[ischaemic heart disease]] than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established".&lt;ref name="AJCN metastudy"/&gt;

In ''Mortality in British vegetarians'',&lt;ref name="AJCN British study"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Key TJ, Appleby PN, Davey GK, Allen NE, Spencer EA, Travis RC | title = Mortality in British vegetarians: review and preliminary results from EPIC-Oxford | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 78 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 533S–538S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936946 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.533S }}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar conclusion is drawn:

&lt;blockquote&gt;British vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Appleby PN, Key TJ, Thorogood M, Burr ML, Mann J | title = Mortality in British vegetarians | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–36 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12001975 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2001248 | url = http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/16989/1/mortal.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Adventist Health Studies]] is ongoing research that documents the [[life expectancy]] in [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that "the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.&lt;ref&gt;Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, ''[http://www.llu.edu/pages/news/today/july2601/llu.html New Adventist Health Study research noted in Archives of Internal Medicine]'', Loma Linda University, July 26, 2001. Retrieved January 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled "Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?" published in ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that "The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy." However, the study also concluded that "Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians." It further states that "This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet." In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that "5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh PN, Sabaté J, Fraser GE | title = Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 526S–532S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936945 | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/526S.long | accessdate = September 28, 2012 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.526S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and diet==

===General===
{{Main|Ethics of eating meat}}
Various ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural [[taboo]], such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as [[factory farms]], or avoid certain meats, such as [[veal]] or [[foie gras]]. Some people follow vegetarian or [[Veganism|vegan]] diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. [[factory farming]] and the industrialisation of [[animal slaughter]]. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant [[protein]].

Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain [[Intensive farming|agricultural practices]] surrounding the [[animal husbandry|production]] of meat.

=== Ethics of killing for food ===
{{POV section|2018|date=April 2018}}
{{Main|Bioethics}}
[[Princeton University]] professor and [[Animal rights movement|animal rights]] activist [[Peter Singer]] believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals in the flesh to eat as against killing humans to eat, especially humans with cognitive abilities equal or lesser than the animals in question. Singer, in his book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]],'' listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under [[utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]], and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or [[nutrition]] value is not a sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|pages=103–112|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}&lt;/ref&gt; One author proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMahan|first1=Jeff|title=The Ethics of Killing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not [[Moral equivalence|moral equals]] to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SH2b |title=Animals and Ethics [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dairy and eggs ===
One of the main differences between a [[vegan]] and a [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|typical vegetarian diet]] is the avoidance of both eggs and [[dairy product]]s such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. [[Veganism#Ethical veganism|Ethical vegans]] do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death.&lt;ref name=marcus&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781590133446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment of animals ===
{{main|Animal rights}}
[[Ethical vegetarianism]] has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of [[factory farming]], faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Classical Greek and Roman philosophy===
[[File:Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism (1618-20); Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism, painting by [[Rubens]]]]

Ancient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. [[Pythagoras]] was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.

Roman writer [[Ovid]] concluded his magnum opus [[Metamorphoses]], in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]], into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.

{{quote|Everything changes; nothing dies; the soul roams to and fro, now here, now there, and takes what frame it will, passing from beast to man, from our own form to beast and never dies...Therefore lest appetite and greed destroy the bonds of love and duty, heed my message! Abstain! Never by slaughter dispossess souls that are kin and nourish blood with blood!&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]],'' [[Metamorphoses]]'', Book XV, translated by A.D. Melville, Oxford University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While there are no dietary restrictions in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Diet |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Esslemont, J.E. |authorlink = John Esslemont |year = 1980 |title = Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition = 5th |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 978-0-87743-160-2 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/o/BNE/bne-83.html.iso8859-1?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = `Abdu'l-Bahá |editor = MacNutt |author-link = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1912 |publication-date = 1982 |title = The Promulgation of Universal Peace |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn = 978-0-87743-172-5 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-60.html.iso8859-1?}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion.{{r|PSmith}} While [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Writings Concerning Health, Healing, and Nutrition|url = http://bahai-library.com/compilation_health_healing_nutrition#III|accessdate =May 25, 2009|author = Research Department, Universal House of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; both he and the [[Universal House of Justice]], the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs.{{r|PSmith}}

In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, [[elephant meat]], horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh&lt;ref&gt;Mahavagga Pali – Bhesajjakkhandhaka – Vinaya Pitaka&lt;/ref&gt;) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm#note4 "Buddhism and Vegetarianism, The Rationale for the Buddha's Views on the Consumption of Meat"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007043230/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha069.htm |date=October 7, 2013 }} by Dr V.

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian vegetarianism}}

Christians have always been free to make their own decisions about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that practice specific dietary restrictions for various reasons.&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Canon Law|publisher=vatican.va|accessdate=July 28, 2013|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P4O.HTM#37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early sect known as the [[Ebionites]] are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their [[Gospel of the Ebionites#Vegetarianism|Gospel]] indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' "errors".&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 30.22.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isidore of Seville, ''Etymologies'', VIII.v.36&lt;/ref&gt;

At a much later time, the [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] founded by Reverend [[William Cowherd]] in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name=desc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The Bible Christian Church|publisher=International Vegetarian Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the [[Vegetarian Society]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=827|title=History of Vegetarianism – Early Ideas|publisher=The Vegetarian Society|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}; Gregory, James (2007) ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians''.

[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ova-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC). They have also sponsored and participated in many scientific studies exploring the impact of dietary decisions upon health outcomes.&lt;ref name=sdada1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdada.org/position.htm |title=Position Statement on Vegetarian Diet |publisher=Sdada.org |accessdate=September 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529062331/http://sdada.org/position.htm |archivedate=May 29, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCNC has in addition adapted the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]'s [[Food guide pyramid#USDA food pyramid|food pyramid]] for a vegetarian dietary approach.&lt;ref name=sdada1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdada.org/Pyramid-Vegetarian-01.jpg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513033958/http://www.sdada.org/Pyramid-Vegetarian-01.jpg|date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only kinds of meat specifically frowned upon by the SDA health message are [[unclean animals|unclean meats]], or those forbidden in scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdada.org/sdahealth.htm |title=The Seventh-day Adventist Health Message |publisher=Sdada.org |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513031730/http://www.sdada.org/sdahealth.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, anti-vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 "to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/quakers.html |title=The Great War and the Interwar Period |publisher=ivu.org |accessdate=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Canon law#Catholic Church|Canon Law]], [[Roman Catholics]] are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on [[Ash Wednesday]] and all Fridays of [[Lent]] including [[Good Friday]]. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/fast_and_abstinence.htm|title=Fast and Abstinence|publisher=EWTN|accessdate=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the formation of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church, and has been known as the "health message" belief of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventists are well known for presenting a health message that recommends [[Christian vegetarianism|vegetarianism]] and expects adherence to the [[Kashrut|kosher]] laws in Leviticus 11. Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as "[[unclean animals|unclean]]". The church discourages its members from consuming [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[tobacco]] or illegal drugs (compare [[Christianity and alcohol]]). In addition, some Adventists avoid [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[cola]], and other beverages containing [[caffeine]].

The pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of [[breakfast cereal]]s into the Western diet, and the "modern commercial concept of cereal food" originated among Adventists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/78499/breakfast-cereal Britannica.com]&lt;!-- need to replace this with a secondary (not tertiary) source, and remove the quotation--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Harvey Kellogg]] was one of the early founders of Adventist health work. His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]] by his brother [[William K. Kellogg|William]]. In both [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the church-owned [[Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company]] is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently [[Weet-Bix]].

Research funded by the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] has shown that the average Adventist in [[California]] lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. [[Adventist Health Studies|The research]], as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat [[vegetarian]] diet that is rich in nuts and beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Though there is no strict rule on what to consume and what not to, paths of [[Hinduism]] hold vegetarianism as an ideal. Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence ([[ahimsa]]) applied to animals;&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen, Unto: ''Ahimsa. Non-Violence in Indian Tradition'', London 1976, p. 107–109.&lt;/ref&gt; the intention to offer only "pure" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as [[prasad]]; and the conviction that a [[sattvic diet]] is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development.

However, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community, location, custom and  varying traditions. Historically and currently, those [[Hindus]] who eat meat prescribe [[Jhatka]] meat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2004/10/21/stories/2004102100111600.htm |title=The Hindu : Sci Tech / Speaking Of Science : Changes in the Indian menu over the ages |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=October 21, 2004 |accessdate=February 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826122930/http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2004/10/21/stories/2004102100111600.htm |archive-date=August 26, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while some Hindus believe that the cow is a holy animal whose [[Cattle slaughter in India|slaughter]] for meat is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The states where cow slaughter is legal in India|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-no-beef-nation/|work=The Indian Express|date=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|animals in Islam|Islamic dietary laws}}
Some followers of Islam, or Muslims, chose to be vegetarian for health, ethical, or personal reasons.  However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial due to conflicting [[fatwas]] and differing interpretations of the [[Quran]]. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.&lt;ref name="huffpostca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/anila-muhammad/vegetarian-msulim_b_3124110.html|title=Vegetarian Muslim: Turning Away From a Meat-Based Diet|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muslims can’t be vegetarian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipaki.com/content/html/28/1203.html |title=Muslims can't be Vegetarian? : Islam : Dietery Law |publisher=Ipaki.com |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet [[Rabia of Basra]], who died in the year 801, and the Sri Lankan Sufi master [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]], who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. The former [[President of India|Indian president]] Dr. [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] was also famously a vegetarian.&lt;ref name="kalam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lokpriya.com/personalities/scientists/kalam.html |title=lokpriya! |publisher=Lokpriya.com |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321042322/http://www.lokpriya.com/personalities/scientists/kalam.html |archive-date=March 21, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/news/1-96/muslim.html |title=IVU News – Islam and Vegetarianism |publisher=Ivu.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-[[halal]] restaurants. However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole.&lt;ref name="Muslims can’t be vegetarian"/&gt;

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism}}
[[File:Jain Vegetarianism Illustration.jpg|thumb|The food choices of Jains are based on the value of [[Ahimsa|Ahimsa (non-violence)]].]]
Followers of [[Jainism]] believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainstudy.org/JSC6.02-Vegetarianism.htm "Vegetarianism Good For The Self And Good For The Environment"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203447/http://www.jainstudy.org/JSC6.02-Vegetarianism.htm |date=January 1, 2016 }} at The Jain Study Circle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsc.org/spiritual.htm "Spiritual Traditions and Vegetarianism"] at the Vegetarian Society of Colorado website. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301215408/http://www.vsc.org/spiritual.htm |date=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some particularly dedicated individuals are [[fruitarianism|fruitarians]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Warren: ''World Religions'', 4th edition, Belmont: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]] 2005, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-534-52762-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honey is forbidden, because honey is the regurgitation of nectar by bees &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetus.org/honey/honey.htm|title=Why honey is not vegan|author=Noah Lewis|date=|website=vegetus.org|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may also contain eggs, excreta and dead bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because the plants themselves and tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainuniversity.org/jainism.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002010300/http://www.jainuniversity.org/jainism.aspx|date=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish vegetarianism}}
While classical Jewish law neither requires nor prohibits the consumption of meat, Jewish vegetarians often cite Jewish principles regarding [[Jewish ethics#Treatment of animals|animal welfare]], [[Jewish ethics#Environmental ethics|environmental ethics]], moral character, and [[Jewish ethics#Health and self-respect|health]] as reasons for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hazon.org/jewish-food-movement/food-choices/animal-welfare/|title=Animal Welfare - Hazon|work=Hazon|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary L. Zamore, ed. The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic (New York, NY: CCAR Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of medieval [[rabbi]]s (e.g., [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]]) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits.  Many modern rabbis, by contrast, advocate vegetarianism or veganism primarily because of concerns about animal welfare, especially in light of the traditional prohibition on causing unnecessary "pain to living creatures" ([[Tza'ar ba'alei chayim|tza'ar ba'alei hayyim]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rabbis and Vegetarianism: An Evolving Tradition|last=Kalechofsky|first=Roberta|publisher=Micah Publications|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], consumption of meat was prohibited to human beings (1:29-30) though Noah was given permission to consume meat after the Great Flood.  Some advocates of Jewish vegetarianism, such as Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], describe vegetarianism as an [[Jewish eschatology|eschatological]] ideal to which all human beings must eventually return.&lt;ref name="kook"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kook|first=Avraham Yitzhak|authorlink=Avraham Yitzhak Kook|year=1961|title=A Vision of Vegetarianism and Peace|trans-title=|journal=|volume=|series=|issue=|page=|pages=|at=|chapter=|location=|publisher=|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-link=David Cohen (rabbi)|language=|id=|isbn=|issn=|oclc=|pmid=|pmc=|bibcode=|doi=|accessdate=|url=http://jewishveg.com/AVisionofVegetarianismandPeace.pdf|laysource=|laysummary=|laydate=|quote=|ref=|separator=|postscript=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015020644/http://jewishveg.com/AVisionofVegetarianismandPeace.pdf|archive-date=October 15, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the [[halakha|halakhic]] permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishveg.com/torah.html |title=Judaism &amp; Vegetarianism |publisher=Jewishveg.com |accessdate=August 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902154013/http://www.jewishveg.com/torah.html |archive-date=September 2, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some commentators, such as Rabbi [[Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz]], the complexity of the laws of sacrifice and slaughter ([[shechita]]) was intended to discourage the consumption of meat and make it less painful for the animals.&lt;ref&gt;"The Vision of Eden: Animal Welfare and Vegetarianism" in "Jewish Law and Mysticism", Orot 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish vegetarianism and veganism have become especially popular among Israeli Jews. In 2016, Israel was described as "the most vegan country on Earth", as five percent of its population eschewed all animal products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetower.org/article/how-israel-became-the-global-center-of-veganism/|title=How Israel Became the Global Center of Veganism|work=The Tower|access-date=May 23, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest in veganism has grown among both non-Orthodox and Orthodox Jews in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/197361/life-after-brisket|title=The Rise of Israel's Orthodox Vegan Movement – Tablet Magazine|website=www.tabletmag.com|language=en|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness.

Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?"&lt;ref name="fool"/&gt; The Sikh [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]], or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.{{r|hsp|fool}}

==Environment and diet==
{{Main|Environmental vegetarianism}}
Environmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through [[factory farming]], is [[environmentalism|environmentally]] [[sustainable development|unsustainable]]. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a "massive scale" to air and water pollution, [[land degradation]], climate change, and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. The initiative concluded that "the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM |title=Livestock's Long Shadow – Environmental issues and options |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents.  Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;EPA.  2011.  Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990–2009.  United States Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA 430-R-11-005.  459 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.

Meat produced in a laboratory (called [[in vitro meat]]) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926635.600-comment-growing-m |title=Comment: Lab-grown meat could ease food shortage |last=Olsson |first=Anna |periodical= New Scientist |publication-date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions of vegetarians vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17113214 |title=Could vegetarians eat a 'test tube' burger? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: "A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/nov/11/food.climatechange |title=Why eating less meat could cut global warming &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date=November 10, 2007 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, [[Ghent]], Belgium, was reported to be "the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a "weekly meatless day". Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report. Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and "veggie street maps" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants. In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly ''veggiedag'' ("vegetarian day") too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason |first=Chris |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Belgian city plans 'veggie' days |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor conditions and diet==
Some groups, such as [[PETA]], promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary [[meat industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.goveg.com/workerrights.asp|title=Killing for a Living: How the Meat Industry Exploits Workers|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing.&lt;ref name="labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/usa0105/4.htm |title=Worker Health and Safety in the Meat and Poultry Industry |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="labor2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncrlc.com/academic-SR-webpages/food_safety.html |title=Food Safety, the Slaughterhouse, and Rights |publisher=Ncrlc.com |date=March 30, 2004 |accessdate=August 9, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071223175929/http://www.ncrlc.com/academic-SR-webpages/food_safety.html |archivedate = December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="labor3"&gt;[http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/contentPages/docs/meatCultureLiteratureReviewV81.pdf Positive Safety Culture.

==Economics and diet==
Similar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of [[economic vegetarianism]]. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious [[simple living]] strategy or just out of necessity. According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], "Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517050751/http://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02/ |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Prejudice researcher Gordon Hodson observes that vegetarians and vegans frequently face [[discrimination]] where eating meat is held as a cultural norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prejudice Against "Group X" (Asexuals)|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/without-prejudice/201209/prejudice-against-group-x-asexuals|publisher=[[Psychology Today]]|last=Hodson|first=Gordon|date=September 1, 2012|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
A 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that "of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joanne McAllister Smart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iggAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The gender gap: if you're a vegetarian, odds are you're a woman. Why? |page=74|issue=210|issn=0164-8497|date=February 1995 |journal=Vegetarian Times|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies. A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 "found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls".&lt;ref name="Babies"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/869696.stm |title='More girl babies' for vegetarians |publisher=BBC News |date=August 7, 2000 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Collins of the [[British Dietetic Association]] has dismissed this as a "statistical fluke" given that it is actually the male's [[XY sex-determination system|genetic contribution]] which determines the sex of a baby.{{r|Babies}}

'''''Viva Piñata: Party Animals''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Krome Studios]] for the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox 360]] [[video game console]], part of the ''[[Viva Piñata]]'' series. The game was announced in July, 2007, and was released on October 30, 2007 in North America, November 15, 2007 in Australia, November 16, 2007 in Europe, and December 6, 2007 in Japan.

Unlike the original ''Viva Piñata'', ''Party Animals'' is based on elements from [[Viva Piñata (TV series)|the television show]], including its characters and voices. Furthermore, the title provides a [[minigame]] based experience, similar to the ''[[Mario Party (series)|Mario Party]]'' series, rather than the [[Sandbox (video games)|sandbox]] environment of the original. There are over 40 minigames, as well as [[Racing game#Kart racing games|kart-style]] races which are conducted on foot.

==Gameplay==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VP Party gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|''Viva Piñata: Party Animals'' gameplay screenshot.]] --&gt;
Similar to other casual Xbox 360 titles such as ''[[Fuzion Frenzy 2]]'', ''Viva Piñata: Party Animals'' is framed as a [[game show]], where contestants compete against each other while announcers provide colorful commentary.

A game of ''Party Animals'' consists of three or more race events, each followed by one or more randomly selected challenge mini-games (depending on selected game length).  The goal is to be the player who has earned the most candy ("Candiosity") after the final challenge is completed.  Games always feature four player characters, although only one of these need be human-controlled.  Multiple individuals can play on a single console (causing races to be conducted split-screen), or players can play online via [[Xbox Live]].

Players earn candy based on their performance during the challenge mini-games, with fixed awards for first, second, third, and fourth places.  The races themselves do not earn players candy, but instead determine a bonus which influences the winnings from the challenge events which follow.  As a result, candy awards are always a combination of these two separate placements, with players required to do well in both event types to guarantee overall victory.

There are eight playable characters: Hudson Horstachio, Paulie Pretztail, Fergy Fudgehog and Franklin Fizzlybear, as well as their newly introduced female counterparts.

==Development==
''Viva Piñata: Party Animals'' was developed by a team of roughly 60 people at Krome Studios, the first Australian studio to develop a first-party game for Microsoft.&lt;ref name="ignau"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/809/809744p1.html | title=Viva Piñata: Party Animals AU Interview | last=Kolan | first=Patrick | publisher=IGN AU | date=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The involvement of [[Rare (company)|Rare]], responsible for the original ''Viva Piñata'', was limited to supplying artwork and information about the game's visual style, while Krome retained full control over the design.&lt;ref name="ignau" /&gt;

When asked why the studio was chosen, Microsoft VP Shane Kim explained, "They've got a long history in the industry and we have a ton of respect for their work", referring to Krome's previous efforts on series such as ''[[Ty the Tasmanian Tiger]]'' and ''[[Spyro the Dragon (series)|Spyro the Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name="gamespotqa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/strategy/vivapinatapartyanimals/news.html?sid=6174823 | title=E3 '07 Q&amp;A: Microsoft's Shane Kim | last=Sinclair | first=Brendan | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | date=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same interview, Kim also noted that the ''Viva Piñata'' franchise was important to the success of the Xbox 360 in the casual game space.  He summarized, "Our aspiration is to win this generation, and in order to do that, we know we have to appeal beyond the core gamer segment".&lt;ref name="gamespotqa" /&gt;

''Viva Piñata: Party Animals'' was not particularly well received by the gaming press, despite the appreciation of its vibrant visuals.  [[IGN]] criticized the fact that many of the mini-games were simply minor variants of each other, with most being aimed at young children.  The review remarks that, "A few of them will be enjoyable for those under the age of seven, but if you're any older than that there's absolutely no challenge to be found within Party Animals".&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;  The [[GameSpot]] review similarly frowned upon the lack of true variety, noting that "... the [minigame] variants end up feeling so similar to one another that the game might as well just have six minigames".&lt;ref name="gamespot" /&gt;

Somewhat more positive remarks were earned from [[TeamXbox]], where the reviewer felt that the better mini-games balanced out the poorer ones.  The review concludes, "The wide range of minigames almost guarantees everyone will find at least something they like in the title, and I’ve yet to find anyone who didn’t get a thrill out of the game’s fast paced racing".&lt;ref name="teamxbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1415/Viva-Piata-Party-Animals/p2/|title=Viva Piñata: Party Animals Review (Xbox 360)|last=Chapman|first=David|publisher=[[TeamXbox]]|date=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Viva Piñata: Trouble in Paradise''''' is a 2008 [[simulation video game]] in the ''[[Viva Piñata]]'' series for the [[Xbox 360]]. Developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]], the game builds atop [[Viva Piñata (video game)|its predecessor]], in which the player tends a garden and the [[piñata]] creatures that come to live there. New features to the series include a [[cooperative multiplayer]] mode, a new plot, additional types of piñata creatures, [[Xbox Live Vision Camera]] support, and two new areas for capturing piñatas.

Microsoft considered ''Viva Piñata'' a success and the sequel's development team sought to make a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks, but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. ''Trouble in Paradise'' was later included in the developer's 2015 [[Xbox One]] retrospective compilation, ''[[Rare Replay]]''.

== Gameplay ==

[[File:VP2-2cursors.jpg|thumb|Two players, indicated by the shovel and watering can, gardening in cooperation]]

Apart from a few new features, ''Trouble in Paradise'' is nearly identical to its predecessor, the 2006 ''[[Viva Piñata (video game)|Viva Piñata]]'', in gameplay: The player acts as a gardener whose land is visited by piñata creatures.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt; The creatures are stylized like piñatas but have the qualities of animals. Creature types include ladybugs, crabs, geckos, gorillas, and vultures, among others. The player plants seeds, tends to plants, and digs ponds within the garden's boundaries.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p1"/&gt; New types of piñata creatures visit and eventually come to reside in the garden when certain prerequisites are met. For instance, a piñata might be attracted to a garden with a specific plant, type of piñata, or amount of soil. The player uses an in-game encyclopedia to learn each piñata type's preferences, which grow in complexity: advanced creatures require more transformative changes to the garden or many other piñatas to eat.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; When multiple piñatas are satisfied, the player can "romance" two to make a baby piñata. The player continues to cultivate the garden and the piñata creatures to grow in experience level and unlock upgrades in garden size and gardening tools.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt; An in-game store sells seeds, items, and upgrades.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; Both games are rendered in the same [[game engine|engine]] and their supporting casts are the same. The first game's online piñata gifting feature returns in ''Trouble in Paradise''.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt;

Atop the previous formula is a new plot, a [[cooperative multiplayer]] mode, [[Xbox Live Vision Camera]] support, 32 new types of piñata creatures, and two separate areas to trap piñatas.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; These latter areas—the Dessert [[Desert]] and Piñ[[arctic]]—let the player set traps for wandering piñatas to bait, capture, and return to the garden. At a later player experience level, the player can add sand and ice to their main garden for the piñatas. In the new plot, the player must repopulate a database of piñata information that has been maliciously erased.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt; ''Trouble in Paradise'' includes new challenges in which the player finds and indulges a specific piñata with actions it likes such that the piñata can be sent happily to a party somewhere around the world. The game also adds [[fashion show]] and [[side-scrolling]] racing [[minigame]]s.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; A new "Trick Stick" lets players teach piñatas to perform new tricks.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p1"/&gt; Up to four players can join together on [[Xbox Live]] to garden in the same plot. The plot's owner can set restrictions on what other players can access. Up to two players can join together locally on the same Xbox 360. The game's additional "Just for Fun" mode is designed for younger children by eliminating monetary restrictions, evil piñatas, and ruffian characters that might otherwise frustrate the player.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; These malicious "sour" piñatas, who try to poison the other piñatas, can be tamed to peaceably join the player's garden.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; Players can use the Xbox Live Vision Camera to scan collectible cards and unlock piñatas and items. New controls were added to streamline the player's interface interactions, and a leaderboard added for players to compare their progress.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt;

== Development ==

As Rare released the original ''Viva Piñata'' for the Xbox 360 in 2006, its development team saw it as incomplete. The developers had cut partial ideas from the release to meet their deadlines.&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p1"/&gt; Rare's [[Gregg Mayles]] said that the game sold well and steadily on par with their expectations&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p2"/&gt; and Xbox's [[Phil Spencer (business executive)|Phil Spencer]] added that the game was considered a success inside the company.&lt;ref name="1UP: makes sense"/&gt; The team incorporated player feedback and worked towards a "more definitive version" of the original.&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p1"/&gt; Mayles left the team to work on ''[[Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts]]'' and Justin Cook became the team's lead designer.&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare: paradise p1"/&gt; The sequel was built atop the original and the developers re-used many of the tools from the original game's development.&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare: paradise p2"/&gt; In both the sequel and the original, the development team volunteered to record the sounds used for the piñatas.&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare: paradise p2"/&gt; One of the team's new ideas was "Piñata Vision", a feature that detects printed cards via the [[Xbox camera]] to change the in-game environment (e.g., adding piñatas or altering the weather).&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare: paradise p1"/&gt; Near the time of the sequel's release, Rare's Mayles figured that the team would likely not have enough new gameplay ideas to warrant a sequel to ''Trouble in Paradise'',&lt;ref name="1UP Mayles p1"/&gt; though Cook said that he would work on the game's shop interface had he more time.&lt;ref name="Mundo Rare: paradise p3"/&gt; ''Trouble in Paradise'' released in early September 2008.{{refn|The game released in North America on September 2, 2008, and Europe three days later.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar rev"/&gt;}} The two ''Viva Piñata'' console games were later re-released in the 2015 compilation of Rare games, ''[[Rare Replay]]'',&lt;ref name="Polygon: ranked"/&gt; but the server that handled their piñata sharing features had been shut down by that time.&lt;ref name="RFDB interview"/&gt;

The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=Metacritic/&gt; Critics had found its predecessor surprisingly engaging,&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGM rev"/&gt; and thought that ''Trouble in Paradise''{{'s}} additions made it the definitive ''Viva Piñata'' release.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; Critics agreed that the changes made the game friendlier for new players and children.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGM rev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p2"/&gt; They appreciated the new game's improvements, but some were disappointed that the base game was essentially unchanged. Reviewers considered ''Trouble in Paradise'' to be an expansion of the original game rather than a unique sequel.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGM rev"/&gt;

Critics praised ''Trouble in Paradise''{{'s}} new features.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; Mc Shea (''[[GameSpot]]'') thought that the sequel's in-game challenges resolved the core issue of the original game—the lack of motivation to continue breeding new species, whereas the challenges direct players to collect new species. He appreciated the two new trap areas for adding to the game's variety of characters, though he did not find the actual laying of traps and transport of piñatas interesting.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; Geddes (''[[IGN]]'') thought that it felt wrong but oddly satisfying to put piñatas in captivity. He considered the trap areas a good idea but unwelcome as another obstacle in the animal acquisition process.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt; Geddes praised ''Trouble in Paradise''{{'s}} cooperative features, but found local cooperative to lose most of the benefits of efficient multitasking.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; Mc Shea (''GameSpot'') on the other hand felt that it was strange to be on either side of the cooperative gardening experience, which lacks the game's creative element when the visitor is directed by the garden's owner.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; Bramwell (''[[Eurogamer]]'') saw a lack of depth in the online gameplay, both in feelings of connections with others and in how online matchmaking became a brief "show and tell" of a garden instead of a cross-exchange like in ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' or ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p2"/&gt; Reviewers agreed that cooperative was useful for introducing new players to the game.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt;

Reviewers considered some of the smaller additions useful and others gimmicky.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; Critics appreciated the release's time-saving interface tweaks and overall pacing,&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGM rev"/&gt; but thought, for instance, that the vision camera integration added little to the game.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; While ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' had wanted more development of the story,&lt;ref name="EGM rev"/&gt; Mc Shea (''GameSpot'') was grateful that the story remained in the background of the game.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;  While ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' wrote that [[loading screen|loading times]] had been improved,&lt;ref name="EGM rev"/&gt; Geddes (''IGN'') considered them "frustratingly long".&lt;ref name="IGN: review p1"/&gt; Considering the previous game's slow start, Tom Bramwell (''Eurogamer'') thought that ''Trouble in Paradise'' did a better job of introducing the player to the world by pre-loading player gardens with animals, plants, and decorations, and offering a tutorial.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p1"/&gt; He wondered whether the game went too far, from too slow to hyperactive.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p2"/&gt;

Reviewers praised ''Trouble in Paradise''{{'s}} bright visuals and cute characters.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; Mc Shea (''GameSpot'') was impressed by the game's visuals and wrote that players would continue playing the game if only to unlock nuanced, animated video of piñatas acting cute during major life milestones. Mc Shea recalled the human helper characters as an exception, who were off-putting with creepy masks and "offensive" voice acting.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; ''IGN'' praised the game's surround sound but not its soundtrack's composition,&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; and Mc Shea (''GameSpot'') considered the voice acting harsh against the game's otherwise tranquil mood.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;

Mc Shea (''GameSpot'') called ''Trouble in Paradise'' "a safe sequel to a great game".&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; Ultimately, Geddes (''IGN'') wrote that an expansion pack on the original game would have served the same function.&lt;ref name="IGN: review p2"/&gt; Even with ''Trouble in Paradise''{{'s}} upgraded controls, Bramwell (''Eurogamer'') preferred the precision of the [[Nintendo DS]] version's stylus or of a [[computer mouse]], and thought the game could be further simplified.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p1"/&gt; However, he saw the new release as a more polished opportunity to attract an audience that was not originally convinced by the reception of the first game.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer rev p2"/&gt; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' said that players that hated the original game would not be swayed by the sequel.&lt;ref name="EGM rev"/&gt; ''GameSpot''{{'s}} 2008 year in review staff nominated ''Trouble in Paradise'' as the "Best Game No One Played", which it did not win.&lt;ref name="GameSpot's 2008"/&gt;
