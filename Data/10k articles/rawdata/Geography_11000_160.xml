      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1589">'''Aeningia''' is an island mentioned in ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|the Natural History]]'' by [[Pliny the Elder]], written in the 1st century CE. According to Pliny, Aeningia was inhabited by [[Sarmatians]] (Sarmati), [[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]] (Venedi), [[Scirii]] (Sciri) and [[Hirri]], bordering [[Vistula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.nh4.html C. Plinii natvralis historiae liber IV]. In Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeningia was probably a corrupted form of ''Aestingia'' ([[Estonia|Estland]]) and referred to the area of the present-day [[Baltic states]] and northern [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/geohist/0036.html 28 (Geografiens och de geografiska upptäckternas historia)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early European historians interpreted the name as a corrupt form of [[Finland]], constructing a hypothetical [[Latin]] name ''[[Finningia]]'' as the original name. This probably originated from [[Olaus Magnus]] who was the first to place ''Finningia olim regnum'' on the map in 1539&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bell.lib.umn.edu/map/OLAUS/carta.html Olaus Magnus' map of Scandinavia]. See section F.&lt;/ref&gt; or from [[Jacob Ziegler]], who placed Finlandia and Einingia next to each other in present-day southwestern Finland in 1532.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/English/map/map4.html Jacob Ziegler's map of Scandinavia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615201610/http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/English/map/map4.html |date=2008-06-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=June 2016}}
A '''''bakhsh''''' ({{lang-fa|بخش}}, {{transl|fa|''baxš''}}) is a type of [[administrative division]] of [[Iran]]. While sometimes translated as [[county]], it should be more accurately translated as district, similar to a [[township (United States)|township in the United States]] or a [[Districts of England|district of England]].

In Iran, each ''[[ostan (Geography)|ostan]]'' or province consists of several ''[[Counties of Iran|shahrestan]]'' or counties ({{Lang-fa|شهرستان }} ''šahrestân''), and each ''shahrestan'' has one or more ''bakhsh'' or districts.&lt;ref name="Law1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwillim Law|title=Administrative Subdivisions of Countries: A Comprehensive World Reference, 1900 through 1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXCeCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|date=1 October 1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0447-3|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''bakhsh'' usually consists of dozens of villages with a central town or city. The official governor of a ''bakhsh'' is called a ''bakhshdar'', which is the head of ''bakhshdari'' office.

There are usually a few cities ({{lang-fa|شهر}}, {{transl|fa|''šahr''}}) and ''dehestan'' (municipalities or rural agglomerations; {{lang-fa|دهستان}}, {{transl|fa|''dehestân''}}) in each county. Dehestans are a collection of a number of villages and their surrounding lands. One of the cities of the county is appointed as the capital of each county.

To better understand such subdivisions, the following table may be helpful: Assume that province P is divided into two counties: A and B. County A has 3 districts: Central, X, and Y. The Central district is the district that contains City M, the capital of the county. Each district might contain one or more cities or one or more Rural Agglomerations (RA). In this example, the Central district contains City M, City N, and RA T composed of the villages V1, V2, V3, and V4, in turn; district X contains City O and RA U; and district Y has no cities and one RA V. The minimal county consists of only one city as the only district, named Central. The county B in the following table is of such type, containing only one city Q.

{{Special characters}}

A '''barbarian''' is a [[human]] who is perceived to be either [[Civilization|uncivilized]] or [[Primitive culture|primitive]]. The designation is usually applied as [[generalization]] based on a popular [[stereotype]]; barbarians can be any member of a [[nation]] judged by some to be less civilized or orderly (such as a [[tribal society]]), but may also be part of a certain "primitive" [[culture|cultural group]] (such as [[nomad]]s) or [[social class]] (such as [[bandit]]s) both within and outside one's own nation. Alternatively, they may instead be admired and romanticised as [[noble savage]]s. In idiomatic or figurative usage, a "barbarian" may also be an individual reference to a brutal, cruel, warlike, and insensitive person.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary'', 1972, pg. 149, Simon &amp; Schuster Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originates from the {{lang-el|βάρβαρος}} (''barbaros'' pl. βάρβαροι ''barbaroi''), which in turn originates from the languages of early [[Anatolia]]n nations that were heard by the Greeks as "bar... bar..." In [[Ancient Greece]], the Greeks used the term towards those who did not speak Greek and follow classical Greek customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America | publisher=Penguin Press HC | author=Amy Chua, Jed Rubenfeld | year=2014 |page=121| isbn=978-1594205460}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Empire|Ancient Rome]], the Romans used the term towards non-Romans such as the [[Germanic peoples|Germanics]], [[Celts]], [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Berbers]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and [[Sarmatians]]. In the [[early modern period]] and sometimes later, the Byzantine Greeks used it for the [[Turkish people|Turks]], in a clearly [[pejorative]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Εκδοτική Αθηνών, ο Ελληνισμός υπό ξένη κυριαρχία: Τουρκοκρατία, Λατινοκρατία, 1980, page 34 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Marozzi, The Way of Herodotus: Travels with the Man who Invented History, 2010, pages 311–315&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek]] name [[wikt:βάρβαρος|βάρβαρος]] (''barbaros''), "barbarian", was an [[antonym]] for [[wikt:πολίτης|πολίτης]] (''politēs''), "citizen" (from πόλις – ''[[polis]]'', "city-state"). The earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀞𐀫}}, ''pa-pa-ro'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=519 Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kramer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iDYObRmfLikC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22pa-pa-ro%22+Linear+B&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCsAT-24IYf5sgb_xPgT&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pa-pa-ro%22%20Linear%20B&amp;f=false ''Die Sprachbezeichnungen 'Latinus' und 'Romanus' im Lateinischen und Romanischen''], Erich Schmidt Verlag, 1998, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks used the term ''barbarian'' for all non-Greek-speaking peoples, including the [[Egyptians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Medes]] and [[Phoenicians]], emphasizing their otherness. According to Greek writers, this was because the language they spoke sounded to Greeks like [[gibberish]] represented by the sounds "bar..bar..;"  the alleged root of the word [[wikt:βάρβαρος|βάρβαρος]], which is an echomimetic or [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] word. However, in various occasions, the term was also used by Greeks, especially the [[Athens|Athenians]], to deride other Greek tribes and states (such as Epirotes, Eleans, Macedonians, Boeotians and Aeolic-speakers) but also fellow Athenians, in a pejorative and politically motivated manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2319347 |title=The term '''barbaros''', ''"A Greek-English Lexicon"'' (Liddell &amp; Scott), on Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delante Bravo|first=Chrostopher|title=Chirping like the swallows: Aristophanes' portrayals of the barbarian "other"|year=2012|publisher=ProQuest, UMI Dissertation Publishing|isbn=978-1-248-96599-3|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baracchi|first=Claudia|title=The Bloomsbury Companion to Aristotle|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0873-9|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siculus Diodorus, Ludwig August Dindorf, Diodori Bibliotheca historica – Volume 1 – Page 671&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the term also carried a cultural dimension to its dual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's "Life of Pyrrhos" records his apprehensive remark on seeing a Roman army taking the field against him in disciplined order: "These are not barbarians."[http://www.globaled.org/nyworld/materials/greek2.html Foreigners and Barbarians (adapted from ''Daily Life of the Ancient Greeks'')] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063551/http://www.globaled.org/nyworld/materials/greek2.html |date=June 29, 2011 }}, The American Forum for Global Education, 2000. &lt;blockquote&gt;"The status of being a foreigner, as the Greeks understood the term does not permit any easy definition. Primarily it signified such peoples as the Persians and Egyptians, whose languages were unintelligible to the Greeks, but it could also be used of Greeks who spoke in a different dialect and with a different accent&amp;nbsp;... Prejudice toward Greeks on the part of Greeks was not limited to those who lived on the fringes of the Greek world. The Boeotians, inhabitants of central Greece, whose credentials were impeccable, were routinely mocked for their stupidity and gluttony. Ethnicity is a fluid concept even at the best of times. When it suited their purposes, the Greeks also divided themselves into Ionians and Dorians. The distinction was emphasized at the time of the Peloponnesian War, when the Ionian Athenians fought against the Dorian Spartans. The Spartan general Brasidas even taxed the Athenians with cowardice on account of their Ionian lineage. In other periods of history the Ionian-Dorian divide carried much less weight."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton. ''Athens: Its Rise and Fall''. Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4191-0808-5}}, pp. 9–10. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Whether the Pelasgi were anciently a foreign or Grecian tribe, has been a subject of constant and celebrated discussion. Herodotus, speaking of some settlements held to be Pelaigic, and existing in his time, terms their language 'barbarous;' but Mueller, nor with argument insufficient, considers that the expression of the historian would apply only to a peculiar dialect; and the hypothesis is sustained by another passage in Herodotus, in which he applies to certain Ionian dialects the same term as that with which he stigmatizes the language of the Pelasgic settlements. In corroboration of Mueller's opinion, we may also observe, that the 'barbarous-tongued' is an epithet applied by Homer to the Carians, and is rightly construed by the ancient critics as denoting a dialect mingled and unpolished, certainly not foreign. Nor when the Agamemnon of Sophocles upbraids Teucer with 'his barbarous tongue,' would any scholar suppose that Teucer is upbraided with not speaking Greek; he is upbraided with speaking Greek inelegantly and rudely. It is clear that they who continued with the least adulteration a language in its earliest form, would seem to utter a strange and unfamiliar jargon to ears accustomed to its more modern construction."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The verb {{lang|el|βαρβαρίζω}} (''barbarízō'') in [[ancient Greek]] meant to behave or talk like a barbarian, or to hold with the barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dbarbari%2Fzw βαρβαρίζω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] (''Statesman'' 262de) rejected the Greek–barbarian dichotomy as a logical absurdity on just such grounds: dividing the world into Greeks and non-Greeks told one nothing about the second group, yet Plato used the term barbarian frequently in his seventh letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/seventh_letter.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; The Seventh Letter by Plato |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Homer]]'s works, the term appeared only once (''[[Iliad]]'' 2.867), in the form {{lang|el|βαρβαρόφωνος}} ({{lang|el|barbarophonos}}) ("of incomprehensible speech"), used of the [[Carians]] fighting for [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]]. In general, the concept of ''barbaros'' did not figure largely in archaic literature before the 5th century [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Jonathan. ''Hellenicity'', p. 111, {{ISBN|0-226-31329-8}}. "There is at the elite level at least no hint during the archaic period of this sharp dichotomy between Greek and Barbarian or the derogatory and the stereotypical representation of the latter that emerged so clearly from the 5th century."&lt;/ref&gt; Still it has been suggested that "barbarophonoi" in the ''Iliad'' signifies not those who spoke a non-Greek language but simply those who spoke Greek badly.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Jonathan. ''Hellenicity'', p. 111, {{ISBN|0-226-31329-8}}. "Given the relative familiarity of the Karians to the Greeks, it has been suggested that barbarophonoi in the Iliad signifies not those who spoke a non-Greek language but simply those who spoke Greek badly."&lt;/ref&gt;

A change occurred in the connotations of the word after the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] in the first half of the 5th century BC. Here a hasty coalition of Greeks defeated the vast [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. Indeed, in the Greek of this period 'barbarian' is often used expressly to refer to Persians, who were enemies of the Greeks in this war.&lt;ref&gt;Tsetskhladze, Gocha R. ''Ancient Greeks West and East'', 1999, p. 60, {{ISBN|90-04-10230-2}}. "a barbarian from a distinguished nation which given the political circumstances of the time might well mean a Persian."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans used the term ''barbarus'' for uncivilised people, opposite to Greek or Roman, and in fact, it became a common term to refer to all foreigners among Romans after Augustus age (as, among the Greeks, after the Persian wars, the Persians), including the Germanic peoples, Persians, Gauls, Phoenicians and Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dbarbarus barbarus], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''barbaros'' was the etymological source for many words meaning "barbarian", including English ''barbarian'', which was first recorded in 16th century [[Middle English]].

A word ''barbara-'' is also found in the [[Sanskrit]] of ancient India, with the primary meaning of "stammering" implying someone with an unfamiliar language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=barbara&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= Barbara  (entry)] SpokenSanskrit.de&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Apte (1920), [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/AEScan/AEScanjpg/ae0167-foible.jpg Apte English–Sanskrit Dictionary], "Fool" entry, 3rd ed., Pune&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUKaou4KcMC A Sanskrit–English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages], Monier Monier-Williams (1898), Ernst Leumann, Carl Cappeller, pub. Asian Educational Services (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''barbaros'' is related to Sanskrit ''barbaras'' (stammering).&lt;ref&gt;Onions, C.T. (1966), edited by, The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, page 74, [[The Clarendon Press]], Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; This Indo-European root is also found in Latin ''balbus'' for "stammering" and Czech blblati "to stammer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=barbarian&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Barbarian], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aramaic, Old Persian and Arabic context, the root refers to "babble confusedly". It appears as ''barbary'' or in Old French ''barbarie'', itself derived from the Arabic ''Barbar'', ''Berber'', which is an ancient Arabic term for the North African inhabitants west of Egypt. The Arabic word might be ultimately from Greek ''barbaria''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Barbary&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Barbary], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
[[File:Germaniae antiquae libri tres, Plate 17, Clüver.jpg|thumb|"[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors" as depicted in [[Philipp Clüver]]'s ''Germania Antiqua'' (1616)]]

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines five meanings of the noun ''barbarian'', including an obsolete [[Barbary]] usage.
* '''1.''' ''Etymologically'', A foreigner, one whose language and customs differ from the speaker's.
* '''2.''' ''Hist''. '''a.''' One not a Greek. '''b.''' One living outside the pale of the Roman Empire and its civilization, applied especially to the northern nations that overthrew them. '''c.''' One outside the pale of [[Christian civilization]]. '''d.''' With the Italians of the Renaissance: One of a nation outside of Italy.
* '''3.''' A rude, wild, uncivilized person. '''b.''' Sometimes distinguished from ''savage'' (perh. with a glance at 2). '''c.''' Applied by the Chinese contemptuously to foreigners.
* '''4.''' An uncultured person, or one who has no sympathy with literary culture.
* †'''5.''' A native of Barbary. [See [[Barbary Coast]].] ''Obs''. †'''b.''' [[Barbary pirates]] &amp; [[Barb horse|A Barbary horse]]. ''Obs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2009, 2nd ed., v. 4.0, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''OED'' ''barbarous'' entry summarizes the semantic history. "The sense-development in ancient times was (with the Greeks) 'foreign, non-Hellenic,' later 'outlandish, rude, brutal'; (with the Romans) 'not Latin nor Greek,' then 'pertaining to those outside the Roman Empire'; hence 'uncivilized, uncultured,' and later 'non-Christian,' whence 'Saracen, heathen'; and generally 'savage, rude, savagely cruel, inhuman.'"

=== Historical developments ===
[[File:Roman collared slaves - Ashmolean Museum.jpg|thumb|Slaves in chains, relief found in Smyrna (present day [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]]), 200 AD]]
Greek attitudes towards "barbarians" developed in parallel with the growth of [[chattel slavery]] - especially in [[Athens]]. Although the enslavement of Greeks for non-payment of [[debt]]s continued in most Greek states, Athens banned this practice under [[Solon]] in the early 6th century BC. Under the [[Athenian democracy]] established ca. 508 BC, [[slavery in antiquity|slavery]] came into use on a scale never before seen among the Greeks. Massive concentrations of slaves worked under especially brutal conditions in the silver mines at [[Laurium|Laureion]] in south-eastern Attica after the discovery of a major vein of silver-bearing ore there in 483 BC, while the phenomenon of skilled slave craftsmen producing manufactured goods in small factories and workshops became increasingly common.

Furthermore, slave-ownership no longer became the preserve of the rich: all but the poorest of Athenian households came to have slaves in order to supplement the work of their free members. The slaves of Athens that had "barbarian" origins were coming especially from lands around the [[Black Sea]] such as [[Thrace]] and [[Taurica]] ([[Crimea]]), while [[Lydia]]ns, [[Phrygians]] and [[Carians]] came from [[Asia Minor]]. [[Aristotle]] (''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' 1.2–7; 3.14) characterises barbarians as slaves by nature.

From this period, words like ''barbarophonos'', cited above from Homer, came into use not only for the sound of a foreign language but also for foreigners who spoke Greek improperly. In the Greek language, the word ''[[logos]]'' expressed both the notions of "language" and "reason", so Greek-speakers readily conflated speaking poorly with stupidity.

Further changes occurred in the connotations of ''barbari''/''barbaroi'' in [[Late Antiquity]],&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Ralph W. Mathison, ''Roman Aristocrats in Barbarian Gaul: Strategies for Survival in an Age of Transition'' (Austin) 1993, pp. 1–6, 39–49; Gerhart B. Ladner, "On Roman attitudes towards barbarians in late antiquity" ''Viator'' '''77''' (1976), pp. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[bishop]]s and [[Catholicos|''catholikoi'']] were appointed to sees connected to cities among the "civilized" ''gentes barbaricae'' such as in [[Armenia]] or [[Persia]], whereas bishops were appointed to supervise entire peoples among the less settled.

Eventually the term found a hidden meaning through the [[folk etymology]] of [[Cassiodorus]] (c. 485 – c. 585). He stated that the word ''barbarian'' was "made up of ''barba'' (beard) and ''rus'' (flat land); for barbarians did not live in cities, making their abodes in the fields like wild animals".&lt;ref&gt;Arno Borst. ''Medieval Worlds: Barbarians, Heretics and Artists in the Middle Ages''. London: Polity, 1991, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenic stereotypes===
[[File:Head of a barbarian Athens.jpg|thumb|right|Head of a barbarian, Probably a [[Germanic Kingship|Client King]]. [[Acropolis Museum]].]]

From classical origins the Hellenic stereotype of barbarism evolved: barbarians are like children, unable to speak or reason properly, cowardly, effeminate, luxurious, cruel, unable to control their appetites and desires, politically unable to govern themselves. Writers voiced these stereotypes with much shrillness - [[Isocrates]] in the 4th century B.C., for example,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} called for a war of conquest against [[Persian empire|Persia]] as a [[panacea]] for Greek problems.

However, the disparaging Hellenic stereotype of barbarians did not totally dominate Hellenic attitudes. [[Xenophon]] (died 354 B.C.), for example, wrote the ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', a laudatory fictionalised account of [[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of the [[Persian Empire]], effectively a [[utopia]]n text. In his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', Xenophon's accounts of the Persians and other non-Greeks who he knew or encountered show few traces of the stereotypes.

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Prodicus of Ceos calls "barbarian" the [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolian]] dialect that [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plato |title=Protagoras |isbn=978-1604506365 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AF1VViQLWDQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Pittacus%20barbarian%20dialect%20Protagoras&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} [Cited in [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The renowned [[orator]] [[Demosthenes]] (384–322 B.C.) made derogatory comments in his speeches, using the word "barbarian".

In the [[Bible|Bible's]] [[New Testament]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] (from [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]) - lived about A.D. 5 to about A.D. 67) uses the word ''barbarian'' in its Hellenic sense to refer to non-Greeks (''[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:14''), and he also uses it to characterise one who merely speaks a different language (''[[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 14:11'').

About a hundred years after Paul's time, [[Lucian]] – a native of [[Samosata]], in the former kingdom of [[Commagene]], which had been absorbed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made part of the province of [[History of Syria|Syria]] – used the term "barbarian" to describe himself. Because he was a noted satirist, this could have indicated self-deprecating irony. It might also have suggested descent from Samosata's original [[Semitic people|Semitic]] population – who were likely called "barbarians by later Hellenistic, [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] settlers", and might have eventually taken up this appellation themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_intro.htm Harmon, A. M. "Lucian of Samosata: Introduction and Manuscripts."] in Lucian, ''Works''. Loeb Classical Library (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Sidwell, introduction to Lucian: ''Chattering Courtesans and Other Sardonic Sketches'' (Penguin Classics, 2005) p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

The term retained its standard usage in the [[Greek language]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]]; [[Byzantine Greeks]] used it widely until the fall of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], (later named the [[Byzantine Empire]]) in the 15th century (1453 with the fall of capital city [[Constantinople]]}.

[[Cicero]] (106-43 BC) described the mountain area of inner [[Sardinia]] as "a land of barbarians", with these inhabitants also known by the manifestly pejorative term ''latrones mastrucati'' ("thieves with a rough garment in wool").
The region, still known as "[[Barbagia]]" (in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] ''Barbàgia'' or ''Barbàza''), preserves this old "barbarian" designation in its name – but it no longer consciously retains "barbarian" associations: the inhabitants of the area themselves use the name naturally and unaffectedly.

===The Dying Galatian statue===
{{main article|Dying Galatian}}
[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''Dying Galatian'', [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome]]

The statue of the ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' provides some insight into the Hellenistic perception of and attitude towards "Barbarians". [[Attalus I]] of [[Pergamon]] (ruled 241-197 BC) commissioned (220s BC) a statue to celebrate his victory (ca 232 BC) over the Celtic [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]] (the bronze original is lost, but a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[marble]] copy was found in the 17th century).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Helbig, ''Führer durch die öffenlicher Sammlungen Klassischer altertümer in Rom'' (Tubingen 1963–71) vol. II, pp 240–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue depicts with remarkable realism a dying Celt warrior with a typically Celtic hairstyle and moustache. He sits on his fallen shield while a sword and other objects lie beside him. He appears to be fighting against death, refusing to accept his fate.

The statue serves both as a reminder of the Celts' defeat, thus demonstrating the might of the people who defeated them, and a memorial to their bravery as worthy adversaries. As [[H. W. Janson]] comments, the sculpture conveys the message that "they knew how to die, barbarians that they were".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Janson, "History of Art: A survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day", p. 141. H. N. Abrams, 1977. {{ISBN|0-13-389296-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utter barbarism, civilisation, and the noble savage ===
The Greeks admired [[Scythia]]ns and [[Galatia]]ns as heroic individuals – and even (as in the case of [[Anacharsis]]) as philosophers – but they regarded their culture as barbaric. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] indiscriminately characterised the various [[Germanic tribes]], the settled [[Gauls]], and the raiding [[Hun]]s as barbarians,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and subsequent classically oriented historical narratives depicted the migrations associated with the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] as the "[[barbarian invasions]]".

The Romans adapted the term in order to refer to anything that was non-Roman. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta points out that the meaning of the word "barbarous" has undergone a semantic change in modern times, after [[Michel de Montaigne]] used it to characterize the activities of the Spaniards in the New World – supposedly representatives of the "higher" European culture – as "barbarous," in a satirical essay published in the year 1580.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= On Cannibals|author= Montaigne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not the supposedly "uncivilized" Indian tribes who were "barbarous", but the conquering Spaniards. Montaigne argued that Europeans noted the barbarism of other cultures but not the crueler and more brutal actions of their own societies, particularly (in his time) during the so-called [[European wars of religion|religious wars]]. In Montaigne's view, his own people – the Europeans – were the real "barbarians". In this way, the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] argument was turned around and applied to the European invaders. With this shift in meaning, a whole literature arose in Europe that characterized the indigenous Indian peoples as innocent, and the militarily superior Europeans as "barbarous" intruders invading a paradisical world.&lt;ref&gt;

=="Barbarian" in international historical contexts==
Historically, the term ''barbarian'' has seen widespread use, in English. Many peoples have dismissed alien cultures and even rival civilizations, because they were unrecognizably strange. For instance, the nomadic [[Eurasian nomads|steppe peoples]] north of the [[Black Sea]], including the [[Pechenegs]] and the [[Kipchaks]], were called barbarians by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs |title=The Pechenegs |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115640/http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}, Steven Lowe and Dmitriy V. Ryaboy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East and North Africa===
[[File:Purchase of Christian captives from the Barbary States.jpg|thumb|Ransom of Christian slaves held in Barbary, 17th century]]

The ''[[Berber people|Berbers]]'' of [[North Africa]] were among the many peoples called "Barbarian" by the Romans; in their case, the name remained in use, having been adopted by the [[Arab]]s (see [[Berber (Etymology)|Berber etymology]]) and is still in use as the name for the non-Arabs in North Africa (though not by themselves). The geographical term [[Barbary]] or [[Barbary Coast]], and the name of the [[Barbary pirates]] based on that coast (and who were not necessarily Berbers) were also derived from it.

The term has also been used to refer to people from [[Barbary]], a region encompassing most of [[North Africa]]. The name of the region, ''Barbary,'' comes from the Arabic word ''Barbar,'' possibly from the Latin word ''barbaricum,'' meaning "land of the barbarians."

Many languages define the "Other" as those who do not speak one's language; Greek ''barbaroi'' was paralleled by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[ajam]]'' "non-Arabic speakers; non-Arabs; (especially) [[Persian people|Persians]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alam, M. Shahid (2003), "Articulating Group Differences: A Variety of Autocentrisms," ''Science &amp; Society'' 67.2, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asia===
====China====
{{Main article|Ethnic groups in Chinese history}}
{{split section|date=November 2016}}
The term "Barbarian" in traditional Chinese culture had several aspects. For one thing, Chinese has more than one historical "barbarian" [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]]. Several historical [[Chinese characters]] for non-Chinese peoples were [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|graphic pejoratives]], the character for the [[Yao people]], for instance, was changed from ''yao'' 猺 "jackal" to ''yao'' 瑤 "precious jade" in the modern period.&lt;ref&gt;More information on this Chinese system, and on how it was abolished in the 20th century, can be found in the article "The animal other: Re-naming the barbarians in 20th-century China," by Magnus Fiskesjö, Social Text 29.4 (2011) (No. 109, Special Issue, "China and the Human"), 57–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Hua–Yi distinction]] between "Chinese" and "barbarian" was based on culture and power but not on race.

Historically, the Chinese used various words for foreign ethnic groups. They include terms like 夷 ''Yi'', which is often translated as "barbarians." Despite this conventional translation, there are also other ways of translating ''Yi'' into English. Some of the examples include "foreigners,"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Morrison, ''The Dictionary of the Chinese Language'', 3 vols. (Macao: East India Company Press, 1815), 1:61 and 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt; "ordinary others,"&lt;ref&gt;Liu Xiaoyuan, ''Frontier Passages: Ethnopolitics and the Rise of Chinese Communism, 1921–1945'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004), 10–11. Liu believes the Chinese in early China did not originally think of ''Yi'' as a derogatory term.&lt;/ref&gt; "wild tribes,"&lt;ref&gt;James Legge, ''Shangshu'', "Tribute of Yu" from http://ctext.org/shang-shu/tribute-of-yu&lt;/ref&gt; "uncivilized tribes,"&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, ''Wandering on the way : early Taoist tales and parables of Chuang Tzu'' (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1998),315.&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth.

=====History and terminology=====
Chinese historical records mention what may now perhaps be termed "barbarian" peoples for over four millennia, although this considerably predates the [[Greek language]] origin of the term "barbarian", at least as is known from the thirty-four centuries of written records in the Greek language. The sinologist [[Herrlee Glessner Creel]] said, "Throughout Chinese history "the barbarians" have been a constant motif, sometimes minor, sometimes very major indeed. They figure prominently in the Shang oracle inscriptions, and the dynasty that came to an end only in 1912 was, from the Chinese point of view, barbarian."&lt;ref&gt;Creel, Herrlee G. (1970). ''The Origins of Statecraft in China''. The University of Chicago Press. p. 194. {{ISBN|0-226-12043-0}}. See "The Barbarians" chapter, pp. 194–241. Creel refers to the Shang [[Oracle bone]] inscriptions and the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC) [[Oracle bone script|oracles]] and [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]] first recorded specific Chinese [[exonyms]] for foreigners, often in contexts of warfare or tribute. King [[Wu Ding]] (r. 1250–1192 BC), for instance, fought with the  [[Guifang]] 鬼方, [[Di (Wu Hu)|Di]] 氐, and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] 羌 "barbarians."

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771–476 BC), the meanings of four exonyms were expanded. "These included Rong, Yi, Man, and Di—all general designations referring to the barbarian tribes."&lt;ref&gt;Pu Muzhou (2005). ''Enemies of Civilization: Attitudes toward Foreigners in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China''. SUNY Press. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; These ''[[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]'' 四夷 "Four Barbarians", most "probably the names of ethnic groups originally,"&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, 197"&gt;Creel (1970), 197.&lt;/ref&gt; were the Yi or [[Dongyi]] 東夷 "eastern barbarians," Man or [[Nanman]] 南蠻 "southern barbarians," Rong or [[Xirong]] 西戎 "western barbarians," and Di or [[Beidi]] 北狄 "northern barbarians." The Russian anthropologist [[Mikhail Kryukov]] concluded.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Evidently, the barbarian tribes at first had individual names, but during about the middle of the first millennium B.C., they were classified schematically according to the four cardinal points of the compass. This would, in the final analysis, mean that once again territory had become the primary criterion of the we-group, whereas the consciousness of common origin remained secondary. What continued to be important were the factors of language, the acceptance of certain forms of material culture, the adherence to certain rituals, and, above all, the economy and the way of life. Agriculture was the only appropriate way of life for the [[Huaxia|Hua-Hsia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jettmar, Karl (1983). "The Origins of Chinese Civilization: Soviet Views." In Keightley, David N., ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC The Origins of Chinese civilization]. p. 229. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Raising an army.jpg|thumb|A scene of the Chinese campaign against the [[Miao people|Miao]] in Hunan, 1795]]
The [[Chinese classics]] use compounds of these four generic names in localized "barbarian tribes" exonyms such as "west and north" ''Rongdi'', "south and east" ''Manyi'', ''Nanyibeidi'' "barbarian tribes in the south and the north," and ''Manyirongdi'' "all kinds of barbarians." Creel says the Chinese evidently came to use ''Rongdi'' and ''Manyi'' "as generalized terms denoting 'non-Chinese,' 'foreigners,' 'barbarians'," and a statement such as "the Rong and Di are wolves" (''Zuozhuan'', Min 1) is "very much like the assertion that many people in many lands will make today, that 'no foreigner can be trusted'."
&lt;blockquote&gt; The Chinese had at least two reasons for vilifying and depreciating the non-Chinese groups. On the one hand, many of them harassed and pillaged the Chinese, which gave them a genuine grievance. On the other, it is quite clear that the Chinese were increasingly encroaching upon the territory of these peoples, getting the better of them by trickery, and putting many of them under subjection. By vilifying them and depicting them as somewhat less than human, the Chinese could justify their conduct and still any qualms of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Creel (1970), 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This word ''Yi'' has both specific references, such as to ''Huaiyi'' 淮夷 peoples in the [[Huai River]] region, and generalized references to "barbarian; foreigner; non-Chinese." ''[[Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' translates ''Yi'' as "Anc[ient] barbarian tribe on east border, any border or foreign tribe."&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yutang (1972), [http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/ Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage], Chinese University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The sinologist [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]] says the name ''Yi'' "furnished the primary Chinese term for 'barbarian',"  but "Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most civilized of the non-Chinese peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Pulleyblank, E. G., (1983). "The Chinese and Their Neighbors in Prehistoric and Early Historic Times." In Keightley, David N., ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC The Origins of Chinese civilization]. p. 440. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Idealization=====
Some Chinese classics romanticize or idealize barbarians, comparable to the western [[noble savage]] construct. For instance, the Confucian ''[[Analects]]'' records:
* The Master said, The [夷狄] barbarians of the East and North have retained their princes. They are not in such a state of decay as we in China.
* The Master said, The Way makes no progress. I shall get upon a raft and float out to sea.
* The Master wanted to settle among the [九夷] Nine Wild Tribes of the East. Someone said, I am afraid you would find it hard to put up with their lack of refinement. The Master said, Were a true gentleman to settle among them there would soon be no trouble about lack of refinement.&lt;ref&gt;3/5, 5/6, 9/14, tr. by Arthur Waley (1938), ''The Analects of Confucius'', Vintage, pp. 94–5, 108, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
The translator [[Arthur Waley]] noted that, "A certain idealization of the 'noble savage' is to be found fairly often in early Chinese literature", citing the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' maxim, "When the Emperor no longer functions, learning must be sought among the 'Four Barbarians,' north, west, east, and south."&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 17, Waley (1938), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Creel said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;From ancient to modern times the Chinese attitude toward people not Chinese in culture—"barbarians"—has commonly been one of contempt, sometimes tinged with fear&amp;nbsp;... It must be noted that, while the Chinese have disparaged barbarians, they have been singularly hospitable both to individuals and to groups that have adopted Chinese culture. And at times they seem to have had a certain admiration, perhaps unwilling, for the rude force of these peoples or simpler customs.&lt;ref&gt;Creel (1970), 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a somewhat related example, [[Mencius]] believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless, and thus followed by both Hua and Yi, "[[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] was an Eastern barbarian; he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T'iao. [[King Wen]] was a Western barbarian; he was born in Ch'i Chou and died in Pi Ying. Their native places were over a thousand ''li'' apart, and there were a thousand years between them.  Yet when they had their way in the Central Kingdoms, their actions matched like the two halves of a tally.  The standards of the two sages, one earlier and one later, were identical."&lt;ref&gt;''Mencius,''D.C Lau tran. (Middlesex:Penguin Books, 1970),128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' character dictionary, defines ''yi'' 夷 as "men of the east” 東方之人也. The dictionary also informs that ''Yi'' is not dissimilar from the ''Xia'' 夏, which means Chinese. Elsewhere in the ''Shuowen Jiezi'', under the entry of ''qiang'' 羌, the term ''yi'' is associated with benevolence and human longevity. ''Yi'' countries are therefore virtuous places where people live long lives. This is why Confucius wanted to go to ''yi'' countries when the ''dao'' could not be realized in the central states.&lt;ref&gt;Xu Shen 許慎, ''Shuowen Jieji'' 說文解字 (Beijing: Zhonghua Shuju, 1963), 213, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pejorative Chinese characters=====
{{main article|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}

Some [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult derived not from the Chinese word but from the character used to write it. Take for instance, the [[Written Chinese]] transcription of ''Yao'' "the [[Yao people]]", who primarily live in the mountains of southwest China and Vietnam. When 11th-century [[Song Dynasty]] authors first transcribed the [[exonym]] ''Yao'', they insultingly chose ''yao'' 猺 "jackal" from a lexical selection of over 100 characters pronounced ''yao'' (e.g., 腰 "waist", 遙 "distant", 搖 "shake"). During a series of 20th-century Chinese [[language reform]]s, this graphic pejorative [[wikt:猺|猺]] (written with the 犭"[[Radical 94|dog/beast radical]]") "jackal; the Yao" was replaced twice; first with the invented character ''yao'' [[wikt:傜|傜]] (亻"[[Radical 9|human radical]]") "the Yao", then with ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] (玉 "[[Radical 96|jade radical]]") "precious jade; the Yao." Chinese [[orthography]] (symbols used to write a language) can provide unique opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically that do not exist alphabetically. For the Yao ethnic group, there is a difference between the transcriptions ''Yao'' 猺 "jackal" and ''Yao'' 瑤 "jade" but none between the [[Chinese romanization|romanizations]] ''Yao'' and ''Yau''.&lt;ref&gt;See Fiskesjö, "The animal other: Re-naming the barbarians in 20th-century China."&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cultural and racial barbarianism=====
[[File:Great wall of china-mutianyu 3.JPG|thumb|right|The purpose of the [[Great Wall of China]] was to stop the "barbarians" from crossing the northern border of China.]]
According to the archeologist William Meacham, it was only by the time of the late [[Shang dynasty]] that one can speak of "[[Chinese people|Chinese]]," "[[Chinese culture]]," or "Chinese civilization." "There is a sense in which the traditional view of ancient Chinese history is correct (and perhaps it originated ultimately in the first appearance of dynastic civilization): those on the fringes and outside this esoteric event were "barbarians" in that they did not enjoy (or suffer from) the fruit of civilization until they were brought into close contact with it by an imperial expansion of the civilization itself."&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, William (1983). "Origins and Development of the Yueh Coastal Neolithic: A Microcosm of Culture Change on the Mainland of East Asia." In Keightley, David N., ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC The Origins of Chinese civilization], p. 149. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar vein, Creel explained the significance of Confucian ''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' "ritual; rites; propriety".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental criterion of "Chinese-ness," anciently and throughout history, has been cultural. The Chinese have had a particular way of life, a particular complex of usages, sometimes characterized as ''li''. Groups that conformed to this way of life were, generally speaking, considered Chinese. Those that turned away from it were considered to cease to be Chinese.&amp;nbsp;... It was the process of acculturation, transforming barbarians into Chinese, that created the great bulk of the Chinese people. The barbarians of Western Chou times were, for the most part, future Chinese, or the ancestors of future Chinese. This is a fact of great importance.&amp;nbsp;... It is significant, however, that we almost never find any references in the early literature to physical differences between Chinese and barbarians. Insofar as we can tell, the distinction was purely cultural.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, 197"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dikötter says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thought in ancient China was oriented towards the world, or ''[[tianxia]]'', "all under heaven." The world was perceived as one homogenous unity named "great community" (''[[Great Unity|datong]]'') The Middle Kingdom [China], dominated by the assumption of its cultural superiority, measured outgroups according to a yardstick by which those who did not follow the "Chinese ways" were considered "barbarians." A Theory of "using the Chinese ways to transform the barbarian" as strongly advocated. It was believed that the barbarian could be culturally assimilated. In the Age of Great Peace, the barbarians would flow in and be transformed: the world would be one.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1990), "Group Definition and the Idea of 'Race' in Modern China (1793–1949)," ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' 13:3, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Pakistani academic [[M. Shahid Alam]], "The centrality of culture, rather than race, in the Chinese world view had an important corollary. Nearly always, this translated into a civilizing mission rooted in the premise that 'the barbarians could be culturally assimilated'"; namely ''laihua'' 來化 "come and be transformed" or ''Hanhua'' 漢化 "become Chinese; be sinicized."&lt;ref&gt;Alam, M. Shahid (2003), "Articulating Group Differences: A Variety of Autocentrisms," ''Science &amp; Society'' 67.2, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two millennia before the French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] wrote ''[[The Raw and the Cooked]]'', the Chinese differentiated "raw" and "cooked" categories of barbarian peoples who lived in China. The ''shufan'' 熟番 "cooked [food eating] barbarians" are sometimes interpreted as Sinicized, and the ''shengfan'' 生番 "raw [food eating] barbarians" as not Sinicized.&lt;ref&gt;An alternative interpretation emphasizing power and state control as the main distinction at play, rather than the degree of cultural assimilation, is offered in Fiskesjö, Magnus. "On the 'Raw' and the 'Cooked' barbarians of imperial China." Inner Asia 1.2 (1999), 139–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Liji]]'' gives this description.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The people of those five regions – the Middle states, and the [Rong], [Yi] (and other wild tribes around them) – had all their several natures, which they could not be made to alter. The tribes on the east were called [Yi]. They had their hair unbound, and tattooed their bodies. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the south were called Man. They tattooed their foreheads, and had their feet turned toward each other. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the west were called [Rong]. They had their hair unbound, and wore skins. Some of them did not eat grain-food. Those on the north were called [Di]. They wore skins of animals and birds, and dwelt in caves. Some of them did not eat grain-food.&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James (1885) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hNYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA229 The Li ki], Clarendon Press, part 1, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dikötter explains the close association between [[nature and nurture]]. "The ''shengfan'', literally 'raw barbarians', were considered savage and resisting. The ''shufan'', or 'cooked barbarians', were tame and submissive. The consumption of raw food was regarded as an infallible sign of savagery that affected the physiological state of the barbarian."&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (1992), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Warring States period]] texts record a belief that the respective natures of the Chinese and the barbarian were incompatible. Mencius, for instance, once stated: "I have heard of the Chinese converting barbarians to their ways, but not of their being converted to barbarian ways."&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lau (1970), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Dikötter says, "The nature of the Chinese was regarded as impermeable to the evil influences of the barbarian; no retrogression was possible. Only the barbarian might eventually change by adopting Chinese ways."&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (1992), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, different thinkers and texts convey different opinions on this issue. The prominent Tang Confucian Han Yu, for example, wrote in his essay ''Yuan Dao'' the following: "When Confucius wrote the ''Chunqiu'', he said that if the feudal lords use Yi ritual, then they should be called Yi; If they use Chinese rituals, then they should be called Chinese." Han Yu went on to lament in the same essay that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/detail.asp?id=25097 |title="孔子之作春秋也，诸侯用夷礼，则夷之；进于中国，则中国之." |publisher=Confucianism.com.cn |date=2006-10-04 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Han Yu's essay shows the possibility that the Chinese can lose their culture and become the uncivilized outsiders, and that the uncivilized outsiders have the potential to become Chinese.

After the Song Dynasty, many of China's rulers in the north were of Inner Asia ethnicities, such as Qidan, Ruzhen, and Mongols of the Liao, Jin and Yuan Dynasties, the latter ended up ruling over the entire China. Hence, the historian [[John King Fairbank]] wrote, "the influence on China of the great fact of alien conquest under the Liao-Jin-Yuan dynasties is just beginning to be explored."&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Qing Dynasty, the rulers of China adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven to rule China. At the same time, they also tried to retain their own indigenous culture.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 146–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Manchus' adoption of Han Chinese culture, most Han Chinese (though not all) did accept the Manchus as the legitimate rulers of China. Similarly, according to Fudan University historian Yao Dali, even the supposedly "patriotic" hero Wen Tianxiang of the late Song and early Yuan period did not believe the Mongol rule to be illegitimate. In fact, Wen was willing to live under Mongol rule as long as he was not forced to be a Yuan dynasty official, out of his loyalty to the Song dynasty. Yao explains that Wen chose to die in the end because he was forced to become a Yuan official. So, Wen chose death due to his loyalty to his dynasty, not because he viewed the Yuan court as a non-Chinese, illegitimate regime and therefore refused to live under their rule. Yao also says that many Chinese who were living in the Yuan-Ming transition period also shared Wen's beliefs of identifying with and putting loyalty towards one's dynasty above racial/ethnic differences. Many Han Chinese writers did not celebrate the collapse of the Mongols and the return of the Han Chinese rule in the form of the Ming dynasty government at that time. Many Han Chinese actually chose not to serve in the new Ming court at all due to their loyalty to the Yuan. Some Han Chinese also committed suicide on behalf of the Mongols as a proof of their loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.news.163.com/special/00013PNN/vol13.html |title=百家博谈第十三期：从文天祥与元代遗民看中国的"民族主义"_网易博客 网易历史 |publisher=History.news.163.com |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; We should note that the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, also indicated that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China.  On a side note, one of his key advisors, Liu Ji, generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non-Chinese are different, they are actually equal. Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that the Chinese were and are superior to the "Yi."&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Songfang, "Lun Liu Ji de Yimin Xintai" (On Liu Ji's Mentality as a Dweller of Subjugated Empire) in ''Xueshu Yanjiu'' no.4 (2005), 112–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

These things show that many times, pre-modern Chinese did view culture (and sometimes politics) rather than race and ethnicity as the dividing line between the Chinese and the non-Chinese. In many cases, the non-Chinese could and did become the Chinese and vice versa, especially when there was a change in culture.

=====Modern reinterpretations=====
According to the historian [[Frank Dikötter]], "The delusive myth of a Chinese antiquity that abandoned racial standards in favour of a concept of cultural universalism in which all barbarians could ultimately participate has understandably attracted some modern scholars. Living in an unequal and often hostile world, it is tempting to project the utopian image of a racially harmonious world into a distant and obscure past."&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1992). ''The Discourse of Race in Modern China''. Stanford University Press, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The politician, historian, and diplomat [[K. C. Wu]] analyzes the origin of the characters for the ''Yi'', ''Man'', ''Rong'', ''Di'', and ''Xia'' peoples and concludes that the "ancients formed these characters with only one purpose in mind—to describe the different ways of living each of these people pursued."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, K. C. 1982. ''The Chinese Heritage''. New York: Crown Publishers. {{ISBN|0-517-54475-X}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;106–108&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the well-known examples of pejorative exonymic characters (such as the "dog radical" in Di), he claims there is no hidden racial bias in the meanings of the characters used to describe these different peoples, but rather the differences were "in occupation or in custom, not in race or origin."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 109&lt;/ref&gt; K. C. Wu says the modern character [[wikt:夷|夷]] designating the historical "Yi peoples," composed of the characters for 大 "big (person)" and 弓 "bow", implies a big person carrying a bow, someone to perhaps be feared or respected, but not to be despised.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; However, differing from K. C. Wu, the scholar Wu Qichang believes that the earliest [[oracle bone script]] for ''yi'' 夷 was [[Shi (personator)#Characters|used interchangeably]] with ''shi'' [[wikt:尸|尸]] "corpse".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' (1993), vol. 3, p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian John Hill explains that ''Yi'' "was used rather loosely for non-Chinese populations of the east. It carried the connotation of people ignorant of Chinese culture and, therefore, 'barbarians'."&lt;ref&gt;Hill, John (2009), ''Through the Jade Gate to Rome: A Study of the Silk Routes during the Later Han Dynasty, First to Second Centuries CE'', BookSurge, {{ISBN|978-1-4392-2134-1}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher I. Beckwith makes the extraordinary claim that the name "barbarian" should only be used for Greek historical contexts, and is inapplicable for all other "peoples to whom it has been applied either historically or in modern times."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I. (2009). ''Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present''.  Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13589-2}}. p. 356. Furthermore, "The entire construct is, appropriately enough, best summed up by popular European and American fiction and film treatments such as ''Conan the Barbarian''." Also see "The Barbarians" epilogue, pp. 320–362.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwith notes that most specialists in East Asian history, including him, have translated Chinese exonyms as English "''barbarian''." He believes that after academics read his published explanation of the problems, except for direct quotations of "earlier scholars who use the word, it should no longer be used as a term by any writer."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;361–2. The author describes his belief in religious terms; following his "enlightenment on this issue", he says no scholar who used the word ''barbarian'' "needs to be blamed for such sins of the past".&lt;/ref&gt;

The first problem is that, "it is impossible to translate the word ''barbarian'' into Chinese because the concept does not exist in Chinese," meaning a single "completely generic" [[loanword]] from Greek ''barbar-''.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; "Until the Chinese borrow the word ''barbarian'' or one of its relatives, or make up a new word that explicitly includes the same basic ideas, they cannot express the idea of the 'barbarian' in Chinese.".&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 358"&gt;Beckwith, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual [[Standard Chinese]] translation of English ''barbarian'' is ''yemanren'' ({{CJKV|t=野蠻人|s=野蛮人|p=yěmánrén}}), which Beckwith claims, "actually means 'wild man, savage'. That is very definitely not the same thing as 'barbarian'."&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 358"/&gt; Despite this semantic hypothesis, Chinese-English dictionaries regularly translate ''yemanren'' as "barbarian" or "barbarians."&lt;ref&gt;For instance, ''Far East Chinese-English Dictionary'' "barbarians; savages" (1992) p. 1410; "savage; Shanghai Jiaotong ''Chinese-English Dictionary'' "barbarian", (1993) p. 2973; ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'' "barbarians" (2003), p. 1131.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwith concedes that the early Chinese "apparently disliked foreigners in general and looked down on them as having an inferior culture," and pejoratively wrote some exonyms. However, he purports, "The fact that the Chinese did not ''like'' foreigner Y and occasionally picked a transcriptional character with negative meaning (in Chinese) to write the sound of his ethnonym, is irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;356–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckwith's second problem is with linguists and lexicographers of Chinese. "If one looks up in a Chinese-English dictionary the two dozen or so partly generic words used for various foreign peoples throughout Chinese history, one will find most of them defined in English as, in effect, 'a kind of barbarian'. Even the works of well-known lexicographers such as Karlgren do this."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), 358.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Beckwith does not cite any examples, the Swedish sinologist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] edited two dictionaries: ''Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'' (1923) and ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' (1957). Compare Karlgrlen's translations of the ''siyi'' "four barbarians":
* ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian, foreigner; destroy, raze to the ground," "barbarian (esp. tribes to the East of ancient China)"&lt;ref&gt;AD186, GSR 551a.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''man'' 蛮 "barbarians of the South; barbarian, savage," "Southern barbarian"&lt;ref&gt;AD 590, GSR 178p.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''rong'' 戎 "weapons, armour; war, warrior; N. pr. of western tribes,"  "weapon; attack; war chariot; loan for tribes of the West"&lt;ref&gt;AD 949, GSR 1013a.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''di'' 狄 "Northern Barbarians – "fire-dogs"," "name of a Northern tribe; low servant"&lt;ref&gt;AD 117, GSR 856a.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus'' Project includes Karlgren's ''GSR'' definitions. Searching the [http://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl STEDT Database] finds various "a kind of" definitions for plant and animal names (e.g., ''you'' 狖 "a kind of monkey,"&lt;ref&gt;GSR 1246c. Beckwith criticizes "a kind of X" definitions as "the dictionary maker either could not find out what it was or was too lazy to define it accurately" (2009), 359; compare listing "rakhbīn (a kind of cheese)" as an export from [[Khwarezm]] (2009), 327.&lt;/ref&gt; but not one "a kind of barbarian" definition.  Besides faulting Chinese for lacking a general "barbarian" term, Beckwith also faults English, which "has no words for the many foreign peoples referred to by one or another Classical Chinese word, such as 胡 ''hú'', 夷 ''yí'', 蠻 ''mán'', and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third problem involves [[Tang Dynasty]] usages of ''fan'' "foreigner" and ''lu'' "prisoner", neither of which meant "barbarian." Beckwith says Tang texts used ''fan'' 番 or 蕃 "foreigner" (see ''shengfan'' and ''shufan'' above) as "perhaps the only true generic at any time in Chinese literature, was practically the opposite of the word ''barbarian''. It meant simply 'foreign, foreigner' without any pejorative meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 360.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, ''fan'' 番 means "foreigner; barbarian; aborigine". The linguist Robert Ramsey illustrates the pejorative connotations of ''fan''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The word "''Fān''" was formerly used by the Chinese almost innocently in the sense of 'aborigines' to refer to ethnic groups in South China, and Mao Zedong himself once used it in 1938 in a speech advocating equal rights for the various minority peoples. But that term has now been so systematically purged from the language that it is not to be found (at least in that meaning) even in large dictionaries, and all references to Mao's 1938 speech have excised the offending word and replaced it with a more elaborate locution, "Yao, Yi, and Yu."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Robert S. (1987). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2E_5nR0SoXoC&amp;pg=PA160 The Languages of China]'', p. 160. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Tang Dynasty Chinese also had a derogatory term for foreigners, ''lu'' ({{CJKV|t=虜|s=虏|p=lǔ}}) "prisoner, slave, captive". Beckwith says it means something like "those miscreants who should be locked up," therefore, "The word does not even mean 'foreigner' at all, let alone 'barbarian'."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), 360&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher I. Beckwith's 2009 "The Barbarians" epilogue provides many references, but overlooks H. G. Creel's 1970 "The Barbarians" chapter. Creel descriptively wrote, "Who, in fact, were the barbarians? The Chinese have no single term for them. But they were all the non-Chinese, just as for the Greeks the barbarians were all the non-Greeks."&lt;ref&gt;Creel (1970), 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwith prescriptively wrote, "The Chinese, however, have still not yet borrowed Greek ''barbar''-. There is also no single native Chinese word for 'foreigner', no matter how pejorative," which meets his strict definition of "barbarian.".&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 358"/&gt;

=====Barbarian puppet drinking game=====
In the [[Tang Dynasty]] houses of pleasure, where drinking games were common, small puppets in the aspect of Westerners, in a ridiculous state of drunkenness, were used in one popular permutation of the drinking game; so, in the form of blue-eyed, pointy nosed, and peak-capped barbarians, these puppets were manipulated in such a way as to occasionally fall down: then, whichever guest to whom the puppet pointed after falling was then obliged by honor to empty his cup of [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|Chinese wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
When Europeans came to [[Japan]], they were called {{nihongo|''nanban''|南蛮}}, literally ''Barbarians from the South'', because the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ships appeared to sail from the South. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who arrived later, were also called either ''nanban'' or {{nihongo|''kōmō''|紅毛}}, literally meaning "Red Hair."

===South Asia===
In the ancient Indian epic [[Mahabharata]], the Sanskrit word ''barbara-'' meant "stammering, wretch, foreigner, sinful people, low and barbarous".&lt;ref&gt;Suryakanta (1975), Sanskrit Hindi English Dictionary, reprinted 1986, page 417, [[Orient Longman]] ({{ISBN|0-86125-248-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Romila Thapar, the Indo-Aryan semi-nomadic people viewed the indigenous people as barbarians when they arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Romila Thapar|title=Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fK3VTUrWsD0C&amp;pg=PA137|year=1978|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-0808-8|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indo-Aryan used the term ''[[mleccha]]'' in referring to people "outside the caste system and ritual ambience." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISFBJarYX7YC&amp;pg=PA8 ''Students' Britannica India''], Vols. 1–5, p. 8. Encyclopædia Britannica (India).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Colombian Americas===
In Mesoamerica the [[Aztec]] civilization used the word "[[Chichimeca]]" to denominate a group of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes that lived on the outskirts of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]]'s Empire, in the north of Modern Mexico, and whom the Aztec people saw as primitive and uncivilized. One of the meanings attributed to the word "Chichimeca" is "dog people".

The [[Incas]] of South America used the term "puruma auca" for all peoples living outside the rule of their empire (see [[Promaucaes]]).

The British, and later the white colonial settlers of the [[United States]], referred to Native Americans as "savages."

===Barbarian mercenaries===
The entry of "barbarians" into [[mercenary]] service in a metropole repeatedly occurs in history as a standard way in which peripheral peoples from and beyond [[frontier]] regions relate to "civilised" imperial powers as part of a (semi-)foreign militarised proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;

Italians in the [[Renaissance]] often called anyone who lived outside of their country a barbarian. As an example, there is the last chapter of [[The Prince]] by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], "Exhortatio ad Capesendam Italiam in Libertatemque a Barbaris Vinsicandam" (in English: Exhortation to take Italy and free her from the barbarians) in which he appeals to [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]] to unite Italy and stop the "barbarian invasions" led by other European rulers, such as [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] and [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], both of France, and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].

Spanish sea captain [[Francisco de Cuellar]], who sailed with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, used the term 'savage' ('salvaje') to describe the [[Irish people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/research/celt/published/T108200.html |title=Captain Cuellar's Adventures in Connacht and Ulster |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist use of "Barbarism"==
In her 1916 anti-war pamphlet ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ The Crisis of German Social Democracy]'', [[Marxism|Marxist]] theorist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg, "The Junius Pamphlet" |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Luxemburg attributed it to [[Friedrich Engels]], though – as shown by [[Michael Löwy]] – Engels had not used the term "Barbarism" but a less resounding formulation: ''If the whole of modern society is not to perish, a revolution in the mode of production and distribution must take place.'' &lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, "Anti-Dühring" (1878), quoted in Michael Löwy, "Philosophy of Praxis &amp; Rosa Luxemburg" in "Viewpoint", Online Issue No. 125, November 2, 2012 {{cite web|url=http://www.viewpointonline.net/philosophy-of-praxis-a-rosa-luxemburg-michael-loewy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511013653/http://www.viewpointonline.net/philosophy-of-praxis-a-rosa-luxemburg-michael-loewy.html |archivedate=2013-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been made that Luxemburg had remembered a passage from ''[[Erfurt Program|The Erfurt Program]]'', written in 1892 by [[Karl Kautsky]], and mistakenly attributed it to Engels:&lt;blockquote&gt;As things stand today capitalist civilization cannot continue; we must either move forward into socialism or fall back into barbarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mronline.org/2014/10/22/angus221014-html-2/|title=MR Online {{!}} The Origin of Rosa Luxemburg’s Slogan “Socialism or Barbarism”|date=2014-10-22|work=MR Online|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Luxemburg went on to explain what she meant by "Regression into Barbarism": "A look around us at this moment [i.e., 1916 Europe] shows what the regression of bourgeois society into Barbarism means. This World War is a regression into Barbarism. The triumph of Imperialism leads to the annihilation of civilization. At first, this happens sporadically for the duration of a modern war, but then when the period of unlimited wars begins it progresses toward its inevitable consequences. Today, we face the choice exactly as Friedrich Engels foresaw it a generation ago: either the triumph of Imperialism and the collapse of all civilization as in ancient Rome, depopulation, desolation, degeneration – a great cemetery. Or the victory of Socialism, that means the conscious active struggle of the International Proletariat against Imperialism and its method of war."

"Socialism or Barbarism" became, and remains, an often quoted and influential concept in [[Marxist]] literature. "Barbarism" is variously interpreted as meaning either a technologically advanced but extremely exploitative and oppressive society (e.g. a victory and world domination by [[Nazi Germany]] and its [[Fascism|Fascist]] allies); a collapse of technological civilization due to Capitalism causing a [[Nuclear War]] or [[ecological disaster]]; or the one form of barbarism bringing on the other.

The [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]] considers "Socialism or Barbarism" to be a variant of the earlier "[[Give me Liberty, or give me Death!|Liberty or Death]]", used by revolutionaries of different stripes since the late 18th century &lt;ref&gt;"The October Revolution – Ninety Years On", 2007 statement of the Internationalist Communist Tendency

==Modern popular culture==
Modern popular culture contains such fantasy barbarians as [[Conan the Barbarian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525135846/http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm | archivedate=May 25, 2011|title=The Hyborian Age|authors=Howard, Robert E., adapted by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Walt Simonson]]|work=Conan Saga |issue= 50–54, 56|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such fantasy, the negative connotations traditionally associated with "Barbarian" are often inverted. For example, "[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]" (1932), the first of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s "Conan" series, is set soon after the "Barbarian" protagonist had forcibly seized the turbulent kingdom of [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonia]] from King Numedides, whom he strangled upon his throne. The story is clearly slanted to imply that the kingdom greatly benefited by power passing from a decadent and tyrannical hereditary monarch to a strong and vigorous Barbarian usurper.

A '''boundary problem''' in analysis is a phenomenon in which geographical patterns are differentiated by the shape and arrangement of boundaries that are drawn for administrative or measurement purposes.  This is distinct from and must not be confused with the boundary problem in the philosophy of science that is also called the '''[[demarcation problem]]'''.

== Definition ==
In '''[[spatial analysis]]''', four major problems interfere with an accurate estimation of the statistical parameter: the boundary problem, scale problem, pattern problem (or [[spatial autocorrelation]]), and [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (Barber 1988). The boundary problem occurs because of the loss of neighbours in analyses that depend on the values of the neighbours. While geographic phenomena are measured and analyzed within a specific unit, identical spatial data can appear either dispersed or clustered depending on the boundary placed around the data. In analysis with point data, dispersion is evaluated as dependent of the boundary. In analysis with area data, statistics should be interpreted based upon the boundary.

In geographical research, two types of areas are taken into consideration in relation to the boundary: an area surrounded by fixed natural boundaries (e.g., coastlines or streams), outside of which neighbours do not exist (Henley 1981), or an area included in a larger region defined by arbitrary artificial boundaries (e.g., an air pollution boundary in modeling studies or an urban boundary in population migration) (Haining 1990). In an area isolated by the natural boundaries, the spatial process discontinues at the boundaries. In contrast, if a study area is delineated by the artificial boundaries, the process continues beyond the area.

If a spatial process in an area occurs beyond a study area or has an interaction with neighbours outside artificial boundaries, the most common approach is to neglect the influence of the boundaries and assume that the process occurs at the internal area. However, such an approach leads to a significant model misspecification problem (Upton and Fingleton 1985).

That is, for measurement or administrative purposes, geographic boundaries are drawn, but the boundaries per se can bring about different spatial patterns in geographic phenomena (BESR 2002). It has been reported that the difference in the way of drawing the boundary significantly affects identification of the spatial distribution and estimation of the statistical parameters of the spatial process (Cressie 1992; Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993; Griffith 1983; Martin 1987). The difference is largely based on the fact that spatial processes are generally unbounded or fuzzy-bounded (Leung 1987) but the processes are expressed in data imposed within boundaries for analysis purposes (Miller 1999). Although the boundary problem was discussed in relation to artificial and arbitrary boundaries, the effect of the boundaries also occurs according to natural boundaries as long as it is ignored that properties at sites on the natural boundary such as streams are likely to differ from those at sites within the boundary (Martin 1989).

The boundary problem occurs with regard not only to horizontal boundaries but also to vertically drawn boundaries according to delineations of heights or depths (Pineda 1993). For example, biodiversity such as the density of species of plants and animals is high near the surface, so if the identically divided height or depth is used as a spatial unit, it is more likely to find fewer number of the plant and animal species as the height or depth increases.

&lt;sup&gt;Notes: Land cover datasets were obtained from USGS and population density from FGDL.&lt;/sup&gt;

== Types and examples ==

By drawing a boundary around a study area, two types of problems in measurement and analysis takes place (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). The first is an '''edge effect'''. This effect originates from the ignorance of interdependences that occur outside the bounded region. Griffith (1980; 1983) and Griffith and Amrhein (1983) highlighted problems according to the edge effect. A typical example is a cross-boundary influence such as cross-border jobs, services and other resources located in a neighbouring municipality (McGuire 1995).

The second is a '''shape effect''' that results from the artificial shape delineated by the boundary. As an illustration of the effect of the artificial shape, point pattern analysis tends to provide higher levels of clustering for the identical point pattern within a unit that is more elongated (Fotheringham and Rogerson 1993). Similarly, the shape can influence interaction and flow among spatial entities (Arlinghaus and Nystuen 1990; Ferguson and Kanaroglou 1998; Griffith 1982). For example, the shape can affect the measurement of origin-destination flows since these are often recorded when they cross an artificial boundary. Because of the effect set by the boundary, the shape and area information is used to estimate travel distances from surveys (Rogerson 1990) or to locate traffic counters, travel survey stations, or traffic monitoring systems (Kirby 1997). From the same perspective, Theobald (2001; retrieved from BESR 2002) argued that measures of urban sprawl should consider interdependences and interactions with nearby rural areas.

In spatial analysis, the boundary problem has been discussed along with the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) inasmuch as MAUP is associated with the arbitrary geographic unit and the unit is defined by the boundary (Rogerson 2006). For administrative purposes, data for policy indicators are usually aggregated within larger units (or enumeration units) such as census tracts, school districts, municipalities and counties. The artificial units serve the purposes of taxation and service provision. For example, municipalities can effectively respond to the need of the public in their jurisdictions. However, in such spatially aggregated units, spatial variations of detailed social variables cannot be identified. The problem is noted when the average degree of a variable and its unequal distribution over space are measured (BESR 2002).

The '''Canalizations of Zenobia''' or '''El Kanat''' are [[canal]]s that according to traditions, were built by [[Queen Zenobia]] to channel water from the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] river in the [[Anti-Lebanon]] mountains to [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="AloufRain1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel M. Alouf|author2=Tedd St Rain|title=History of Baalbek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiyY1CKE9SIC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=1 October 2012|year=1999|publisher=Book Tree|isbn=978-1-58509-063-1|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some remains of the ruins of the canals can be seen in places around [[Lebanon]] and seems to be from the Roman times&lt;ref name="AloufRain1999"/&gt;

==Data==

Some of the canals were built in the second century during [[Hadrian]], when the region was fully under Roman rule. There are bridges over canals, still standing from Roman times&lt;ref&gt;[https://everipedia-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/NewlinkFiles/2636882/7edb1___canalizations-of-zenobia/roman-bridge-over-an-ancient-lebanese-canal-credit.jpe Roman bridge over canal supposed to be built under Zenobia]&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the canals is suggested to originate from a mountain near [[Labweh]] extending to [[Qusair]]&lt;ref name="Abu-Izzeddin1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Halim Said Abu-Izzeddin|title=Lebanon and its provinces: a study by the governors of the five provinces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O1dtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2012|year=1963|publisher=Khayats}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Labweh has several archaeological sites of interest including three old caves with [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Byzantine]] [[sarcophagi]] and the remains of a temple. There are also remains of a Byzantine bastion and a Roman dam suggested to date to the reign of [[Queen Zenobia]]. Legend suggests that channels were carved through the rock to send water to her lands in [[Palmyra]], Syria.&lt;ref name="Brochure"&gt;[http://www.discoverlebanon.com/en/panoramic_views/bekaa/el_hermel/hermel-pyramid.php Ba'albeck - Al-Hermal, Bekaa - Tourist Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another canal extends from the village of Chawaghir, {{convert|8|km|mi}} north of [[Hermel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mada.org.lb/resources/Hermel_survey_en.pdf Guadagnoli, Giulia, Hermel - Survey of social and economic establishments in 5 municipalities, MADA, January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The canals were cut out of solid [[limestone]] bedrock to a depth of {{convert|20|m|ft}} with wells approximately every {{convert|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nna-leb.gov.lb/archive/24-11-2010/E46.html Sahili, Jamal., (Translated by Lynn Waked), Hermel, The wealth of ancient monuments, Lebanese National News Agency, 24 November 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|'' Among the remains to be found around Hermel one may see the canalizations of Zenobia, queen of Palmyra. Two of them hewn in the rock supplied the city of Palmyra in the desert with water from the Orontes. They were dug at a depth of twenty meters and were connected with wells dug at every hundred meters, channeling the water off to Palmyra, the short-lived capital of Queen Zenobia''.Kirkbride Diana &lt;ref&gt;Kirkbride, Diana. "Early Byblos and the Bakaa", Volume 45 (Pages 43–60), Mélanges de l'Université Saint-Joseph (Beirut Lebanon), 1969&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[tradition]]al suggestion that the canals were originally constructed during the brief reign of Zenobia has been treated as probable -but not sure-  by Michael Alouf, who notes the existence of canals traces in the desert around [[Palmyra]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/07/120717-palmyra-roman-city-syria-science-farming-world-ancient/ Canals found around Palmyra]&lt;/ref&gt;, that are from the second century.&lt;ref name="AloufRain1999"/&gt;

The canals were used until the Arab conquest, when were destroyed.

The '''City Club of New York''' is a [[New York City]]-based independent, not-for-profit organization.

In 1950, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the City Club of New York "a social club with a civic purpose"&lt;ref name=NYT1950&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/02/08/89716340.html?pageNumber=45 "Club Ending in its 58th Year,"] ''New York Times'' (Feb. 8, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; whose members "fought for adequate water supply, the extension of [[rapid transit]] lines, lower costs of foreclosure in private homes, and the merit system in [[civil service]], [as well as] ... traffic relief, the prevention of [[juvenile delinquency]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/02/15/121629833.html?pageNumber=26 "THE CITY CLUB DISBANDS,"] ''New York Times'' (Feb. 15, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The City Club claimed that it inspired the creation of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], and also fought for [[minimum wage]] laws, city parks, and playground programs.&lt;ref name=Holusha /&gt;

For 30 years the City Club of New York administered the [[Albert S. Bard Award]] for Distinguished Architecture and Urban Design, which not only conferred honors on top city buildings but also used the occasion to comment on the state of municipal architecture in general.&lt;ref&gt;Huxtable, Ada Louise. [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/05/14/90556733.html?pageNumber=28 "Architectural Dynamite: City Club Criticism of Municipal Design Underscores Need for Drastic Reform,"] ''New York Times'' (May 14, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The City Club was founded as a [[gentlemen's club]] in March 1892&lt;ref name=Times1892&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/03/19/104120995.html?pageNumber=4 "The New City Club,"] ''New York Times'' (March 19, 1892).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times2013&gt;Dunlap David. W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/nyregion/a-goad-to-the-powerful-lately-dormant-is-stirred-by-a-midtown-zoning-plan.html?_r=0 "BUILDING BLOCKS: A Goad to the Powerful, Lately Dormant, Is Stirred by a Midtown Zoning Plan,"] ''New York Times'' (August 28, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; by a group of 23 men, including such prominent names as [[August Belmont, Jr.]], [[James C. Carter]], [[John Jay Chapman]], R. Fulton Cutting, [[W. Bayard Cutting]], [[Charles DeKay]], [[George C. Magoun]], [[George Haven Putnam]], and [[John Woodruff Simpson]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes1942 /&gt; Spurred by international law expert [[Edmond Kelly]]&lt;ref name=NYT1950 /&gt; (1851–1909), their mission was to:
{{blockquote|promote social intercourse among persons specially interested in the good government of the City of New-York, in securing honesty and efficiency in the administration of city affairs, and in severing municipal from national politics. The organization will also aim to procure the election of fit persons to city offices, and will exert its influence steadily in behalf of an honest, efficient, and independent city government.&lt;ref name=Times1892 /&gt;}}

The first club president was [[James C. Carter]].&lt;ref name=Times1892B /&gt; The group first met as a club in June 1892 at a dinner of about 200 men at [[Sherry's]].&lt;ref name=NYT1950 /&gt; Membership soon grew to about 350 men.

The City Club's first target was [[Tammany Hall]]; they helped the [[Lexow Committee]] probe into police corruption, and worked to elect [[William Lafayette Strong]] in 1895 as the reform mayor of New York. In 1897 the City Club helped organize the [[Citizens Union]].&lt;ref name=NYT1950 /&gt; Their activities were closely documented by ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In 1913 the City Club commissioned a large boulder to commemorate the burial site of Captain [[Thomas Willett]] (died 1674), the first English mayor of New York, at [[Little Neck Cemetery]], [[East Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name="East Providence Historical Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ephist.org/cemetery.htm|title=East Providence Historical Society|work=East Providence Historical Society|publisher=East Providence Historical Society|access-date=2016-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021163905/http://ephist.org/cemetery.htm|archive-date=2013-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s the City Club was advocating on behalf of making the city safer in areas like urban planning and transportation; they also expanded their advocacy to the State of New York as a whole. They published an annual "Murder Map," documenting the deaths of children due to traffic accidents and other unsafe urban conditions. In May 1937 the City Club bestowed its first annual "Citation for Meritorious Service" to New York City Parks Commissioner [[Robert Moses]].&lt;ref name="Times1937"&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/05/22/118971460.html?pageNumber=17 "CITY CLUB HONOR AWARDED TO MOSES,"] ''New York Times'' (May 22, 1937).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite their earlier commendation of [[Robert Moses]]' work, as time moved on the club opposed many of Moses' plans for the development of New York City: it successfully organized opposition to the [[Brooklyn-Battery Bridge]] project and was instrumental in the preservation of [[Castle Clinton]]. In the late 1930s and early 1940s lawyer and civic activist [[Albert S. Bard]] exercised his influence in civic and urban affairs through his work on City Club committees.&lt;ref&gt;Albert S. Bard Papers, Boxes 18, 24, 60-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Albert S. Bard Award]] (see below) was later named in his honor. The City Club celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 1942; among those in attendance were New York City Mayor [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia]], New York State Lieutenant Governor [[Charles Poletti]], and former Governor [[Al Smith]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes1942"&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/05/10/85535839.html?pageNumber=37 "CITY CLUB TO MARK 50TH ANNIVERSARY,"] ''New York Times'' (May 10, 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1962–1997, the City Club hosted roundtable luncheons, held every Friday except during the summer. Invited speakers (usually members) made presentations before the City Club. The luncheon presentations were aired live by [[WNYC (AM)|WNYC-AM]] until 1987, when the station instead taped the luncheons and aired them during off-peak hours.&lt;ref name=WNYC /&gt;

The City Club caused controversy In 1967 in a strongly worded article by activist Chairman [[I. D. Robbins]] about the perceived failures of the [[John Lindsay]] administration, particularly in regard to housing. Some club members objected to the article, asserting that it did not represent the official City Club position.&lt;ref&gt;Within, Richard. [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/11/21/96244744.html?pageNumber=50 "CITY CLUB REJECTS ATTACK ON MAYOR: Says Article by Chairman Is Not Official Position,"] ''New York Times'' (November 21, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Robbins offered to resign but was not allowed to.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan, Thomas P.

In 1973, the City Club of New York celebrated its 80th anniversary with a gala dinner at the [[New York Hilton]]. Attendees included New York Mayor [[John Lindsay]] and former Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner]] (both of whom had been heavily criticized by the City Club at various times).&lt;ref name=Weisman&gt;WEISMAN, STEVEN R. [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/03/10/90921730.html?pageNumber=17 "CITY CLUB, AT 80, IN BUSIEST YEAR: Plans a Series of Reports on Government Here 23 Awards Presented Charter Revision Cited,"] ''New York Times'' (March 10, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; At the gala, the City Club handed out 23 "For New York" awards to citizens who dedicated themselves to bettering the city. Recipients included [[John Chancellor]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Lloyd Goodrich]], [[Ada Louise Huxtable]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Arthur Mitchell (dancer)|Arthur Mitchell]], [[Bess Myerson]], [[John Bertram Oakes]], [[Joseph Papp]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Dorothy Schiff]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Preston Robert Tisch]], and [[Lila Bell Wallace]].&lt;ref name=Weisman /&gt;

In 1977, the City Club inaugurated the Richard S. Childs Lectureship in Municipal Administration. In 1982 [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]] delivered a Childs Lecture on the topic "A Survival Strategy for America's Cities." Other Childs Lecture speakers over the years included Governor [[Mario Cuomo]], I. D. Robbins, [[Richard Ravitch]], and [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]] The Childs Lecture series lasted until 1992.

In 1984 the City Club elected [[Sally Goodgold]] as its first female president; she was noted for her ability to attract high-profile names to the Club's weekly luncheon speaker series.&lt;ref&gt;DUNLAP, DAVID W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/29/nyregion/sally-goodgold-civic-advocate-who-practiced-bagel-diplomacy-dies-at-82.html "Sally Goodgold, Civic Advocate Who Practiced ‘Bagel Diplomacy,’ Dies at 82,"] ''New York Times'' (AUG. 28, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NICHOLS, MARY PEROT.

The club suspended activities in 2003&lt;ref name="times2013" /&gt; and officially dissolved in 2009.{{citation needed|reason=This claim conflicts with the preceding source |date=July 2016}}

In 2013 the club hired a new president, Michael S. Gruen, and resumed its role of civic advocacy, taking on New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s [[East Midtown]] rezoning plans.&lt;ref name="times2013" /&gt;

== Clubhouse ==
The Club's first headquarters, located at 677 Fifth Avenue, was secured in October 1892.&lt;ref name=Times1892B&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/10/03/106086746.html?pageNumber=9 "The City Club's New Home,"] ''New York Times'' (October 3, 1892).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1900s the City Club commissioned its own clubhouse at 55 West 44th Street, which was designed by architect [[Austin W. Lord]] and erected in 1904. After 40 years at that location, in 1944 the club moved to the Hotel Russell at 45 Park Avenue.&lt;ref name="NYT1944"&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1944/02/12/88594848.html?pageNumber=11 "QUITS CITY CLUB POST: Price, Chairman for 33 Years, Is Succeeded by Sparry,"] ''New York Times'' (Feb. 12, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; (The 44th Street structure is now the City Club Hotel.)&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Turkel, ''Built to Last: 100+ Year-Old Hotels in New York'' (AuthorHouse, 2011), pp. 109–15. {{ISBN|1463443412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City Club is currently located at 45 West 67th Street in [[Manhattan]].

== Membership ==
Socialite and philanthropist [[Peter Marié]] was an early member of the City Club, as were publisher [[Frank Howard Dodd]] and businessman [[Hamilton McKown Twombly]]. Architect and town planner [[Electus D. Litchfield]] was a City Club member.

In 1892 the club's membership was more than 650 men,&lt;ref name=Times1892B /&gt; and by 1904, membership was 667 (including 195 lawyers, 61 bankers, 31 doctors, 28 stockbrokers, 26 editors and writers, and 13 clergymen).&lt;ref name="Holusha"&gt;HOLUSHA, JOHN. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/04/business/commercial-real-estate-regional-market-midtown-manhattan-club-hotel-share-more.html "COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- Midtown Manhattan; Club and Hotel to Share More Than the Name,"] ''New York Times'' (June 4, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1950 City Club membership was down to 200 men and the club had been unsuccessful at recruiting a new generation of civic-minded applicants. In February 1950 they voted to disband, stating that the work they had been doing should be "entrusted to the [[Citizens Union]] ..., which has the staff to carry on...."&lt;ref name="NYT1950" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, however, the club was revived with an influx of younger men, and it vowed to continue its work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/03/18/305455322.html?pageNumber=15 "CITY CLUB TO TRY AGAIN; Group of Young New Members to Seek to Revive Organization,"] ''New York Times'' (March 18, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, club membership was about 200 men,&lt;ref name=Weisman /&gt; but had increased to about 400 in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;BURKS, EDWARD C. [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/09/25/90977739.html?pageNumber=47 "State's Transit-Bond Plan Is Denounced by City Club: A Defeat Predicted,"] ''New York Times'' (Sept. 25, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the City Club of New York opened its membership to women.&lt;ref name=times2013 /&gt;

In 2011 the City Club had 450 members.&lt;ref&gt;Turkel, Stanley. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EEDE113AF935A1575BC0A9679D8B63 "Paid Notice: Deaths: GOODGOLD, SALLY,"] ''New York Times'' (August 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert S. Bard Award ==
The '''Albert S. Bard Award''' (full name '''Albert S. Bard Award for Distinguished Architecture and Urban Design''') created in 1962 and administered by the City Club, honored those who helped enrich the intellectual and cultural life of the community through architecture and urban design. The award was conceived by City Club member architect Leon Brand, who envisioned "an architectural prize intended to raise the standard of excellence for building design in New York City."&lt;ref name=Brand-obit&gt;PETERSON, ALISON J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/arts/05brand.html "Leon Brand, 74, Who Founded New York Architecture Prize, Dies,"] ''New York Times'' (NOV. 5, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bard Award was born into controversy when the City Club refused to present any awards in its inaugural year, claiming that they were unable to find "a single work of civic architecture created in the city since 1958 worthy" of the award.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Alexander. [http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/05/14/90556728.html?pageNumber=28 "CITY HELD FAILURE IN ARCHITECTURE: Club Can't Find a Municipal Building Worthy of Award,"] ''New York Times'' (May 14, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; The New York chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] sharply criticized the City Club for this pronouncement.&lt;ref name=Burnham&gt;Burnham, Alexander.

For many years, the Bard Awards were distributed on alternate years for public and private buildings. Top awards were deemed "First Honor;" those that didn't reach such a high level were called "Merit Awards."&lt;ref name=Huxtable&gt;HUXTABLE, ADA LOUISE.

The image is based on the notion of them having reached America and also encountered a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 2004, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Didrik Pining''' ({{circa}} 1430 – 1491)&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 2004, pp. 504 and 506.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Germany|German]] [[privateer]], [[nobleman]] and governor of [[Iceland]] and [[Vardøhus Fortress|Vardøhus]].&lt;ref name="DidrikPiningSNL"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|url=http://snl.no/Didrik_Pining|title=Didrik Pining|language=Norwegian|date=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is most notable because some have proposed that he may have landed in [[North America]] in the 1470s, almost twenty years before [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus']] voyages of discovery. Some of the claims concerning Pining are controversial because information about him is, in general, relatively sparse and partially contradictory.&lt;ref name="DidrikPiningSNL"/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Didrik Pining has been found by modern German genealogists to have been a native of [[Hildesheim]] in [[Germany]], and this has according to a report been "suddenly and conclusively proved."&lt;ref name="Thomas2003"&gt;Hughes, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been assumed that he was a Dane or Norwegian until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=h504&gt;Hughes, 2004, p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] records until 1468, he is mentioned as a [[privateer]] or [[captain (naval)|captain]] in the service of [[Free City of Hamburg|Hamburg]], charged with hunting down English merchant ships in the [[North Atlantic]].&lt;ref name="Thomas2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=h504/&gt; From 1468 to 1478, he was in the service of [[Denmark-Norway|Denmark]] (by 1470 as an "admiral")&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 2004, pp. 504–05.&lt;/ref&gt; first under [[Christian I of Denmark]] (ruled 1448–1481), and later for his son, [[John of Denmark]] (ruled 1481–1513).&lt;ref name="DidrikPiningSNL"/&gt; Before his employment by the Danes, Pining and his partner [[Hans Pothorst]] had also been regarded by the [[Hanseatic League]] as "pirates who did much damage to the Hanse towns."&lt;ref name=friedland&gt;Friedland, 1984, p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt; During the later years of the reign of Christian I, Pining and Pothorst are said to have distinguished themselves "not less as capable seamen than as matchless freebooters."&lt;ref name="p125"&gt;Nansen and Chater, 1911, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged trip to America===

====Sofus Larsen's theory====
The theory of the Pining voyage reaching [[Americas|America]] was published for the first time by Dr. [[Sofus Larsen]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] in his book ''The Discovery of North America Twenty Years Before Columbus'' in 1925.&lt;ref name="Thomas2003"/&gt; Larsen based his claims on various sources (mainly three) which had no immediately apparent connection.&lt;ref name=jen186/&gt; Pining was according to Larsen appointed leader of an expedition to the north towards [[Greenland]] in the early 1470s.&lt;ref name="Thomas2003"/&gt; He, together with Hans Pothorst (also from Hildesheim), and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] and [[Álvaro Martins]], were said to have been the principals in the expedition. The navigator was supposedly the semi-mythical figure named [[John Scolvus]]. According to Larsen, the mission likely started off from [[Bergen]], went on through to [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]], and eventually discovered ''[[Bacalao|Terra do Bacalhau]]'', the "Land of Codfish", later presumed to be [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] or [[Labrador]].&lt;ref name="DidrikPiningSNL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2003"/&gt; While it is known that Pining and Corte-Real were respectively appointed governors of Iceland (1478) and the [[Azores]] (1474), these appointments were according to Larsen a reward for having discovered the Land of Codfish.&lt;ref name="Thomas2003"/&gt;

====General research====
While Larsen's claims have enjoyed strong scholarly and public support in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Portugal]], it has been more disputed among German scholars. Reception of the account by American and English [[historian]]s has generally ranged from ridicule to acceptance of the plausibility of at least part of it.&lt;ref name="Thomas2003"/&gt; Many further circumstances are known to support the theory, although it is generally concluded that the theory is "not proven" (nor sufficiently "disproven"), with any possible "final proof" lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 2004, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, no sources explicitly supports that Pining and Pothorst had any connections with the journey by Corte-Real, nor that they reached North America (excluding Greenland).&lt;ref&gt;Seaver, 1997, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; What is known however, is that Pining and Pothorst were sent out by a royal Danish order to find out which of several possible policies concerning trade in Iceland should be developed, in which settlements and harbours. Pining's orders further included investigating what formerly, in the 11th century, had been called the ''regiones finitimae'' (i.e. "the coasts opposite those still-remembered but obsolete settlements in Greenland").&lt;ref name=friedland/&gt; In 1476, they made this trip, which likely went to Greenland, where they were reported to have encountered hostile [[Inuit]], and no [[Norsemen|Norse people]].&lt;ref name=mills/&gt; The location they visited is assumed by some to have been around [[Tasiilaq|Angmagssalik]].&lt;ref name=mills&gt;Mills, 2003, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing specific suggests it went further west than this.&lt;ref name=dif&gt;Diffie, 1977, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1478, Didrik Pining became the governor (''höfuðsmaðr'')&lt;ref name=seav200&gt;Seaver, 1997, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Iceland]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 2004, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; serving until 1481, when he is mentioned as having "fared out of Iceland."&lt;ref name="p125"/&gt; He replaced the former governor [[Thorleif Björnsson]], whose struggle to marry his own cousin Ingvild was supported by Pining. The following year, Thorleif gave Pining [[silver]] and a horn of [[walrus ivory]] to pay the king for a license for his union. The agreement was constituted in 1484, merging two of Iceland's most fortunate political dynasties. In the same year, there came complaints of Pining and his men having raped women and stolen money from farmers.&lt;ref name=seav200/&gt; In 1481, Pining was present at the funeral of Danish king Christian I.&lt;ref name=h506&gt;Hughes, 2004, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made state visits of homage to [[Bergen]] and [[Copenhagen]], became [[knight]]ed in [[Norway]], and employed his personal coat of arms which featured a [[grappling hook]].&lt;ref name=h506/&gt; Some years later, in 1489 and 1490, he is again described as "governor (''hirdstjore'') over the whole of Iceland" in two Icelandic laws or edicts (the so-called Pining's Laws). A later chronicler says about him that "he was in many ways a serviceable man and put many things right that were wrong."&lt;ref name="p125"/&gt; His godson and nephew, Didrik Pining the Younger, succeeded him in 1490, and was governor for the two following years.&lt;ref name=h506/&gt;

Pining, together with Hans Pothorst, patrolled [[North Atlantic]] waters and played prominent roles in the Anglo-Danish Naval War (1484–90).&lt;ref name=jen185&gt;Jensen, 2007, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1484, he captured, off the coast of [[England]] or [[Brittany]] and in the Spanish Sea, three Spanish or Portuguese ships which he brought to King [[John of Denmark]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name="p125"/&gt; He accompanied John to Bergen in 1486 as admiral of the royal fleet.&lt;ref name=jen18586&gt;Jensen, 2007, p. 185-86.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1487, he led a fleet to the island of [[Gotland]] in the [[Baltic Sea]], and secured it for Denmark.&lt;ref name="DidrikPiningSNL"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jen18586/&gt; In a treaty concluded between John of Denmark and the Dutch in 1490, it is, however, expressly stated that Didrik Pining (and another admiral named Bartold Busch)&lt;ref&gt;Daae, 1887, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; were to be excluded from the peace. He was then also spoken of as a lord of Iceland. In the same year, Pining was appointed governor of [[Vardøhus Fortress|Vardøhus]], and may thus have been commander-in-chief of the seas and lands in northern waters.&lt;ref name="p126"&gt;Nansen and Chater, 1911, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Didrik Pining likely died (was possibly killed) around [[Finnmark]] or the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] in 1491.&lt;ref name=h506/&gt; In the ''[[Skibby Chronicle]]'', Pining (and Pothorst) are mentioned among many pirates who "met with a miserable death, being either slain by their friends or hanged on the gallows or drowned in the waves of the sea,"&lt;ref name="p129"&gt;Nansen and Chater, 1911, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been disputed by some modern historians.&lt;ref name=jen185/&gt;

==Later references==
In a letter to [[Christian III of Denmark]] in 1551, the mayor of [[Kiel]], Carsten Griep, sent the king two maps of the north Atlantic made during the expeditions of Pining and Pothorst, "who were sent out by your majesty's royal grandfather King Christian the First, at the request of his majesty of Portugal, with certain ships to explore new countries and islands in the north, have raised on the rock ''[[Gunnbjørn Fjeld|Wydthszerck]]'', lying off Greenland and towards ''[[Snæfellsjökull|Sniefeldsiekel]]'' in Iceland on the sea, a great sea-mark on account of the Greenland pirates (presumably [[Inuit]])."&lt;ref name="p127"&gt;Nansen and Chater, 1911, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefansson, 2005, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olaus Magnus - On the dwarfs of Greenland and the rock of Hvitsark I.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Olaus Magnus]]' account is illustrated by one of his woodcuts (seen above), resembling the southern Greenland coast where Hvidserk is seen, and the explorers combating [[Eskimo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 2004, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Olaus Magnus]] wrote in 1555 that Pining and Pothorst, due to their piracy, had "by the Nordic kings been excluded from all human contact and declared outlaws, as a result of their extremely violent robberies and numerous cruel acts against all sailors that they could catch, whether close or distant." They then took refuge at a cliff called Hvidserken, which apparently was located between Iceland and Greenland.&lt;ref name=dp244&gt;Daae, 1887, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Magnus added that in "1494", the pirates created a giant compass out of a considerable circular space at the top of the cliff, with rings and lines formed of lead, to make it easier for them to know in which direction they could seek a great plunder. Modern historians have suggested that they may in fact have set up some mark at the coast of Greenland to reclaim it for the Danish king.&lt;ref name=jen186&gt;Jensen, 2007, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1625, a report from London talks about Pining and Pothorst (''Punnus'' and ''Potharse'') and states that Pining "gave the Islanders their Lawes," referred to later as Pining's Law, the written [[Law of Iceland|Icelandic law]].&lt;ref name="p126"/&gt;

The term "geopiety" comes from a combination of the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''geo'', for earth, and the [[Latin language|Latin]] root "[[Pietas (virtue)|pietas]]". As Wright explained when coining the term, geopiety is meant to refer to "emotional piety aroused by awareness of terrestrial diversity of the kind of which geography is also a form of awareness".&lt;ref name=w251&gt;Wright, 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of geopiety can be found in the works of American preacher [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]:
{{quote|He that is traveling up a very high mountain, if he goes on climbing, will at length get to that height and eminence as at last not only to have his prospect vastly large, but he will get above clouds and winds, and where he will enjoy a perpetual serenity and calm. This may encourage Christians constantly and steadfastly to climb the Christian hill.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

That high towers or other high places are commonly smitten with thunder, and mountainous places more subject to terrible thunder and lightning, shows how that pride and self-exaltation does particularly excite God's wrath.&lt;ref name=w251/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''ISO 3166-2:RS''' is the entry for [[Serbia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Serbia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[autonomous provinces of Serbia|2 autonomous provinces]]
* [[districts of Serbia|1 city and 29 districts]]

The city [[Belgrade]] is the capital of the country and has special status equal to the districts.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|RS}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Serbia. The second part is either of the following:
* two letters: autonomous provinces
* two digits: city and districts

The digits for the city and districts are assigned as follows:
* 00: city
* 01&amp;ndash;07: districts in the autonomous province [[Vojvodina]]
* 08&amp;ndash;24: districts in [[Central Serbia]]
* 25&amp;ndash;29: districts in the autonomous province [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo-Metohija]] (different from the [[districts of Kosovo|districts]] established when it was under the interim administration of the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo]], and currently used by the ''de facto'' independent [[Republic of Kosovo]])

Before the dissolution of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2006, Serbia was assigned the ISO 3166-2 code {{mono|CS-SR}} under the [[ISO 3166-2:CS#I-8|entry for Serbia and Montenegro]].

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Jean Godin des Odonais''' (5 July 1713 [[Saint-Amand-Montrond]], [[France]] - 1 March 1792 [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] [[Cartography|cartographer]] and [[naturalist]].

==Biography==
Godin des Odonais had joined the [[French Geodesic Mission|world's first geodesy expedition]] to the [[equator]], led by [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]]. He had been recommended to La Condamine by the expedition's chief [[astronomy|astronomer]], his cousin [[Louis Godin]]. To be distinguished from his relative, Jean added to his surname that of his mother, Odonais.

When the commission returned to France, Godin des Odonais became professor of astronomy and natural science at the College of Quito, 1739. At the same time he studied the Indian languages and the flora of Ecuador.  His marriage with an heiress, [[Isabel Godin des Odonais|Isabel Gramesón]], gave him the means, and in 1743 he resigned his chair and gave his whole time to natural science and the Indian language.

He explored Ecuador and the northern provinces of Peru, and collected an herbarium containing more than 4,000 species of plants. He also made drawings of over 800 species of animals. Having lost the greater part of his wife's dowry in speculations, he resolved to try his fortune in Cayenne, where he arrived in May, 1750, and settled on the banks of the river Oyapok. For fifteen years he explored Cayenne and the Brazilian Guiana, north of the Amazon, and collected nearly 7,000 species of plants. From 1765 till 1773 he explored the Amazon.

In the latter year he finally returned to France, and settled on his estate of St. Amand. He gave his botanical collections to the museum of natural history, where they are still preserved. In 1784 he was elected a member of the [[French Academy of Science]], and he labored thenceforth to arrange the notes taken during the many years of his explorations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6101">The '''Jenks optimization method''', also called the '''Jenks natural breaks classification method''', is a [[data clustering]] method designed to determine the best arrangement of values into different classes. This is done by seeking to minimize each class’s average deviation from the class mean, while maximizing each class’s deviation from the means of the other groups. In other words, the method seeks to reduce the [[variance]] within classes and maximize the variance between classes.&lt;ref name="Jenks"&gt;Jenks, George F. 1967. "The Data Model Concept in Statistical Mapping", International Yearbook of Cartography 7: 186–190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McMaster"&gt;McMaster, Robert, "In Memoriam: George F. Jenks (1916–1996)". Cartography and Geographic Information Science. 24(1) p.56-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jenks optimization method is directly related to [[Otsu's Method]] and [[Linear discriminant analysis#Fisher's linear discriminant|Fisher's Discriminant Analysis]].

==History==

=== George Jenks ===
George Frederick Jenks was a 20th-century American [[cartography|cartographer]]. Graduating with his Ph.D. in agricultural geography from [[Syracuse University]] in 1947, Jenks began his career under the tutelage of [[Richard Edes Harrison|Richard Harrison]], cartographer for [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] and Fortune magazine.&lt;ref name="McMaster2"&gt;McMaster, Robert and McMaster, Susanna. 2002. “A History of Twentieth-Century American Academic Cartography”, Cartography and Geographic Information Science. 29(3) p.312-315.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty of the [[University of Kansas]] in 1949 and began to build the cartography program. During his 37-year tenure at KU, Jenks developed the Cartography program into one of three programs renowned for their graduate education in the field; the others being the [[University of Wisconsin]] and the [[University of Washington]]. Much of his time was spent developing and promoting improved cartographic training techniques and programs. He also spent significant time investigating three-dimensional maps, eye-movement research, [[thematic map]] communication, and [[geostatistics]].&lt;ref name="McMaster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McMaster2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSUN"&gt;CSUN Cartography Specialty Group, [http://www.csun.edu/~hfgeg003/csg/winter97.html Winter 1997 Newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Jenks was a cartographer by profession. His work with [[statistics]] grew out of a desire to make [[choropleth map]]s more visually accurate for the viewer. In his paper, ''The Data Model Concept in Statistical Mapping'', he claims that by visualizing data in a three dimensional model cartographers could devise a “systematic and rational method for preparing choroplethic maps”.&lt;ref name="Jenks" /&gt; Jenks used the analogy of a “blanket of error” to describe the need to use elements other than the mean to generalize data. The three dimensional models were created to help Jenks visualize the difference between data classes. His aim was to generalize the data using as few planes as possible and maintain a constant “blanket of error”.

==Method==
The method requires an iterative process. That is, calculations must be repeated using different breaks in the dataset to determine which set of breaks has the smallest in-class [[variance]]. The process is started by dividing the ordered data into groups. Initial group divisions can be arbitrary. There are four steps that must be repeated:
#Calculate the sum of squared deviations between classes (SDBC).
#Calculate the sum of squared deviations from the array mean (SDAM).
#Subtract the SDBC from the SDAM (SDAM-SDBC). This equals the sum of the squared deviations from the class means (SDCM).
#After inspecting each of the SDBC, a decision is made to move one unit from the class with the largest SDBC toward the class with the lowest SDBC.

New class deviations are then calculated, and the process is repeated until the sum of the within class deviations reaches a minimal value.&lt;ref name="Jenks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESRI"&gt;ESRI FAQ, [http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&amp;d=26442 What is the Jenks Optimization method]{{Dead link|{{subst:DATE}}|date=May 2018}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, all break combinations may be examined, SDCM calculated for each combination, and the combination with the lowest SDCM selected. Since all break combinations are examined, this guarantees that the one with the lowest SDCM is found.

Finally, the goodness of variance fit (GVF) is calculated. GVF is defined as (SDAM - SDCM) / SDAM. GVF ranges from 0 (worst fit) to 1 (perfect fit).

==Uses==

{{main article|Choropleth map}}
Jenks’ goal in developing this method was to create a map that was absolutely accurate, in terms of the representation of data’s spatial attributes. By following this process, Jenks claims, the “blanket of error” can be uniformly distributed across the mapped surface. He developed this with the intention of using relatively few data classes, less than seven, because that was the limit when using monochromatic shading on a choroplethic map.&lt;ref name="Jenks" /&gt;

==Alternative methods==
{{Main article|Cluster analysis}}

Other methods of data classification include [[Head/tail Breaks]], Natural Breaks (without Jenks Optimization), Equal Interval, Quantile, and Standard Deviation.

'''Karl Gottlieb Mauch''' (7 May 1837 – 4 April 1875) was a German explorer and geographer of Africa. He reported on the archaeological ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] in 1871 during his search for the biblical land of [[Ophir]].

==Exploration and Great Zimbabwe==
[[File:Conical tower.jpg|thumb|left|Some of the ruins of Great Zimbabwe as they appear today]]
In 1871, Mauch discovered the stone ruins now known as [[Great Zimbabwe]], five years after discovering the first gold mines in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. Mauch believed that the ruins were the remnants of the lost biblical city of [[Ophir]], described as the origin of the gold given by the [[Queen of Sheba]] to [[Solomon|King Solomon]]. He did not believe that the structures could have been built by a previous local population similar to those which inhabited the area at the time of his excavation, and so pressed ahead with his research. Further research on the site (including one of the first [[Aerial archaeology|archaeological uses of aviation]]) illustrated that the structures did indeed have African origin. 

Because of the [[ethnocentrism]] popular in the 19th century, Mauch and his contemporaries have been intensely criticized for their assumptions about the site by modern archaeologists. The Great Zimbabwe site is now considered to have been built by ancestors of the [[Shona people]] between the 11th and 15th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zimb/hd_zimb.htm|title=Great Zimbabwe (11th–15th century) – Thematic Essay|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mauch died as a result of a fall from the third floor window of a hotel where he was living. It is uncertain whether the death was accidental or self-inflicted.&lt;ref name="raiders"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Real King Solomon's Mines |series=Raiders of the Lost Past |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2473628/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_7 |publisher=World Media Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media and popular culture==
"The Real King Solomon's Mines" was the fifth episode in World Media Rights' ''Raiders of the Lost Past'' [[docudrama]] series, and focused on the life of Mauch and his quest to discover the fabled mines.&lt;ref name="raiders" /&gt; The episode was first transmitted in the UK via the [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday channel]] on 23 November 2012, was directed by Gerry Pomeroy, narrated by Jonny Phillips and featured Ross Owen Williams as Karl Mauch. In the week of its first transmission, the Sunday Times Culture Magazine recommended the episode as a pick of the week.  In North America, the episode was included in the television history series ''Myth Hunters''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4631">[[File:EKB keyboard fixed.jpg|thumb|The monument in 2011, the building in the background is sometimes dubbed the "[[computer case]]"]]'''Keyboard Monument''' is an outdoor sculpture featuring the [[QWERTY]]/[[JCUKEN]] keyboard. It is located in the Russian city of [[Yekaterinburg]] alternatively spelt Ekaterinburg and is popular among tourists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/sports/world-cup/yekaterinburg-keyboard-monument.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="englishrussia2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishrussia.com/2006/10/09/keyboard-monument/ |title=Keyboard Monument |publisher=English Russia |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==

It was created by Anatoly Vyatkin and installed on October 5, 2005 on the embankment of the [[Iset River]] in the city centre.&lt;ref name="englishrussia2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jessica Patterson |url=http://design.org/blog/walk-keyboard-russian-qwerty-keyboard-stones-monument |title=Walk the Keyboard: Russian QWERTY Keyboard Stones Monument &amp;#124; Design Blog |publisher=design.org |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landmark depicts an [[IBM PC compatible]] [[Cyrillic]] computer keyboard at 30:1 scale (the area covered by the monument is 16 × 4 m), with 104 concrete keys. Each regular key weighs 180 pounds, while the [[space bar]] alone weighs 1,000&amp;nbsp;pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publiciti.ru/en/news/8russian-it-pros-decide-the-fate-of-keyboard-monument01 |title=Russian IT Pros Decide The Fate Of Keyboard Monument |publisher=publiciti.ru |date=2011-04-25 |accessdate=2011-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811035254/http://www.publiciti.ru/en/news/8russian-it-pros-decide-the-fate-of-keyboard-monument01 |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The keyboard attracts many visitors to the city and is today considered one of its top sights.

== Events ==
Regular celebrations are held near the object. Among them the annual internationally recognised [[Sysadmin Day]] on the last Friday in July. Before 2010 Ekaterinburg technicians were gathering at separate places, and since 2010 Ekaterinburg authorities granted official permission for the event to be held near the Keyboard Monument with support from IT companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} http://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-331716.html&lt;/ref&gt;  There are "sysadmin competitions" between participants: they throw defunct [[Computer mouse|PC mice]] to reach maximum distance and also throw such mice (with their "tails" cut out) within an empty distant [[computer case]] used as basket. Additionally, they [[powerlifting|powerlift]] a bundle of unused [[Hard disk drive|HDDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} http://www.ural.kp.ru/photo/66600/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 during such an event a memorial plaque was set up at the monument to honour {{ill|Eugene Zorin|ru|Зорин, Евгений Александрович}}, the Ekaterinburg [[FidoNet]] organiser and Internet pioneer who died recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [[n:ru:Память уральского общественника Евгения Зорина увековечили на одной из клавиш Памятника клавиатуре]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of April, the "Keyboard [[Subbotnik]]s" are also held, when people are cleaning and re-painting the monument, and "sports competitions" also take place.

'''Krasnodar Krai''' ({{lang-rus|Краснода́рский край|r=Krasnodarsky kray|p=krəsnɐˈdarskʲɪj kraj}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (a [[krai]]), located in the [[North Caucasus]] region in [[Southern Russia]] and administratively a part of the [[Southern Federal District]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Krasnodar]]. The third most-populous federal subject, the krai had a population of&amp;nbsp;5,226,647 as of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]].&lt;ref name="2010Census"&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krasnodar Krai is formally and informally referred to as '''Kuban''', a term denoting former [[Kuban People's Republic]] and historic region of [[Kuban]] situated between the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Kuban River]] which is mostly composed of the krai's territory. It is bordered by [[Rostov Oblast]] to the north, [[Stavropol Krai]] to the east, [[Karachay-Cherkessia]] to the south-east, and [[Adygea]] is an [[enclave]] entirely within the krai. Krasnodar Krai shares an international border with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the south, and a [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|disputed border]] with [[Crimea]] across the [[Kerch Strait]].

The northern part of the krai belongs to the [[Don Steppe]], while southern region's [[Mediterranean climate]] has made it a popular [[Tourism|tourist]] location. [[Novorossiysk]] is Russia's main port on the Black Sea, one of the few cities awarded the title of the [[Hero City]],
and [[Sochi]] was host of the [[XXII Olympic Winter Games]] in 2014. Krasnodar Krai is home to significant infrastructure of the [[Russian Navy]]'s [[Black Sea Fleet]].

==Geography==
Krasnodar Krai is located in the southwestern part of the [[North Caucasus]] and borders with [[Rostov Oblast]] in the northeast, [[Stavropol Krai]] and [[Karachay-Cherkessia]] in the east, and with the [[Abkhazia]] region (internationally recognized as part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) in the south.&lt;ref name="OffSiteGeo"&gt;Official website of Krasnodar Krai.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The region's earliest known inhabitants are referred to, generically, as the [[Maeotians|''Maiōtai'']] (after the Greek name for the [[Maeotian Swamp|Sea of Azov]]). During the 6th century BCE, [[Pontic Greeks]], founded the area's first cities, such as ''[[Phanagoria]]'' (near modern [[Sennoy, Krasnodar Krai|Sennoy]]) and ''[[Hermonassa]]'' (on the [[Taman Peninsula]]),  who traded with nomadic tribes including the [[Scythians|''Skuthai'']] (Scythians) and [[Sindi people|''Sindi'']].

From the 8th to the 10th centuries, the area was dominated by the [[Khazars]], a [[Turkic people]] who had earlier migrated from the east onto the [[Pontic-Caspian Steppe]], where they reputedly converted to [[Judaism]].  After the defeat of the [[Khazar Khanate]] in 965 [[Kievan prince]] [[Svyatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] conquered the area, it came under the rule of [[Kievan Rus']], and it then formed the Tmutarakan principality. Later, due to the increasing claims of Byzantium at the end of the 11th century, the Tmutarakan principality came under the authority of the Byzantine emperors (until 1204).

In that period of history, the [[Circassians]] were first mentioned, under the ethnonym ''Kasogs''.  For example, Rededi Prince Kasozhsky was mentioned in ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''.

In 1243–1438 the current territory of the Kuban was part of the [[Golden Horde]]. After the collapse of the latter, parts of Kuban were held under the Crimean Khanate, Circassia, and the [[Ottoman Empire]], which dominated the region. The [[Tsardom of Russia]] began to challenge the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire in the area during the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russian-Turkish wars]].

In April 1783, by decree of [[Catherine II]], right-bank Kuban and Taman Peninsula were annexed to the [[Russian Empire]]. In the years 1792–1793 Cossacks moved here from [[Zaporizhia|Zaporozhye]], now located in Ukraine, and formed the Black Sea Area troops, with the creation of a solid cordon line for the [[Kuban River]] and the marginalization of the neighboring [[Circassians]].

During the campaign for control of the [[North Caucasus]] ([[Caucasian War|Caucasian war 1763–1864]]) Russia pushed away the Ottoman Empire from the region, followed by [[Circassian genocide|elimination of local population]] ([[Circassians]]) as well. For this see [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus#Black Sea Coast|Russian conquest of the Western Caucasus]].

In 1783, the present northern territory of the Kuban region became part of Russia after the liquidation of the Crimean Khanate. A border garrison was located there from 1793–1794 in order to protect the Kuban River. The remaining area was relegated to the Cossacks, initiating development of the region. The administrative region was accorded the status of "Land of Black Sea Cossack Army".

In 1860, most of the occupied area of the territory of the modern Kuban-Krasnodar region was formed of, and controlled by, remnants of the [[Black Sea Cossack Host]] and the western part of the [[Caucasus Line Cossack Host]], who were to become the [[Kuban Cossacks|Kuban Cossack Army]].

In 1900, the region's population numbered around two million people. In 1913, the gross grain harvest Kuban region entered the 2nd place in Russia, for the production of marketable grain – in the 1st place.
Krasnodar Krai was founded on 13 September 1937, when [[Azov-Black Sea Krai]] of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian SFSR]] was split up in Krasnodar Krai and [[Rostov Oblast]].
{{also|Kuban-Black Sea Oblast}}

==Politics==
[[File:Krasnodar 002.JPG|thumb|Krai Administration building in Krasnodar]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the krai was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Krasnodar CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the Krai Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the Krai Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the krai administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Krasnodar Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Krasnodar Krai]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the krai government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The krai administration supports the activities of the governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the Krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Krasnodar Krai}}

Krasnodar Krai is administratively divided into thirty-eight [[raion|districts]] (''raions'') and fifteen [[city of federal subject significance|cities of district equivalence]]. The districts and cities are further subdivided into eleven [[town of district significance|towns]], plus [[urban-type settlement of district significance|urban-type settlements]], and [[selsoviet|rural okrugs and stanitsa okrugs]].

==Economy==
Large companies in the region include [[Magnit|Tander]], [[Novorossmetal]], [[Autonomous Heat Energy Company]], [[Gazprom gas distribution Krasnodar]], [[Evrokhim]] Chemical Fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Krasnodar Territory Industries |url=https://www.investinregions.ru/en/regions/krasnodarsky/industries/ |website=investinregions.ru |accessdate=7 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-train Lastochka on station Sochi.jpg|thumb|EMU train Lastotschka, [[Sochi]]]]

Several lines of [[Russian Railways]] cross the region and link it with [[Abkhazia]], [[Ukraine]], and neighboring Russian regions. There are direct trains from resort cities like [[Sochi]] and [[Anapa]] to [[Moscow]], via [[Krasnodar]], which become very popular during the summer vacation season. There are also suburb train connections.
The [[Apsheronsk narrow-gauge railway]], the longest [[Mountain railway|mountain]] [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge railway]] in Russia, runs through Krasnodar Krai.

There are several airports in the region, including [[Krasnodar International Airport]], [[Sochi International Airport]], [[Anapa Airport]], and [[Gelendzhik Airport]].

The biggest ports are [[Novorossiysk]] and [[Tuapse]]. Others are [[Eisk]] and [[Temryuk]] on the [[Azov Sea]], and [[Port Kavkaz]],   [[Taman, Russia|Taman]], [[Anapa]], [[Gelendzhik]], and [[Sochi]] on the [[Black Sea]]. There is a [[Kerch Strait ferry line]] which connects Krasnodar Krai and [[Crimea]].

The population of Krasnodar Krai is concentrated in the [[Kuban River]] drainage basin, which was traditionally [[Cossack]] land (see'' [[History of Cossacks]]''). The [[Kuban Cossacks]] are now generally considered to be ethnic Russians, even though they are still an important minority in their own right in the area. [[Kuban Cossacks#National identity|Historically]], they were considered to be ethnic Ukrainian{{fact|date=February 2018}}, and reported their language as Ukrainian in censuses well into the 20th century; this change in identity is due to assimilation and historical persecution of the Kuban Cossacks{{fact|date=February 2018}}, which was particularly prominent due to questions of their loyalty{{fact|date=February 2018}} to Moscow and the Communist state during the Russian Revolution and First World War{{fact|date=March 2018}}. Other notable ethnic groups are the [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]], who have lived in the Kuban area for thousands of years, and the [[Armenians]] (including Christian [[Hamsheni]] and [[Cherkesogai]]), who have lived in the region since at least the 18th century.

A [[landlocked country|landlocked]] [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]] is any state whose territorial boundaries do not touch an ocean, gulf, or bay. All of the landlocked states in the U.S. are situated in the [[contiguous United States|contiguous 48 states]] on the North American mainland.
[[File:Landlocked US States.png|thumbnail|The landlocked U.S. states do not touch any ocean, gulf, or bay]]
*16 states and the federal capital, [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]], are considered to be '''singly landlocked''' given that one must travel through only one other U.S. state, Mexican state, or Canadian province to reach an ocean, gulf, or bay. One state, [[Hawaii]], is completely insular, meaning it only borders water and no other territories.
*10 states are considered '''doubly landlocked''' because to reach a major body of water, one must travel through two U.S. states, Mexican states, or Canadian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Doubly Landlocked US States |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-doubly-landlocked-us-states.html |website=World Atlas |publisher=World Atlas |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Only 1 state, Nebraska, is '''triply landlocked''' as one must travel through three U.S. states, or two U.S. states and one Canadian province to reach an ocean, gulf, or bay

==Singly landlocked==
The 16 singly landlocked states, and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], with routes to their nearest ocean, gulf, or bay:

*[[Arizona]] – [[California]] to the Pacific Ocean or [[Sonora]] to the [[Gulf of California]]
*[[Arkansas]] – [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]], or [[Mississippi]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which is part of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]
*[[District of Columbia]] – [[Virginia]] or [[Maryland]] to the Atlantic Ocean
*[[Idaho]] – British Columbia, Washington or Oregon to the [[Pacific Ocean]]
*[[Kentucky]] – Virginia to the Atlantic Ocean
*[[Michigan]] – [[Ontario]] (water boundaries) to [[James Bay]], an inlet of [[Hudson Bay]], which is part of the [[Arctic Ocean]]
*[[Minnesota]] – Ontario to James Bay, or [[Manitoba]] to Hudson Bay
*[[Montana]] – [[British Columbia]] to the Pacific Ocean
*[[Nevada]] – California or Oregon to the Pacific Ocean
*[[New Mexico]] – [[Texas]] to the Gulf of Mexico
*[[North Dakota]] – Manitoba to Hudson Bay
*[[Ohio]] – Ontario (water boundary) to James Bay
*[[Oklahoma]] – Texas to the Gulf of Mexico
*[[Pennsylvania]] – [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], or [[Maryland]] to the Atlantic Ocean or [[Chesapeake Bay]]; or Ontario (water boundary) to James Bay
*[[Tennessee]] – [[North Carolina]], [[Virginia]], or [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the Atlantic Ocean; [[Alabama]] or [[Mississippi]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]
*[[Vermont]] – [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]] or [[Quebec]] to the Atlantic Ocean (Quebec also bounds the Arctic Ocean, via James Bay, Hudson Bay and [[Ungava Bay]])
*[[West Virginia]] – Virginia or Maryland to the Atlantic Ocean

==Doubly landlocked==
The 10 doubly landlocked states, with routes to their nearest ocean, gulf, or bay:

*[[Colorado]] – New Mexico or Oklahoma, then Texas to the Gulf of Mexico
*[[Illinois]] – Michigan (water boundary) then Ontario to James Bay or, Kentucky then Virginia to the Atlantic Ocean
*[[Indiana]] – Michigan then Ontario to Hudson Bay; or, Kentucky then Virginia to the Atlantic Ocean
*[[Iowa]] – Minnesota then Manitoba or Ontario to James Bay or Hudson Bay
*[[Kansas]] – Oklahoma then Texas to the Gulf of Mexico
*[[Missouri]] – Arkansas then Louisiana, Mississippi, or Texas to the Gulf of Mexico; or, Oklahoma then Texas to the Gulf of Mexico; or, Tennessee then Alabama or Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico; or, Tennessee then Virginia, North Carolina, or Georgia to the Atlantic Ocean; or, Kentucky then Virginia to the Atlantic Ocean
*[[South Dakota]] – Minnesota then Ontario to James Bay; or North Dakota then Manitoba to Hudson Bay
*[[Utah]] – Idaho then British Columbia, Washington or Oregon to the Pacific Ocean; or Nevada or Arizona, then California to the Pacific Ocean; or Nevada then Oregon to the Pacific Ocean
*[[Wisconsin]] – Michigan or Minnesota, then Ontario to James Bay or Manitoba to Hudson Bay
*[[Wyoming]] – Idaho then British Columbia, Washington or Oregon to the Pacific Ocean; or, Montana then British Columbia to the Pacific Ocean

==Triply landlocked==
[[Nebraska]] is the only triply landlocked state.&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fischer |first1=Deb |title=Senate Passes Fischer-Sasse USS Omaha Resolution New Littoral Combat Ship Will Be Commissioned This Weekend |url=https://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/1/senate-passes-fischer-sasse-uss-omaha-resolution-new-littoral-combat-ship-will-be-commissioned-this-weekend |website=Deb Fischer – U.S. Senator for Nebraska |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reach an ocean, gulf, or bay from Nebraska, one must travel through at least three states, such as through Missouri, Tennessee, and North Carolina to reach the Atlantic Ocean, or through Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon to reach the Pacific.

The APPEM won the most votes in the 1996 elections.--&gt;

[[File:Tallest buildings in the European Union.png|500px|thumb|Tallest buildings in the European Union.]]
This list ranks the '''tallest buildings in the [[European Union]]''' that stand at least {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} tall, based on standard height measurement. This means that [[spire]]s and other architectural details are included in the official height, but not [[Radio masts and towers|antenna masts]], as it is defined by the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]]. Only habitable buildings are ranked, which excludes [[radio masts and towers]], [[observation tower]]s, [[cathedral]]s, [[Steeple (architecture)|steeples]], [[chimney]]s and other tall architectural structures. Since 2011, the tallest building in the EU has been [[Shard London Bridge|The Shard]] in London, United Kingdom, at {{convert|310|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}.

==Existing buildings==

This list includes buildings under construction that have already been architecturally [[Topping out|topped out]]. Architectural height is considered, so masts and other elements added after completion of building are not considered.

===Buildings by pinnacle height===
Some skyscraper enthusiasts prefer this measurement, claiming that the extensions that can or cannot be deemed "architectural" are subjective. However, many non-architectural extensions (such as radio antennas) are easily added and removed from tall buildings without significantly changing the style and design of the building, which is seen as a significant part of the value of these buildings.

The list includes all skyscrapers of at least {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} tall. However the height data is subject to fluctuations due to simple changing of mast extensions. This list includes buildings under construction that have already been architecturally topped out.

Note: Until 1990, the [[Palace of Culture and Science]] in [[Warsaw]] surpassed the height of the then tallest EU building; however, Poland did not [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|become a member of the European Union]] until 2004. Also, Madrid buildings [[Edificio España]] and [[Torre de Madrid]] also surpassed the height of the then tallest EU building until 1966, but Spain became a European Union member in 1986.

'''Maciej Miechowita''' (also known as ''Maciej z Miechowa, Maciej of Miechów, Maciej Karpiga, Matthias de Miechow''; 1457 &amp;ndash; 8 September 1523) was a [[Polish renaissance]] scholar, professor of [[Jagiellonian University]], historian, chronicler, geographer, medical doctor (royal physician of king [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland), [[alchemy|alchemist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet/historia/historiatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021120144715/http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet%2Fhistoria%2Fhistoriatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en |date=2002-11-20 }}; Włodzimierz Hubicki, "Fuitne olim alchimia in Academia Cracoviensi lecta?" ''Kwartalnik historii nauki i techniki'' 9 (1964): 199–210.&lt;/ref&gt; [[astrologer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.edu.pl/IRO/NEWSLET/IRO13/ZIEJKA2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809093747/http://www.uj.edu.pl/IRO/NEWSLET/IRO13/ZIEJKA2.html |archivedate=2007-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Kraków]].

He studied at the Jagiellonian University (also known that as the Cracow Academy), obtaining his [[master's degree]] in 1479. Between 1480-1485 he studied abroad. Upon his return to the country, he became a professor at the Jagiellonian University, where he served as a [[Rector (academia)|rector]] eight times (1501–1519), and also twice as a deputy [[chancellor]] of the Academia.

His ''Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis'' (Treatise on the Two Sarmatias) is considered the first accurate [[geography|geographical]] and [[ethnography|ethnographical]] description of [[Eastern Europe]]. It provided the first systematic description of the lands between the [[Vistula]], the [[Don River, Russia|Don]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. This work also repeated after [[Jan Długosz]] and popularised abroad the [[mythology|myth]] of [[Sarmatism]]: that Polish nobility ([[szlachta]]) are descendants from the ancient [[Sarmatians]].&lt;ref name="sarmatian review"&gt;[[Andrzej Wasko]], Sarmatism or the Enlightenment:The Dilemma of Polish Culture[[Sarmatian Review]] XVII.2, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/497/wasko.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Chronica Polonorum'' (Polish Chronicle) is the developed, larger treaty about Polish history and geography. ''Contra pestem sevam regimen'' and ''Conservatio sanitatis'' are his two printed medical treaties, about how to combat epidemics and on benefit of sanitation.

He has also written other works, many of which appeared only in manuscripts and were not printed during his lifetime, like his biography of Saint [[John Cantius]].

{{nihongo|'''Mainland Japan'''|内地|naichi|lit. "inner lands"}} is a term to distinguish the area of [[Japan]] from its outlying territories. It was an official term in the [[World War II|pre-war]] period, distinguishing Japan and the colonies in [[East Asia]]. After the end of [[World War II]], the term became uncommon, but still is used as an unofficial term to distinguish the area of Japan from [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] or [[Hokkaidō]].

The literal Japanese meaning might best be translated as inner Japan or inner lands.  The term "mainland" is an inaccurate translation because [[mainland]] is usually the continental part of a region, as opposed to the islands.

It is also somewhat confusing as Mainland Japan is defined to consist of several major islands ([[Hokkaidō]], [[Honshū]], [[Kyūshū]], [[Shikoku]]) and many minor ones.  The term mainland Japan is also sometimes used to translate [[Honshū]], the largest island.

==Historical usage==
In the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] of the [[World War II|pre-war]] period, ''naichi'' referred to the mainland of the empire. The other territories of the empire was called ''gaichi'' (外地, lit. "outer lands").

1 of the Common Law ([[:ja:共通法|共通法]]) enumerates the territories with legal jurisdictions, namely,
* ''Naichi'' (Mainland Japan),
* [[Korea under Japanese rule|Chōsen]] (Korea),
* [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]],
* [[Kwantung Leased Territory|Kwantung Province]], and
* [[South Pacific Mandate|Nan'yō Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web |url=http://www.geocities.jp/nakanolib/hou/ht07-39.htm |title=''Kyōtsūhō'' 共通法 |author=Nakano Bunko 中野文庫 |accessdate=10 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, ''Naichi'' consisted of the following{{cn|date=December 2011}}:
*[[Karafuto Prefecture]](after 1943)
*[[Kuril Islands|Chishima Islands]]
*[[Hokkaidō]]
*[[Honshū]]
*[[Shikoku]]
*[[Kyūshū]]
*[[Izu Islands]]
*[[Ogasawara Islands]]
*[[Okinawa]]
*Minor outlying islands around them
Although it has never been abolished, the Common Law lost effect from enforcement after Japan lost all the former colonies, or ''gaichi'' as a result of [[World War II]].

==Modern usage==
The residents of Hokkaidō and Okinawa occasionally use ''naichi'' to refer to the "mainland", excluding these areas. The colloquial usage is officially "incorrect", as both areas are legally within ''naichi''. In Hokkaidō, the official term that refers to Japan except Hokkaidō is ''Dōgai'' (lit. outside of Hokkaidō). With ''Dōgai'' becoming common even in colloquial use, ''naichi'' ceases to be used.

'''Minṭaqah''' ({{Lang-ar|منطقة}} {{IPA-ar|ˈmintˤaqa|}}; plural {{lang|ar|مناطق}} ''manāṭiq'' {{IPA-ar|maˈnaːtˤiq|}}) is a first-level [[administrative division]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Chad]] and for a second-level administrative division in several other [[Arab world|Arab countries]]. It is often translated as ''[[region]]'' or ''[[district]]'', but the literal meaning is "region" or "area".

==Usage==
* [[Regions of Bahrain]] (formerly, top-level, replaced by governorates)
* [[Regions of Oman]] (formerly, top-level, alongside governorates, now only governorates)
* [[Regions of Chad]] (top-level)
* [[Regions of Saudi Arabia]] (top-level, above governorates)
* [[Districts of Syria]] (second-level, below governorates) - A ''mintaqah'' in [[Syria]] was formerly called ''[[qadaa]]''.
* [[Districts of Israel]] (top-level)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1477">A '''mouth bar''' is a [[bar (river morphology)|bar]] in a [[river]] that is typically created in the middle of a [[channel (geography)|channel]] in a [[river delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2006JF000574|title=Mechanics of river mouth bar formation: Implications for the morphodynamics of delta distributary networks|year=2007|author=Edmonds, D.

L.|bibcode=2007JGRF..11202034E}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is created by a [[positive feedback]] between mid-channel [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] and flow divergence. As the flow diverges near the [[ocean]], [[sediment]] settles out in the channel and creates an incipient mouth bar. As flow is routed around the incipient bar, additional sediment is deposited on the incipient bar. This continued process results in the formation of a full-fledged mouth bar, which causes the channel to [[River bifurcation|bifurcate]]. This continued process leads to the characteristic [[fractal tree]] pattern found in some [[progradation|prograding]] river-dominated deltas.

'''[[Neotropical]]''' is a [[zoogeographic]] term that covers a large part of the [[Americas]], roughly from Mexico and the Caribbean southwards (including cold regions in southernmost South America). 

'''[[Palaeotropical]]''' refers to geographical occurrence. For a distribution to be palaeotropical a taxon must occur in tropical regions in the [[Old World]].

According to Takhtajan (1978), the following families have a pantropical distribution: 
[[Annonaceae]], [[Hernandiaceae]], [[Lauraceae]], [[Piperaceae]], [[Urticaceae]], [[Dilleniaceae]], [[Tetrameristaceae]], [[Passifloraceae]], [[Bombacaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Rhizophoraceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Anacardiaceae]], [[Sapindaceae]], [[Malpighiaceae]], [[Proteaceae]], [[Bignoniaceae]], [[Orchidaceae]] and [[Arecaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Тахтаджян А.

On the occasion of a visit by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to the [[British Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in London on 18 December 2012, it was announced there that a {{convert|437000|km2|adj=on}} area of the [[British Antarctic Territory]] had been named Queen Elizabeth Land after The Queen.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|title=UK to name part of Antarctica Queen Elizabeth Land|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20757382|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]], [[William Hague]], said that the naming was "a fitting tribute at the end of [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee]] year".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Queen Elizabeth Land is nearly twice the size of the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; and is essentially a triangular segment of [[Antarctica]], with one vertex at the [[South Pole]]. It is bounded on the North side by the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]], to the North East by [[Coats Land]], on the East by [[Queen Maud Land]] and extending on the West side to a line between the South Pole and [[Rutford Ice Stream]], east of [[Constellation Inlet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/queen-elizabeth-land Queen Elizabeth Land], Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office.

== Reaction ==
[[Argentina]], whose [[Argentine Antarctica]] claim overlaps with the British Antarctic Territory, criticised the naming calling it a "systematic attack" and described it as "provocation" after recent tensions over Argentina's claim to the [[Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands|sovereignty]] of the [[Falkland Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Strange |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3636121.ece |title=Argentina fury as Britain names disputed Antarctic territory ‘Queen Elizabeth Land’ |publisher=The Times |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] issued a statement regarding the naming, where they reminded that Russia was one of the original parties to the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959 and calling for the full, unconditional and responsible compliance by all State parties with its provisions (which included the UK). According to the Russians, "no acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial in Antarctica and do not create any rights of sovereignty in Antarctica".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Russia issues statement on Queen Elizabeth Land | publisher = ''New Europe Online'' | url = http://www.neurope.eu/article/russia-issues-statement-queen-elizabeth-land | date = 27 December 2012 | accessdate = 11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil conservation''' is the preventing of soil loss from [[erosion]] or reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, salinization or other chemical [[soil contamination]].

[[Slash-and-burn]] and other unsustainable methods of [[subsistence farming]] are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale [[erosion]], loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total [[desertification]]. Techniques for improved soil conservation include [[crop rotation]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Tillage#Conservation tillage|conservation tillage]] and planted [[windbreak]]s and affect both erosion and fertility. When plants, especially trees, die, they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].
Farmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Borrelli|first2=Pasquale|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Alewell|first4=Christine|last5=Lugato|first5=Emanuele|last6=Montanarella|first6=Luca|title=Estimating the soil erosion cover-management factor at the European scale|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837715001611|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=48|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; plant residues and grass margins in order to better address the soil conservation.Political and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we name and value the land and what we call it and this can be changed by cultural adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Imeson|first2=Anton|last3=Meusburger|first3=Katrin|last4=Borrelli|first4=Pasquale|last5=Poesen|first5=Jean|last6=Alewell|first6=Christine|date=2016-08-01|title=Soil Conservation in Europe: Wish or Reality?|journal=Land Degradation &amp; Development|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1547–1551|doi=10.1002/ldr.2538|issn=1099-145X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contour ploughing  ==
[[Contour ploughing]] orients furrows following the [[contour line]]s of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, and is effective for slopes between two and ten percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Predicting soil erosion by water, a guide to conservation planning in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation'', [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Agricultural Research Service, Agricultural handbook no. 703 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Contour plowing can increase crop yields from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/contourfarmingbo23unit|title=Contour farming boosts yields: a farmer's guide in laying out key contour lines and establishing grassed waterways|last=United States. Department of Agriculture|first=National Agricultural Library|date=1943-01-01|publisher=[Washington, D.C.] : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Terrace Farming ==
[[terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of steps, each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers.

Terraced farming is more common on small farms and in underdeveloped countries, since mechanized equipment is difficult to deploy in this setting.
It protects the soil from its erosion. It is one of the way by which soil erosion can be stopped. It is the step can be cut out on the slopes making terraces. It restricts soil erosion. It is practiced in western and central Himalayas

== Keyline design ==

[[Keyline design]] is an enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed properties are taken into account in forming the [[contour line]]s.

== Perimeter runoff control ==
[[File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv|thumb|350px|runoff and filter soxx]]

Tree, [[shrub]]s and [[ground-cover]] are effective perimeter treatment for [[soil erosion]] prevention, by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the use of a “grass way” that both [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s and dissipates runoff through surface friction, impeding [[surface runoff]] and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.&lt;ref&gt;''Perimeter landscaping of Carneros Business Park'', Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca., prepared for Sonoma County, Ca. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Windbreaks==

Windbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of [[tree]]s at the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] exposure of an agricultural field subject to [[wind]] [[erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Summer, ''Modelling Soil Erosion, Sediment Transport and Closely Related Hydrological Processes'' entry by Mingyuan Du, Peiming Du, Taichi Maki and Shigeto Kawashima, “Numerical modeling of air flow over complex terrain concerning wind erosion”, International Association of Hydrological Sciences publication no. 249 (1998)  {{ISBN|1-901502-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen]] [[species]] provide year-round protection; however, as long as [[foliage]] is present in the seasons of bare [[soil]] surfaces, the effect of [[deciduous]] trees may be adequate.

== Cover crops/crop rotation ==

Cover crops such as legumes plant, white turnip, radishes and other species are rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as [[green manure]] that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news

== Soil-conservation farming ==

Soil-conservation farming involves [[no-till farming]], “green manures” and other soil-enhancing practices.  Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of [[barren lands]]. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Salinity management==
[[File:Aralship2.jpg|thumb|right|Salt deposits on the former bed of the [[Aral Sea]]]]

{{Main article|Soil salinity control}}
[[Salinity]] in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.
 
The [[ions]] responsible for salination are: [[sodium]] (Na&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;2+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and [[chlorine]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth’s [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Yaron, ''Salinity in Irrigation and Water Resources'', Marcel Dekker, New York (1981)   {{ISBN|0-8247-6741-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil salinity adversely affects crop [[metabolism]] and erosion usually follows.

Salinity occurs on [[drylands]] from [[Irrigation|overirrigation]] and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow [[saline water]] table [[capillary action]] occurred in [[Egypt]] after the 1970 construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. The change in the [[groundwater]] level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the [[water table]] led to [[soil salination]].

Use of [[humic acid]]s may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation. Humic acids can fix both [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s and eliminate them from [[root|root zones]]. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include [[saltbush]], a plant found in much of [[North America]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] regions of [[Europe]].

Pagal Organisms In Soil
[[File:K 1033CR08-9 Yellow fungus on stalk.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Yellow fungus, a [[mushroom]] that assists in organic decay.]]

When worms excrete [[faeces|egesta]] in the form of [[Vermicompost|casts]], a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible for [[root]] uptake. [[Earthworm]] casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s and eleven times richer in available [[potash]] than the surrounding upper {{Convert|150|mm}} of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil [[poros]]ity, creating channels that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Bill  Mollison, ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'', Tagari Press, (December 1, 1988), 576 pages, {{ISBN|0908228015}}. Increases in porosity enhance infiltration and thus reduce adverse effects of [[surface runoff]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important soil organisms include [[nematodes]], [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrizha]] and [[bacteria]].

Degraded soil requires [[synthetic fertilizer]] to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold '''20,000''' gallons more water per acre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mineralization==
To allow plants full realization of their [[phytonutrient]] potential, active [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of the soil is sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to [[combat]] [[mineral]] depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such  as [[phosphorus]] and more exotic substances such as [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur T. Hubbard, ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science Vol 3'', Santa Barbara, California Science Project, Marcel Dekker, New York (2004) {{ISBN|0-8247-0759-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flooding can bring significant [[sediments]] to an [[alluvial]] plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a [[floodplain]] is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.

The '''Union for Ethical BioTrade''' (UEBT) is a [[nonprofit]] association that promotes the "Sourcing with Respect" of ingredients that come from [[biodiversity]]. Members commit to gradually ensuring that their sourcing practices promote the conservation of biodiversity, respect [[traditional knowledge]] and assure the equitable sharing of benefits all along the [[supply chain]], following the Ethical BioTrade Standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethicalbiotrade.org/dl/public-and-outreach/Ethical-BioTrade-Standard_2012.pdf Ethical BioTrade Standard]&lt;/ref&gt; Members also commit to the UEBT verification system, which includes undergoing independent third party verification against the Ethical BioTrade Standard, developing a work-plan for gradual compliance for all [[natural]], as well as the commitment to continuous improvement once compliance is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISEAL homepage|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/online-community/organisations/union-for-ethical-biotrade|accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

UEBT is a membership-based organisation that was created in May 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN Foundation|title=UN Foundation|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/partners/organizations/union-for-ethical-biotrade.html|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Geneva, Switzerland. It was conceptualized in response to multiple developments. First of all, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)]] acknowledged that additional efforts were needed to reach out to the [[private sector]]. The CBD recognized the strong link between business and biodiversity, as well as the dependency of industry on biodiversity and it highlighted the key role the private sector plays in sustainable use and the need for efforts and tools to engage it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Pierre William|title=Ethical biotrade as a business alternative to biopiracy: three levels of interpretations of emerging social demands|url=http://www.esee2011.org/registration/fullpapers/esee2011_44cd7a_1_1305151108_1144_2120.pdf|publisher=REEDS, University of Versailles|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pursuit of the decisions that CBD parties had taken regarding private sector engagement and the use of standards in this, the idea of UEBT was conceived. The creation of the Union for Ethical BioTrade also responded to the need expressed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries for ways to differentiate biodiversity-based products in the market. Finally, UEBT built upon efforts initiated by the BioTrade Initiative of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), which was created to contribute to making biodiversity a strategy for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotrade.org/index.asp BioTrade Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2007, a meeting of the founding members took place and the articles of association were approved. To support the efforts of the Union, the CBD and UEBT signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] in December 2008, to encourage companies involved in BioTrade to adopt and promote good practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Convention on Biological Diversity|title=Memorandum of Understanding|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/agreements/agmt-union-biotrade-2011-08-18-mou-web-en.pdf|publisher=CBD|accessdate=1-5-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim ==

Although the CBD and CSD provide general principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD BioTrade Initiative - BioTrade Principles and Criteria|url=http://www.biotrade.org/ResourcesPublications/UNCTAD_BT_PC_en.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; not much practical guidance is currently available to help business advance on the ethical sourcing of biodiversity. UEBT fills this gap and makes concrete contributions to biodiversity [[Habitat conservation|conservation]] and local sustainable development. UEBT aims to bring together actors committed to Ethical BioTrade, and promotes, facilitates and recognises ethical [[Strategic sourcing|sourcing]] of biodiversity in line with the objectives of the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Justice|url=http://naturaljustice.org/our-work/cross-cutting-themes/biotrade|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to achieve these goals, UEBT supports its members in the membership process and in their work towards implementing the Ethical BioTrade Standard. It also provides technical support, organizes regular conferences and workshops around Access and Benefit Sharing and biodiversity, publishes papers and reports, and consults organisations on the ethical sourcing from biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade for Development|url=http://www.befair.be/en/content/ethical-biotrade|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard ==

UEBT manages the Ethical BioTrade Standard, which provides a basis for UEBT Trading Members to improve their biodiversity sourcing practices. UEBT members develop biodiversity management systems that further the implementation of the Ethical BioTrade Standard in all their own operations involving natural ingredients, as well as throughout their supply chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Trade Centre|url=http://www.standardsmap.org/workarea/downloadasset.aspx?id=58664|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In joining UEBT, a company agrees to comply with the principles of Ethical BioTrade. This means using practices that promote the sustainable use of natural ingredients, while ensuring that all contributors along the supply chain are paid [[fair price]]s and share the benefits derived from the use of biodiversity. The Ethical BioTrade Standard is mainstreamed in the operations of UEBT trading members, including for instance in [[research]], [[innovation]] and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Institute for Environment and Development|url=http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/union-ethical-biotrade-uebt|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UEBT members undergo regular [[audits]] by independent third party verification bodies. UEBT works with the following Verification Bodies: Imaflora, SGS Qualifor, NaturaCert, Control Union Certifications, Ecocert SA, SGS del Peru S.A.C., [[Soil Association]], IBD Certificações (IBD), Biotropico S.A., IMO do Brasil,  and [[Rainforest Alliance]].

The Ethical BioTrade Standard builds on the seven Principles and Criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioTrade Principles and Criteria |url=http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditcted20074_en.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as developed by the UNCTAD BioTrade Initiative. First established in 2007, it was revised in April 2011, following the requirements of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). These requirements include the need to periodically review the Standard and ensure wide stakeholder involvement during the review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISEAL Code of Good Practice|url=http://www.isealalliance.org/our-work/codes-of-good-practice|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity Barometer ==

Every year the UEBT publishes the Biodiversity Barometer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethicalbiotrade.org/news/?wpfb_dl=26 Biodiversity Barometer]&lt;/ref&gt; The Biodiversity Barometer contains the results of awareness studies commissioned by UEBT and provides insights on evolving biodiversity [[awareness]] among consumers and how the beauty industry reports on biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Premium Beauty News|title=Biodiversity offers branding opportunities, says UEBT|url=http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/biodiversity-offers-branding,5353|accessdate=1-5-2013|newspaper=Premium Beauty News|date=2013-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversitaets-Barometer 2013|url=http://biologischevielfalt.de/8107.html?&amp;cHash=de4b9d6a42e2b5472fef5c06a3a4c7fb&amp;tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=4578|publisher=Bundesamt fuer Naturschutz|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversitaet: Fuer viele noch immer ein Fremdwort|url=http://globalmagazin.com/?id=1730|publisher=Global Magazin|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversitaet kennt nur jeder Zweite|url=http://www.factory-magazin.de/news/beitrag/artikel/biodiversitaet-kennt-nur-jeder-zweite.html|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barometer is used as one of the indicators for measuring progress towards meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Target 1 in the [[Biodiversity Indicators Partnership]]'s Aichi Passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity Indicators Partnership|url=http://www.bipindicators.net/partners|publisher=BIP|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

E.g. Berlin does not know about Germany, which itself doesn't know about Europe and so forth. GeoPlanet records, or places as they are called by Yahoo!, always (except one) have a reference to its parent place and therefore offer relations between places like the following:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cosmocode.de/en/blog/schoenborn/2010-01/24-free-geo-data-solutions-compared-geonames.org-vs.-yahoo-geoplanet?&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parent (direct surrounding place)
* Child (direct sub-places)
* Siblings (places sharing the same parent and place type)
* Ancestors (set of all parents)

If you take e.g. our company's district you will get the following family tree:

* Deutschland (WOEID 23424829)
** Bundesland Berlin (WOEID 2345496)
*** Stadtkreis Berlin (WOEID 1259838)
**** Berlin (WOEID 638242)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''William Tripp''' (November 29, 1817 probably in [[Bethel, Maine|Bethel]], [[Maine]] &amp;ndash; March 29, 1878 in [[Dakota Territory]]) was an American politician, lawyer, soldier, and surveyor.

Tripp's father, also named William Tripp, was a farmer and minister. He married Lucy Tebbets on January 3, 1814, and William Tripp was their second child.&lt;ref&gt;http://ripleymaine.blogspot.com/2009_10_01_archive.html blog on Ripley, Maine history&lt;/ref&gt; After attending the Maine Wesleyan Seminary, he studied law and was admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-one. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he or his father represented [[Harmony, Maine|Harmony]] in the Maine House of Representatives in 1841; he represented [[Wilton, Maine|Wilton]] in the Maine Senate in 1848-9, becoming Senate President in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maine.gov/legis/senate/history/past/prespast/1849wt.htm Maine Legislature page on Tripp&lt;/ref&gt; In 1852 he was serving as county attorney for [[Franklin County, Maine|Franklin County]], a Justice of the Peace, and a Brigadier General (Second Brigade, Eighth Division) of the Maine Militia. &lt;ref&gt;The Maine Register, and State Reference Book, 1852, Hallowell: Masters, Smith, &amp; Co., 1852, pages 49, 64, &amp; 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852 he left Maine and settled in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], [[Iowa]], where he practiced law. In 1857 he moved to [[Sioux City, Iowa|Sioux City]], Iowa. At the beginning of the Civil War he became the commander of Company B of the [[1st Dakota Cavalry Battalion|1st Dakota Cavalry]], serving under General [[Alfred Sully]] on the frontier. From 1866-9 he served as Surveyor General for the Dakota Territory under President [[Andrew Johnson]]. He later practiced law in [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]] in the Dakota Territory with his younger half-brother [[Bartlett Tripp]], later a judge and diplomat. The first meeting of the Upper House of the Territorial Legislature, in March 1862, occurred at William Tripp's house in Yankton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yankton.net/articles/2011/06/11/life/doc4df2d8dc4f167504180543.txt article ''The Beginnings Of Yankton’s Christ Episcopal Church'', Yankton Press &amp; Dakotan, June 11, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tripp played a part in the story of the first man officially convicted and jailed by the Dakota Territory. A man named Frank Sullivan was brought to Yankton in October of 1870, accused of stealing horses from the Indians. William Tripp managed to get him acquitted. However, while working for William's half-brother Bartlett, Sullivan forged an order for a suit of clothes, and fled when his crime was discovered. Brought back to Yankton, he escaped the jail and stole a horse from William Tripp. He was once more captured, while trying to use another forged order, this time from William Tripp, brought back, convicted, and sent to prison in December of 1871.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Dakota Territory, Vol. I, George Washington Kingsbury, Chicago: S. J. Clarke Publishing Co., 1915, p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;

William Tripp and his half-brother Bartlett were both defense lawyers in the 1874 trial of Peter Wintermute for the murder of acting governor [[Edwin Stanton McCook]]. William was called as a witness at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Dakota Territory, Vol. I, p. 723&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Tripp married Sarah Adams Woods (1819-1897) in 1841 and had at least two children - William Wallace Tripp (1843-1863) and Flora Louisa Tripp Voter (1849-1913). &lt;ref&gt;A History of Farmington, Franklin County, Maine, from the Earliest Explorations to the Present Time, 1776-1885, Francis Gould Butler, Farmington, ME: Press of Knowlton, McLeary, and Company, 1885, p. 619&lt;/ref&gt; Tripp and his wife were divorced in 1862 by act of the Dakota legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Divorce: An American Tradition, Glenda Riley, Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1997, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Tripp then married Martha Atwood (1822-1905) and had three children, two of whom died in infancy, and a son, Henry Tripp (1865-1933).
