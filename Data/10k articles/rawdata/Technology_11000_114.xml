      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6554">A '''3D Content Retrieval''' system is a computer system for browsing, searching and retrieving three dimensional digital contents (e.g.: [[Computer-aided design]], molecular biology models, and cultural heritage 3D scenes,  etc.) from a large database of digital images. The most original way of doing 3D content retrieval uses methods to add description text to 3D content files such as the content file name, link text, and the web page title so that related 3D content can be found through text retrieval. Because of the inefficiency of manually annotating 3D files, researchers have investigated ways to automate the annotation process and provide a unified standard to create text descriptions for 3D contents. Moreover, the increase in 3D content has demanded and inspired more advanced ways to retrieve 3D information. Thus, shape matching methods for 3D content retrieval have become popular. Shape matching retrieval is based on techniques that compare and contrast similarities between 3D models.

==3D retrieval methods==
'''Derive a high level description (e.g.: a skeleton) and then find matching results'''

This method describes 3D models by using a skeleton. The skeleton encodes the geometric and topological information in the form of a skeletal graph and uses [[graph matching]] techniques to match the skeletons and compare them.&lt;ref&gt;Sundar, H., Silver, D., Gagvani, N., Dickinson, S., Skeleton based shape matching and retrieval, In: Proc. SMI, Seoul, Korea (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this method requires a 2-manifold input model, and it is very sensitive to noise and details. Many of the existing 3D models are created for visualization purposes, while missing the input quality standard for the skeleton method. The skeleton 3D retrieval method needs more time and effort before it can be used widely.

'''Compute a feature vector based on statistics'''

Unlike Skeleton modeling, which requires a high quality standard for the input source, statistical methods do not put restriction on the validity of an input source. Shape [[histogram]]s, feature vectors composed of global geo-metic properties such as circularity and eccentricity, and feature vectors created using frequency decomposition of spherical functions are common examples of using statistical methods to describe 3D information.&lt;ref&gt;Min, P., Kazhdan, M., Funkhouser, T., A comparison of text and shape matching for retrieval of Online 3D models. Research And Advanced Technology For Digital Libraries, 2004, Vol.3232, pp.209-220&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2D projection method '''

Some approaches use 2D projections of a 3D model, justified by the assumption that if two objects are similar in 3D, then they should have similar 2D projections in many directions. [[Prototype|Prototypical]] Views&lt;ref&gt;Cyr, C.M., Kimia, B.B., 3D object recognition using shape similarity-based aspect graph, In: Proc. ICCV, IEEE (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Light field]] description&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D.Y., Ouhyoung, M., Tian, X.P., Shen, Y.T., Ouhyoung, M., On visual similarity based 3D model retrieval, In: Proc. Eurographics, Granada, Spain (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; are good examples of 2D projection methods.

==3D Engineering Search System==
In Purdue University, researchers led by Professor Karthik Ramani at the Research and Education Center for Information created a 3D search engine called the '''3D Engineering Search System''' (3DESS). It is designed to find computer-generated engineering parts.

The mechanism behind this search engine is that it starts from an algorithm which can transform query drawing to [[voxel]]s, then extracts the most important shape information from the voxels by using another algorithm called thinning, and formulates a skeleton of the object’s outlines and [[topology]]. After that, 3DESS will develop a skeletal graph to render the skeleton, using three common topological constructs: loops, edges, and nodes. The processed common constructs graph can reduce the data amount to represent an object, and it is easier to store and index the description in a database.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, S., 3D searching starts to take shape, Computer, 2004, Vol.37(8), pp.24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the lead professor, 3DESS can also describe objects using feature vectors, such as volume, surface area, etc. The system processes queries by comparing their feature vectors or skeletal graphs with data stored in the database. When the system retrieves models in response to the query, users can pick whichever object looks more similar to what they want and leave feedback.

==Challenges==
'''Challenges associated with 3D shape-based similarity queries'''

With the skeleton modeling 3D retrieval method, figuring out an efficient way to index 3D shape descriptors is very challenging because 3D shape indexing has very strict criteria. The 3D models must be quick to compute, concise to store, easy to index, invariant under similarity transformations, insensitive to noise and small extra features, robust to arbitrary topological degeneracies, and discriminating of shape differences at many scales.

'''3D search and retrieval with multimodal support challenges'''

In order to make the 3D search interface simple enough for novice users who know little on 3D retrieval input source requirements, a [[Multimodal interaction|multimodal]] retrieval system, which can take various types of input sources and provide robust query results, is necessary. So far, only a few approaches have been proposed. In Funkhouser et al. (2003),&lt;ref&gt;Funkhouser, T., Min, P., Kazhdan, M., Chen, J., Halderman, A.,Dobkin, D., &amp; Jacobs, D. (2003). A search engine for 3D models. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 22(1), 83–105&lt;/ref&gt; the proposed “Princeton 3D search engine” supports 2D sketches, 3D sketches, 3D models and text as queries. In Chen et al. (2003),&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D.Y., Ouhyoung, M., Tian, X.P., Shen, Y.T., Ouhyoung, M., On visual similarity based 3D model retrieval, In: Proc. Eurographics, Granada, Spain (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; he designed a 3D retrieval system that intakes 2D sketches and retrieves for 3D objects. Recently, Ansary et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Filali Ansary, T., Daoudi, M., &amp; Vandeborre, J.-P. (2007). A Bayesian 3D search engine using adaptive views clustering. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 9(1), 78–88.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a 3D retrieval framework using 2D photographic images, sketches, and 3D models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11350">{{short description|A small scale sewage treatment system which uses an aerobic process for digestion}}
An '''aerobic treatment system''' or '''ATS''', often called (incorrectly) an '''aerobic septic system,''' is a small scale [[sewage treatment]] system similar to a [[septic tank]] system, but which uses an [[Cellular respiration|aerobic]] process for [[digestion]] rather than just the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|anaerobic]] process used in septic systems.  These systems are commonly found in [[rural]] areas where public sewers are not available, and may be used for a single residence or for a small group of homes.

Unlike the traditional septic system, the aerobic treatment system produces a high quality secondary effluent, which can be sterilized and used for surface irrigation.  This allows much greater flexibility in the placement of the [[Septic drain field|leach field]], as well as cutting the required size of the leach field by as much as half.&lt;ref name="EPA Manual"&gt;
{{cite report |date=February 2002 |title=Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems Manual |url=https://www.epa.gov/septic/onsite-wastewater-treatment-and-disposal-systems |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-625-R-00-008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The ATS process generally consists of the following phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerobic reactors for biological wastewater treatment|url=http://blog-en.condorchem.com/aerobic-reactors-for-biological-wastewater-treatment|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Pre-treatment stage to remove large solids and other undesirable substances.
*Aeration stage, where aerobic bacteria digest biological wastes.
*Settling stage allows undigested solids to settle.  This forms a sludge that must be periodically removed from the system.
*Disinfecting stage, where [[chlorine]] or similar [[disinfectant]] is mixed with the water, to produce an antiseptic output. Another option is UV disinfection, where the water is exposed to UV light inside of a UV disinfection unit.

The disinfecting stage is optional, and is used where a sterile effluent is required, such as cases where the effluent is distributed above ground.  The disinfectant typically used is tablets of [[calcium hypochlorite]], which are specially made for waste treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2003 |title=Disinfection for Small Systems |url=https://www.epa.gov/septic/wastewater-technology-fact-sheets |publisher=EPA |website=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheets |id=EPA 832-F-03-024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets are intended to break down quickly in sunlight. Stabilized forms of chlorine persist after the effluent is dispersed, and can kill plants in the leach field.

Since the ATS contains a living [[ecosystem]] of microbes to digest the waste products in the water, excessive amounts of items such as [[bleach]] or [[antibiotic]]s can damage the ATS environment and reduce treatment effectiveness. Non-digestible items should also be avoided, as they will build up in the system and require more frequent sludge removal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hootsystems.com/homeowners/itemstoavoid.html Items to Avoid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718121945/http://hootsystems.com/homeowners/Itemstoavoid.html |date=2007-07-18 }}, Hoot Aerobic Systems&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of aerobic treatment systems==
Small scale aerobic systems generally use one of two designs, fixed-film systems, or continuous flow, suspended growth aerobic systems (CFSGAS).  The pre-treatment and effluent handling are similar for both types of systems, and the difference lies in the aeration stage.&lt;ref name="EPA Manual" /&gt;

===Fixed film systems===
Fixed film systems use a porous medium which provides a bed to support the biomass film that digests the waste material in the wastewater. Designs for fixed film systems vary widely, but fall into two basic categories (though some systems may combine both methods). The first is a system where the media is moved relative to the wastewater, alternately immersing the film and exposing it to air, while the second uses a stationary media, and varies the wastewater flow so the film is alternately submerged and exposed to air.  In both cases, the biomass must be exposed to both wastewater and air for the aerobic digestion to occur.  The film itself may be made of any suitable porous material, such as formed plastic or [[peat moss]].  Simple systems use stationary media, and rely on intermittent, gravity driven wastewater flow to provide periodic exposure to air and wastewater.  A common moving media system is the [[rotating biological contactor]] (RBC), which uses disks rotating slowly on a horizontal shaft.  Approximately 40 percent of the disks are submerged at any given time, and the shaft rotates at a rate of one or two revolutions per minute.&lt;ref name="EPA Manual" /&gt;

===Continuous flow, suspended growth aerobic systems===
CFSGAS systems, as the name implies, are designed to handle continuous flow, and do not provide a bed for a bacterial film, relying rather on bacteria suspended in the wastewater.  The suspension and aeration are typically provided by an air pump, which pumps air through the aeration chamber, providing a constant stirring of the wastewater in addition to the oxygenation.  A medium to promote fixed film bacterial growth may be added to some systems designed to handle higher than normal levels of biomass in the wastewater.&lt;ref name="EPA Manual" /&gt;

===Retrofit or portable aerobic systems===
Another increasingly common use of aerobic treatment is for the remediation of failing or failed anaerobic septic systems, by retrofitting an existing system with an aerobic feature.  This class of product, known as aerobic remediation, is designed to remediate biologically failed and failing anaerobic distribution systems by significantly reducing the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD5) and [[total suspended solids]] (TSS) of the effluent. The reduction of the BOD5 and TSS reverses the developed bio-mat. Further, effluent with high dissolved oxygen and aerobic bacteria flow to the distribution component and digest the bio-mat.Doing so on single tank systems where solids do not have anywhere to settle, or there is no a clarifying area{{Clarification|date=August 2018}} can do damage to the field lines as the solid matter is stirred up in the tank.

===Composting toilets===
{{Main|composting toilet}}
Composting toilets are designed to treat only toilet waste, rather than general residential waste water, and are typically used with water-free toilets rather than the [[flush toilet]]s associated with the above types of aerobic treatment systems. These systems treat the waste as a moist solid, rather than in liquid suspension, and therefore separate [[urine]] from [[feces]] during treatment to maintain the correct moisture content in the system. An example of a composting toilet is the [[clivus multrum]] ([[Latin]] for 'inclined chamber'), which consists of an inclined chamber that separates urine and feces and a fan to provide positive ventilation and prevent odors from escaping through the toilet. Within the chamber, the urine and feces are independently broken down not only by aerobic bacteria, but also by [[fungi]], [[arthropods]], and [[earthworm]]s.  Treatment times are very long, with a minimum time between removals of solid waste of a year; during treatment the volume of the solid waste is decreased by 90 percent, with most being converted into water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pathogens are eliminated from the waste by the long durations in inhospitable conditions in the treatment chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivusmultrum.com/science-technology.php |title=Composting Toilets and Greywater Systems Science &amp; Technology |author =Clivus Multrum, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to traditional septic systems==
The [[aeration]] stage and the disinfecting stage are the primary differences from a traditional septic system; in fact, an aerobic treatment system can be used as a secondary treatment for septic tank effluent.&lt;ref name="EPA Manual" /&gt; These stages increase the initial cost of the aerobic system, and also the maintenance requirements over the passive septic system. Unlike many other [[biofilters]], aerobic treatment systems require a constant supply of electricity to drive the air pump increasing overall system costs. The disinfectant tablets must be periodically replaced, as well as the electrical components (air compressor) and mechanical components (air diffusers). On the positive side, an aerobic system produces a higher quality [[effluent]] than a septic tank, and thus the [[leach field]] can be smaller than that of a conventional septic system, and the output can be discharged in areas too environmentally sensitive for septic system output. Some aerobic systems [[recycle]] the effluent through a [[fire sprinkler system|sprinkler system]], using it to water the lawn where regulations approve.

===Effluent quality===
Since the effluent from an ATS is often discharged onto the surface of the leach field, the quality is very important.  A typical ATS will, when operating correctly, produce an effluent with less than 30&amp;nbsp;mg/liter BOD5, 25&amp;nbsp;mg/L TSS, and 10,000 cfu/mL [[Fecal coliforms|fecal coliform bacteria]].  This is clean enough that it cannot support a biomat or "slime" layer like a septic tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/DD7667.html |title=Aerobic Treatment Unit |author1=David M. Gustafson |author2=James L. Anderson |author3=Sara Heger Christopherson |publisher=University of Minnesota Extension}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATS effluent is relatively odorless; a properly operating system will produce effluent that smells musty, but not like sewage.  Aerobic treatment is so effective at reducing odors, that it is the preferred method for reducing odor from manure produced by farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.missouri.edu/explore/envqual/wq0403.htm |title=Sewage Treatment Plants for Rural Homes |author1=Charles D.

'''Archive Corporation''' was a computer [[tape drive]] manufacturer, based in [[Costa Mesa, California]] that was acquired by [[Conner Peripherals]] in 1993.  

Of particular note are the Archive [[Digital Data Storage|DDS]] tape drives produced for [[Silicon Graphics]] that could also read and write [[Digital Audio Tape]]s.
* Archive Python 4320
* Archive Peregrine 4326 (branded Conner or Seagate)

Prior to this, Archive was a leading vendor of the very popular QIC ([[Quarter-inch cartridge]]) format which was a popular distribution format for UNIX workstations and servers.  For example, [[Sun-3]] (Motorola 68k family) and [[Sun-4]] (SPARC) software was most commonly distributed on QIC media before the CD-ROM became more cost-effective.  Archive was probably better known for their QIC drives.

== Acquisitions ==
* In 1989, Archive acquired [[Maynard Electronics]].  The ''MaynStream'' brand of tape drives and software was maintained.
* In March 1990, Archive acquired [[Cipher Data Products]] for $118 Million.[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-9195117.html]  This included Cipher's subsidiary [[Irwin Magnetics]]. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n1917_v38/ai_12406465]

[[File:Felling axe.jpg|thumb|Double- and single-bit felling axes]]
[[File:ALB - Hortfund Groß Gaglow.jpg|thumb|A hoard of [[bronze]] socketed axes from the [[Bronze Age]] found in modern Germany. This was the top tool of the period, and also seems to have been used as a store of value]]
An '''axe''' ([[British English]]) or '''ax''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|see spelling differences]]) is an implement that has been used for [[Millennium|millennia]] to shape, split and cut [[wood]]; to [[harvest]] [[Lumber|timber]]; as a [[battle axe|weapon]]; and as a [[ceremony|ceremonial]] or [[Heraldry|heraldic]] [[symbol]]. The axe has many forms and specialised uses but generally consists of an axe head with a [[Handle (grip)|handle]], or ''helve''.

Before the modern axe, the stone-age [[hand axe]] was used from 1.5 million years [[Before Present|BP]] without a handle. It was later fastened to a wooden handle. The earliest examples of handled axes have heads of [[rock (geology)|stone]] with some form of wooden handle attached ([[hafting|hafted]]) in a method to suit the available materials and use. Axes made of [[copper]], [[bronze]], [[iron]] and [[steel]] appeared as these technologies developed. Axes are usually composed of a head and a handle.

The axe is an example of a [[simple machine]], as it is a type of [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]], or dual [[inclined plane]]. This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper. It splits the wood into two parts by the pressure concentration at the blade. The handle of the axe also acts as a [[Lever#Third-class levers|lever]] allowing the user to increase the force at the cutting edge—not using the full length of the handle is known as choking the axe. For fine chopping using a side axe this sometimes is a positive effect, but for [[felling]] with a double bitted axe it reduces efficiency.

Generally, cutting axes have a shallow wedge angle, whereas splitting axes have a deeper angle. Most axes are double bevelled, i.e. symmetrical about the axis of the blade, but some specialist [[broadaxe]]s have a single bevel blade, and usually an offset handle that allows them to be used for finishing work without putting the user's knuckles at risk of injury. Less common today, they were once an integral part of a joiner and carpenter's tool kit, not just a tool for use in forestry. A tool of similar origin is the [[billhook]].

Most modern axes have steel heads and wooden handles, typically [[hickory]] in the US and [[ash tree|ash]] in Europe and Asia, although [[plastic]] or [[fibreglass]] handles are also common. Modern axes are specialised by use, size and form. Hafted axes with short handles designed for use with one hand are often called hand axes but the term hand axe refers to axes without handles as well. [[Hatchet]]s tend to be small hafted axes often with a [[hammer]] on the back side (the poll). As easy-to-make weapons, axes have frequently been used in combat.

==History==
[[File:Brescia Monte pietà romani1 by Stefano Bolognini.JPG|thumb|upright|Roman axe in an ancient Roman relief in [[Brescia]], [[Italy]]]]

Initially axes were tools of stone called [[hand axe]]s, used without handles (hafts), and had [[Knapping|knapped]] (chipped) cutting edges of [[Flint axe|flint]] or other stone. Stone axes made with ''ground'' cutting edges were first developed sometime in the late [[Pleistocene]] in [[Indigenous Australians|Australia]], where ground-edge axe fragments from sites in [[Arnhem Land]] date back at least 44,000 years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hiscock | first1 = P. | last2 = O'Connor | first2 = S. | last3 = Balme | first3 = J. | last4 = Maloney | first4 = T. | year = 2016 | title = World's earliest ground-edge axe production coincides with human colonisation of Australia  | journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | page = 2-11 | doi=10.1080/03122417.2016.1164379 | url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03122417.2016.1164379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geneste | first1 = J.-M. | last2 = David | first2 = B. | last3 = Plisson | first3 = H. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | last5 = Delannoy | first5 = J.-J. | last6 = Petchey | first6 = F. | last7 = Whear | first7 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Earliest evidence for ground-edge axes: 35,400 ± 410 cal BP from Jawoyn Country, Arnhem Land | journal = Australian Archaeology | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | page = 66-69 | doi=10.1080/03122417.2010.11689385 | url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/03122417.2010.11689385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ground-edge axes were later invented independently in [[Japan]] sometime around 38,000 BP, and are known from several [[Upper Palaeolithic]] sites on the islands of [[Honshu]] and [[Kyushu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takashi | first1 = T. | year = 2012 | title = MIS3 edge-ground axes and the arrival of the first Homo sapiens in the Japanese archipelago | journal = Quaternary International | volume = 248 | page = 70-78 | doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.01.030 | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618211000504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, however, the innovation of ground edges occurred much later, in the [[Neolithic]] period ending 4,000 to 2,000 BC. The first true hafted axes are known from the [[Mesolithic]] period (c. 6000 BC). Few wooden hafts have been found from this period, but it seems that the axe was normally hafted by wedging. [[Birch-tar]] and raw-hide lashings were used to fix the blade.

Sometimes a short section of deer [[antler]] (an "antler sleeve") was used,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} which prevented the splitting of the haft and softened the impact on the stone blade itself, helping absorb the impact of each axe blow and lessening the chances of breaking the handle. The antler was hollowed out at one end to create a socket for the axehead. The antler sheath was then either perforated and a handle inserted into it or set in a hole made in the handle instead.

The distribution of stone axes is an important indication of prehistoric trade.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}} Thin sectioning is used to determine the provenance of the stone blades. In Europe, Neolithic "axe factories", where thousands of ground stone axes were roughed out, are known from many places, such as:

* [[Langdale axe industry|Great Langdale]], England (tuff)
* [[Rathlin Island]], Ireland (porcellanite)
* [[Krzemionki]], Poland (flint)
* [[Plancher-les-Mines]], France (pelite)
* [[Aosta Valley]], Italy (omphacite).

Stone axes are still produced and in use today in parts of [[Papua (province)|Papua]], Indonesia. The [[Mount Hagen]] area of [[Papua New Guinea]] was an important production centre.

From the late [[Neolithic]]/[[Chalcolithic]] onwards, axes were made of copper or copper mixed with arsenic. These axes were flat and hafted much like their stone predecessors. Axes continued to be made in this manner with the introduction of Bronze metallurgy. Eventually the hafting method changed and the flat axe developed into the "flanged axe", then [[palstave]]s, and later winged and socketed axes.

The Proto-Indo-European word for "axe" may have been ''*pelek'u-'' (Greek ''pelekus'' πέλεκυς, Sanskrit ''parashu'', see also [[Parashurama]]), but the word was probably a loan, or a Neolithic ''[[wanderwort]]'', ultimately related to [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ''balag'', [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''pilaku-''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

At least since the late Neolithic, elaborate axes (battle-axes, T-axes, etc.) had a [[Religion|religious]] significance and probably indicated the exalted [[Social status|status]] of their owner. Certain types almost never show traces of wear; deposits of unshafted axe blades from the middle Neolithic (such as at the [[Somerset Levels]] in Britain) may have been gifts to the [[deity|deities]].
[[File:Old axes.jpg|thumb|A collection of old Australian cutting tools including [[broad axe]]s, broad hatchets, mortising axes, carpenter's and felling axes. Also five [[adze]]s, a corner chisel, two [[froe]]s, and a [[twibil]]]]

In [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] Crete, the double axe ([[labrys]]) had a special significance, used by priestesses in religious ceremonies. The symbol refers to deification ceremonies; part of the leaping over the bull symbol also found at Crete; whereby aspirant becomes able to speak as a god to create any reality; the symbol being a sky map.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1998 a labrys, complete with an elaborately embellished haft, was found at Cham-Eslen, [[Canton of Zug]], [[Switzerland]]. The haft was 120&amp;nbsp;cm long and wrapped in ornamented birch-bark. The axe blade is 17.4&amp;nbsp;cm long and made of [[antigorite]], mined in the [[Gotthard Pass|Gotthard]]-area. The haft goes through a biconical drilled hole and is fastened by wedges of antler and by birch-tar. It belongs to the early [[Cortaillod culture]].

In [[folklore]], stone axes were sometimes believed to be [[thunderbolt]]s and were used to guard buildings against [[lightning]], as it was believed ([[Rumor|mythically]]) that lightning never struck the same place twice. This has caused some skewing of axe distributions.

[[Steel]] axes were important in [[superstition]] as well. A thrown axe could keep off a [[hail]]storm, sometimes an axe was placed in the [[crops]], with the cutting edge to the skies to protect the harvest against bad [[weather]]. An upright axe buried under the [[sill plate|sill]] of a house would keep off [[Witchcraft|witches]], while an axe under the bed would assure [[male]] [[offspring]].

[[Basque people|Basques]], [[Australia]]ns and New Zealanders have developed variants of rural sports that perpetuate the traditions of log cutting with axe. The Basque variants, splitting horizontally or vertically disposed logs, are generically called ''[[aizkolaritza]]'' (from ''aizkora'': axe).

In [[Yoruba religion|Yorùbá mythology]], the oshe (double-headed axe) symbolises [[Shango]], [[Orisha]] (god) of thunder and lightning. It is said to represent swift and balanced justice. Shango altars often contain a carved figure of a woman holding a gift to the god with a double-bladed axe sticking up from her head.

The [[Arkalochori Axe]] is a bronze, Minoan, axe from the second millennium BC thought to be used for religious purposes. Inscriptions on this axe have been compared with other ancient writing systems.

==Parts of the axe==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
[[File:An axe labelled-2edit.svg|thumb|upright|A diagram showing the main points on an axe]]

The axe has two primary components: the axe ''head'', and the ''haft''.

The ''axe head'' is typically bounded by the ''bit'' (or blade) at one end, and the ''poll'' (or butt) at the other, though some designs feature two bits opposite each other. The top corner of the bit where the cutting edge begins is called the ''toe'', and the bottom corner is known as the ''heel''. Either side of the head is called the ''cheek'', which is sometimes supplemented by ''lugs'' where the head meets the haft, and the hole where the haft is mounted is called the ''eye''. The part of the bit that descends below the rest of the axe-head is called the beard, and a ''bearded axe'' is an antiquated axe head with an exaggerated beard that can sometimes extend the cutting edge twice the height of the rest of the head.

The ''axe haft'' is sometimes called the handle. Traditionally, it was made of a resilient hardwood like hickory or ash, but modern axes often have hafts made of durable synthetic materials. Antique axes and their modern reproductions, like the [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]], often had a simple, straight haft with a circular cross-section that wedged onto the axe-head without the aid of wedges or pins. Modern hafts are curved for better grip and to aid in the swinging motion, and are mounted securely to the head. The ''shoulder'' is where the head mounts onto the haft, and this is either a long oval or rectangular cross-section of the haft that is secured to the axe head with small metal or wooden wedges. The ''belly'' of the haft is the longest part, where it bows in gently, and the throat is where it curves sharply down to the short ''grip'', just before the end of the haft, which is known as the ''knob''.

==Types of axes==

===Axes designed to cut or shape wood===
[[File:Axt zum spalten1.jpg|thumb|upright|Splitting axe]]
[[File:Carpenter's axe.jpg|thumb|upright|A Swedish carpenter's axe]]

* '''Felling axe''': Cuts across the grain of wood, as in the [[felling]] of trees. In single or double bit (the bit is the cutting edge of the head) forms and many different weights, shapes, handle types and cutting geometries to match the characteristics of the material being cut. More so than with for instance a splitting axe, the bit of a felling axe needs to be very sharp, to be able to efficiently cut the fibres.
* '''Splitting axe''': Used in [[wood splitting]] to split with the grain of the wood. Splitting axe bits are more wedge shaped. This shape causes the axe to rend the fibres of the wood apart, without having to cut through them.
* '''[[broadaxe|Broad axe]]''': Used with the grain of the wood in precision splitting or "[[hewing]]" (i.e. the squaring-off of round timbers usually for use in construction). Broad axe bits are most commonly [[chisel]]-shaped (i.e. one flat and one beveled edge) facilitating more controlled work as the flat cheek passes across the squared timber.
* '''[[Adze]]''': A variation featuring a head perpendicular to that of an axe. Rather than splitting wood side-by-side, it is used to rip a level surface into a horizontal piece of wood. It can also be used as a [[pickaxe]] for breaking up rocks and [[clay]].
* '''[[Hatchet]]''': A small, light axe designed for use in one hand specifically while camping or travelling.
* '''[[Carpenter's axe]]''': A small axe, usually slightly larger than a hatchet, used in traditional woodwork, joinery and log-building. It has a pronounced beard and finger notch to allow a "choked" grip for precise control. The poll is designed for use as a hammer.
* '''Hand axe''': A small axe used for intermediate chopping, similar to hatchets.
* [[Mortise and tenon|Mortising]] axe: Used for creating mortises, a process which begins by drilling two holes at the ends of the intended mortise. Then the wood between the holes is removed with the mortising axe. Some forms of the tool have one blade, which may be pushed, swung or struck with a mallet. Others, such as twybil, bisaigüe and piochon have two, one of which is used for separating the fibres, and the other for levering out the waste.&lt;ref&gt;Johan David.

===Axes as weapons===
[[File:Beheading duke somerset.jpg|thumb|upright|The execution of the [[Edmund Beaufort (died 1471)|Duke of Somerset]] after the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471]]
* '''Archer's axe''': a one-handed axe with bearded head carried by medieval archers serving both as melee weapon and tool. Defensively deployed archers in line used the poll of this axe to hammer wooden stakes into the ground and then sharpened the stakes by chopping the ends with the blade. These stakes were primarily intended to protect against cavalry.
* '''[[Battle axe]]''': In its most common form, an arm-length weapon borne in one or both hands. Compared to a [[sword]] swing, it delivers more cleaving power against a smaller target area, making it more effective against armour, due to concentrating more of its weight in the axehead.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}
* '''[[Tomahawk (axe)|Tomahawk]]''': used almost exclusively by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], its blade was originally crafted of stone. Along with the familiar war version, which could be fashioned as a throwing weapon, the pipe tomahawk was a ceremonial and diplomatic tool.
* '''Spontoon tomahawk''': A French trapper and Iroquois collaboration, this was an axe with a knife-like stabbing blade instead of the familiar wedged shape.
* '''[[Shepherd's axe]]''': used by shepherds in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], it could double as a [[walking stick]].
* '''[[Ono (weapon)|Ono]]''': a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] weapon wielded by ''[[sōhei]]'' warrior monks.
* '''[[Dagger-axe]] (Ji or Ge)''': A variant of Chinese [[polearm]]like weapon with a divided two-part head, composed of the usual straight blade and a scythe-like blade. The straight blade is used to stab or feint, then the foe's body or head may be cut by pulling the scythe-like horizontal blade backwards. Ge has the horizontal blade but sometimes does not have the straight spear.
* '''[[Halberd]]''': a [[spear]]like weapon with a hooked poll, effective against mounted [[cavalry]].
* '''[[Glaive]]''': a European [[polearm]] weapon, consisting of a single-edged blade on the end of a [[quarterstaff|pole]].
* '''[[Pollaxe]]''': designed to defeat [[plate armour]]. Its axe (or hammer) head is much narrower than other axes, which accounts for its penetrating power.
* '''[[Dane axe]]''': A long-handled weapon with a large flat blade, often attributed to the [[Norsemen]].
* '''[[Throwing axe]]''': Any of a number of [[ranged weapon]]s designed to strike with a similar splitting action as their [[Melee weapon|melee]] counterparts. These are often small in profile and usable with one hand.
* '''[[Hurlbat]]''': An entirely metal throwing axe sharpened on every auxiliary end to a point or blade, practically guaranteeing some form of damage against its target.
* '''[[Francisca]]''' or '''Frankish axe''': a short throwing weapon of the European [[Migration Period]], the name of which may have become attached to the Germanic tribe associated with it: the [[Franks]] (see [[France]]).
* '''[[Parashu]]''': The '''parashu''' ({{lang-sa|paraṣu}}) is an [[India]]n battle-axe. It is generally wielded with two hands but could also be used with only one. It is depicted as the primary weapon of [[Parashurama]], the 6th Avatar of Lord [[Vishnu]] in [[Hinduism]].
* '''[[Sagaris]]''': An ancient weapon used by [[Scythians]].

===Axes as tools=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[United Airlines Flight 93]] --&gt;
* '''Double bit axe''': A common axe in the ancient world; introduced to America in the 1800s. The heavy head makes it ideal for felling trees. Often one bit is designated for tasks that would more quickly dull the edge such as cutting roots through dirt.
* '''[[Firefighter]]'s axe''', '''fire axe''', or '''pick head axe''': It has a pick-shaped pointed poll (area of the head opposite the cutting edge). It is often decorated in vivid colours to make it easily visible during an emergency. Its primary use is for breaking down doors and windows.
* '''Crash axe''' A short lightweight handheld emergency chopping tool with a sharp or serrated blade spanning a quarter circular from the axis of the handle, sometimes with a notch in the blade to catch on sheet metal, and often a short pick opposite the blade, this tool or a prybar is required to be carried in most large aircraft cockpits with 20 seats or more to quickly chop and pry walls and cabinets to gain access when extinguishing a fire while in flight or to escape when exits are unavailable.  A crash axe is sometimes also used by crash rescue firefighter crews to chop through the airplane's sheet metal skin for a rescue opening; modern crash axes are often made with an electrically insulated handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/2009_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303201515/https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/2009_01.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Ice axe]]''' or '''climbing axe''': A number of different styles of ice axes are designed for [[ice climbing]] and enlarging steps used by climbers.
* '''[[Hammer|Lathe hammer]]''' (also known as a lath hammer, lathing hammer, or lathing hatchet): a tool used for cutting and nailing wood lath which has a small hatchet blade on one side (which features a small lateral nick used for pulling out nails) and a hammer head on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/lathing+hammer|title=Lathing hammer|journal=The Free Dictionary|author=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mattock]]''': A dual-purpose axe, combining an adze and axe blade, or sometimes a pick and adze blade.
* '''[[Pickaxe]]''': An axe with a large pointed end, rather than a flat blade. Sometimes exists as a double-bladed tool with a pick on one side and an axe or adze head on the other. Often used to break up hard material, such as rocks or concrete.
* '''[[Pulaski (tool)|Pulaski]]''': An axe with a [[mattock]] blade built into the rear of the main axe blade, used for digging ('grubbing out') through and around roots as well as chopping.  The pulaski is an indispensable tool used in fighting [[Wildfire|forest fires]], as well as trail-building, brush clearance and similar functions.
* '''[[Slater|Slater's axe]]''': An axe for cutting roofing [[slate]], with a long point on the poll for punching nail holes, and with the blade offset laterally from the handle to protect the worker's hand from flying slate chips.
* '''[[Splitting maul]]''': A splitting implement that has evolved from the simple "wedge" design to more complex designs. Some mauls have a conical "axehead"; compound mauls have swivelling "sub-wedges", among other types; others have a heavy wedge-shaped head, with a [[sledgehammer]] face opposite.

==Hammer axe==
Hammer axes (or axe-hammers) typically feature an extended poll, opposite the blade, shaped and sometimes hardened for use as a [[hammer]]. The name axe-hammer is often applied to a characteristic shape of perforated stone axe used in the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]]s. Iron axe-hammers are found in Roman military contexts, e.g. [[Cramond]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[South Shields]], [[Tyne and Wear]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Barro negro pottery''' ("black clay") is a style of pottery from [[Oaxaca]], Mexico, distinguished by its color, sheen and unique designs. Oaxaca is one of few Mexican states which is characterized by the continuance of its ancestral crafts, which are still used in everyday life.&lt;ref name="gmarin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artesmexico.org/arte_tradicional_mexicano/barro_negro.asp  |title= Barro Negro |first= Guillermo |last= Marín |publisher=Artes de Mexico magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barro negro is one of several pottery traditions in the state, which also include the glazed green pieces of [[Santa María Atzompa]];&lt;ref name="encmuc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/cult.htm |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca Atractivos Culturales y Turísticos |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Encyclopedia of the Municipalities of Mexico State of Oaxaca Cultural and Tourist Attractions |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710092144/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/cult.htm |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, barro negro is one of the best known and most identified with the state.&lt;ref name="once"&gt;{{cite news |title= El proceso de elaboración de artesanías de barro negro de Oaxaca |url= http://oncetv-ipn.net/noticias/index.php?modulo=despliegue&amp;dt_fecha=2007-10-08&amp;numnota=46 |agency= Redacción Once Noticias |newspaper=Once Noticias |location=Mexico City |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The process of crafting barro negro crafts of Oaxaca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also one of the most popular and appreciated styles of pottery in Mexico.&lt;ref name="hovargas"&gt;{{cite news |title= San Bartolo Coyotepec, Oaxaca |first= Hilda  |last= Ortiz Vargas   |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/entretenimiento/2008/14428/6/san-bartolo-coyotepec-oaxaca.htm  |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=24 May 2008 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The origins of this pottery style extends as far back as the [[Monte Alban]] period and for almost all of this pottery's history, had been available only in a grayish matte finish.

==History==
[[File:El Tren de la Historia 3.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of a funeral in barro negro at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]].]]
The origins of barro negro pottery extend over centuries, with examples of it found at archeological sites, fashioned mostly into jars and other utilitarian items. It has remained a traditional crafts of the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] and [[Mixtecs]] of the Central Valleys area to the present day.&lt;ref name="hovargas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; Originally barro negro pottery was matte and grayish. In this form, the pottery is very sturdy, allowing it to be hit without breaking.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;

In the 1950s, Doña Rosa Real discovered that she could change the color and shine of the pieces by polishing the clay pieces and firing them at a slightly lower temperature. Just before the formed clay piece is completely dry, it is polished with a quartz stone to compress the surface. After firing, the piece emerges a shiny black instead of a dull gray.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; This innovation makes the pieces more breakable, but it has made the pottery far more popular with Mexican folk art collectors, including Nelson Rockefeller, who promoted it in the United States.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3594-mexico-s-mezcal-monkey-collectible-ceramic-folk-art-from-oaxaca |title= Mexico's Mezcal Monkey: collectible ceramic folk art from Oaxaca |first=Alvin |last=Starkman  |date=31 January 2010 |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity stems from the look, rather than wearability, so many pieces are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utility.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; Doña Rosa died in 1980, but the tradition of making the pottery is being carried on by her daughter and grandchildren who stage demonstrations for tourists in their local potters' workshop.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble"&gt;Pg 744 – {{cite book | last = Noble, John| title = Mexico|edition= 2008| isbn= 1-74104-804-4 }}- Total pages: 1056&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop is still in the family home, where shelves and shelves of shiny black pieces for sale line the inner courtyard.&lt;ref name="donafodors"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/mexico/oaxaca/review-176168.html |title= Mexico's Mezcal Monkey: collectible ceramic folk art from Oaxaca Alfarería Doña Rosa  |publisher=Fodors Travel Guides |accessdate=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being the origin of black polished clay, pieces at this workshop are much cheaper than in other parts of Mexico.&lt;ref name="ajimenez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Barro negro de San Bartolo |first= Alejandro |last= Jiménez |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/41974.html |newspaper= El Universal |location= Mexico City |date= 12 August 2007 |language= Spanish |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121008091855/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/41974.html |archivedate= 8 October 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important person in the development and promotion of barro negro is Carlomagno Pedro Martinez. He was born in San Bartolo Coyotepec into a pottery-making family. He was named after [[Charlemagne]] by his grandmother, who was an admirer of the king.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt; From a young age, he showed talent in fashioning figures in clay. When he was grown, he attended the Fine Arts Workshop of [[Rufino Tamayo]] in [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca city]]. He has become the first potter/sculptor in the medium, winning his first recognition in 1985 for his work. His fame increased with his development of human skulls made of barro negro in the years that followed.&lt;ref name="hermano"/&gt; Each piece Carlomagno makes is unique, but themes such as oral histories, indigenous legends, Christianity and death, called "our grandmother," recur.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt; In Mexico, he has exhibited his work in dozens of expositions and has won three national-level awards. His work has been featured in five books.&lt;ref name="carlomagno"/&gt; Martinez’s work has been exhibited in the United States, Colombia, Argentina, Lebanon, Germany, Spain, and Japan, with one of his latest exhibits in New York in 2008. In that same year, he created a mural in barro negro at the Baseball Academy in San Bartolo Coyotepec sponsored by the [[Alfredo Harp Helú]] Foundation.&lt;ref name="hermano"/&gt;

==San Bartolo Coyotepec==
[[File:Barro Negro Design Oaxaca.png|thumb|right|A woman cutting designs into unfired barro negro pottery in San Bartolo Coyotepec, Oaxaca, Mexico.]]

The craft is made in San Bartolo Coyotepec and a large number of small communities in the surrounding valley, where the clay that gives it its color is found.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cromero"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6365-Arte-popular-oaxaque%F1o.-Formas,-texturas-y-colores |title= Arte popular oaxaqueño.

A group of fourteen people exhibit and sell barro negro objects. Some of these products include vases, animal figures and jars. Demonstrations of pottery making are held as well.&lt;ref name="meapo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meapo.oaxaca.gob.mx/mercado/index.html |title=MERCADO DE ARTESANIAS de Barro Negro de San Bartolo Coyotepec |publisher=Museo estatal de Arte Popular Oaxaca |location=San Bartolo Coyotepec |language=Spanish |trans-title=Crafts Market of San Bartolo Coyotepec |accessdate=8 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223011330/http://www.meapo.oaxaca.gob.mx/mercado/index.html |archivedate=23 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the [[Museo Estatal de Arte Popular de Oaxaca]](State Museum of Popular Art) was opened here. It has one of its three halls dedicated to barro negro, with pieces from the Monte Alban era to the present day.&lt;ref name="hovargas"/&gt; In 2009, San Bartolo Coyotepec held its first Feria Artesanal de Barro Negro (Crafts Fair of Barro Negro) with the participation of over 150 artisans.&lt;ref name="acces0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanbartolocoyotepec.ieaip.org/ |title= Primer Feria Artesanal de Barro Negro 2009  |publisher= Instituto Estatal de Acceso a la Información Pública de Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=Spanish |trans-title=First Crafts Fair of Barro Negro 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objects made with barro negro==

Many different kinds of objects are made of barro negro including pots, whistles, flutes, bells, masks, lamps, animal figures with most being of a decorative nature and not for the storage of food and water.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; One exception to this is the use of [[cantaro]]s from San Bartolo Coyotepec to age and store [[mezcal]] at many distilleries. These large jars are not polished and retain the ancient gray matte, which allows them to be resistant to liquid.&lt;ref name="corne"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mezcal minero de Oaxaca |first= Tío |last= Corne |author2= Gustavo |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2007/08/02/index.php?section=gastronomia&amp;article=a10o1gas |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Miners’ mescal of Oaxaca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another quality the gray matte version has is that it can be struck similar to a bell, and the cantaros are also used as musical instruments. The sound produced is crystalline.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hovargas"/&gt;

Another famous barro negro object is the "mezcal monkey" (chango mezcalero). This is a vessel created for the alcoholic liquor [[mezcal]] in the shape of a monkey. It is made to hold between 700 ml and 1 liter of the liquid with a cork or corncob stopper. It is either painted in bright colors or left grayish with detailed etchings. Valente Nieto, the sole surviving progeny of Doña Rosa states that his family created the mezcal monkey and no one else. He claims that his father was a gifted sculptor, and mezcal owners came to their property requesting novelty bottles for the alcoholic beverage. The monkey as well as other animal shapes were created. However, another family, that of Marcelo Simon Galan, also claim to have created the container. His surviving granddaughter says that he made the shape at the request of a customer. An example of Galan’s work is on display at the Museo de Arte Popular de Oaxaca in San Bartolo Coyotepec.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Elaboración del barro negro10 inakiherrasti.JPG|thumb|left|Creation of a pitcher at the Doña Rosa workshop]]
The color of barro negro is due to the properties of the clay, and is not colored.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; The earth used to extract the clay is cleaned to remove impurities, which can take a month of soaking and settling out the clay from the rest of the soil.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt; After this process, each piece takes about twenty days to complete.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;

Traditionally, the clay is molded on plates balanced on rocks to that they can be spun by hand. Modern potters’ tools are not used.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;  Large pieces, such as cantaros are fashioned from the bottom up adding clay as the piece grows.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt; After it is shaped, the pieces are set to dry in a well-insulated room to protect them from sudden changes in temperature.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;  Drying can take up to three weeks. If the piece is to be polished so that it turns out shiny black when finished, it is polished when the piece is almost dry. The surface of the piece is lightly moistened and then rubbed with a curved quartz stone. This compacts the surface of the clay and creates the metallic sheen and dark color during firing.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt; This is also the stage when decorative accents such as clay flowers or small handles are added. The designs of barro negro objects are unique to this area.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;

The pieces are then fired in [[pit fired pottery|underground pits]] or above ground kilns, using wood fires that heat the objects to between 700 and 800&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="aboy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carlomagno"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mentiras verdaderas’’ en alfarería |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/25938.8220-mentiras-verdaderas-8217-8217-en-alfare.html |newspaper=[[El Siglo de Torreon]] |location=Torreon, Coahuila |date= 2 April 2003 |accessdate=10 March 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title="True Lies" in pottery}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they emerge, the polished pieces are a shiny black and the unpolished ones have a grey matte finish.&lt;ref name="once"/&gt;

[[Image:TireBead.png|thumb|A tire bead is held in the groove by air pressure.]]
Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A '''bead breaker''' is a tool used for separating [[tire]]s from [[rim (wheel)|rims]]. The inner-most diameter of the tire that interfaces with a wheel is called the Tire Bead.  The tire bead is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called the Bead Bundle.&lt;ref&gt;https://beadbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ST_2.0.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  The inner-most surface of the tire bead creates the air seal between the tire and rim on a [[radial-ply tire]] and a bias-ply tire. Often, the bead can become frozen to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring the use of a bead breaker in order to be removed.

A need was experienced by avid [[4x4]] enthusiasts and [[overlanding|overland travelers]] for a simple tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside. On ATV's, as well as motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, many industrial and offroad vehicles, as well as light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the Bead Retainer.  The bead retainer is a bump like feature that prevents the tire bead from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal.  On ATV's (and UTV's/side-by-sides) this bead retainer is substantially large because these tires are often run at very low air pressures (~5 psi) and experience severe side loading forces from typical trail riding.  The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the tire bead from the bead seat.  Further, if an ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the Tire in place for low speed riding allowing the operator to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim.  The large bead retainers of ATV's do such a good job keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, it also prevents the tire from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.
[[File:Clamp and Ram Bead Breaker.jpg|thumb|BeadBuster Clamp-and-Ram mechanism]]
There are three categories of tire bead breaker designs: 1) [http://www.harborfreight.com/bead-breaker-92961.html "Shoe and Lever mechanism"], 2) [http://www.tyrepliers.com.au/New/BB100atv.html "Plier-type mechanism"], 3)  [https://beadbuster.com/help-me-choose/ "Clamp and Ram mechanism"].  The Shoe and Lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, however with more difficult-to-change tires it often fails because of the nature of the design.  The shoe pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the tire bead, and if the bead is stuck, the shoe will simply slide down the sidewall.&lt;ref&gt;https://beadbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ST_3.2B-325x477.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;  Further the Shoe and Lever mechanism is quite large, and is not a good portable solution for on-the-trail tire changes. Advantages are typically low cost, often less than $50, and can be found manufactured by many companies.  The Plier-Type tool has a spike that pushes in between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and can actually put a separating force on the bead bundle.  However the pivot point results in an arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall.  The Plier-type mechanism is more effective than the Shoe and Lever, however it has some disadvantages.  It must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, it makes metal on metal contact with the rim, and can easily scratch and mar the surface of aluminum or painted wheels, it takes a bit of coordination and balance to use as you have to stand on the tire and use your body weight to operate the tool, and it is also fairly large, but ultimately is portable and is often used at race tracks for pit-stop tire changes.  Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on very stubborn ATV tires, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of the Plier-type is variable, form $75 to $200, and is manufactured by multiple companies.  Lastly, the Clamp-and-Ram mechanism tool &lt;ref&gt;https://beadbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bd381dcf84a06ddbf81e3aa6a82b4263.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; is by far the most effective and compact tool for breaking beads on ATV's and other difficult-to-change tires.  This style of tool has a pointed foot that enters the space between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and it uses a padded clamp that is driven with a wrench to get pulled in all the way with very little user effort.  The Ram foot then gets actuated by another bolt, with little effort by the user, and it completely breaks the bead loose in one motion.  Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire.  The ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, and therefore works well on old and deteriorated tires. 

[[Tire changer]]s have a semi-automated [[Tire changer#Bead loosening system|bead loosening system]] for removing tires, but due to the high cost and lack of portability these are were not suitable. In addition beads frozen by heat and [[rust]] to the rim must often be broken free manually. In these case the bead breaker is ideal. Used like a chisel, a bead breaker leverages a mechanical advantage to drive the bead away from the rim.&lt;gallery&gt;

[[File:Direct changeover.png|thumb]]
'''Big bang adoption''' or '''direct changeover''' is the [[Adoption (software implementation)|adoption]] type of the instant changeover, when everybody associated with the old system moves to the fully functioning new system on a given date.&lt;ref name="Eason1988"&gt;(Eason, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Copley|first=Steve|title=IGCSE ICT|url=http://www.igcseict.info/theory/8/implem/|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wainwright|first=Stewart|title=IGSCE and O Level Computer Studies and Information Technology|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=29|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9780521545402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a new [[Conceptual system|system]] needs to be implemented in an [[organization]], there are three different ways to adopt this new system: the big bang adoption, [[phased adoption]] and [[parallel adoption]].  In case of parallel adoption the old and the new system are running parallel, so all the users can get used to the new system, and meanwhile do their work using the old system.  Phased adoption means that the adoption will happen in several phases, so after each phase the system is a little nearer to be fully adopted.  With the big bang adoption, the switch between using the old system and using the new system happens at one single date, the so-called instant changeover of the system.  Everybody starts to use the new system at the same date and the old system will not be used anymore from that moment on.

The big bang adoption type is riskier than other adoption types because there are fewer learning opportunities incorporated in the approach, so more preparation is needed to get to the big bang.&lt;ref name="Eason1988" /&gt;  This preparation will be described below, illustrated by the process-data model of the big bang adoption.

== Big bang==

Once the [[management]] has decided to use the big bang method, and supports the changes which are needed for this, the real changing process can start.  This process comprises several steps: converting the system, releasing parts of the system and training the future [[user (computing)|users]].&lt;ref name="Eason1988" /&gt;

=== Convert the system===
At first, a [[planning]] for the whole adoption process is needed.  Making a planning allows future users to know what will happen and when they should expect certain changes, which avoids unnecessary uncertainties and therefore creates a better working atmosphere.  The planning also makes clear when the real adoption takes place and gives the future users the opportunity to get ready for this change.&lt;ref name="Eason1988" /&gt;  The model below shows that the activities (in the grey box) lead to outcomes (in the boxes next to the grey box) to be able to have a partial outcome: the converted system

[[Image:Convert system with Big bang.jpg]]

When the planning is made and everyone knows what is expected from them, the technical changeover can start.  First the old data needs to be converted into a form which is able to work with the data in the new system (Koop, Rooimans and de Theye, 2003). Then this  data needs to be loaded into the new system, which results in the so-called loaded data. This loaded data needs to be tested to check the efficiency of the data and to test the level of understanding of the future users.  Off-line [[Evaluation|trials]] need to be executed to check whether the system and the users can work together.  Not only do the efficiency and the understanding need to be tested, but the validity needs to be tested to make the level of [[data validation]] clear.&lt;ref name="Eason1988" /&gt; ).  If the data is not valid, the management need to determine the changes again and the organisation will have to prepare a different way of executing the Big bang adoption (See [[Adoption]]; Prepare an organization for adoption).

=== Release parts of the system===
[[Image:Release parts with Big bang.jpg]]

If all the data is valid, separate parts of the system can be [[Software release life cycle|released]].  The [[database]] which is converted from the old database needs to be released, so the new data is accessible.  Next,  the produced [[Application software|application]] needs to be released, so the new application can also be used.  The [[infrastructure]] of the whole new system also needs to be released, so that it is clear what the system will look like and how everything is connected (Koop, Rooimans and de Theye, 2003).  Important to note is that in this phase only separate parts are released, which don’t form the new system yet, but only parts of it.  Note that all of this happens off-line: only the system developers see this, the users are still working on the old system.  The model above shows what activities need to be executed (in the grey box) by the system controller, to get the outcomes that lead to the released parts.  If the release of the parts failed, the management need to determine new changes again (See [[Adoption]]; Prepare an organization for adoption).

===Train the organization in using the system===
[[Image:Prepare users with Big bang.jpg]]

If the release of the separate parts succeeded, the next step can be taken: prepare the users. To be able to introduce the whole new system, i.e. to adopt it, all users need to be trained in working with the new system.  Without huge consequences for the production level of an organization, training everyone is only possible if there is a buffer of experienced staff who can take over the daily work of the users that need to be trained.  This means that for all the people that need to be trained, there will be staff available who can take over the work, so there won’t be an enormous delay of work.  When this buffer is created, the users can be trained .&lt;ref name="Eason1988" /&gt;  The human resources department will create the buffer of experienced staff (activity in the grey box) by inviting applicants for the buffer.  Then the users can be trained and the trained users can be listed, so a user preparation report can be written.

But training the future users properly is not as easy as it seems, as the FoxMeyer case illustrates (Scott, Vessey, 2000).  This company used the big bang method to implement an [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) system.  Wrong trainings were given, the assumption was made that users already knew enough about it and wrong skills were taught.  Dow Corning also had big problems with acquiring the necessary skills during their big bang ERP implementation (Scott, Vessey, 2000).  Using a new system demands various skills and knowledge, which in several cases seem to be underrated by the (change) managers.

== Techniques==

There are several techniques to implement a new system. The adoption phase is only one phase of the whole implementation. [[Regatta]] (Koop, Rooimans and de Theye, 2003) is for example a method which is developed to implements systems. This method, developed by Sogeti, treats a changeover as a project and focuses several stages of this project, for example the preparation phase ([[Regatta: preparation phase]]) of an adoption and on the acceptance of an implementation method ([[Regatta: adoption method]]). [[SAP Implementation]] is another technique specialized in implementing and adopting [[SAP AG]] software, which is divided into several techniques.

== Risks==

Because of the instant changeover, everything must be done in a fixed time schedule. This is a risky operation. The organization might not be ready yet for this, an incorrect dataset might be used, or the information system can get stuck, because of a lack of experience and start up problems. Also an incapable fall-back method can be a risk in implementing a system using the Big Bang (Koop, Rooimans and de Theye, 2003).

===UK stock market, 1980s===
{{distinguish|Big Bang (financial markets)|section=true}}
The 1986 the [[London Stock Exchange]] closed on Friday night and the computers were all switched on the following Monday morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How technology has influenced The Stock Market. – Computers in the City|url=http://www.citc.it/how-technology-has-influenced-the-stock-market/|accessdate=19 June 2017|work=www.citc.it|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonstockexchange.com/products-and-services/rns/history/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this caused large losses.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Dow Corning===
Dow Corning formerly used systems that were focused on specific departments. The management decided that they wanted to become a truly global company, that would use only one information system: an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)-system. To adopt this new ERP-system, they used the big bang adoption type and they spent considerable time and effort reexamining its business processes. The company was prepared for the adoption and first conducted three pilot implementations, before using the new system across the global organization. Second, FoxMeyer adopted an ERP-system with ambitious warehouse automation software, using the big bang adoption to gain competitive advantage.  But FoxMeyer seemed to have an overoptimistic management with unrealistic expectations: the change was too big and too drastic.  This resulted in very high work pressure to meet the deadlines for all the employees.  So unrealistic expectations of the management are also a risk (Scott, Vessy, 2000).

Dow Corning monitored the progress constantly and made decisions to make sure that the deadlines would be met.  This was only possible with feedback and good communication.  FoxMeyer failed in having communication and attention that was necessary to be able to give fast and effective feedback.  They instead tried to minimize problems by ignoring them, and gave discouraging criticism, which resulted in ambiguous feedback.  This hindered [[organizational learning]], something which is very important during an organizational change.  So bad communication and ambiguous feedback are also risks when adopting a system with the big bang (Scott, Vessey, 2000).

Another risky strategy is to focus only on the outcome, not on how to achieve this outcome and underrating the learning process for users.  It is very hard to plan learning or knowledge, though these are necessary to be able to execute the big bang changeover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">'''Blow-Fill-Seal''' (BFS) technology is a manufacturing technique used to produce small, (0.1mL) and large volume, (500mL +) liquid-filled containers. Originally developed in [[Europe]] in the 1930s, it was introduced in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, but over the last 20 years it has become more prevalent within the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and is now widely considered to be the superior form of [[aseptic processing]] by various medicine regulatory agencies including the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the packaging of pharmaceutical and healthcare products. 

The basic concept of BFS is that a container is formed, filled, and sealed in a continuous process without human intervention, in a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] enclosed area inside a machine. Thus this technology can be used to [[aseptic]]ally manufacture sterile pharmaceutical liquid dosage forms. 

The process is multi-stepped: first, pharmaceutical-grade plastic resin is vertically heat extruded through a circular throat to form a hanging tube called the [[parison]]. This extruded tube is then enclosed within a two-part mould, and the tube is cut above the mould.  The mould is transferred to the filling zone, or sterile filling space, where filling needles ([[mandrel]]s) are lowered and used to inflate the plastic to form the container within the mould. Following the formation of the container, the [[mandrel]] is used to fill the container with liquid. Following filling the mandrels are retracted and a secondary top mould seals the container. All actions take place inside a sterile shrouded chamber inside the machine. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for labeling, packaging and distribution. 

Blow-fill-seal technology reduces personnel intervention making it a more robust method for the aseptic preparation of sterile pharmaceuticals. BFS is used for the filling of vials for [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] preparations and infusions, [[eye drops]], and [[inhalation]] products. Generally the plastic containers are made up of [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]. Polypropylene is more commonly used to form containers which are further sterilised by [[autoclaving]] as polypropylene has greater thermostability.

'''Boku Inc.''' {{LSE|Boku}} provides a [[mobile payments]] platform headquartered in [[San Francisco]], CA, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using their mobile phone number, with purchases billed to a consumer's mobile network operator bill. This form of [[mobile payment]], also referred to as [[Mobile payment|carrier billing]], allows unbanked consumers who may have a mobile phone, but no credit card or traditional bank account, to make purchases online, as well as banked customers who simply find carrier billing a simpler way to transact.
The majority of transactions processed through Boku carrier billing are for digital and virtual goods and services, including music streaming, online video, digital subscription services, mobile device app stores, social and [[free-to-play]] games, virtual goods, social networks and other online experiences. Boku focuses on making the mobile phone number a viable payment option not only for virtual goods, but for digital goods (i.e. MP3's, eBooks, movies, etc.) and physical goods.

==History==
Originally called Vidicom Ltd, and founded in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, U.K. in 2003 by Glyn Smith, Thomas Kirk and original angel investors Dr Steven Gillam, Philip Meakin and Chris Harris. A small number of investors joined before Vidicom Ltd was convinvced by non exec board Chairman Mark Berntstein to seek funding from venture capitalists in Silicon Valley for its application "Mobillcash". Vidicom succsefully secured funding from Khosla Ventures (US) and Index Ventures (UK) Marc Britto and Ron Hirson's services were secured and Vidicom Ltd incorporated Boku inc as a Delaware company in 2009 and reestablished itself as Boku Inc. Boku launched in the USA in 2009 with the internal acquisition of Mobilcash and new acquisition of Paymo – a provider in the mobile payments industry – as well as $13 million USD in investment from venture capital firms.&lt;ref name=Gigaom&gt;{{cite web| url=https://gigaom.com/2009/06/16/419-boku-raises-13-million-buys-paymo-mobillcash-launches-mobile-payment-se/| title=Boku Raises $13 Million To Buy Paymo And Mobillcash; Launches Mobile Payment Service| author=James Quintana Pearce| date=16 June 2009| publisher=Gigaom| accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Boku added $25 million USD in a series C round, led by [[DAG Ventures]].&lt;ref name=AllthingsD&gt;{{cite web| url=http://allthingsd.com/20100119/another-big-bet-on-mobile-payments-boku-raises-25-million/| title=Another Big Bet on Mobile Payments: Boku Raises $25 Million| author=Peter Kafka | date=19 January 2010| publisher=All Things Digital | accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Boku raised another $35 million USD round to be used to continue building out its payments business globally, led by [[New Enterprise Associates|NEA]] and existing venture capital investors.&lt;ref name="Techcrunch 2012"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/15/mobile-payments-boku-35m-nea-telefonic/| title=Mobile Payment Startup BOKU Raises A $35M Round.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7516">A '''bottom hole assembly''' (BHA) is a component of a [[drilling rig]].  It is the lowest part of the [[drill string]], extending from the bit to the [[drill pipe]]. The assembly can consist of [[drill collar]]s, subs such as stabilizers, reamers, shocks, hole-openers, and the bit sub and bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineers|year=1996|publisher=Gulf Publishing Company|location=Houston Texas|editor=William C. Lyons}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The characteristics of the BHA help to determine the borehole shape, direction and other geometric characteristics.

The BHA is used to help the drilling process; the proper selection of the right BHA would go a long way in ensuring high [[rate of penetration]] (ROP) and thus help drill quickly and efficiently. This would lead to lowered drilling costs.

==Variations==
===Rotary assembly===
Rotary assemblies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Halliburton: Petroleum Well Construction|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|author1=Michael L. Payne |author2=Lance D. Underwood|editor=Michael J. Economides |editor2=Larry T. Watters |editor3=ShariDunn-Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; are commonly used where formations are predictable and the rig economics are an issue. In such  an assembly the weight of the drill collars gives the BHA the tendency to sag or flex to the low side of the hole, collar stiffness length and stabilizer diameter and placement are engineered as a means of controlling the flex of the BHA. this will bring about the desired hold, build or drop tendency. 

The ability to vary the directional tendency of the assembly comes from varying the weight on the bit. A fixed assembly has only one directional tendency. The weight on bit allows you to tune that tendency.   

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) can be:
* slick with no stabilizers
* a pendulum bottom-hole assembly for reducing the deviation of a well
* packed with stabilizers for a straight hole / a short lock assembly
* a [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]] for increasing the deviation of the well / a long lock assembly

Bottom-hole assemblies are also described as
* specialized, such as articulated, 
* steerable, and 
* oriented or non-oriented.

===Fulcrum / Long Lock===

This assembly is used to build angle. The assembly usually incorporates a near bit stabilizer. Behind this would be a selection of drill collars and Heavy Weight Drill Pipe (HWDP). The length of the section AFTER the near bit stabilizer would determine the extent of the angle build rate. 

After the appropriate length of pipe after the near bit stabilizer you would place a drill string stabilizer. 

In short the longer the gap between the near bit and the drill string stabilizer the greater the angle building rate. Care must be taken to not have this section too long as the pipe may sag too much and rub against the borehole wall. This could result in key seating and pipe digging into the borehole wall.

===Stabilization / Short Lock===

This assembly is usually used to maintain borehole angle. This assembly is very rigid allowing little movement of the bit. 

Such an assembly would mean that the stabilizers are closely packed: a near bit stabilizer within 0–30 feet of the drill bit, and two more spaced 30 and 60 feet beyond it.  If a short drill collar is used, then the stabilizers can be even closer together. 

The shorter the distance between the stabilizers means that the drill collars bend less and the weight on bit (WOB) pushes directly on the bit, hence maintaining the angle.

===Pendulum assembly===

A pendulum assembly is used to reduce the angle build rate or reduce well-bore angle.

In this assembly there is no near bit assembly. The front portion of the (BHA) is allowed to hang as a result of its own weight. In such a case the first stabilizer is placed 30–45 feet behind the bit. 

This hanging means that there is a force acting on the low side of the hole, which causes the deviation. In the case of a straight hole then the bit simply continues downward.

===BHA configurations===
There are three types of BHA configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drill Stem Design and Inspection|year=1992|publisher=T.H. Hill and Associates Inc.|location=Houston Texas|author1=Tom H. Hill|author2=Randy C. Money.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These configurations addressed are usually concerned with the use or layout of drill collars, heavy weight drill pipe and standard drill pipe.

Type 1, standard simple configuration, uses only drill pipe and drill collars. In this instance the drill collars provide the necessary weight on the bit.

Type 2 uses heavy weight drill pipe as a transition between the drill collars and the drill pipe. Weight on bit is achieved by the drill collars. 

Type 3 uses the drill collars to achieve directional control. The heavy weight drill pipe applies the weight on the bit. Such a layout promotes faster rig floor BHA handling. It may also reduce the tendency for differential sticking.

In most cases the above three types of configurations usually apply to straight/vertical wellbores at most low to medium angle wellbores. For high angle and horizontal wellbore careful weight control of the BHA is a must. In this instance the weight may be applied by running the drill pipe in compression in the high angle section. The high angle may help to stabilize the drill pipe allowing it to carry some compression.

==BHA tools==
===Stabilizer===
A '''stabilizer''' is used within a column of drill collars. They help guide the bit in the hole. They play a major part in [[directional drilling]] as it helps determine the well-bore path and angle. 

It is used to
* equalize the load on the bit;
* prevent whirl of the lower assembly;
* minimize bit walk;
* minimize bending and vibrations that cause tool joint wear;
* prevent collar contact with the sidewall of the bore-hole;
* minimize key-seating with differential pressure;
* restrict lateral movement of the lower BHA as such they lower the strain on the drill collar and BHA connections.

'''Solid''' stabilizers have no moving or replaceable parts. The blades and the mandrel can be one piece (integral) or welded to the mandrel (weld-on/welded blade). The blades may be either straight or spiral. The working surface can be impregnated with tungsten carbide or diamonds inserts.

'''Replaceable blade''' stabilizers can maintain full gauge stabilization, but their blades can be changed with tools no machining or welding required

'''Sleeve type''' stabilizers have replaceable sleeves that can be changed in the field. The sleeves are either rotating or non-rotating. 

'''Reamers''' are stabilizers that have cutting elements embedded on their fins, and are used to maintain a gauged well-bore. They can be used to drill out doglegs and key-seats in hard formations. Due to the cutting ability of the reamer the bit does less work in maintaining well-bore gauge and more work drilling.

===[[Underreamer]]===
An [[underreamer]] is used to enlarge the well-bore, usually beginning at some point under the surface. It does this by utilizing expandable cutters that only deploy at the designated time or depth. It is not to be confused with hole opening which occurs from the surface and in most cases the hole opener tool is of a fixed diameter. 

The [[underreamer]] utilizes an increase in mud pressure or flow rate to deploy the expandable cutters. A corresponding pressure drop across the tool would indicate that the tool has fully deployed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2027">'''Catalytic combustion''' is a chemical process which uses a [[catalyst]] to speed desired oxidation reactions of a fuel and so reduce the formation of undesired products, especially [[pollutant]] [[NOx|nitrogen oxide gases]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) far below what can be achieved without catalysts. The process was discovered in the 1970s at Engelhard Corp.

==Chemical process==

Catalysts may be used to control combustion reactions in the following ways:
# fuel preparation, such as splitting long molecules into shorter ones;
# fuel oxidation to release heat energy;
# the destruction of pollutant gases in the exhaust.

==Technology==

Catalytic combustion was developed by Dr. [[William C. Pfefferle]] of Engelhard Corp by 1975.&lt;ref name=BioMed&gt;Worthy, Sharon. ''[http://news.bio-medicine.org/biology-news-2/Connecticut-chemist-receives-award-for-cleaner-air-technology-4451-1 Bio-Medicine: Connecticut chemist receives award for cleaner air technology]''. 23 June 2003. Retrieved 31 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded a company, Precision Combustion, in 1986 to develop catalytic combustors for gas turbines. Pfefferle holds more than ninety United States patents related to catalytic combustion. Other early work was carried out by researchers at [[Acurex]], [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], [[NASA]] and the [[United States Air Force]]. The technique was revisited in the 1990s, leading to two types of catalytic system: [[Catalytica]]'s fuel-lean approach, and [[Precision Combustion]]'s fuel-rich approach.&lt;ref name=NETL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/File%20Library/Research/Coal/energy%20systems/turbines/handbook/3-2-2.pdf | title=3.2.2 Catalytic Combustion | publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, USA Department of Energy | accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cold-cranking simulator''' ('''CCS''') is a device used to determine the low [[temperature]] performance of [[lubricant]]s, when starting a cold engine (i.e. cold-cranking). In this condition, the only [[energy]] available to turn the engine comes from the [[Automobile self starter|starter motor]] and the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], and it has been widely assumed that the system acts as a constant [[Power (physics)|power]] [[viscometer]]. The use of this device for this purpose is standardized as ASTM D5293.&lt;ref name = astm&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1520/D5293-17A | title = ASTM D5293-17a, Standard Test Method for Apparent Viscosity of Engine Oils and Base Stocks Between –10 °C and –35 °C Using Cold-Cranking Simulator | publisher = ASTM International | location = West Conshohocken, PA | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test development==
The cold-cranking simulator was invented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country = US | number = 3350922 | title = Engine viscosity simulator | invent1 = Kim Dae Sik | invent2 = Gerald K. Vick | assign1 = Esso Research and Engineering Company | gdate = 1967-11-07 | status = patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Dr. Dae Sik Kim of [[Esso]] Research and Engineering Company in 1964. The first [[prototype]] was built on his apartment kitchen table with [[Unimat]], a miniature lathe/milling machine, to minimize and avoid proper company procedures. He reported the results of his developmental work, titled: "Results of Cold Cranking Simulator and a Comment" at SAE Fuels and Lubricants Meeting in Palmer house, Chicago on May 18, 1965. Although the device was initially called "Kimometer", he refused to put his name on it and he named it for what it was intended.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Purpose of this test==
Cold-cranking simulator simulates [[rheological]] process of "an average engine" during cold starting. The engine's starter motor was replaced with a small series wound universal motor, a typical [[sewing machine]] motor, and the engine, with a specially designed cold cylinder and an insulated cylindrical rotor with a pair of parallel flats. The sample oil is continuously sheared under a periodically varying shear rate, lower when the flats pass. Oils in real engines are similarly sheared, high in the journal bearings, oscillatory on [[piston]] rings and low in galley. Most developmental work went into proper sizing of the flat to simulate relative shear rate distribution in an "average engine". Both an engine and simulator is calibrated with a set of Newtonian standard crank case oils with known viscosities.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

When SAE and ASTM decided to use the simulator for their future standard instrument, Esso R &amp; E Company gave a free exclusive license to Cannon Instrument Co of State College, PA to avoid conflict of interest.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

During past four decades many marginal improvements are being made but the basic design and idea remains. Various generations of the CCS have been made over the years, with the latest Cannon CCS-2100 utilising [[Peltier cooling]] and an associated chiller to operate essentially the same instrument as the original 1960s design.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In the late 1980s Ravenfield Designs, Heywood, England, redesigned the entire system from the ground up, utilising a novel system to accurately model the old instruments and created a new machine offering higher repeatability and reproducibility than former methods. The Ravenfield apparatus, designated Model CS is markedly smaller than the Cannon apparatus, incorporating the cooler, the PC, the instrument and sample pumping in a 600&amp;nbsp;mm square footprint.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] adopted the CCS test as part of the [[SAE J300|J300]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sae.org/servlets/pressRoom?OBJECT_TYPE=PressReleases&amp;PAGE=showRelease&amp;RELEASE_ID=109 SAE J300 specification&lt;/ref&gt; specification, and is the subject of [[ASTM]] test method D5293.&lt;ref name = astm/&gt;

==History==
The Djinn chair is one element of a series of Djinn furniture designed by noted French designer Olivier Mourgue.&lt;ref name=Fiell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Habegger /&gt; In 1964 the first piece of the series, a [[chaise longue]], was introduced by ''Airborne'' in [[Merignac Cedex]], France.&lt;ref name=Habegger /&gt; The rest of the series was released in 1965, and includes the iconic ''"Low fireside chair"'', a two seat [[Couch|sofa]], and a foot stool.&lt;ref name=Habegger /&gt; The set remained in production until 1976.&lt;ref name=Habegger /&gt; 

The name "Djinn" refers to [[Jinn|an Islamic spirit capable of changing shape]].&lt;ref name=Fiell /&gt; The design's low profile was an attempt to emulate the informal lifestyle of the time.&lt;ref name=Fiell /&gt; The set was introduced during a time when growing interest in Eastern mysticism was influencing Western decorative arts.&lt;ref name=Fiell /&gt;

==Survivors==
The stretch jersey covering used for the Djinn series did not wear well.&lt;ref name=Patton&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/19/garden/public-eye-30-years-after-2001-a-furniture-odyssey.html | title=Public Eye; 30 Years After '2001': A Furniture Odyssey | accessdate=March 1, 2011 | author=Patton, Phil | date=February 19, 1998 | publisher=[[NY Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worse yet, the polyether foam used in construction of Djinn chairs has a tendency to degrade over time, causing the pieces to become unusable.&lt;ref name=Patton /&gt; "Things should have a short life," Mr. Mourgue said in 1965, when he was 26.&lt;ref name=Patton /&gt;

Djinn chairs were sold worldwide, and in Europe they have become valuable designer collectibles.&lt;ref name=Patton /&gt; Values in Europe remain varied depending on condition, with professionally restored chairs selling for $1,000 or more, and sofas for more than $1,800.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} In the United States the chairs remain largely forgotten,&lt;ref name=Patton /&gt; and little effort at restoration has occurred.

A 1964-1965 green Djinn Chaise Longue is in the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. It was donated by George Tanier, Inc. in 1966 [http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=3358]

'''Eagle Vision One''' (EV1) is a military based Commercial Satellite Imagery (CSI) capability programmed and funded by HQ AF/A2QS (Air Force ISR Innovations). It is located at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany, and is staffed by intelligence personnel assigned to the [[24th Intelligence Squadron]] (24IS). The mission of EV1 is to maintain a deployable commercial satellite imagery system ready to support contingency operations, theater security cooperation events, and disaster relief efforts. The EV1 system consists of the two elements: a Data Acquisition Segment (DAS) which includes a direct downlink antenna and a computer server shelter that collects and processes imagery into a standard format, and a transit-cased Data Integration Segment (DIS) that processes the standard format products into useful products.

EV1 works with satellite vendors from France ([[SPOT (satellite)|Spot]] 4 &amp; 5), Canada ([[RADARSAT]] 1 &amp; 2), and India ([[Cartosat-3|CARTOSAT1 &amp; 2]]) to provide unclassified imagery to customers.

EV1 is part of a larger Eagle Vision enterprise that consists of four other units stationed in South Carolina, Alabama, California, and Hawaii.

Newest tools at EV1: EVR2EST is an unclassified imagery server used to upload and share imagery products. See the link below to view the EVR2EST server.

'''Fetoscopy''' is an endoscopic procedure during [[pregnancy]] to allow surgical access to the [[fetus]], the [[amniotic cavity]], the [[umbilical cord]], and the fetal side of the [[placenta]]. A small (3–4&amp;nbsp;mm) incision is made in the [[abdomen]], and an [[endoscope]] is inserted through the [[abdominal wall]] and [[uterus]] into the [[amniotic cavity]]. Fetoscopy allows for medical interventions such as a [[biopsy]] (tissue sample) or a [[laser]] occlusion of abnormal blood vessels (such as [[chorioangioma]]) or the treatment of [[spina bifida]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Thomas. Percutaneous minimally invasive fetoscopic surgery for spina bifida aperta. Part I: surgical technique and perioperative outcome.Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2014; 44: 515–524&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fetoscopy is usually performed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The procedure can place the fetus at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including fetal loss or preterm delivery, so the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed in order to protect the health of the mother and fetus(es). The procedure is typically performed in an [[operating room]] by an [[obstetrician-gynecologist]].

== History ==
In 1945, [[Björn Westin]] published a study which documented his use of a [[Panendoscopy|panendoscope]] to directly observe embryos.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Oc2pMJHYmWwC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Diagnostic and Operative Hysteroscopy|last=Perez-Medina|first=Tirso|last2=Font|first2=Enrique Cayuela|date=2011-04-30|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=9789380704692|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Agüero et al published a study which used [[hysteroscopy]] to observe various features of the fetus, cervix, and uterus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1972, Carlo Valenti of the [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center]] recorded a technique which he called "endoamnioscopy", which allowed for direct visualization of the developing fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valenti|first1=C|title=Endoamnioscopy and fetal biopsy: a new technique.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=15 October 1972|volume=114|issue=4|pages=561–4|pmid=4653838|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(72)90220-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallinat made the first attempt to standardize these techniques in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because of the invasiveness of these procedures and the high risk they posed to the fetus, they were largely discarded in favor of [[transvaginal sonography]] until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By that time, smaller instruments had been developed which reduced the risk to the fetus and provided a better visual for the physician. This in turn allowed for the development of techniques for surgical interventions such as biopsy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1993, authors such as Cullen, Ghirardini, and Reece had referred to this technique as "fetoscopy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The field of minimally-invasive surgical fetoscopy has continued to develop since the 2000s. Physicians such as [[Michael Belfort]] and [[Ruben Quintero]] have used the technique to remove tumors and correct spina bifida on fetuses within the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/fetal-surgery-spina-bifida.html|title=To Mend a Birth Defect, Surgeons Operate on the Patient Within the Patient|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2009/01/21/renowned-surgeon-ruben-quintero-joins-miller-faculty|title=Renowned surgeon Ruben Quintero joins Miller Faculty|author=Sarah B.

==Non-surgical fetoscopes==
Fetoscopy is a surgical procedure which may involve the use of a fibreoptic device called a [[endoscope|fetoscope]]. Some confusion may arise from the use of specialized forms of [[stethoscope]]s, including [[Pinard horn]]s and [[Doppler sonography|Doppler wand]]s, to audibly monitor fetal heart rate (FHR). These audio diagnostic tools are also called "fetoscopes" but are not related to fetoscopy.

'''Fragmentation''' is the process by which the casing of an [[artillery]] or [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[shell (projectile)|shell]], [[rocket]], [[missile]], [[bomb]], [[grenade]], etc. is shattered by the [[detonate|detonation]] of the [[explosive]] filler.

The correct [[Technical terminology|term]] for these pieces is "fragmentation" (sometimes shortened to frag); "shards" or "splinters" can be used for non-preformed fragments. Preformed fragments can be of various shapes (spheres, cubes, rods, etc.) and sizes, and are normally held rigidly within some form of matrix or body until the [[high explosive]] (HE) filling is detonated. The resulting high-velocity fragments produced by either method are the main lethal mechanisms of these weapons, rather than the [[heat]] or [[overpressure]] caused by detonation, although [[Grenade#Concussion|offensive grenades]] are often constructed without a frag matrix.

These casing pieces are often incorrectly referred to as "'''shrapnel'''"&lt;ref name=shrapneldef/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://osd.dtic.mil/photos/Nov2003/031111-D-9880W-175.html] [http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/HeroicDeedsOnOperationsHonoured.htm] Examples of use of "shrapnel" for casing fragments&lt;/ref&gt; (particularly by non-military media sources).

==History==
[[File:Ming Dynasty fragmentation bomb.jpg|thumb|180px|right|An illustration of a fragmentation bomb from the 14th century Ming Dynasty text ''Huolongjing''. The black dots represent iron pellets.]]
The use of fragmentation in bombs dates to the 14th century, and appears in the [[Ming Dynasty]] text ''[[Huolongjing]]''. The fragmentation bombs were filled with iron pellets and pieces of broken porcelain. Once the bomb explodes, the resulting shrapnel is capable of piercing the skin and blinding enemy soldiers.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Needham|title=Military Technology: The Gunpowder Epic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNcZJ35dIyUC&amp;pg=PR180|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30358-3|pages=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|For this bomb you take [[tung oil]], yin hsiu, [[salammoniac]], chin chih, scallion juice, and heat them so as to coat a lot of iron pellets and bits of broken porcelain.

When it bursts, it breaks into pieces that wound the skin and break the bones (of enemy soldiers) and blinds their eyes.|''[[Huolongjing]]'', Part 1 Chapter 2&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;}}
The modern fragmentation [[hand grenade|grenade]] was developed during the 20th century. The [[Mills bomb]], first adopted in 1915 by the [[British army]], is an early fragmentation grenade used in [[World War I]]. The [[Mk 2 grenade]] was a fragmentation grenade adopted by the [[United States Armed Forces|American military]] based on the Mills bomb, and was in use during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="weapons"&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Weapons of the World Encyclopedia: An International Encyclopedia from 5000 B.C. to the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Il9ubyJCisC&amp;pg=PA88|date=21 August 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-36832-6|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between fragmentation and shrapnel==
[[File:Shrapnel shell.gif|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Animation of a bursting&lt;br /&gt;shrapnel shell&lt;/center&gt;]]
The term "shrapnel" is often incorrectly used to refer to fragments produced by ''any'' explosive weapon. However, the [[shrapnel shell]], named for Major General [[Henry Shrapnel]] of the British [[Royal Artillery]], predates the modern [[high-explosive shell]] and operates via an entirely different process.&lt;ref name=shrapneldef/&gt;

A shrapnel shell consists of a shell casing filled with steel or lead balls suspended in a [[resin]] matrix, with a small explosive charge at the base of the shell. When the projectile is fired, it travels a pre-set distance along a [[ballistic trajectory]], then the fuse ignites a relatively weak secondary charge (often [[black powder]] or [[cordite]]) in the base of the shell. This charge fractures the matrix holding the balls in place and expels the nose of the shell to open a path for the balls, which are then propelled out of the front of the shell without rupturing the casing (which falls to earth harmlessly and can be retrieved and reused).&lt;ref name="ammo"&gt;U.S. War Department Technical Manual 9-1900 ‘'Ammunition, General'’. 18 June 1945. p. 106. Available: http://90thidpg.us/Reference/Manuals/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; These balls continue onward to the target, spreading out in a cone-shaped pattern at ground level, with most of their energy coming from the original velocity of the shell itself rather than the lesser force of the secondary charge that freed them from the shell. Since the cone of impact is relatively small, no more than 10 to 15 times the diameter of the shell, true shrapnel shells needed to be carefully sighted and judiciously used in order to maximize their impact on the enemy.

In contrast, a high-explosive shell contains a relatively large and energetic secondary charge of high explosive (known as a burster charge) which, when ignited by the fuse, produces a powerful supersonic [[shock wave]] that shatters the entire shell casing into many fragments that fly in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;What forensic conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of shell fragments: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1179/1574077313Z.00000000029?needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt; The use of high explosives with a fragmenting case improves efficiency as well as propelling a larger number of fragments at a higher velocity over a much wider area (40-60 times the diameter of the shell), giving high-explosive shells a vastly superior battlefield lethality that was largely impossible before the [[Industrial Era]]. [[World War I]] was the first major conflict in which HE shells were the dominant form of artillery; the failure to adapt infantry tactics to the massive increase in lethality they produced was a major element in producing the ghastly subterranean [[stalemate]] conditions of [[trench warfare]], in which neither side could risk movement above ground without the guarantee of instant casualties from the constant, indiscriminate hail of HE shell fragments.

One easy comparison between fragmenting HE and shrapnel shells would be to imagine a shell of each type standing stationary and base-first on the ground; a high-explosive shell would be equally lethal if detonated in this state vs. detonating on impact after being fired, whereas a shrapnel shell would ineffectually fire its contents only a few feet into the air in a cone-shaped pattern (while the casing itself remained intact).&lt;ref name=shrapneldef&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/faq/shrapnel.htm|title=What is the difference between artillery shrapnel and shell fragments?|date=March 1952|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210123724/http://www.history.army.mil/faq/shrapnel.htm|archivedate=10 February 2017|journal=Combat Forces Journal|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reduced area of effect of shrapnel shells can be exploited, such as in the creeping barrage tactics of World War I, where shrapnel shells were able to be used much closer to friendly infantry than HE shells could be.

Another artillery round very similar to (and directly predating) shrapnel is [[canister shot]], sometimes called [[case shot]]. Canister shot is a simple sheet metal casing filled with steel or lead balls. Upon firing, the casing fractures as it exits the muzzle of the gun and dispenses the balls from the gun’s muzzle much like a large [[shotgun]].&lt;ref name="ammo" /&gt; The practical differences between canister and shrapnel is that canister produces projectile separation immediately on detonation, and thus is only effective at short range (less than {{convert|200|yd|order=flip|disp=or}}),&lt;ref&gt;U.S. War Department Armored Force Field Manual 7-12, ‘'Tank Gunnery'’. 22 April 1943. Available: http://www.ahco.army.mil/site/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a shrapnel shell can travel hundreds of meters downrange before the fuse activates the explosive charge and separates the projectiles from the case, thus making it effective at much longer ranges.

[[Image:Fulton_MX-991U_Flashlight.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A photograph showing two Fulton MX-991/U Flashlights, next to an unofficial reproduction and a standard angle-head flashlight.]]

The '''Fulton MX991/U [[Flashlight]]''' (or sometimes known as a '''GI Flashlight''', '''Army flashlight''', '''moonbeam''' (Marine Corps&lt;ref name="SchadingSchading2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara Schading|author2=Richard Schading|title=A Civilian's Guide to the U.S. Military: A comprehensive reference to the customs, language and structure of the Armed Forces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQ1cqghFn3wC&amp;pg=PA270|date=8 December 2006|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=1-59963-331-0|pages=270–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or simply '''MX991/U''') is a model of angle-head flashlight currently manufactured by [[Fulton_Bag_and_Cotton_Mills#Changes_after_World_War_II|Fulton Industries]] which was issued to soldiers during the [[Vietnam War]], and has since remained in service with the [[United States Army]].

==History==
During [[World War II]], a request was made for a type of flashlight to be developed and used by soldiers being deployed by the US military. The TL-122 series of angle-head flashlights was developed by multiple manufacturers, most notably Bright Star, and issued to soldiers. It was used widely throughout the war, and the design remained fairly consistent throughout the following years.  

During the onset of the Vietnam War, a contract was offered to a manufacturer who could develop an updated version of the TL-122 series flashlights with improvements for the modern military requirements. The result was the MX-991/U angle head flashlight, and the contract was secured by Fulton Industries, and for a brief period, G.T. Price. Currently, Fulton Industries continues to manufacture the flashlight in various colors and modifications. These are available to civilians, law enforcement, and the military.

In recent years, many unnamed manufacturers from Asia have developed unofficial reproductions of the MX-991/U flashlight. Often the variants are physically and internally identical, with the exclusion of the "MX-991/U" printed into the side of the flashlight. These clones often include varying colours not available by Fulton, such as blaze orange, and also include different coloured lens in the tailcap such as yellow and green alongside the standard colours.

==Design==
The MX-991/U flashlight is an inexpensive, waterproof angle head flashlight that uses two [[D battery|D-cell batteries]] (military BA-30). It uses a standard incandescent bulb, and features a high-impact plastic body, a belt/equipment clip so that it may be fastened to a belt or strap, a tailcap lanyard ring, a multi-mode switch and tailcap with a storage compartment which houses multiple colored plastic lenses which is not available on the telecommunications variant of the flashlight.

==Features==
The multi-mode switch consists of three settings: Off, Signal, and On. When the switch is set to Signal, the user is able to press and hold a button located just above the switch to turn the light on, and it will switch off again when the button is released. This allows users to signal using [[Morse code]]. When the switch is moved up to the On position, the flashlight remains on without any further user interaction. The modern MX-991/U also features a switch guard which was not present in previous variants as issued in the Vietnam War. The switch guard was suggested as an improvement from soldiers during the war, and later added to prevent unintentional operation of the flashlight. This helped to prevent soldiers from accidentally giving their position away in the dark should equipment, clothing etc press the signal button or move the switch.

The tailcap consists of two compartments. The first houses the spring and keeps the batteries inside the flashlight body. Under the spring, a small plastic component houses a spare flashlight bulb. The second part of the tailcap consists of a small compartment that houses five plastic lens.

The nosecap of the flashlight has the ability to be unscrewed, and a custom lens can be fitted. The flashlight contains five lens in the tailcap, consisting of two red lens, blue lens, white lens, and diffuser lens (earlier three red and no blue-green). This enabled soldiers to send signals using different colors, or to cast the light in different methods. As the flashlight could not be focused/unfocused, the diffuser lens was used to spread the light in such a fashion that it would throw out a wide glow of light, as opposed to a narrow, focused beam.

Fulton currently manufactures the flashlight in varying color combinations, often to designate a special use or model:

* Olive Drab (The standard issue US military version which has been available since Vietnam)
* Yellow tailcap and nosecap with a black body (explosion-proof)
* White tailcap and nosecap with a teal body (telecommunications use)
* Grey (US military, usually Air Force use)
* Black (law enforcement use)
* Khaki/tan (US military use in desert conditions)
* Woodland Camo (military use or civilian camping use)

The flashlight is often sold at military disposal stores, and is popularly considered by many to be an ideal flashlight for camping or power outages, due to its low price, utility and durable body. The flashlight can also accept custom bulbs such as modern [[LED bulbs|LED lamp]], which greatly extend the battery life and provide brighter light than the standard incandescent bulbs. It is still widely recognized or known as a "GI Flashlight" for its military history or a "Boy Scout Flashlight" in referral to its resemblance to the brass stamped angle-head flashlights issued to Boy Scouts in the mid-century.

[[File:Appletons' Harvard John - Harvard hall.jpg|thumb|The first Harvard Hall, Harvard University, credited to be the oldest known example of a gambrel roof in North America, built c. 1677, burned 1766.]]
[[File:Mansard-section.gif|thumb|A cross-sectional diagram of a mansard roof, which is a hipped gambrel roof]]

A '''gambrel''' or '''gambrel roof''' is a usually [[symmetrical]] two-sided roof with two slopes on each side. (The usual architectural term in eighteenth-century England and North America was "Dutch roof.") The upper slope is positioned at a shallow angle, while the lower slope is steep. This design provides the advantages of a sloped roof while maximizing headroom inside the building's upper level and shortening what would otherwise be a tall roof. The name comes from the [[Medieval]] [[Latin]] word ''gamba'', meaning ''horse's hock or leg''.&lt;ref name="etym-gambrel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etym-gambol"/&gt; The term ''gambrel'' is of American origin,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., Gambrel:4.&lt;/ref&gt; the older, European name being a curb (kerb, kirb) roof. Europeans historically did not distinguish between a gambrel roof and a [[mansard roof]] but called both types a mansard. In the United States, various shapes of gambrel roofs are sometimes called [[Dutch language|Dutch]] gambrel or Dutch Colonial gambrel with bell-cast eaves, Swedish ~, German ~, English ~ , French ~, or New England gambrel.

The cross-section of a  gambrel roof is similar to that of a [[mansard roof]], but a gambrel has vertical [[gable]] ends instead of being [[hip roof|hipped]] at the four corners of the building. A gambrel roof overhangs the [[façade]], whereas a mansard normally does not.

==Origin and use of the term==
''Gambrel'' is a Norman English word, sometimes spelled gambol such as in the 1774 Boston carpenters' price book (revised 1800). Other spellings include gamerel, gamrel, gambril, gameral, gambering, cambrel, cambering, chambrel&lt;ref&gt;A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles: Founded Mainly ..., Volume 4. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to a wooden bar used by butchers to hang the carcasses of slaughtered animals.&lt;ref name="etym-gambrel"/&gt; Butcher's gambrels, later made of metal, resembled the two-sloped appearance of a gambrel roof when in use.&lt;ref name="patent"/&gt; Gambrel is also a term for the joint in the upper part of a horse's hind leg, the [[Hock (zoology)|hock]].  

In 1858, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] wrote:
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;Know old Cambridge? Hope you do.—
  Born there? Don't say so! I was, too.
(Born in a house with a gambrel-roof,—
  Standing still, if you must have proof.—
"Gambrel?—Gambrel?"—Let me beg
  You'll look at a horse's hinder leg,—
First great angle above the hoof,—
  That's the gambrel; hence gambrel-roof.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |class = journal | first= Oliver Wendell Sr. |last=Homes |chapter=The Professor Under Chloroform |wslink=The Atlantic Monthly/Volume 2/No. 5 |plaintitle=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] |volume=2:No. 5 |month=October |year=1858 |publisher=Jay Lauf |location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt; }}
&lt;!--
&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., "Parson Turell's Legacy or, The President's Old Arm-Chair: A Mathematical Story", ''The Poetical Works of Oliver Wendell Holmes'', Vol. 6, Poems From The Breakfast-Table Series (1857-1872). http://eremita.di.uminho.pt/gutenberg/7/3/9/7393/7393.txt accessed 2/3/2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
--&gt;
An earlier reference from the ''Dictionary of Americanisms'', published in 1848, defines ''gambrel'' as "A hipped roof of a house, so called from the resemblance to the hind leg of a horse which by farriers is termed the ''gambrel''."&lt;ref name="americanisms"/&gt; Websters Dictionary also confusingly used the term ''hip'' in the definition of this roof.

The term is also used for a single [[mansard roof]] in France and Germany. In Dutch the term 'two-sided mansard roof' is used for gambrel roofs.

==Origins of the gambrel in North America==
The origin of the gambrel roof form in North America is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, John Frederick. Early domestic architecture of connecticut. Unknown: 1924, Dover Publications, Inc. reprint 1963. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known gambrel roof in America was on the second Harvard Hall at Harvard University built in 1677.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M.. American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. 144. {{ISBN|0393731030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the oldest surviving house in the U.S. with a gambrel roof is the c. 1677–78 [[Peter Tufts House]]. The oldest surviving framed house in North America, the [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]], has an ell with a gambrel roof, but this roof was a later addition.

Claims to the origin of the gambrel roof form in North America include: 1) [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and [[England|English]] mariners and traders had visited or settled into the area of southeast Asia now called [[Indonesia]] prior to permanent European settlement in America. In Indonesia, they saw dwellings with a roof style where the end of a roof started as a hip and finished as a gable end at the ridge. The gable end was an opening, to allow smoke to dissipate from the cooking fires. This roof design was brought back to Europe and the American Colonies, and adapted to local conditions. The roof style is still in use around the world today;&lt;ref name="dummies"/&gt; 2) Seamen who traveled to the Netherlands brought the design back to North America;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atwood House Restoration Project  Documentary Video|url=http://www.chathamhistoricalsociety.org/AHM_restoration/AHP_video1.htm|publisher=Atwood House Museum|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3) or practical reasons such as a way to allow wider buildings, the use of shorter rafters, or to avoid taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E.

The '''Gelato Federation''' (usually just '''Gelato''') was a "global technical community dedicated to advancing [[Linux]] on the [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] platform through collaboration, education, and leadership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2001, membership included more than seventy academic and research organizations around the world, including several that operated Itanium-based [[supercomputer]]s on the [[Top500]] list. The organization was active in projects to enhance the Linux kernel for Itanium and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] for Itanium. The organization took its name from the Italian dessert [[gelato]], paying homage to this by naming sub-projects Gelato Vanilla and Gelato Coconut for varieties of the dessert.

== History ==
[[File:Gelato Federation timeline.jpg|thumb|Timeline of the Gelato Federation]]
In late 2001, representatives from seven organizations met with [[Hewlett-Packard]]. The institutions were the [http://www.bii.a-star.edu.sg/newsevents/news.asp?newsid=5 Bioinformatics Institute, Singapore]; [[École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Électronique et Électrotechnique|Groupe ESIEE]], France; Hewlett-Packard Company; [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]], USA; [[Tsinghua University]], China; [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], USA; [http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au University of New South Wales], Australia; and [http://gelato.uwaterloo.ca University of Waterloo], Canada. These were the founding members of Gelato.  

Representatives from these organizations met twice a year. The first few meetings (in [[Palo Alto, California]] 2001 and [[Paris]] 2002) were primarily a "strategy council meeting" where the by-laws and charter were hammered out.

The [[Sydney]] meeting in October 2002 was the first that included a day of technical presentations.  These became a regular feature of the meetings, eventually expanded to conferences, and thus the two conferences each year were entirely composed of technical presentations by vendors and members.

The organization apparently ceased operation in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/ shutdown notice]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
[[File:Gelato Membership.jpg|thumb|Gelato Federation membership]]
The federation grew markedly after its inception. By April 2007, there were more than 70 members and sponsors around the world. Members were institutions, but there were a few individuals who, because of their contribution to IA-64 on Linux or to Gelato, were made Honorary Members. These included [[Clemens C. J. Roothaan]] (who contributed to the Itanium math libraries and floating point unit), Brian Lynn (the original HP representative), David Mosberger-Tang (original porter of Linux to IA-64) and Jean-Pol Taffin (ex-general secretary of ESIEE, and very influential in the early days of Gelato).

Institutional members were sponsored by an IA-64 vendor, or came in on their own.  Sponsored members typically had specific projects in mind.

== Conferences ==
[[File:Gelato ICE.jpg|thumb|Gelato ICE]]
The Gelato ICE: Itanium Conference &amp; Expo alternated between San Jose, California and somewhere else in the world, often in Southeast Asia or Europe. Gelato conferences were where most of the collaboration and cooperation between members were established, and where Intel revealed some of their future strategy for the Itanium-based platform.  The last conference was held in [[Singapore]] in October 2007.

== Other activities ==
[[File:Gelato Workgroup.jpg|thumb|Gelato GCC on Itanium Workgroup]]
Apart from the Members' activities, Gelato funded a Central Operations (hosted at the  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Central Operations, in addition to running the twice-a-year meetings, tried to coordinate and manage a number of projects. These included:
* Gelato GCC on Itanium Workgroup, a group of members and sponsors of the Gelato Federation and the GCC community interested in improving GCC (the [[GNU Compiler Collection]]) on Itanium processors.
* Vanilla, a concerted effort to port and tune software for Itanium. In addition to the actual tuned binaries, the tuning process was documented.
* Coconut, a system of access to Itanium machines for members.
* The Gelato System Grant program, which provided Itanium systems for members.

== Sponsors ==
Gelato was funded by HP, Intel, BP, Itanium Solutions Alliance, and SGI. Gelato Central Operations was housed at the Coordinated Science Lab at the University of Illinois.

'''Graco''' (pronounced gray-co) is an American baby products company based in [[High Point, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="bberg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=843908 |title=Company Overview of Graco Children's Products Inc. |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned and operated by [[Newell Brands]]. Graco was founded in 1942 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Russell Gray and Robert Cone (hence the name) as Graco Metal Products, a company that fabricated machine and car parts. Rex Thomas (one of two engineers hired to come up with a sustainable product) watched his wife sitting on the porch, rocking their baby in a swing with a string tied to it, while she read a book. Rex went into work the next day and said "why don't we make an automatic baby swing." After 18 months of research and development, the Swyngnomatic - the world's first wind-up, automatic baby swing—was born in 1955, designed by company engineer Dave Saint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracobaby.com/about/pages/aboutgraco.aspx|title=About Graco   - Graco|website=www.gracobaby.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the company pioneered the invention of the Pack N' Play Portable Playard, the world's first portable playard (designed by Nate Saint, Dave Saint's son).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1998, Graco acquired Century, a car seat manufacturer and introduced the SnugRide infant car seat, which has become America's top-selling infant car seat line. Century actually introduced the travel system where a car seat could fit on a stroller for easy transportation. That same year, Graco was acquired by [[Rubbermaid]] (the company became Newell Rubbermaid in 1999 and [[Newell Brands]] in 2016). In 2002, Graco launched the TurboBooster, a booster seat designed to help parents stay in compliance with many states' passage of laws requiring children to stay in a car seat longer. In 2007, the company purchased established German baby product brand, Teutonia. The same year, the Nautilus® 3-in-1car seat debuted, earning the "Best Bet" designation from [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Then, in 2008, Graco acquired Aprica Kassai®, the number one selling baby brand in Japan. In 2014, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American baby brand, Baby Jogger.

Graco offers products including car seats, travel systems, strollers, high chairs, playards and baby swings.

A '''gravity battery''' is a type of mechanical battery that stores [[gravitational potential energy]], by raising a [[mass]], allowing that [[energy]] to be released (typically converted to [[electrical energy]] via a [[electric generator|generator]]), by allowing the mass to fall.

'''Griggs apparatus''', also referred to as a '''Griggs rig''', is a modified piston cylinder high pressure apparatus used to create an environment of high pressure, high temperature and to impart a deviatoric stress on a sample of material. It was conceived in the 1960s.

Sample sizes range depending on the specific Griggs apparatus but generally can be up to approximately 150 mm3, and temperatures of up to 1600 K along with pressures of approximately 3 GPa can be achieved.&lt;ref name="Greena nd Borch, (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Harry|author2=R.S. Borch|title=High pressure and Temperature deformation experiments in a liquid confining medium|journal=Geophysical Monograph Series|date=1990|volume=56|pages=195–201|doi=10.1029/gm056p0195|bibcode=1990GMS....56..195G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Griggs apparatus was conceived by David Griggs in the mid 1960s during his time at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Since the inception of the Griggs apparatus it has become the work horse of many rock deformation labs world-wide, and has also helped elucidate numerous facets of plastic deformation in crystalline materials including the [[hydrolytic]] weakening of [[quartz]].&lt;ref name="Griggs and Blacic, (1965)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griggs|first=David|author2=J.D. Blacic|title=Quartz: Anamalous weakness of synthetic crystals|journal=Science|date=1965|volume=147|issue=3655|pages=292–295|doi=10.1126/science.147.3655.292|pmid=17788211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The Griggs machine utilizes the same principle that other high pressure apparatuses (such as the [[diamond anvil cell]]) use to create elevated pressure on a specimen.

By generating a nominal force, in the case of the Griggs machine through a hydraulic ram, a greater force can then be applied to the sample by decreasing the area of subsequent pistons in series with the ram and in contact with the sample.

== Sample assembly ==
[[File:Griggs sample assembly.png|thumb|Example of one experimental sample assembly for a Griggs machine]]
The sample assembly is constructed of multiple cylindrical sleeves which are placed in the opening in the pressure vessel or “bomb”. The outermost sleeve is typically composed from NaCl which is used to transfer the vertical load applied from the steel piston into a confining pressure on the sample at the center of the assembly. NaCl is used since it is relatively weak and it assists in the transfer of stress. Directly inboard of the outer NaCl sleeve is a ceramic support sleeve with a [[graphite]] sleeve inside of it, which is used for resistive heating of the sample. The inner most sleeve which houses the sample along with the upper and lower alumina pistons, is commonly also composed of NaCl. In addition to this arrangement, the inner sleeve can also be composed of a ternary eutectic salt mixture which is called a molten salt cell.&lt;ref name="Greena nd Borch, (1990)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tingle et al., (1993)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tingle|first=Tracy |author2=H.W. Green |author3=T.E. Young |author4=T.A. Koczynski|title=Improvements to Griggs-type Apparatus for Mechanical Testing at High Pressures and Temperatures|journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics|date=1993|volume=141|pages=523–543|doi=10.1007/bf00998344}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage to the molten salt cell is the salt mixture melts at moderate temperatures which allows for a true hydrostatic pressure to be applied the sample. When using a molten salt cell it also becomes necessary to add an additional [[nickel]] capsule to contain the salt mixture in order to prevent damage to other parts of the sample assembly. Temperature is monitored by a side entry [[thermocouple]](s) that penetrate the wall of the graphite furnace and are directly adjacent to the sample, and are typically threaded through protective mullite insulation. The deviatoric stress is transferred to the sample through the σ1 piston. This piston is orientated in series with the upper piston, sample and lower piston within the inner sleeve which all sits on top of a [[tungsten carbide]] bottom piston.

== Design ==
[[File:Inner piston.jpg|thumb|Expanded view of the outer (σ3) and inner (σ1) pistons.]]A Griggs apparatus has the ability to create and maintain confining pressure on a sample while separately being able to strain the sample. Confining pressure is generated by advancing a hydraulic ram either by using a hand operated lever pump or a servo controlled syringe pump. The advancing ram then compresses the outer tungsten carbide piston (σ3) that in turn depresses the Pb plug at the top of the sample assembly and then in turn stresses the NaCl pressure medium. Deviatoric stress is created by a mechanical drive train that is powered by an electric motor that sits on top of the apparatus. When the electric motor is powered it engages with a set of gears that allow for variable strain rates to be chosen that range from 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;sec-1 down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;sec-1. 
To eliminate the torque from the advancing drive train produced by the gear set, a recirculating ball screw is located in between the gear set and deformation piston (σ1) that provides the axial load. Connected in series with the deformation piston is also an external load cell which measures the load applied to the inner (σ1). The outer (σ3) and inner (σ1) pistons that sit above the sample are two separate pieces, this allows for the advancement of the deformation piston with the drive train without altering the confining pressure which is operated with the hydraulic ram.

The design of the hydraulic ram produces an error in pressure measurements that are calculated from utilizing the oil pressure within the ram. Inside of the ram there is a large O-ring that seals oil in either the upper or lower portion of the ram. As the ram is pressurized and oil is transferred from the lower reservoir to the upper friction is produced by the motion of the O-ring along the inside wall of the ram. Since the ram needs to overcome the force of the friction to continue advancing, pressure measurements calculated using the oil pressure within the ram includes a contribution from the internal friction. The contribution of frictional force on pressure calculations can be described by the following relationship:

Calculated pressure = Confining pressure + Internal friction within the ram.

The total contribution of this friction to the value of measured pressure is different for each specific Griggs machine, but it has been shown that deviations between actual and measured pressure can be up to 10%.&lt;ref name="Burnley and Getting, (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burnley|first=Pamela|author2=I.C.

== Background ==
The company was founded in [[Melbourne]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=TheAge2007/&gt; as an international electronics trading firm, in a spare bedroom, by Rosmin Robertson (née Jaffer) and Bruce Robertson, Bruce developed the ground-breaking KI2000 Optical Light Source and KI020 Optical Talk Set.&lt;ref name=KF_History/&gt;

Bruce Robertson's technical involvement in fiber optics started 1980 - 1985, when he was a researcher at GEC's Hirst Research Centre in the UK, developing novel fiber optic cable designs,  manufacturing processes, fiber optic sensors &amp; instrumentation, and was awarded various patents.

In 1988, the business moved to a large garage, further contracts were won, and an Australian Federal R&amp;D Grant{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} was received for early development work on [[optical power meter]]s, which culminated in the release of the KI6000 series power meters soon afterwards.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1991, Kingfisher had grown into its first factory in [[Rowville]].&lt;ref name=KF_History/&gt; Kingfisher then located in facility in Scoresby from 2001 to May 2015, when it moved to new premises at 720 Springvale Road, Mulgrave Victoria 3170.

The company has always made its products in Australia.&lt;ref name=KF_History/&gt;

Kingfisher is one of the oldest fiber optic test companies,&lt;ref name = VicGovAU2005/&gt; and is regarded by industry elders as having a significant influence on the development of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;World Optical Light Source (OLS) Market Report, Frost &amp; Sullivan 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Optical Loss Test Set (OLTS) Market Report, Frost &amp; Sullivan 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Optical Power Meter (OPM) Market Report, Frost &amp; Sullivan 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Kingfisher products are used by professional technicians when installing and maintaining [[Optical fiber cable|fiber optic cabling]] and systems, and its fiber optic test equipment range includes such items as, [[optical power meter]]s, optical light sources, optical loss test sets, optical test and inspection kits, [[Optical attenuator|variable optical attenuators]], inspection [[Optical microscope|microscopes]] and various optical fault locators.

The company has worldwide distribution channels, and currently participates in various national and international standards development groups.

Since 2014, Kingfisher International has been wholly owned and managed by co-founder Bruce Robertson.

'''''Kryptos''''' is a [[sculpture]] by the [[United States|American]] artist [[Jim Sanborn]] located on the grounds of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in [[Langley, Virginia]]. Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the four [[cryptography|encrypted]] messages it bears. Of the four messages, the first three have been solved, while the fourth message remains as one of the most famous [[unsolved codes]] in the world. The sculpture continues to be of interest to [[cryptanalyst]]s, both amateur and professional, who are attempting to decipher the fourth passage. The artist has so far given two clues to this passage.

== Description ==
The main part of the sculpture is located in the northwest corner of the New Headquarters Building courtyard, outside of the Agency's cafeteria. The sculpture comprises four large [[copper]] plates with other elements consisting of water, wood, plants, red and green [[granite]], white [[quartz]], and [[petrified wood]]. The most prominent feature is a large vertical S-shaped copper screen resembling a scroll or a piece of paper emerging from a computer printer, half of which consists of encrypted text. The characters are all found within the 26 letters of the [[Latin alphabet]], along with question marks, and are cut out of the copper plates. The main sculpture contains four separate enigmatic messages, three of which have been deciphered.&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt;

In addition to the main part of the sculpture, [[Jim Sanborn]] also placed other pieces of art at the CIA grounds, such as several large granite slabs with sandwiched copper sheets outside the entrance to the New Headquarters Building. Several [[morse code]] messages are found on these copper sheets, and one of the stone slabs has an engraving of a [[compass rose]] pointing to a [[lodestone]]. Other elements of Sanborn's installation include a landscaped garden area, a fish pond with opposing wooden benches, a [[reflecting pool]], and other pieces of stone including a triangle shaped black stone slab.

The name ''Kryptos'' comes from the ancient [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word for "hidden", and the theme of the sculpture is "Intelligence Gathering".

The cost of the sculpture in 1988 was US $250,000 (worth US $501,000 in 2016).&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;

== Encrypted messages ==
The ciphertext on the left-hand side of the sculpture (as seen from the courtyard) of the main sculpture contains 869 characters in total : 865 letters and 4 question marks.

In April 2006, however, Sanborn released information stating that a letter was omitted from this side of ''Kryptos'' "for aesthetic reasons, to keep the sculpture visually balanced".&lt;ref&gt;Zetter, Kim. [https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70701?currentPage=2 "Typo Confounds Kryptos Sleuths" ''Wired'' April 20, 2006 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also three misspelled words in the plaintext of the deciphered first three passages, which Sanborn has said was intentional{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}{{dubious|date=May 2017}}, and three letters (YAR) near the beginning of the bottom half of the left side are the only characters on the sculpture in [[superscript]].

The right-hand side of the sculpture comprises a keyed [[Vigenère cipher|Vigenère]] encryption tableau, consisting of 867 letters.

One of the lines of the Vigenère tableau has an extra character (L). Bauer, Link and Molle&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Link and Molle, 2016, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that this may be a reference to the [[Hill cipher]] as an encryption method for the fourth passage of the sculpture.

Sanborn worked with a retiring CIA employee named [[Ed Scheidt]], Chairman of the CIA Office of Communications, to come up with the cryptographic systems used on the sculpture.

Sanborn has revealed that the sculpture contains a riddle within a riddle, which will be solvable only after the four encrypted passages have been deciphered.

He has given conflicting information about the sculpture's answer, saying at one time that he gave the complete solution to the then-CIA director [[William H. Webster|William Webster]] during the dedication ceremony; but later, he also said that he had not given Webster the entire solution. He did, however, confirm that within the passage of the plaintext of the second message which reads "Who knows the exact location? Only WW.", "WW" was intended to refer to William Webster.

Sanborn also confirmed that should he die before the entire sculpture becomes deciphered, there will be someone able to confirm the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Zetter, Kim. [https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/01/66333 "Questions for Kryptos' Creator,"] ''Wired'' (January 20, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to announce publicly that he had solved the first three passages was [[Jim Gillogly]], a [[computer scientist]] from southern [[California]], who deciphered these passages using a computer, and revealed his solutions in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/06/biztech/articles/16code.html|title=CIA's Artistic Enigma Reveals All but Final Clues|date=June 16, 1999|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=December 11, 2011|author=Markoff, John|authorlink=John Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Gillogly's announcement, the CIA revealed that their analyst David Stein also had solved the same passages in 1998 using pencil and paper techniques, although at the time of his solution the information was only disseminated within the intelligence community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Studies in Intelligence]]|format=pdf|title=The Puzzle at CIA Headquarters: Cracking the Courtyard Crypto |first=David D. |last=Stein |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB431/docs/intell_ebb_010.PDF|year=1999|volume=43|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no public announcement was made until July 1999.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/kryptos19.htm|title=Cracking the Code of a CIA Sculpture|date=July 19, 1999|work=Washington Post|accessdate=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zetter|first=Kim|title=CIA Releases Analyst's Fascinating Tale of Cracking the Kryptos Sculpture|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/analyst-who-cracked-kryptos/|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Security Agency|NSA]] also claimed that some of their employees had solved the same three passages, but would not reveal names or dates until March 2000, when it was learned that an NSA team led by Ken Miller, along with Dennis McDaniels and two other unnamed individuals, had solved passages 1–3 in late 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-03-17/news/0003180448_1_decipher-petrified-wood-cia-headquarters|title=Unlocking the secret of 'Kryptos'|date=March 17, 2000|accessdate=December 11, 2011|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|author=Bowman, Tom|authorlink=Tom Bowman (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request by [[Elonka Dunin]], the NSA released documents which show the NSA became involved in attempts to solve the ''Kryptos'' puzzle in 1992, following a challenge by [[Bill Studeman]], then Deputy Director of the CIA. The documents show that by June 1993, a small group of NSA cryptanalysts had succeeded in solving the first three passages of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=wired.com|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/nsa-cracked-kryptos-before-cia|title=Documents Reveal How the NSA Cracked the Kryptos Sculpture Years Before the CIA|first=Kim|last=Zetter|date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=slate.com|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/11/nsa_cracked_kryptos_statue_before_the_cia.html|title=NSA Cracked Kryptos Before the CIA. What Other Mysteries Has It Solved?|first=Jathan|last=Sadowski|date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above attempts to solve ''Kryptos'' found that passage 2 ended with WESTIDBYROWS, but in 2005, Monet Friedrich, a [[logician]], [[philosopher]], and [[computer scientist]] from [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, determined that another possible plaintext was: WESTXLAYERTWO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/sarenasix/home |title=From a radio interview on BellCoreRadio, season 1, episode 32, Barcode Brothers |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2005-10-11 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Sanborn announced that he had made an error in passage 2, and confirmed that the last passage of the plaintext was WESTXLAYERTWO, and not WESTIDBYROWS. Sanborn had inadvertently omitted a letter S in the crypt text.  By rotating the keyword to BSCISSAA it decrypts to WESTPLAYERTWO. The significance of this is that WESTXLAYERTWO is the original plain text. It was intentional that WESTIDBYROWS was discovered at a later stage by following a clue to manipulate the letter(s) X.&lt;ref name=error2006&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=Finally, a New Clue to Solve the CIA's Mysterious Kryptos Sculpture|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/second-kryptos-clue/|accessdate=25 November 2014|date=20 November 2014|work=Wired|quote=in 2006, Sanborn realized he had also made an inadvertent error, a missing "x" that he mistakenly deleted from the end of a line in passage 2, a passage that was already solved}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solutions ==
The following are the solutions of passages 1–3 of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Corey Lindsly |url=http://www.elonka.com/kryptos/mirrors/cypherpunks/1999/0930.html |title=Kryptos: The Sanborn Sculpture at CIA Headquarters |publisher=Elonka.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Misspellings present in the text are included verbatim.

=== Solution of passage 1 ===

Method : [[Vigenère cipher|Vigenère]]

Keywords: Kryptos, [[Palimpsest]]

ONLY WW THIS WAS HIS LAST MESSAGE X THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES SIX POINT FIVE SECONDS NORTH SEVENTY SEVEN DEGREES EIGHT MINUTES FORTY FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO

On April 19, 2006, Sanborn contacted an online community dedicated to the ''Kryptos'' puzzle to inform them that the accepted solution to passage 2 was incorrect.
He said that he made an error in the sculpture by omitting an "X" used to separate sentences, for aesthetic reasons, and that the deciphered text that ended "...FOUR SECONDS WEST ID BY ROWS" should actually be "...FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elonka.com/kryptos/CorrectedK2Announcement.html |title=The Kryptos Group announces a corrected answer to Kryptos Part 2 |publisher=Elonka.com |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coordinates mentioned in the plaintext: {{coord|38|57|6.5|N|77|8|44|W}} are for a point that is approximately 150 feet southeast of the sculpture.&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt;

This is a paraphrased quotation from [[Howard Carter (archaeologist)|Howard Carter]]'s account of the opening of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] on November 26, 1922, as described in his 1923 book ''The Tomb of Tutankhamun''. The question with which it ends is asked by [[George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], to which Carter (in the book) famously replied "wonderful things". In the November 26, 1922 field notes, however, his reply was, "Yes, it is wonderful.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/gri/4tut.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518224221/http://www.ashmolean.org/gri/4tut.html |date=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solution of passage 4 ===

Method(s) : Unknown.

No solution to Part 4 has been publicly acknowledged by either Jim Sanborn or Ed Scheidt to be correct.

=== Clues given ===

When commenting in 2006 about his error in passage 2, Sanborn said that the answers to the first three passages contain clues to the fourth passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zetter, Kim|authorlink=Kim Zetter|url=https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70701-1.html |title=Typo Confounds Kryptos Sleuths |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |date=April 20, 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2010, Sanborn released a clue, publicly stating that "NYPVTT", the 64th-69th letters in passage four, become "BERLIN" after decryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwartz |first=John |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/us/21code.html?hp |title=Artist releases clue to Kryptos |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2010-11-20 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=''[[All Things Considered]]'' |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/11/22/131520768/-kryptos-sculptor-drops-new-clue-in-20-year-mystery |title='Kryptos' Sculptor Drops New Clue In 20-Year Mystery |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanborn gave ''The New York Times'' another clue in November 2014: the letters "MZFPK", the 70th-74th letters in passage four, become "CLOCK" after decryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Clue to 'Kryptos'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/21/science/new-clue-to-kryptos.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 74th letter is K in both the plaintext and ciphertext, meaning that it is possible for a character to encrypt to itself. This means it does not have a weakness, where a character could never be encrypted as itself, that was known to be inherent in the German [[Enigma machine]]. It is believed that the "BERLINCLOCK" plaintext may be a direct reference to the [[Mengenlehreuhr|Berlin Clock]].{{Citation needed|reason=By whom?|date=August 2017}}

Sanborn further stated that in order to solve passage 4, "You'd better delve into that particular clock," but added, "There are several really interesting clocks in Berlin."&lt;ref name="berlinclock"&gt;{{cite web|agency=New York Times|title=Sculptor Offers Another Clue in 24-Year-Old Mystery at C.I.A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/us/another-kryptos-clue-is-offered-in-a-24-year-old-mystery-at-the-cia.html|last=Schwartz|first=John|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related sculptures ==
''Kryptos'' was the first cryptographic sculpture made by Sanborn.

After producing ''Kryptos'' he went on to make several other sculptures with codes and other types of writing, including one entitled ''[[Antipodes (sculpture)|Antipodes]]'', which is at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington, D.C., an "Untitled Kryptos Piece" that was sold to a private collector, and ''[[Cyrillic Projector]]'', which contains encrypted [[Cyrillic script|Russian Cyrillic]] text that included an extract from a classified [[KGB]] document.

The cipher on one side of ''Antipodes'' repeats the text from ''Kryptos''. Much of the cipher on ''Antipodes''{{'}} other side is duplicated on ''Cyrillic Projector''. The Russian portion of the cipher found on ''Cyrillic Projector'' and ''Antipodes'' was solved in 2003 by Frank Corr and Mike Bales independently from each other with translation from Russian plaintext provided by Elonka Dunin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol302/issue5643/r-samples.dtl Cyrillic Riddle Solved] [[Science (journal)|Science]], vol 302, 10 Oct. 2003, page 224&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ex Nexum'' was installed in 1997 at [http://www.gsa.gov/fa/#/building/266 Little Rock Old U.S. Post Office &amp; Courthouse]

Some additional sculptures by Sanborn include Native American texts: ''Rippowam&lt;ref name="rippowam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctmuseumquest.com/?page_id=5425|title=127. UConn Public Art Collection (8 of 30)|work=ctmuseumquest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' was installed at the [[University of Connecticut]], in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] in 1999, while ''[[Lux (sculpture)|Lux]]'' was installed in 2001 at an old [[US Post Office]] building in [[Fort Myers, Florida]].&lt;ref name="jimsanborn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimsanborn.net/main.html#publicartwork|title=Jim Sanborn: The Artist's Official Site|work=jimsanborn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Indian Run'' is located next to the US Federal Courthouse in [[Beltsville, Maryland]] and contains a bronze cylinder perforated with the text of the [[Iroquois]] Book of the Great Law.
This document includes the contribution of the indigenous peoples to the United States legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/hconres331.pdf | accessdate=2008-11-23 | title=H. Con. Res. 331, October 21, 1988 | publisher=United States Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The text is written in Onondaga and was transcribed from the ancient oral tradition of five Iroquois nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elonka.com/kryptos/sanborn/IndianRunPark.html|title=Sanborn's Indian Run  Artwork|work=elonka.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A,A|A Comma, A]]'' was installed at the Plaza in front of the new library at the [[University of Houston]], in [[Houston, TX]] in 2004, and ''Radiance'' was installed at the Department of Energy, Coast, and Environment, [[LSU|Louisiana State University]], [[Baton Rouge, LA|Baton Rouge]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="jimsanborn" /&gt;

== Pop culture references ==
The dust jacket of the US version of [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' contains two references to ''Kryptos'' - one on the back cover (coordinates printed light red on dark red, vertically next to the blurbs) is a reference to the coordinates mentioned in the plaintext of passage 2 (see above), except the degrees digit is off by one. When Brown and his publisher were asked about this, they both gave the same reply: "The discrepancy is intentional".  The coordinates were part of the first clue of the second [[The Da Vinci Code WebQuests|''Da Vinci Code'' WebQuest]], the first answer being ''Kryptos''. The other reference is hidden in the brown "tear" artwork—upside-down words which say "Only WW knows", which is another reference to the second message on ''Kryptos''.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elonka.com/kryptos/faq.html |title=FAQ About Kryptos |publisher=Elonka.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05147/511693.stm|title=CIA sculpture 'kryptos' draws mystery lovers|date=May 27, 2005|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=December 11, 2011|author=McKinnon, John D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kryptos'' features in Dan Brown's 2009 novel ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''.&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;''Secrets of the Lost Symbol'', pp.319–326&lt;/ref&gt;

A small version of ''Kryptos'' appears in the season 5 episode of ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' "[[Alias episodes (Season 5)#S.O.S.|S.O.S.]]". In it, [[Marshall Flinkman]], in a small moment of comic relief, says he has cracked the code just by looking at it during a tour visit to the CIA office. The solution he describes sounds like the solution to the first two parts.

A picture of ''Kryptos'' appears in the season 2 episode of ''[[The King of Queens]]'' "[[List of The King of Queens episodes#Season 2: 1999–2000|Meet By-Product]]". A framed pictured of ''Kryptos'' hangs on the wall by the door.

The progressive metal band [[Between the Buried and Me]] has a reference to ''Kryptos'' in their song "Obfuscation" from their 2009 album, ''[[The Great Misdirect]]''.

'''Meadow''' is a [[Black Angus]] calf who is believed to be the first [[bovine]] calf fitted with double [[prosthetic]]s.

Meadow was born in northeastern [[New Mexico]]. She lost both of her back hooves to [[frostbite]] and was found badly wounded on a neighbor's property by Nancy Dickenson, who has helped over a dozen other animals that have been injured.&lt;ref name=az&gt;{{cite news|title=Calf who lost back hooves receives prosthetic legs|date=2009-11-06|publisher=The Arizona Times|pages=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the serious injuries of the wounded calf, Dickenson wanted to give her the ability to walk again.&lt;ref name=huff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/04/cow-prosthetics-csu-scien_n_345620.html|title=Cow Prosthetics: CSU Scientist Give Calf A Pair Of Artificial Legs|last=Dabovich|first=Melanie|date=2009-11-04|publisher=Huffington Post Inc.|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After consulting with [[veterinarian]]s to ensure Meadow could lead a quality life, the doctors amputated a portion of the calf's hind legs and fitted her with new prosthetics. Colorado State [[veterinarian]] Dr. Robert Callan stated that he believes this to be the first bovine calf to be fitted with double prosthetics.&lt;ref name=huff/&gt; He has based this claim with talks he has had with other veterinarian clinics and schools.&lt;ref name=huff/&gt;

==Procedure==
The procedure took place at the [[Colorado State University]]'s (CSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The procedure involved five [[anesthesiologist]]s, expert large animal veterinarians, [[surgeon]]s, and CSU veterinary students. The reason for the large number of anesthesiologists was due to the number of difficulties involved in anesthetizing cattle. The most difficult of these is keeping the animal from [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirating]] its stomach contents while put asleep during surgery.&lt;ref name=Colorado&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.colostate.edu/story.aspx?id=2439|title=Veterinarians provide calf with two prosthetic limbs|last=Moellenberg|first=Dell Rae |date=2009-10-19|work=Veterinary Medicine|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person undergoes [[surgery]], they first go a period of time without eating or drinking before an [[elective surgery]]. This allows the patient's stomach to empty and decreases the opportunity of aspirating stomach content while placed under an anesthetizing agent. These precautions can not be undertaken when dealing with livestock. The calf's stomach has compartments that work "like a giant fermenting vat".&lt;ref name=Colorado/&gt; This means that the stomach can never be emptied. Because of this, the food material within the stomach is frequently regurgitated back into the mouth. Coupled with a large amount of [[saliva]], this placed the calf at a high risk of aspiration of this material. This in return could lead to an airway obstruction and later [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=Colorado/&gt;

==Recovery==
[[File:Meadow 3.JPG|200px||left]]
Meadow has since returned from the successful operation and prosthetic fittings. Dickenson has said she is adjusting well to her new legs as she recuperates at her new home at Twin Willows Ranch. She can be seen running and grazing, and is said to be "making friends with goats in a nearby pen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,571572,00.html|title=Calf Fitted with Prosthetic Hind Leg|last=Associated Press|date=2008-11-04|publisher=Fox News Inc.|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10847">'''Microwave engineering''' pertains to the study and design of [[microwave]] circuits, components, and systems. Fundamental principles are applied to analysis, design and measurement techniques in this field. The short [[wavelengths]] involved distinguish this discipline from [[Electronic engineering]]. This is because there are different interactions with circuits, transmissions and propagation characteristics at microwave frequencies.

Some theories and devices that pertain to this field are [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], [[radar]], [[transmission line]]s, space based systems ([[remote sensing]]), measurements, microwave radiation hazards and safety measures.

During World War II microwave engineering played a significant role in developing radar that could accurately locate enemy ships and planes with a focused beam of [[EM radiation]]. The foundations of this discipline are found in [[Maxwell's equations]] and the work of [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]]'s [[waveguide|waveguide theory]], [[J.C. Bose]], the [[klystron]] from Russel and Varian Bross, as well as contributions from Perry Spencer, and others.&lt;ref name=Das&gt;

==The microwave domain==
[[EM spectrum|Microwave]] is a term used to identify electromagnetic waves above 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; megahertz (1 Gigahertz) up to 300 Gigahertz because of the short physical wavelengths of these frequencies. Short [[wavelength]] energy offers distinct advantages in many applications. For instance, sufficient directivity can be obtained using relatively small antennas and low-power transmitters. These characteristics are ideal for use in both military and civilian radar and communication applications. Small antennas and other small components are made possible by microwave frequency applications. The size advantage can be considered as part of a solution to problems of space, or weight, or both. Microwave frequency usage is significant for the design of shipboard radar because it makes possible the detection of smaller targets. Microwave frequencies present special problems in transmission, generation, and circuit design that are not encountered at lower frequencies. Conventional [[circuit theory]] is based on [[voltages]] and [[Electric current|current]]s while microwave theory is based on [[electromagnetic fields]].&lt;ref name=neetstheory&gt;

Apparatus and techniques may be described qualitatively as "microwave" when the wavelengths of signals are roughly the same as the dimensions of the equipment, so that [[Lumped element model|lumped-element circuit theory]] is inaccurate. As a consequence, practical microwave technique tends to move away from the discrete [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s used with lower frequency [[radio waves]]. Instead, [[Distributed element model|distributed circuit element]]s and transmission-line theory are more useful methods for design and analysis. Open-wire and coaxial [[transmission line]]s give way to [[waveguide]]s and [[stripline]], and lumped-element tuned circuits are replaced by cavity [[resonator]]s or resonant lines. Effects of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[scattering]], [[diffraction]] and atmospheric [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] usually associated with visible light are of practical significance in the study of microwave [[Radio propagation|propagation]]. The same [[Maxwell's equations|equations]] of electromagnetic theory apply at all frequencies.&lt;ref name=Das/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph was directly copied from the Wikipedia article entitled [[Microwave]]. (September 04, 2011). However this material is covered by the reliable source provided in this article (Das, Annapurna; and Sisir K. Das. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU19Uemy83YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=microwave+engineering&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false   Microwave Engineering]''. McGraw-Hill Higher Education).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance==
The microwave engineering discipline has become relevant as the [[microwave]] domain moves into the commercial sector, and no longer only applicable to 20th and 21st century [[History of military technology|military technologies]]. Inexpensive components and  digital communications in the microwave domain have opened up areas pertinent to this discipline. Some of these areas are radar, [[satellite]], [[wireless radio]], [[optical communication]], faster computer circuits, and  collision avoidance radar.&lt;ref name=tufts/&gt;

A '''Multi-evaporator system''' is a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] system generally consisting of four major components:
* 1.[[Evaporator]]
* 2.[[Gas compressor|Compressor]]
* 3.[[Condenser (heat transfer)|Condenser]]
* 4.[[Thermal expansion valve]]

Sometimes in a refrigerator several loads are varied. Refrigerators used to function at different loads operated under different condition of temperatures and pressures. There may be arrangements possible for multi evaporators on the basis of single or multi compressors. If refrigerant from each evaporator compressed in the same single compressor then it is called as Multi-evaporator single-compressor system.

== Single Compressor-Individual Expansion Valve==
A two evaporator single compressor with ''individual expansion valves'' for each evaporator after passing through the back pressure valve enters into the compressors and hence there is a significant rise in temperature is observed. 
This system helps in dropping the pressure from high pressure evaporators with the help of back pressure valves. The high pressure ratio is obtained which necessarily compresses the vapor to high extent from the higher temperature evaporators to condenser temperature. This kind of refrigerator has greater application in load varying purpose. Moreover, high value of COP and better operating economy is observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refrigertion and air conditi|last=A|first=D|publisher=df|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=sfs|last=fs|first=sf|publisher=sds|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass flow rate through evaporators :-

m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=Heat through evaporator 1(Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)÷(specific enthalpy difference in evaporator 1)

m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=Heat through evaporator 1(Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)÷(specific enthalpy difference in evaporator 2))

The net Work done is :-
*  W = (Sum of masses through evaporator 1 and evaporator 2)*(specific enthalpy difference in compressor)
*  W = (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)*(h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="986">In [[computer programming]], an '''opaque predicate''' is a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]—an expression that evaluates to either "true" or "false"—for which the outcome is known by the programmer ''a priori'', but which, for a variety of reasons, still needs to be evaluated at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. Opaque predicates have been used as [[watermark]]s, as it will be identifiable in a program's executable. They can also be used to prevent an overzealous [[Compiler optimization|optimizer]] from optimizing away a portion of a program.

[[File:Bells Photophon Schema.jpg|thumb|A diagram from one of Bell's 1880 papers]]

The '''photophone''' is a [[telecommunications]] device that allows [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of speech on a beam of [[light]]. It was invented jointly by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] on February 19, 1880, at Bell's laboratory at 1325 L Street in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pg. 336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SDU"/&gt; Both were later to become full associates in the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Laboratory projects|Volta Laboratory Association]], created and financed by Bell.

On June 3, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message from the roof of the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]] to the window of Bell's laboratory, some 213 meters (about 700&amp;nbsp;ft.) away.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pg. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carson 2007, pg. 76-78"&gt;Carson 2007, pg. 76-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 11"&gt;Mims 1982, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell believed the photophone was his most important [[invention]]. Of the 18 [[patent]]s granted in Bell's name alone, and the 12 he shared with his collaborators, four were for the photophone, which Bell referred to as his "greatest achievement", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was "the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone".&lt;ref name="Phillipson+Neilson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 14"&gt;Mims 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The photophone was a precursor to the [[fiber-optic communication]] systems that achieved worldwide popular usage starting in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AmericanScientist-1984.V72.No1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallardo+Mims"/&gt; The master patent for the photophone ({{US patent|235199}} ''Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone'') was issued in December 1880,&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt; many decades before its principles came to have practical applications.

==Design==
[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|A photophone receiver and headset, one half of Bell and Tainter's optical telecommunication system of 1880]]

The photophone was similar to a contemporary telephone, except that it used [[free-space optical communication#Visible light communication|modulated light]] as a means of wireless transmission while the telephone relied on [[modulation|modulated]] [[electricity]] carried over a conductive [[two-wire circuit|wire circuit]].

Bell's own description of the light modulator:&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

{{Quote
| We have found that the simplest form of apparatus for producing the effect consists of a plane mirror of flexible material against the back of which the speaker's voice is directed. Under the action of the voice the mirror becomes alternately convex and concave and thus alternately scatters and condenses the light.}}

The brightness of a reflected beam of light, as observed from the location of the receiver, therefore varied in accordance with the audio-frequency variations in air pressure—the sound waves—which acted upon the mirror.

In its initial form, the photophone receiver was also non-electronic, using the [[photoacoustic effect]]. Bell found that many substances could be used as direct light-to-sound transducers. [[Lampblack]] proved to be outstanding. Using a fully modulated beam of sunlight as a test signal, one experimental receiver design, employing only a deposit of lampblack, produced a tone that Bell described as "painfully loud" to an ear pressed close to the device.

In its ultimate electronic form, the photophone receiver used a simple [[selenium#Other uses|selenium cell]] [[photodetector]] at the [[focus (optics)|focus]] of a parabolic mirror.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt; The cell's [[electrical resistance]] (between about 100 and 300 [[ohm]]s) varied inversely with the light falling upon it, i.e., its resistance was higher when dimly lit, lower when brightly lit. The selenium cell took the place of a carbon microphone—also a variable-resistance device—in the circuit of what was otherwise essentially an ordinary telephone, consisting of a battery, an electromagnetic earphone, and the variable resistance, all connected in series. The selenium modulated the current flowing through the circuit, and the current was converted back into variations of air pressure—sound—by the earphone.

In his speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1880, Bell gave credit for the first demonstration of speech transmission by light to Mr. A.C. Brown of London in the Fall of 1878.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt;

Because the device used radiant energy, the French scientist [[:fr:Ernest Mercadier|Ernest Mercadier]] suggested that the invention should not be named 'photophone', but 'radiophone', as its mirrors reflected the Sun's radiant energy in multiple bands including the invisible [[infrared|infrared band]].&lt;ref name="Grosvenor &amp; Wesson"&gt;Grosvenor and Wesson 1997, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell used the name for a while but it should not be confused with the later invention "[[radiophone]]" which used [[radio wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Victor Heyn, Fire of genius: inventors of the past century: based on the files of Popular Science Monthly since its founding in 1872, Anchor Press/Doubleday - 1976, page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==First successful wireless voice communications==

[[File:Photophone receiver 4074172975 288f2808f0 o.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a photophone receiver, depicting the conversion of modulated light to sound, as well as its electrical power source (P)]]

While honeymooning in Europe with his bride [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]], Bell likely read of the newly discovered property of selenium having a variable resistance when acted upon by light, in a paper by Robert Sabine as published in ''Nature'' on 25 April 1878. In his experiments, Sabine used a meter to see the effects of light acting on selenium connected in a circuit to a battery. However Bell reasoned that by adding a telephone receiver to the same circuit he would be able to hear what Sabine could only see.&lt;ref&gt;Mims 1982, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bell's former associate, [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]], was fully occupied as the superintendent of manufacturing for the nascent [[Bell Telephone Company]] back in Boston, Massachusetts, Bell hired [[Charles Sumner Tainter]], an instrument maker who had previously been assigned to the [[transit of Venus, 1874|U.S. 1874 Transit of Venus Commission]], for his new [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|'L' Street laboratory in Washington]], at the rate of $15 per week.&lt;ref&gt;Mims 1982, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 1880 the pair had managed to make a functional photophone in their new laboratory by attaching a set of metallic gratings to a diaphragm, with a beam of light being interrupted by the gratings movement in response to spoken sounds. When the modulated light beam fell upon their selenium receiver Bell, on his headphones, was able to clearly hear Tainter singing ''Auld Lang Syne''.&lt;ref&gt;Mims 1982, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 1, 1880 [[Washington, D.C.]] experiment, Bell and Tainter communicated some {{convert|79|m|ft|}} along an alleyway to the laboratory's rear window. Then a few months later on June 21 they succeeded in communicating clearly over a distance of some 213 meters (about 700&amp;nbsp;ft.), using plain [[sunlight]] as their light source, [[incandescent light bulb#History of the light bulb|practical electrical lighting]] having only just been introduced to the U.S. by [[Thomas Edison|Edison]]. The transmitter in their latter experiments had sunlight reflected off the surface of a very thin mirror positioned at the end of a speaking tube; as words were spoken they cause the mirror to oscillate between convex and concave, altering the amount of light reflected from its surface to the receiver. Tainter, who was on the roof of the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]], spoke to Bell, who was in his laboratory listening and who signaled back to Tainter by waving his hat vigorously from the window, as had been requested.&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 11"/&gt;

The receiver was a [[parabolic reflector|parabolic mirror]] with [[selenium#Other uses|selenium cells]] at its focal point.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt; Conducted from the roof of the Franklin School to Bell's laboratory at 1325 'L' Street, this was the world's first formal wireless telephone communication (away from their laboratory), thus making the photophone the world's earliest known voice [[wireless telephone (disambiguation)|wireless telephone]] systems{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, at least 19 years ahead of the first spoken radio wave transmissions. Before Bell and Tainter had concluded their research in order to move on to the development of the [[Graphophone]], they had devised some 50 different methods of modulating and demodulating light beams for optical telephony.&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 12"&gt;Mims 1982, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and adoption==

The telephone itself was still something of a novelty, and [[radio]] was decades away from commercialization. The social resistance to the photophone's futuristic form of communications could be seen in an August 1880 ''[[New York Times]]'' commentary:&lt;ref name="NYT-18800830"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Fiber Optics &amp; Communication, June 1986, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|The ordinary man ... will find a little difficulty in comprehending how sunbeams are to be used. Does Prof. Bell intend to connect Boston and Cambridge ... with a line of sunbeams hung on [[utility pole|telegraph posts]], and, if so, what diameter are the sunbeams to be ....[and] will it be necessary to insulate them against the weather ... until (the public) sees a man going through the streets with a coil of No. 12 sunbeams on his shoulder, and suspending them from pole to pole, there will be a general feeling that there is something about Professor Bell's photophone which places a tremendous strain on human credulity.}}

However at the time of their February 1880 breakthrough, Bell was immensely proud of the achievement, to the point that he wanted to name his new second daughter "Photophone", which was subtly discouraged by his wife [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Bell]] (they instead chose "Marian", with "Daisy" as her [[nickname]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carson 2007, pg.77&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote somewhat enthusiastically:&lt;ref name="Carson 2007, pg. 76-78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990, pg.337"&gt;Bruce 1990, pg. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|I have heard articulate speech by sunlight! I have heard a ray of the sun laugh and cough and sing! ...I have been able to hear a shadow and I have even perceived by ear the passage of a cloud across the sun's disk. You are the grandfather of the Photophone and I want to share my delight at my success.|[[Alexander Graham Bell]]|in a letter to his father [[Alexander Melville Bell]], dated February 26, 1880}}

Bell transferred the photophone's [[intellectual property]] rights to the [[Bell Telephone Company|American Bell Telephone Company]] in May 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pg. 339&lt;/ref&gt; While Bell had hoped his new photophone could be used by ships at sea and to also displace the plethora of telephone lines that were blooming along busy city boulevards,&lt;ref name="NS-1984.01.12"/&gt; his design failed to protect its transmissions from [[precipitation (meteorology)|outdoor interferences]] such as clouds, fog, rain, snow and such, that could easily disrupt the transmission of light.&lt;ref&gt;Carson 2007, pp.77-78&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as the weather and the lack of light inhibited the use of Bell's invention.&lt;ref&gt;Carson 2007, pg.78&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after its invention laboratories within the [[Bell System]] continued to improve the photophone in the hope that it could supplement or replace expensive conventional [[telephone line]]s. Its earliest non-experimental use came with military communication systems during World War I and II, its key advantage being that its light-based transmissions could not be intercepted by the enemy.

Bell pondered the photophone's possible scientific use in the [[spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] of artificial light sources, [[star]]s and [[sunspot]]s. He later also speculated on its possible future applications, though he did not anticipate either the [[laser]] or [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic telecommunications]]:&lt;ref name="Bruce 1990, pg.337"/&gt;

{{Quote
|Can Imagination picture what the future of this invention is to be!.... We may talk by light to any visible distance without any conduction wire.... In general science, discoveries will be make by the Photophone that are undreamed of just now.}}

==Further development==
[[File:Ernst Ruhmer, Technical World cover (1905).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ernst Ruhmer at his "photo-electric" optical telephone system station. (1905)&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015057148481;view=1up;seq=13 Cover page] ''Technical World'', March 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although Bell Telephone researchers made several modest incremental improvements on Bell and Tainter's design, [[Guglielmo Marconi#Radio work|Marconi's radio transmissions]] started to far surpass the maximum range of the photophone as early as 1897&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 14"/&gt; and further development of the photophone was largely arrested until German-Austrian experiments began at the turn of the 20th century.

The German physicist [[Ernst Ruhmer]] believed that the increased sensitivity of his improved selenium cells, combined with the superior receiving capabilities of professor H. T. Simon's "speaking arc", would make the photophone practical over longer signalling distances. Ruhmer carried out a series of experimental transmissions along the [[Havel|Havel river]] and on Lake Wannsee from 1901 to 1902. He reported achieving sending distances under good conditions of 15 kilometers (9 miles),&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090837562;view=1up;seq=133 "Correspondence: Wireless Telephony"] (October 30, 1902 letter from Ernst Ruhmer), ''The Electrician'', November 7, 1902, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt; with equal success during the day and at night. He continued his experiments around Berlin through 1904, in conjunction with the German Navy, which supplied high-powered searchlights for use in the transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b33006;view=1up;seq=73 ''Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice''] by Ernst Ruhmer, 1908, pages 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Siemens &amp; Halske|Siemens &amp; Halske Company]] boosted the photophone's range by utilizing current-modulated carbon arc lamps which provided a useful range of approximately {{convert|8|km|mi}}. They produced units commercially for the [[German Navy]], which were further adapted to increase their range to {{convert|11|km|mi}} using voice-modulated ship [[searchlight]]s.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt;

[[British Admiralty]] research during WWI resulted in the development of a vibrating mirror modulator in 1916. More sensitive [[molybdenite]] receiver cells, which also had greater sensitivity to infra-red radiation, replaced the older selenium cells in 1917.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt; The United States and German governments also worked on technical improvements to Bell's system.&lt;ref&gt;Mims 1982, pp. 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1935 the German [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Company]] had started producing infra-red photophones for the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]'s tank battalions, employing tungsten lamps with infra-red filters which were modulated by vibrating mirrors or prisms. These also used receivers which employed [[lead sulfide]] detector cells and amplifiers, boosting their range to {{convert|14|km|mi}} under optimal conditions. The Japanese and Italian armies also attempted similar development of lightwave telecommunications before 1945.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt;

Several military laboratories, including those in the United States, continued R&amp;D efforts on the photophone into the 1950s, experimenting with high-pressure vapour and mercury arc lamps of between 500 and 2,000 watts power.&lt;ref name="Groth"/&gt;

On March 3, 1947, the centenary of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s birth, the [[Pioneers, a Volunteer Network|Telephone Pioneers of America]] dedicated a historical marker on the side of one of the buildings, the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]], which Bell and [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] used for their first formal trial involving a considerable distance. Tainter had originally stood on the roof of the school building and transmitted to Bell at the window of his laboratory. The marker did not acknowledge Tainter's scientific and engineering contributions.{{original research inline|date=September 2017}}

On February 19, 1980, exactly 100 years to the day after Bell and Tainter's first photophone transmission in their laboratory, staff from the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[National Geographic Society]] and AT&amp;T's [[Bell Labs]] gathered at the location of Bell’s former 1325 'L' Street [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C. for a commemoration of the event.&lt;ref name="Gallardo+Mims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NS-1986.02.27"/&gt;

The Photophone Centenary commemoration had first been proposed by electronics researcher and writer [[Forrest Mims|Forrest M. Mims]], who suggested it to Dr. [[Melville Bell Grosvenor]], the inventor's grandson, during a visit to his office at the National Geographic Society. The historic grouping later observed the centennial of the photophone's first successful laboratory transmission by using Mims hand-made demonstration photophone, which functioned similar to Bell and Tainter's model.&lt;ref name="Mims 1982, p. 12"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|

The demonstration model was a replica in principle but not identical to Bell and Tainter's model. The commemorative model transmitter was a thin mirror cemented to a short aluminum speaking tube, and its receiver was a silicon solar cell and audio amplifier, both installed in a lantern light housing.

|group="Note"}}

Mims also built and provided a pair of modern hand-held battery-powered [[fiber-optic communication#Transmitters|LED transceivers]] connected by {{convert|100|yd|m}} of [[optical fiber]]. The Bell Labs' Richard Gundlach and the Smithsonian's Elliot Sivowitch used the device at the commemoration to demonstrate one of the photophone's modern-day descendants. The National Geographic Society also mounted a special educational exhibit in its Explorer's Hall, highlighting the photophone's invention with original items borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref&gt;Mims 1982, pp. 6 &amp; 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More footnotes|date=June 2008}}
'''Power Management''' is a feature of some electrical appliances, especially [[photocopying|copiers]], [[computer]]s, [[GPU]]s and computer [[peripheral]]s such as [[Computer display|monitors]] and [[Computer printer|printers]], that turns off the power or switches the system to a low-power state when inactive.  In computing this is known as [[PC power management]] and is built around a standard called [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]]. This supersedes
[[advanced power management|APM]]. All recent (consumer) computers have ACPI support.

In the military, ""Power Management"" often refers to suites of equipment which permit soldiers and squads to share diverse energy sources, powering often incompatible equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/Media-Center/Fact-Sheets/Power-Management-Kit.aspx
|title      = Office of Naval Research - Power Management Kit
|publisher  = ONR
|accessdate = 2015-01-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
[[PC power management]] for computer systems is desired for many reasons, particularly:
* Reduce overall energy consumption
* Prolong battery life for portable and embedded systems
* Reduce [[Computer cooling|cooling requirements]]
* [[Quiet PC|Reduce noise]]
* Reduce operating costs for energy and cooling

Lower power consumption also means lower heat dissipation, which increases system stability, and less energy use, which saves money and reduces the impact on the environment.

==Processor level techniques==
The power management for microprocessors can be done over the whole processor,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/6644474/A_Survey_of_Methods_For_Analyzing_and_Improving_GPU_Energy_Efficiency A Survey of Methods for Analyzing and Improving GPU Energy Efficiency]", Mittal et al., ACM Computing Surveys, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; or in specific components, such as cache memory&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/5010517/A_Survey_of_Architectural_Techniques_For_Improving_Cache_Power_Efficiency A Survey of Architectural Techniques For Improving Cache Power Efficiency]", S. Mittal, SUSCOM, 4(1), 33-43, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and main memory.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/2475806/A_survey_of_architectural_techniques_for_DRAM_power_management A survey of architectural techniques for DRAM power management]", S. Mittal, IJHPSA, 4(2), 110-119, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[dynamic voltage scaling]] and [[dynamic frequency scaling]], the [[CPU core voltage]], [[clock rate]], or both, can be altered to decrease power consumption at the price of potentially lower performance.  This is sometimes done in real time to optimize the power-performance tradeoff.

Examples:
* AMD [[Cool'n'Quiet]]
* AMD [[PowerNow!]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=https://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_8796_12353,00.html
|title      = AMD PowerNow! Technology with optimized power management
|publisher  = AMD
|accessdate = 2009-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* IBM [[EnergyScale]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.ibm.com/systems/power/hardware/whitepapers/energyscale.html
|title      = IBM EnergyScale for POWER6 Processor-Based Systems
|publisher  = IBM
|accessdate = 2009-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intel [[SpeedStep]]
* Transmeta [[LongRun]] and LongRun2
* VIA [[LongHaul]] (PowerSaver)

Additionally, processors can selectively power off internal circuitry ([[power gating]]). For example:
* Newer [[Intel Core]] processors support ultra-fine power control over the functional units within the processors.
* AMD [[CoolCore]] technology get more efficient performance by dynamically activating or turning off parts of the processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=https://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_9485_9487%5E10272,00.html
|title      = AMD Cool'n'Quiet Technology Overview
|publisher  = AMD
|accessdate = 2009-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel VRT]] technology split the chip into a 3.3V I/O section and a 2.9V core section.  The lower core voltage reduces power consumption.

===Heterogenous computing===
[[ARM Holdings|ARM]]'s [[big.LITTLE]] architecture can migrate processes between faster "big" cores and more power efficient "LITTLE" cores.

==Operating system level: Hibernation==
{{Main|Hibernation (computing)}}
When a [[computer system]] hibernates it saves the contents of the [[Random access memory|RAM]] to [[hard disk|disk]] and powers down the machine. On startup it reloads the data. This allows the system to be completely powered off while in hibernate mode. This requires a file the size of the installed RAM to be placed on the hard disk, potentially using up space even when not in hibernate mode. Hibernate mode is enabled by default in some versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and can be disabled in order to recover this disk space.

==In GPUs==
Graphics processing unit ([[GPU]]s) are used together with a [[CPU]] to accelerate [[computing]] in variety of domains revolving around [[scientific]], [[analytics]], [[engineering]], [[consumer]] and [[enterprise applications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html
|title      = What is GPU computing
|publisher  = Nvidia
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of this do come with some drawbacks, the high computing capability of GPUs comes at the cost of high [[power dissipation]]. A lot of research has been done over the power dissipation issue of GPUs and a lot of different techniques have been proposed to address this issue.
[[Dynamic voltage scaling]]/[[Dynamic frequency scaling]](DVFS) and [[clock gating]] are two commonly used techniques for reducing dynamic power in GPUs.

===DVFS techniques===
Experiments show that conventional processor DVFS policy can achieve power reduction of [[Embedded system|embedded]] GPUs with reasonable performance degradation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6329290&amp;tag=1 Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling framework for low-power embedded GPUs]", Daecheol You et al., Electronics Letters  (Volume:48, Issue: 21 ), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; New directions for designing effective DVFS schedulers for heterogeneous systems are also being explored.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2571035 Effects of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling on a K20 GPU]", Rong Ge et al., 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing Pages 826-833, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A heterogeneous CPU-GPU architecture, GreenGPU&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2410566 GreenGPU: A Holistic Approach to Energy Efficiency in GPU-CPU Heterogeneous Architectures]", Kai Ma et al., 41st International Conference on Parallel Processing Pages 48-57, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is presented  which employs DVFS in a synchronized way, both for GPU and CPU. GreenGPU is implemented using the CUDA framework on a real physical testbed with Nvidia GeForce GPUs and AMD Phenom II CPUs. Experimentally it is shown that the GreenGPU achieves 21.04% average energy saving and outperforms several well-designed baselines.
For the mainstream GPUs which are extensively used in all kinds of commercial and personal applications several DVFS techniques exist and are built into the GPUs alone, [[AMD PowerTune]] and [[AMD ZeroCore Power]] are the two [[dynamic frequency scaling]] technologies for [[AMD]] graphic cards. Practical tests showed that reclocking a [[Geforce]] [[GTX 480]] can achieve a 28% lower power consumption while only decreasing performance by 1% for a given task.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2387879 Power and performance analysis of GPU-accelerated systems]", Yuki Abe et al., USENIX conference on Power-Aware Computing and Systems Pages 10-10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power gating techniques===
A lot of research has been done on the dynamic power reduction with the use of DVFS techniques. However, as technology continues to shrink, leakage power will become a dominant factor.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=782564 Design challenges of technology scaling]", Borkar, S., Micro, IEEE  (Volume:19 ,  Issue: 4 ), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Power gating]] is a commonly used circuit technique to remove leakage by turning off the supply voltage of unused circuits. Power gating incurs energy overhead; therefore, unused circuits need to remain idle long enough to compensate this overheads.
A novel micro-architectural technique&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6176483 Run-time power-gating in caches of GPUs for leakage energy savings]", Yue Wang et al., Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe Conference &amp; Exhibition (DATE), 2012&lt;/ref&gt; for run-time power-gating caches of GPUs saves leakage energy. Based on experiments on 16 different GPU workloads, the average energy savings achieved by the proposed technique is 54%.
Shaders are the most power hungry component of a GPU, a predictive shader shut down power gating technique&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4758617 A Predictive Shutdown Technique for GPU Shader Processors]", Po-Han Wang et al., Computer Architecture Letters  (Volume:8 ,  Issue: 1 ), 2009&lt;/ref&gt; achieves up to 46% leakage reduction on shader processors.
The Predictive Shader Shutdown technique exploits workload variation across frames to eliminate leakage in shader clusters. Another technique called Deferred Geometry Pipeline seeks to minimize leakage in [[fixed function units|fixed-function geometry units]] by utilizing an imbalance between geometry and fragment computation across batches which removes up to 57% of the leakage in the fixed-function geometry units. A simple time-out power gating method can be applied to non-shader execution units which eliminates 83.3% of the leakage in non-shader execution units on average.
All the three techniques stated above incur negligible performance degradation, less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2019612 Power gating strategies on GPUs]", Po-Han Wang et al., ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO) Volume 8 Issue 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liveaudioequip.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A portable setup of various live audio production and recording equipment]]

'''Professional audio''', abbreviated as '''pro audio''', refers to both an activity and a category of high quality, studio-grade audio equipment. Typically it encompasses [[sound recording]], [[sound reinforcement system]] setup and [[audio mixing]], and [[music producer|studio music production]] by trained [[sound engineer]]s, [[audio engineer]]s, [[record producer]]s, and audio technicians who work in [[live event support]] and recording using [[audio mixer]]s, recording equipment and sound reinforcement systems. In contrast, [[consumer electronics|consumer audio]] equipment is a lower grade of gear which is used by regular people for the reproduction of sound in a private home on a [[home stereo]] or [[home cinema]] system.

Professional audio can include, but is not limited to [[broadcast radio]], [[audio mastering]] in a [[recording studio]], [[television studio]], and [[sound reinforcement]] such as a live concert, [[DJ]] performances, [[Sampling (music)|audio sampling]], [[public address]] system set up, [[surround sound]] design in [[movie theatre]]s, and design and setup of [[piped music]] in hotels and restaurants. Professional audio equipment is sold at [[professional audio store]]s and [[music store]]s. While [[consumer electronics]] stores sell some of the same categories of equipment (e.g., [[power amplifier]]s and [[subwoofer]] cabinets), the equipment that consumer stores sells is a lower consumer-grade type of equipment, which does not meet the standards for low noise and low [[distortion (music)|distortion]] that are required in pro audio applications.

==Definition==
The term ''professional audio'' has no precise definition, but it typically includes:
* Operations carried out by trained [[audio engineers]]
* The capturing of sound with one or more [[microphone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Alten | first=S.R. | title=Audio in Media | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-285-67529-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balancing, mixing and adjusting sound signals from [[multitrack recording]] devices using a [[mixing console]]
* The control of audio levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhardt | first=R. | last2=Dowd | first2=S. | title=Adobe Flash CS3 Professional Bible | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | series=Bible | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-470-11937-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQs0sJ0NLDsC&amp;pg=PA1165 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; using standardised types of metering
* Sound signals passing through lengthy [[airchain|signal chain]]s involving processes at different times and places, involving a variety of skills
* Compliance with organisational, national and international practices and standards established by such bodies as the [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[Audio Engineering Society]] and [[European Broadcasting Union]]
* Setting up or designing sound reinforcement systems or recording studios.
==Equipment==
Compared to consumer-grade audio equipment, professional audio equipment tends to have such characteristics as:
* Greater mechanical robustness and reliability
* Many more options for "tweakability" and modification than typical consumer grade equipment. For example, whereas a typical home audio grade active subwoofer may have a factory set-[[audio crossover]] to determine at which point the audio signal will be routed to the subwoofer and a factory preset phase control and equalizer setting, pro audio active subwoofers (with built-in amplifiers and electronics) may offer adjustable crossover points, user-selectable phase control and equalizer controls{{efn|Some expensive, high-end [[hi-fi]] active subwoofers also offer "tweakability" and user controls, but the low-priced active subs sold at [[Big box]] [[consumer electronics]] stores do not usually include these features.}}
* Heavy-duty industrial-grade connectors, e.g. [[XLR connector|XLR]] balanced audio cables (for audio signals) rather than unbalanced cables and [[Speakon]] speaker connectors, rather than 1/4" speaker jacks
* Designed for touring and transportation. This includes the use of [[19-inch rack]]-mount devices for electronic [[effects unit]]s and [[power amplifier]]s, the provision of handles and/or dolly wheels on heavy equipment to facilitate moving gear onstage (large [[speaker enclosure]] cabinets for [[subwoofer]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]] main speakers typically have handles and wheels)
* [[Balanced audio]] interfaces (XLR) for lower noise and hum
* Higher [[analog audio]] signal levels of 0 [[decibel|dBu]] or more&lt;ref name="“books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=professional+audio+equipment+characteristics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1iWT0zIa5p&amp;sig=FLVzefRE9IQZi2or8bZnWP42rwg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OnE6VfGIGYmoNon_gcAG&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=professional%20audio%20equipment%20characteristics&amp;f=false/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AES3|AES/EBU]] [[digital audio]] interfaces
* Lower-noise audio equipment with less [[Total Harmonic Distortion]]

The [[broadcast quality]] of professional audio equipment is on a par with that of consumer [[high-end audio]] and [[hi-fi]] equipment, but is more likely to be designed purely on sound engineering principles and owes little to the consumer-oriented [[audiophile]] sub-culture.&lt;ref name=perlman1&gt;{{Cite journal

'''ProntoHotel''' is a free hotel [[travel metasearch engine]] founded in 2007 with headquarters in Rome, Italy.

The site compares prices for over 550,000 hotels by searching multiple travel [[Travel website#Online travel agencies|booking sites]], including [[Booking.com]] and [[Expedia]]. The site is available in 220 countries and in 20 languages.

==History==
ProntoHotel was founded in May 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/prontohotel-com ProntoHotel], ''[[CrunchBase]]'',  Retrieved on 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; by two Italian experts in online travel and marketing: Paolo Mazzara and Simone Giacco.&lt;ref name="about-prontohotel"&gt;[http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/prontohotel-com About ProntoHotel].&lt;/ref&gt;

Their goal was to meet the increasing needs of travelers to find a simple travel comparison site to help cut down on time spent online researching hotels and rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewcentre.com/Travel-Comparison-Sites_1402135 Travel Comparison Sites], ''[[Review Centre]]''Retrieved on 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beta version of ProntoHotel launched in 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/prontohotel.com Statistics Summary for ProntoHotel.com],’[[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]’. Retrieved on 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with a small number of partnerships with online travel agencies and hotel chains in just the big-name European destinations, such as Rome, Paris, [[London]], Berlin, and [[Amsterdam]].

In 2009, the company implemented new software features, including the ability to filter results by a hotel’s location within a particular area of the city, desired price range per night, and proximity to a specific address.

By 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotelmanager.net/seven-new-companies-with-impressive-ideas-on-travelling.html Seven New Companies with Impressive Ideas on Travelling], 6 December 2011.  Retrieved on 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the database of hotels grew to over 200,000 and the portal was opened up to additional markets, including Spain (prontohotel.es), France (prontohotel.fr), and Germany (prontohotel.de).

In 2013, ProntoHotel added a number of partner websites and doubled the amount of hotels in its database.  The company also created the ProntoHotel Price Index (PHPI), which analyzes the hotel market and issues reports based on time period and region.

In 2014, ProntoHotel was &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelnostop.com/NEWS_dettaglio.php?regione=&amp;t=prontohotel-in-lizza-per-i-world-travel-awards-unica-italiana-con-alitalia&amp;i=116766 ProntoHotel in lizza per i World Travel Awards, unica italiana con Alitalia], Travel NoStop, 16 July 2014. Retrieved on 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; nominated for the World Travel Awards &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtravelawards.com/ World Travel Awards], Retrieved on 14 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Travel Technology category for “World’s Leading Hotel Comparison Website”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtravelawards.com/award-travel-technologys-leading-hotel-comparison-website-2014 Travel Technologys Leading Hotel Comparison Website 2014], Retrieved on 15 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Kayak.com]], Hipmunk, [[HotelsCombined]], Momondo, and Trivago.  That same year, the site’s database included 550,000 hotels, 20 languages, and 35 currencies.

==Technology==
ProntoHotel operates on its own proprietary hotel metasearch engine software.  The system searches the results from a database of 50 partner travel websites (hotel chain websites, independent hotel websites, and [[Travel website|Online Travel Agency]] (OTA)), and aggregates the rates into a condensed list of accommodation options (including hotels, [[bed and breakfasts]], hostels, and resorts) that meet the search criteria. 

The hotel price comparison engine lists amenities of each property, including consumer ratings, industry awards, bathroom type, meeting facilities, and dining options, so that users may have the necessary facts to compare accommodations.  Further information about each property is provided, including [[hotel rating]], amenities, photos, location, and original hotel reviews&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotelmanager.net/reviews-help-the-ranks.html Reviews Help the Ranks], 12 August 2012.  Retrieved on 17 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; written by previous ProntoHotel users.

Search results may be viewed in two formats: map view or list view.  Filters help rank hotels according to price, star rating, and popularity, as well as geographical parameters such as proximity to a certain attraction, position within a neighborhood, and distance from the city center.  

The hotel comparison site offers two features to further personalize search results: one is to remove undesirable hotels from the list of options and the other is to add hotels of interest to a “favorite list.” 

Once a hotel and rate are chosen, the travel technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtravelawards.com/nominees/2014/travel-technology World Travel Awards Travel Technology Nominees 2014 “Leading Hotel Comparison Website”].  Retrieved on 17 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; redirects to the third-party vendor selling that deal.  The transaction is performed directly with that supplier and all further business is conducted through that vendor.

[[File:Racking wine between barrels.JPG|thumb|right|225px|Racking red wine]]
'''Racking''',  often referred to as '''Soutirage''' or  '''Soutirage traditionnel''' (meaning racking in French&lt;ref name="Decanter"&gt;{{cite book|title=Decanter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_RIAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=22 March 2013|year=1999|publisher=Decanter Magazine Limited|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also '''filtering''' or '''fining''', is a method in wine production of moving wine from one barrel to another using gravity rather than a pump, which can be disruptive to a wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napavintners.com/wineries/winery_profile.asp?weblogin=twomey|title=Twomey Cellars|publisher=Napavintners.com|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is also known as ''Abstich'' in German and ''travaso'' in Italian.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutcliffe|first=Serena|title=The art of the winemaker: a guide to the world's greatest vineyards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3fohZX3siYC|accessdate=22 March 2013|year=1988|publisher=New Burlington|isbn=978-0-906286-68-5|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alexis Lichine's Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits'' defines racking as "siphoning [[wine]] or [[beer]] off the [[Lees (fermentation)|lees]] (in the case of wine) or [[Trub (brewing)|trub]] (in the case of beer), into a new, clean barrel or other vessel."&lt;ref name=ALE&gt;{{cite book|last =Lichine |first =Alexis |title =Alexis Lichine's Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits |publisher = Cassell &amp; Company Ltd |year =1967 |location =London|page =428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Racking allows [[clarification (wine)|clarification]] and aids in [[stabilization (wine)|stabilization]]. Wine that is allowed to age on the lees often develops "off-tastes." A racking hose or tube is used and can be attached to a racking cane to make the task easier. The racking process is repeated several times during the [[aging of wine]].&lt;ref name=ALE/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Soutirage.jpg|thumb|right|Soutirage]]
[[File:Soutirage2.jpg|thumb|right|Soutirage of [[Twomey Cellars]]'s Merlot]]
Racking or soutirage is a traditional method in wine production of moving wine from one barrel to another using gravity rather than a pump. The process is repeated when the casks are moved to the second-year cellar.&lt;ref name="DuijkerPublishing1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duijker|first=H.|title=Great Wine Chateaux of Bordeau|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b6910uWVVPwC|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=12 December 1988|publisher=Random House Value Publishing|isbn=978-0-517-42605-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soutirage was developed in the [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] region of France in the 19th century at a time when there was no [[electricity]] to power pumps. Many estates such in Bordeaux and some estates in [[Pomerol AOC|Pomerol]] and [[Saint-Émilion AOC|St. Emilion]] still employ this labor-intensive method. During aging, the wine is decanted several times from barrel to barrel. This process softens [[tannins (wine)|tannins]], clarifies the wine and enhances aromatic qualities. According to [[Oz Clarke]], "traditionally the wine is 'racked' or drawn from barrel or tank to another empty one on a number of occasions (called soutirage). This helps clarify and freshen the wine by removing the fine lees or sediment which forms and provides a tiny amount of oxygen to help the aging process. The wine may also be 'fined' (''collage'') using [[egg white]] or other materials to settle out particles in suspension which are then removed through further racking."&lt;ref name="Clarke2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Oz|title=Oz Clarke's Bordeaux: The Wines, the Vineyards, the Winemakers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wee-TRQyzSEC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=7 May 2007|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-101300-5|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egg white]] is often applied to each barrel during the process.&lt;ref name="Ray1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ray|first=Cyril|title=Lafite; the story of Château Lafite-Rothschild|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vA8vAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 March 2013|year=1969|publisher=Stein and Day|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
A racking hose is a flexible, plastic hose, used to siphon wine or beer from one vessel to another. It is used in both racking and bottling operations.  A racking cane is a rigid tube, often bent or "L"-shaped, that is attached to the racking hose to make racking easier.&lt;ref name=ALE/&gt; A protective cap is placed over the lower end of the cane that allows liquid to be drawn into the cane from above rather than below while keeping most large solids out. The cap allows the tip of the cane to be lowered close to the lees without unduly disturbing them. The lower tip of the racking cane should initially be held about midway between the surface and the lees and gradually lowered as the volume decreases due to the siphoning.&lt;ref name=ALE/&gt;

'''Rational Machines''' was founded by Paul Levy and [[Mike Devlin (entrepreneur)|Mike Devlin]] in 1981 to provide tools to expand the use of modern software engineering practices, particularly [[Modular programming|explicit modular architecture]] and [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative development]]. It changed its name in 1994 to '''Rational Software''', and was sold for US$2.1 billion (equivalent to current US${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|2100000000|2003}}}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) to [[IBM]] on February 20, 2003.

==Rational Environment==
First released in 1985, the [[R1000|Rational Environment]] was an [[integrated development environment]] for the [[Ada programming language]], which provided good support for [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] through [[strong typing]]. Its goal was to provide the productivity benefits associated with academic single-user programming environments to teams of developers developing mission-critical applications that could execute on a range of computing platforms.

The Rational Environment was organized around a persistent intermediate representation ([[DIANA (intermediate language)|DIANA]]), providing users with syntactic and semantic completion, incremental compilation, and integrated configuration management and version control. To overcome a conflict between strong typing and iterative development that produced recompilation times proportional to system size rather than size-of-change, the Rational Environment supported the definition of subsystems with explicit architectural imports and exports; this mechanism later proved useful in protecting application architectures from inadvertent degradation. The Environment's Command Window mechanism made it easy to directly invoke Ada functions and procedures, which encouraged developer-driven unit testing.

The Rational Environment ran on custom hardware, the Rational [[R1000]], which implemented a high-level architecture optimized for execution of Ada programs in general and the Rational Environment in particular. The horizontally-microprogrammed R1000 provided two independent 64-bit data paths, permitting simultaneous computation and type checking. Memory was organized as a single-level store; a 64-bit [[virtual address]] presented to the memory system either immediately returned data, or triggered a page fault handled by the processor's microcode.

The company's name was later changed from "Rational Machines" to Rational Software Corporation (RATL) to avoid emphasizing this proprietary hardware when Rational merged with [[Verdix]] Corporation, a public company that developed Ada compilers, on 30 March 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.rational.com/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=RATL&amp;script=1500|title=Merger with Verdix |publisher=RATL|date=2002-06-01|accessdate=2014-01-05|via =web.archive.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rational provided code generators and the cross-debuggers for then-popular instruction set architectures such as the [[VAX]], [[Motorola 68000]], and [[x86 architecture|x86]]; much of this was accomplished through a partnership with Tartan Labs, founded by [[William Wulf|Bill Wulf]] to commercialize his work on optimizing code generators semi-automatically produced from architecture descriptions ([[PQCC]]).

==Organization==
Rational's field Practices underlying the later [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP) - iterative development, component-based architecture, modelling, continuous developer-driven testing, requirements management, and automated testing—are all traceable to this experience base.

==Second-generation products==
In 1990, Rational launched three parallel development efforts: re-implementation of the Rational Environment (for Ada) to run on [[Unix]]-based workstations from [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and [[IBM]], development of a comparable Rational Environment for [[C++]] to run on Unix-based workstations from Sun and IBM, and development of a workstation-hosted modeling tool called Rose that supported a graphical notation developed by [[Grady Booch]]. Apex, the Rational Environment for Ada, was launched on Sun and IBM Unix platforms in 1993, and the Rational Environment for C++ followed on the same platforms a year later. A version of Apex that ran on [[Microsoft Windows NT]] was successfully developed and released by Rational's Bangalore team.

Rose 1.0 was introduced at [[OOPSLA]] in 1992, but performed poorly in multiple dimensions and was withdrawn from the market.

The development of Rose 2.0 combined a Windows-based [[Booch method|Booch notation]] editor called Object System Designer (acquired from [[Wisconsin]]-based Palladio) with a new intermediate representation, and with new semantic analysis, code generation, and reverse engineering capabilities. The latter, which allowed prospective customers to analyze existing C++ code to produce "as-built" navigable class diagrams, helped overcome Rational's late re-entry into the market for object-oriented modeling tools. Rose 2.0 ran on Windows PCs and on several Unix-based workstations.

==UML and RUP==
In 1994, Rational merged with [[Verdix]], a public company that produced a wide array of Ada compilers targeted to many architecture/OS combinations. The resulting entity was named "Rational Software", and promptly integrated the Rational Ada and C++ environments with the code generators and runtimes developed by Verdix.

In 1995, [[James Rumbaugh]] joined the company, and Rational acquired [[Ivar Jacobson]]'s firm [[Objectory AB]] from [[Ericsson]]. With [[Grady Booch]] already aboard, this brought within one company three of the leading object-oriented software methodologists. These three experts attempted to unify their work. To eliminate the method fragmentation that they concluded was impeding commercial adoption of modeling tools, they developed [[Unified Modeling Language]] ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]), which provided a level playing field for all tool vendors. It was this collaboration effort that earned Rumbaugh, Jacobson and Booch the moniker "The Three Amigos" within the software engineering industry. At its 1.0 release, the Unified Modeling Language was contributed to the [[Object Management Group]], which has managed its subsequent development.

[[Philippe Kruchten]], a Rational techrep, was tasked with the assembly of an explicit process framework for modern software engineering. This effort combined the [[HTML]]-based process delivery mechanism employed by [[Objectory]] with Rational's 15-year experience base in working with customers developing significant software systems. The resulting "[[Rational Unified Process]]" (RUP) completed a strategic tripod:
* a ''tailorable process'' that guided development
* ''tools'' that automated the application of that process
* ''services'' that accelerated adoption of both the process and the tools.

==Acquisitions==
The momentum generated by Rose and the UML enabled Rational to establish a partnership with Windows platform developers. Rational's aim was to secure Microsoft's public support for visual modeling.

Rational peaked at US$850M in revenues (current equivalent US${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|850000000|2003}}}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) and 4000 employees. After the [[dot-com crash]], its revenues declined to $650M, but it was dominant, profitable, and cash-rich (~$600M) when its founders chose to sell the company to [[IBM]] for $2.1B  (current equivalent US${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|2100000000|2003}}}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}). The acquisition was announced on 6 December 2002 and was completed before the market opened 21 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/314.wss|title=IBM Completes Acquisition of Rational Software|publisher=IBM|date=2003-02-21|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shai Reshef''' born September 11, 1955 is an [[Israelis|Israeli]]&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt; educational [[entrepreneur]], founder and president of [[University of the People]], the world's first non-profit, tuition-free, accredited online university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = University of the People – The world’s first tuition-free online university|url = http://uopeople.edu/|website = uopeople.edu|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[TED Talk]], entitled "An ultra-low-cost college degree", has been viewed more than 5 million times.&lt;ref name="An ultra-low-cost college degree"&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/shai_reshef_a_tuition_free_college_degree An ultra-low-cost college degree] March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Reshef earned an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in [[Chinese Politics]] from the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/02/internet-connection-english-college-degree.ars |title= Internet connection + English = college degree |last= Anderson |first= Nate |work= [[Ars Technica]] |date= February 1, 2009 |accessdate= 2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989 to 2005, Reshef served as Chief Executive Officer and then Chairman of the Kidum Group, a for-profit educational services and test preparation company.&lt;ref name="New York Times" /&gt; Reshef joined Kidum in 1989 when it was a single product company with revenues of $100,000. Under his leadership, Kidum grew to become a company with annual revenues in excess of $25 million, with over 1,000 employees and 50,000 students a year. In 2005, he sold the company to Kaplan, Inc., one of the world’s largest education companies and a subsidiary of the [[Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.kaplan.com/AboutKaplan/PressReleases/Archive/2005/8-3-Kidum.htm |title= Kaplan to Acquire Kidum, the leading provider of test preparation in Israel |publisher= Kaplan, Inc. |date= August 3, 2005 |accessdate= 2009-06-04 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090131231113/http://www.kaplan.com/aboutkaplan/pressreleases/archive/2005/8-3-Kidum.htm |archivedate= January 31, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2004, while continuing as the chairman of Kidum, Reshef lived in the Netherlands where he chaired KIT eLearning, a subsidiary of Kidum. KIT became the eLearning partner of the [[University of Liverpool]] in 1999, and was the first online university outside of the United States, providing MBA and M.Sc. degrees in [[Information Technology]]. In 2004, the company was acquired by Laureate Education, Inc. and changed its name to [[Laureate Education|Laureate Online Education]]. It maintains its partnership with the University of Liverpool under its new name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uol.ohecampus.com/laureate/upload/file/PDF/press_releases_7_name_change.pdf Laureate Online Education and K.I.T. eLearning B.V., the eLearning partner of the University of Liverpool, announce name change]. (press release) November 2004. Retrieved on 2009-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Reshef founded [[University of the People]] (UoPeople), a non-profit, accredited online academic institution that seeks to increase the availability of higher education by offering tuition-free degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/education/26university.html?_r=1 Israeli Entrepreneur Plans a Free Global University That Will Be Online Only].

'''Silicon Fen''' (sometimes known as the '''Cambridge Cluster''') is the name given to the region around [[Cambridge]], [[England]], which is home to a large [[business cluster|cluster]] of [[high-tech]] [[businesses]] focusing on [[software]], [[electronics]] and [[biotechnology]].  Many of these businesses have connections with the [[University of Cambridge]], and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in [[Europe]].

It is called "Silicon Fen" by analogy with [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]], because it lies at the southern tip of the [[The Fens|English Fenland]]. The interest in technology in the area started with [[Acorn Computers]].&lt;ref name="zdnet cambridge"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/it-strategy/1998/12/01/us-report-old-cambridge-targets-high-tech-success-2070082/ | title=US Report: Old Cambridge targets high-tech success | work=[[ZDNet]] | date=1 December 1998 | accessdate=15 December 2011 | author=Jones, Kevin | quote=The focus on technology in the so-called Silicon Fen started two decades ago with Acorn Computer PLC, which became the U.K.'s leading personal computer maker until the advent of Windows. The Fen also spawned a couple of successes, such as Advanced RISC Machines Ltd., a virtual chip designer; Cambridge Display Technologies Ltd., a monitor maker [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business growth==
More than 1000 high-technology companies established offices in the area during the five years preceding 1998.&lt;ref name="nytimes Ibrahim 1998"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/010498cambridge.html | title=In Old England a Silicon Fen: Cambridge as a High-Tech Outpost | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=4 January 1998 | accessdate=13 June 2012 | author=Ibrahim, Youseff M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early successful businesses were [[Advanced RISC Machines]] and [[Cambridge Display Technology]].&lt;ref name="zdnet cambridge" /&gt; In 2004, 24% of all UK [[venture capital]] (8% of all the EU's) was received by Silicon Fen companies, according to the Cambridge Cluster Report 2004 produced by [[Library House]] and [[Grant Thornton]].

The so-called ''Cambridge phenomenon'', giving rise to start-up companies in a town previously only having a little light industry in the [[electrical engineering|electrical sector]], is usually dated to the founding of the [[Cambridge Science Park]] in 1970: this was an initiative of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College, Cambridge University]] and moved away from a traditional low-development policy for Cambridge.

The characteristic of Cambridge is small companies (as few as three people, in some cases) in sectors such as [[computer-aided design]]. Over time the number of companies has grown; it has not proved easy to count them, but recent estimates have placed the number anywhere between 1,000 and 3,500 companies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} They are spread over an area defined perhaps by the CB [[postcode]] or 01223 [[telephone]] [[area code]], or more generously in an area bounded by [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], [[Saffron Walden]], [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] and [[Huntingdon]].

In 2000, then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] set up a research partnership between [[MIT]] and Cambridge University, the [[Cambridge–MIT Institute]], in order to increase international collaboration between the two universities and to strengthen the economic success of Silicon Fen.

In February 2006, the [[Judge Business School|Judge Business School, Cambridge University]] reported estimates that suggested that at that time, there were around 250 active start-ups directly linked to the University, valued at around US$6 billion.  Only a tiny proportion of these companies have so far grown into [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s: [[ARM Ltd|ARM]], [[Autonomy Corporation]] and [[AVEVA]] are the most obvious examples, and more recently [[Cambridge Silicon Radio|CSR]] has seen rapid growth due to the uptake of [[Bluetooth]].

It was found in 2012 that strong employment growth was hampered due to the concentration on [[research and development]]. This was because of limited competition in manufacturing capability and its consequent cost.&lt;ref name="hbs andersen 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andersen|first=Christian|author2=Bailey, Jonathan|author3=Heal, Adam|author4=Munn, Oliver|author5=O'Connell, Bryan|title=IT Hardware cluster: Cambridge, United Kingdom|url=http://www.isc.hbs.edu/pdf/Student_Projects/2012%20MOC%20Papers/20120504%20MOC%20UK%20Cambridge%20IT%20hardware%20cluster%20-%20Final%20project%20paper.pdf|work=Final Paper; Microeconomics of Competitiveness, Harvard Business School|publisher=[[Harvard Business School]]|accessdate=18 June 2012|date=4 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619111115/http://www.isc.hbs.edu/pdf/Student_Projects/2012%20MOC%20Papers/20120504%20MOC%20UK%20Cambridge%20IT%20hardware%20cluster%20-%20Final%20project%20paper.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work by [http://www.cambridgeahead.co.uk Cambridge Ahead], the business and academic membership organisation dedicated to the successful growth of the city region in the long-term, has shown that in 2015-16, growth of Cambridge companies continued at around 7% on a one, three and five-year view. Global turnover of Cambridge companies increased by 7.6% to £35.7bn, up from £33bn the previous year, and global employment grew by 7.6% to 210,292. The number of companies with their home base within 20 miles of Cambridge has grown from 22,017 to 24,580.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeahead.co.uk/2017/01/latest-data-cambridge-ahead-reveals-unabated-growth-cambridge-companies/|title=Latest data from Cambridge Ahead reveals unabated growth of Cambridge companies|last=|first=|date=2017-01-24|website=www.cambridgeahead.co.uk|publisher=Cambridge Ahead|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is striking about the data is that 2015-16 was just another typical 7% growth year for Cambridge. Over the past five years (2010-11 to 2015-16) the turnover of Cambridge companies has grown by 7.5% per annum, and employment by 6.6% per annum.

The growth of Silicon Fen is best revealed by the [http://www.camclustermap.com Cambridge Cluster Map], a new data tool that accurately maps the growth of the Cambridge sub-region over time and reveals the true extent of the success of the ‘Cambridge Phenomenon’. The map was created and launched in July 2016 by Cambridge Ahead in partnership with Barclays, working with the Centre for Business Research (CBR) at the University of Cambridge, and is an updated version of the previous Cluster Map covering the Tech sector launched in 2012.

The new dataset identifies and locates companies and certain research facilities that are active within a 20-mile radius of the centre of the city and shows three types of organisations: Cambridge-based companies, Cambridge-active companies, and Non-corporate Knowledge-intensive (KI) organisations.

==Area characteristics==
The region has one of the most flexible job markets in the technology sector, and people are often employed by other companies after a start-up fails. Although everyone wants their company to succeed, failures are tolerated, indeed almost expected.

One reason for the area's success is that after some time such an employment market is self-sustaining, since employees are willing to move to an area that promises a future beyond any one company. Another factor is the high degree of 'networking', enabling people across the region to find partners, jobs, funding, and know-how. Organisations have sprung up to facilitate this process, for example the [[Cambridge Network]].

Another factor is the academic pre-eminence of [[Cambridge University]], which is one of the top 5 universities in the world, a high [[standard of living]] available in the county, and good transport links, for example to London and with [[Cambridge Airport]]  having a full service business jet centre.  Many graduates from the university choose to stay on in the area, giving local companies a rich pool of talent to draw upon {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. The high-technology industry has little by way of competition, unlike say in [[Oxfordshire]] where many other competing industries exist. Because Cambridgeshire was not until recently a high-technology centre, commercial rents were generally lower than in other parts of the UK, giving companies a head-start on those situated in other more expensive regions; this has, however, recently changed and Cambridgeshire now has one of the highest costs of living in the UK outside London.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

[[File:1subsoil1.jpg|thumb|left|Howse brand modular subsoiler mounted to a tractor]][[File:1subsoil-combo1.jpg|thumb|right|Modular subsoiler unit, unmounted with accessories]]A '''subsoiler''' or '''flat lifter''' is a [[tractor]]-mounted [[list of agricultural machinery|farm implement]] used for deep [[tillage]], loosening and breaking up [[soil]] at depths below the levels worked by moldboard [[plough]]s, [[disc harrow]]s, or [[rototiller]]s.  Most such tools will break up and turn over surface soil to a depth of {{convert|15|-|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}, whereas a subsoiler will break up and loosen soil to twice those depths.  Typically a subsoiler mounted on a compact utility tractor will reach depths of about {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} and typically have only one thin blade with a sharpened tip.

The subsoiler is a tillage tool which will improve growth in all crops where soil compaction is a problem. In agriculture angled wings are used to lift and shatter the hard pan that builds up due to compaction. The design provides deep tillage, loosening soil depth is deeper than a tiller or plough is capable of reaching. Agricultural subsoilers, according to the Unverferth Company, can disrupt hardpan ground down to {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} depths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unverferth.com/brenttlg4.htm Brent Tremor Agricultural Subsoilers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110102441/http://www.unverferth.com/brenttlg4.htm |date=2006-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plucks.co.nz/cultivators/legDiagram.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various manufacturers' brochures claim{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} that crops perform well during hot and dry seasons because roots penetrate soil layers deeper to reach moisture and nutrients. Brochures further claim that in wet conditions, the water passes more easily through the shattered areas, reducing the possibility of crops drowning.

Agricultural subsoiler implements will have multiple deeper reaching blades; each blade is called a scarifier or shank.  Purdue University's Deptartment of Agriculture indicates that common subsoilers for agricultural use are available with three, five or seven shanks.  Subsoilers can be up to {{convert|15|feet}} wide, some models are towed behind tractors while others are mounted to the [[three-point hitch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/S/S-56.html Purdue Ag Equipment Sizes &amp; Storage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419005719/http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/S/S-56.html |date=2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of subsoiler has a torpedo-shaped tip and is called a '''mole plough''' because the tip describes a path much like the [[burrow]] that a [[mole (animal)|mole]] creates. Mole ploughs are used to create [[tile drainage]], with or without tiles or tile line added. A form of this implement (with a single blade), a [[pipe-and-cable-laying plough]], is used to lay buried cables or pipes, without the need to dig a deep trench and re-fill it.

'''SunRiver Data Systems''' was a division of SunRiver Corporation, a private company founded in 1986&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi Business Journal, September 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Business Week, July 13, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] by four electrical engineers (Ronnie Hughes, Bill Long, Kester Rice, and Gerald Youngblood), all former employees of [[Diversified Technology, Inc.]] Initially funded by a local businessman, the company moved to [[Austin, Texas]] in 1989 after acquiring [[venture capital financing]] from [[Sevin Rosen Funds]] and [[Austin Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;Austin American Statesman, March 10, 1989, Page C1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Austin Business Journal, December 29, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

SunRiver developed the first Fiber Optic Station, a color graphics terminal which relied on a proprietary, patented, "bus extension" technology in which the parallel data bus of the multi-user computer is serialized and then reconstituted in the terminal device. Custom [[Large Scale Integration|LSI]] chips handled both ends of the connection, which later was converted from [[fiber optic cable]] using ST connectors, to [[Category 5 cable]]. The Cygna 386 Fiber Optic Station was supported with native drivers by the early [[DR-DOS]] operating system produced by [[Digital Research]], as well as SCO ([[Santa Cruz Operation]]) [[XENIX]] and AT&amp;T [[UNIX]]. The Cygna technology did not enjoy extensive commercial success, however, likely due to inherent speed limitations and the popularity of a competing approach offered by [[Citrix]] which was later adopted by [[Microsoft]].

SunRiver Data Systems later became '''Boundless Technologies''' after simultaneously becoming a public corporation and acquiring the [[Applied Digital Data Systems]] division of [[AT&amp;T]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, March 27, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, all of the original founders had left the company. Sometime after departing Boundless, Youngblood founded [[FlexRadio]], and Long founded [[Viridian Gold]]; Rice and Hughes have continued to work in the semiconductor industry. In 2003, Boundless Corporation filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection, was acquired by the majority public stockholders and moved from [[Hauppauge, NY]] to [[Farmingdale, NY]], where it produced [[terminal emulation]] software, [[thin client]] terminals and replacements for old-style text [[computer terminals]].  After a series of 2006 transactions the bankrupt but public Boundless Corporation was merged into the seeking-to-be public Haitian Consulting, a manufacturer of fine chemicals.  Ironically, Boundless had become a public company by a similar transaction in 1994 when it used the public company, All Quotes Inc., as a merger vehicle to the public market.

'''Technology education''' is the study of [[technology]], in which students "learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association|ITEA]]. (2000). Standards for technological literacy; Content for the study of technology. Executive Summary. Reston, Va, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; As a field of study, it covers the human ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and [[tools]] with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education Today: International Perspectives|last=de Vries|first=Marc|last2=Fletcher|first2=Stefan|last3=Labudde|first3=Peter|last4=Lang|first4=Martin|last5=Mammes|first5=Ingelore|last6=Max|first6=Charles|last7=Munk|first7=Dieter|last8=Nicholl|first8=Bill|last9=Strobel|first9=Johannes|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|year=2016|isbn=9783830933847|location=Munster|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall [[Scientific literacy|scientific]] and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education in School and Industry: Emerging Didactics for Human Resource Development|last=Blandow|first=Dietrich|last2=Dyrenfurth|first2=Michael|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=3540582509|location=Berlin|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology education should not be confused with [[educational technology]]. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugger Jr.|first=William E.|last2=Naik|first2=Nitin|date=September 2001|title=Clarifying Misconceptions between Technology Education and Educational Technology|url=https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=49264|journal=Technology Teacher|volume=61|issue=1|pages=31–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Technology education is an offshoot of the [[Industrial arts|Industrial Arts]] tradition in the [[United States]] and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980, through what was called the "Futuring Project", the name of "[[industrial arts education]]" was changed to be "technology education" in [[New York (state)|New York State]]; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/|title=History {{!}} Department of Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oswego.edu|at=sec. Technology Education|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In Sweden, technology as a new subject emerged from the tradition of crafts subjects while in countries like Taiwan and Australia, its elements are discernible in historical vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology Education for Teachers|last=Williams|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Anthony|publisher=Macmillan Education Australia Pty Ltd|year=1996|isbn=0732940907|location=South Melbourne|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18812">{{About|analysis of traffic in a radio or computer network|vehicular traffic|Traffic flow}}
'''Traffic analysis''' is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in [[communication]], which can be performed even when the messages are [[encrypt]]ed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Soltani|first=Ramin|last2=Goeckel|first2=Dennis|last3=Towsley|first3=Don|last4=Houmansadr|first4=Amir|date=2017-11-27|title=Towards Provably Invisible Network Flow Fingerprints|eprint=1711.10079|class=cs.NI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the greater the number of messages observed, or even intercepted and stored, the more can be inferred from the traffic. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of [[military intelligence]], [[counter-intelligence]], or [[pattern-of-life analysis]], and is a concern in [[computer security]].

Traffic analysis tasks may be supported by dedicated computer software programs. Advanced traffic analysis techniques may include various forms of [[social network analysis]].

== Breaking the anonymity of networks ==
Traffic analysis method can be used to break the anonymity of anonymous networks, e.g., [[Tor (anonymity network)|TORs]] &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[Tor (anonymity network)|.]] There are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. 

*In passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. 
*In active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it. It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In military intelligence ==
&lt;!--[[File:GenCOM EOB snapshot.GIF|frame|An example of an electronic [[order of battle]] (EOB) geo-spectral analysis, automatically produced by Genesis EW's GenCOM EOB. It shows the geo-locations of different emitters and the connections between them. This illustrates the practical use of COMINT metadata/Traffic Analysis. By intercepting, processing and analyzing electromagnetic emission only,  the locations of different army units and the connections between them can be seen, without the need to monitor, translate and process their communications.]] --&gt;
In a military context, traffic analysis is a  basic part of [[SIGINT|signals intelligence]], and can be a source of information about the intentions and actions of the target. Representative patterns include:

* Frequent communications – can denote planning
* Rapid, short communications – can denote negotiations
* A lack of communication – can indicate a lack of activity, or completion of a finalized plan
* Frequent communication to specific stations from a central station – can highlight the [[chain of command]]
* Who talks to whom – can indicate which stations are 'in charge' or the 'control station' of a particular network. This further implies something about the personnel associated with each station
* Who talks when – can indicate which stations are active in connection with events, which implies something about the information being passed and perhaps something about the personnel/access of those associated with some stations
* Who changes from station to station, or medium to medium – can indicate movement, fear of interception

There is a close relationship between traffic analysis and [[cryptanalysis]] (commonly called [[codebreaking]]). [[Callsign]]s and addresses are frequently [[encrypt]]ed, requiring assistance in identifying them. Traffic volume can often be a sign of an addressee's importance, giving hints to pending objectives or movements to cryptanalysts.

===Traffic flow security===
'''Traffic-flow security''' is the use of measures that conceal the presence and properties of valid messages on a network to prevent traffic analysis. This can be done by operational procedures or by the protection resulting from features inherent in some cryptographic equipment. Techniques used include:

* changing radio [[callsign]]s frequently
* encryption of a message's sending and receiving addresses ('''codress messages''')
* causing the circuit to appear busy at all times or much of the time by sending dummy [[traffic]]
* sending a continuous encrypted [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]], whether or not traffic is being transmitted. This is also called '''masking''' or  '''link encryption'''.

Traffic-flow security is one aspect of [[communications security]].

=== COMINT metadata analysis ===
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{Tone|section|date=November 2011}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}}}
The '''Communications' Metadata Intelligence''', or '''COMINT metadata''' is a term in [[communications intelligence]] (COMINT) referring to the concept of producing intelligence by analyzing only the technical metadata, hence, is a great practical example for traffic analysis in intelligence.

While traditionally information gathering in COMINT is derived from intercepting transmissions, tapping the target's communications and monitoring the content of conversations, the metadata intelligence is not based on content but on technical communicational data.

Non-content COMINT is usually used to deduce information about the user of a certain transmitter, such as locations, contacts, activity volume, routine and its exceptions.

==Examples==

For example, if a certain emitter is known as the radio transmitter of a certain unit, and by using [[direction finding]] (DF) tools, the position of the emitter is locatable; hence the changes of locations can be monitored. That way we're able to understand that this certain unit is moving from one point to another, without listening to any orders or reports. If we know that this unit reports back to a command on a certain pattern, and we know that another unit reports on the same pattern to the same command, then the two units are probably related, and that conclusion is based on the metadata of the two units' transmissions, and not on the content of their transmissions.

Using all, or as much of the metadata available is commonly used to build up an [[SIGINT#Electronic Order of Battle|Electronic Order of Battle]] (EOB) – mapping different entities in the battlefield and their connections. Of course the EOB could be built by tapping all the conversations and trying to understand which unit is where, but using the metadata with an automatic analysis tool enables a much faster and accurate EOB build-up that alongside tapping builds a much better and complete picture.

===World War I===
* British analysts in [[World War I]] noticed that the [[call sign]] of German Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], commanding the hostile fleet, had been transferred to a land station. [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]], ignorant of Scheer's practice of changing callsigns upon leaving harbor, dismissed its importance and disregarded [[Room 40]] analysts' attempts to make the point. The German fleet sortied, and the British were late in meeting them at the [[Battle of Jutland]].&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If traffic analysis had been taken more seriously, the British might have done better than a 'draw'.{{original research inline|date=August 2009}}
* French military intelligence, shaped by [[Kerckhoffs]]'s legacy, had erected a network of intercept stations at the Western front in pre-war times. When the Germans crossed the frontier, the French worked out crude means for direction-finding based on intercepted signal intensity. Recording of call-signs and volume of traffic further enabled them to identify German combat groups and to distinguish between fast-moving cavalry and slower infantry.&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt;

===World War II===
* In early [[World War II]], the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glorious}} was evacuating pilots and planes from [[Norway]]. Traffic analysis produced indications {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} were moving into the North Sea, but the Admiralty dismissed the report as unproven. The captain of ''Glorious'' did not keep sufficient lookout, and was subsequently surprised and sunk. [[Harry Hinsley]], the young [[Bletchley Park]] liaison to the Admiralty, later said his reports from the traffic analysts were taken much more seriously thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* During the planning and rehearsal for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], very little traffic passed by radio, subject to interception. The ships, units, and commands involved were all in Japan and in touch by phone, courier, signal lamp, or even flag. None of that traffic was intercepted, and could not be analyzed.&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt;
* The espionage effort against Pearl Harbor before December didn't send an unusual number of messages; Japanese vessels regularly called in Hawaii and messages were carried aboard by consular personnel. At least one such vessel carried some Japanese Navy Intelligence officers. Such messages cannot be analyzed. It has been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the volume of diplomatic traffic to and from certain [[Consular office|consular stations]] might have indicated places of interest to Japan, which might thus have suggested locations to concentrate traffic analysis and decryption efforts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* [[Nagumo Chuichi|Admiral Nagumo]]'s Pearl Harbor Attack Force sailed under radio silence, with its radios physically locked down. It is unclear if this deceived the U.S.; Pacific Fleet intelligence was unable to locate the Japanese carriers in the days immediately preceding the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] {{Harv | Kahn}}.
* The [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] played radio games to inhibit traffic analysis (see Examples, below) with the attack force after it sailed in late November.  Radio operators normally assigned to carriers, with a characteristic Morse Code "[[Telegraph key#Key's influence on sender's personal characteristics|fist]]", transmitted from inland Japanese waters, suggesting the carriers were still near Japan {{Harv | Kahn}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[Operation Quicksilver (WWII)|Operation Quicksilver]], part of the British deception plan for the [[Invasion of Normandy]] in [[World War II]], fed German intelligence a combination of true and  false information about troop deployments in Britain, causing the Germans to deduce an order of battle which suggested an invasion at the [[Pas-de-Calais]] instead of Normandy. The fictitious divisions created for this deception were supplied with real radio units, which maintained a flow of messages consistent with the deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masterman |first=John C |authorlink=John Cecil Masterman |title=The Double-Cross System in the War of 1939 to 1945 |publisher=Australian National University Press |isbn=978-0-7081-0459-0 |year=1972 |origyear=1945|page=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In computer security ==

Traffic analysis is also a concern in [[computer security]]. An attacker can gain important information by monitoring the frequency and timing of network packets. A timing attack on the [[Secure Shell|SSH]] protocol can use timing information to deduce information about [[password]]s since, during interactive session, SSH transmits each keystroke as a message.&lt;ref name="Song2001"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time between keystroke messages can be studied using [[hidden Markov model]]s. Song, ''et al.'' claim that it can recover the password fifty times faster than a [[brute force attack]].

[[Onion routing]] systems are used to gain anonymity.  Traffic analysis can be used to attack anonymous communication systems like the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]].  Adam Back, Ulf Möeller and Anton Stiglic present traffic analysis attacks against anonymity providing systems

research showing that traffic-analysis allows adversaries to infer which nodes relay the anonymous streams.  This reduces the anonymity provided by Tor. They have shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator.

[[Anonymous remailer|Remailer]] systems can also be attacked via traffic analysis. If a message is observed going to a remailing server, and an identical-length (if now anonymized) message is seen exiting the server soon after, a traffic analyst may be able to (automatically) connect the sender with the ultimate receiver. Variations of remailer operations exist that can make traffic analysis less effective.

== Countermeasures ==

It is difficult to defeat traffic analysis without both encrypting messages and masking the channel.  When no actual messages are being sent, the channel can be '''masked'''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is very hard to hide information about the size or timing of messages. The known solutions require [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] to send a continuous stream of messages at the maximum [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] she will ever use...This might be acceptable for military applications, but it is not for most civilian applications." The military-versus-civilian problems applies in situations where the user is charged for the volume of information sent.

Even for Internet access, where there is not a per-packet charge, [[ISPs]] make statistical assumption that connections from user sites will not be busy 100% of the time. The user cannot simply increase the bandwidth of the link, since masking would fill that as well. If masking, which often can be built into end-to-end encryptors, becomes common practice, ISPs will have to change their traffic assumptions.

The '''Washington Iron Works Skidder''' is a [[steam engine|steam-powered]] [[logging]] [[skidder]], or cable [[winch]]. It was imported to [[Australia]] in the 1920s and was initially used to move the large [[Jarrah]] logs from the forests of [[Western Australia]]. It was later sold to the [[Forests Commission of Victoria]] for salvaging timber after the 1939 [[Black Friday (1939)|Black Friday]] fires.

The winch is located at [[Swifts Creek, Victoria]], and is a unique part of Victoria's cultural heritage and logging history; left intact with engine, spars and cabling still rigged for work it is the only steam-powered engine of its kind in Australia. It is listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite VHD|5573|Washington Winch|hr=1825|ho=293|accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and managed by the [[Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP)]].

==Washington Iron Works==
Washington Iron Works was a company in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], founded by [[John M. Frink]], that built these steam skidders. The company was active from 1882 until the 1980s when its various divisions – manufacturing cranes, logging equipment, and presses – were gradually sold off. The Works closed in 1986.

Washington Iron Works engines revolutionized steam logging in the 1920s and 1930s. The steam-powered winches were mounted on heavy log skid frames which allowed the winch to be transported to new sites. Many Washington skidders can still be seen in North America.

==Operation==
The Washington Winch operated either a ''high lead'' or a ''skyline'' system. The high lead system was not often used as it only partially lifted the logs off the ground, which caused the logs to become caught in rocks, and left behind a "snig track", which deepened over time. The skyline system involved two large spars (trees) used to create a "flying fox" to lift logs over the rough ground. Riggers climbed 60m up a large tree and headed the trunk, which would cause the tree to sway violently. They then secured the spar with guy cables and attached the tackle. This operation was dangerous and physically demanding, often taking a full day, with lunch sent up on a rope. The Washington Winch was used to harvest [[Alpine Ash]] which would then be used for high-value products such as furniture, flooring and architraves.
